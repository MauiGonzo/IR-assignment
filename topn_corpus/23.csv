INTERFAX learned from sources in the government that this  appointment was due to the increasing role of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations in coordination of foreign economic  activities of the federation's constituent members and to  strengthening control over the export-import operations.  Earlier, Dagayev had headed the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations Department of Export-Import Operations for State Needs  and had been responsible for registration of special exporters.  He will continue to perform these functions in his new post.    Dagayev said in an interview with INTERFAX that state  control  over export activities of the regions would be more important  since the president had issued the decree cancelling quotas and  licensing of export deliveries.

The remarks were made by the State Department spokesman,  Michael McCurry, in a statement released on Monday [16 May].    He said, ""It is long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part  of China. Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as  a sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan  government- in-exile.""    In a bid to clarify some provisions contained in the  ""Foreign  Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995"" adopted  by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in  late April, McCurry also made it clear that ""as both a practical  and legal matter, it would not be possible for the U.S. to  establish offices or conduct programs (in Tibet) without the  permission of the Chinese Government.""    The spokesman continued that the United States will continue  to follow a ""one-China"" policy. ""The language in the act  referring to official visits, including cabinet-level exchanges  with Taiwan are 'sense of the Congress' and not binding,"" he  said in the statement.    His statement also described the wording of the  authorization  act that the Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over the 1982  communique as ""equivalent to a `sense of the Congress' and not  binding.""    ""We continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982  communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as  one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship.  Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will  interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment,"" he said.    The United States remains, he stated, ""fully committed to  the  three joint communiques between the PRC and the U.S. as the  framework of our China policy. Nothing in the Foreign Relations  Authorization Act changes this.""

When examining and approving the establishment of  foreign-funded enterprises and compensatory trade projects,  matters relating to the licenses for importing raw materials and  spare parts and for exporting products, including the increase  or decrease in the number of the originally approved licenses  due to the expansion of operational domains by enterprises and  goods requiring one-time export licenses should be reported in  the form of official documents by the economic and trade bureaus  of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and  cities listed separately for development to the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], which will  examine them and give official replies in the form of ministry  documents.    2. Within the number of licenses permitted by the official  replies from MOFERT, if the products produced by the enterprises  themselves meet the stipulations of the replies, the  license-issuing departments should issue licenses according to  the reply documents. No license should be issued to an  enterprise which does not have the MOFERT document or a letter  permitting a license. Various license-issuing units should  observe strict examination and inspection.    3. It is hereby reiterated that foreign-funded enterprises  are not permitted to purchase products for export without  authorization, and, if such a situation is discovered, it will  be handled as an illegal operation. If an enterprise needs to  purchase products for export in order to strike a balance  between foreign exchange income and expenditures, it should go  through the reporting and approval formalities according to the  relevant regulations of the country.

In the morning  the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations board discussed a  concept for a federal program of industrial export supports, and  in the afternoon the government's commission on operational  issues met and decided to change the mechanism by which export  quotas are assigned.    This is not the first time that the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations has tried to use state incentives to improve  the export structure. The board meeting focused on the  objectives of a federal program to support machinery and  equipment exports.    On 31 March 1993 the government approved the ""State Program  for Support of Machinery and Equipment Exports,"" which was  developed by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. The  first version of the federal program, which differs from the  state program in its specific request for allocation of budget  funding, was presented to the government in October. However,  the government took no action at that time. In December the  draft federal program was sent back to the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations for additional editing.    The core ideas of the revised federal program are these:  establishment of a precedent for budget funding of finished  goods exports through creation of a lending, insurance and  transportation infrastructure for industrial exports (including  through the use of favorable tariffs). Specifically, these  things are supposed to be embodied in the Russian Export-Import  Bank, a controlling block of shares in which will belong to the  state. On two occasions already, in July 1993 and January 1994,  the government has passed a resolution establishing such a bank,  yet at this time it exists only on paper. Suffice it to say that  bank president Viktor Shilin, who was confirmed by the founders'  meeting, is still working as deputy minister for foreign  economic relations, i.e. despite the extensive history of this  issue exporters of finished goods are still forced to solve  their problems on their own.    The sad story of support for industrial exports brings to  mind the thought that in the future Russia will be represented  in the world market solely as a raw materials exporter. In view  of that, the changes in the raw materials export mechanism  announced at yesterday's commission session by Oleg Soskovets,  are of primary importance. The commission granted non-ferrous  metals and diesel fuel export quotas to the State Investment  Corporation, which is headed by Yuriy Petrov. Hard currency  revenues will go to a society for disabled Afghanistan war  veterans.    In this way the case-by-case assignment of export quotas  will  be replaced by specific funding of their previous recipients'  programs. Special-purpose export quotas will now go only to  special exporters, who may in turn, in accordance with a  decision by Soskovets' commission, transfer the hard currency  received through sale of their export quotas (minus a  commission) to non-commercial structures designated by the  government. Thereby the government eliminates another means of  exporting strategic raw materials that has easily evaded state  supervision: use of public organizations that possess special  foreign economic privileges and tax breaks.    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations lobbied for this  innovation, but the ministry has not yet succeeded in reserving  the sale of special-purpose quotas for organizations under its  jurisdiction. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  proposes that the new mechanism be extended to the assignment of  special-purpose quotas and regional quotas, particularly since  at the present time local governments are refusing them in favor  of their own enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations has also drawn up proposals regarding a change in the  mechanism for export shipments in connection with the state's  needs, as supported by the government commission on operational  matters. Specifically, it has been proposed that as of 1 January  1995 state exports be restricted solely to fulfillment of  intergovernmental agreements and protocols. At the same time  export controls should be tightened, with these to be carried  out in part by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations. The  number of government special export agents would be limited to a  single organization for each product category.    Changes in Export Regulation    Immediate Changes    Special-purpose export quotas will be assigned only to  special exporters for the purpose of funding the programs of  public non-commercial organizations designated by the government.    Long-Range Changes    As of 1 January 1995 state exports will be restricted to  fulfillment of obligations under intergovernmental agreements  and protocols.     "

In light of the fact that such  projects do not fall under the domain in which the state  encourages foreign investment, the wide area covered by the  projects, and their complicated nature and in order to properly  guide the flow of foreign capital so that it can help national  economic development, such projects must be subject to strict  scrutiny before approval can be granted, and management must be  strengthened. Henceforth, it will not be suitable to grant any  more approvals for the establishment of joint-venture and  cooperative projects that involve the simple dismantling of  metals and determine which are useful for reexport or for the  establishment of foreign-funded enterprises (solely owned  enterprises) that engage in the processing of waste metals.  Various economic and trade commissions (offices and bureaus)  should maintain strict standards in the examination and approval  work.

Relations between the two states are good, and  Germany is Poland's most important trade partner. Nevertheless,  the opportunities offered by proximity have so far not been  fully exploited, Pawlak said in an interview with DDP/ADN in  Warsaw before his visit to Germany, which is due to begin on  Thursday. ""What is needed is stronger commitment in the search  for partnership and balance,"" the prime minister said.    This applies above all because ""certain disproportions""  became apparent last year. For instance, Polish imports from  Germany developed more dynamically than exports to Germany.  Therefore, both sides should strive for equilibrium in the  balance of trade. In Pawlak's view, for example, the export of  Polish construction services could be again raised to the level  reached years ago.    In the talks in Bonn, the Polish prime minister wants to  concentrate on the practical side of cooperation. The priority  is ""the creation of mechanisms and infrastructures that promote  exchange between companies and relations between people,"" Pawlak  said. Governments have many opportunities to facilitate this  process. The prime minister included in these the creation of a  financial and transport infrastructure such as new  border-crossing points, the development of cultural cooperation,  youth exchanges, and tourism. Pawlak said he wants to talk  about these issues in Germany.    He pointed out that Poland is very attentively watching  Germany's stand on Poland's efforts to seek rapprochement with  the EU [European Union] and with NATO. ""I think our interests  coincide in this area,"" the prime minister stressed.     "

In a meeting with  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, Mondale said he strongly hopes a  planned meeting between U.S. and Japanese trade officials in  Washington on Thursday will successfully find ways to resume the  stalled economic framework talks, the official told reporters.    The meeting, involving senior officials from Japan's  Ministry  of International Trade and Industry and the Foreign Ministry and  their U.S. counterparts, marks the first attempt by the new  government in Tokyo to resolve differences with Washington over  the stalled trade talks. The U.S. envoy also reportedly spoke of  the need for both sides to try to flexibly meet each other  halfway in a bid to restart the negotiations on establishing a  new framework for bilateral trade.    Noting that healthy economic relations between the two  economic superpowers is crucial, Hata also expressed hope for  early resumption of the framework talks, the official said.    The bilateral negotiations on ways to widen foreign access  to  the Japanese market were suspended after the two countries  clashed at the February meeting of U.S. President Bill Clinton  and then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Washington.    At the summit, Hosokawa rejected U.S. proposals for  ""objective criteria"" or numerical targets to measure the  progress of Japanese imports.    Mondale and Hata also agreed on the need for cooperation  between the U.S. and Japan to encourage North Korea to remove  concerns about the communist country's suspected nuclear weapons  development program, the official said.

The final drafting  work was completed yesterday and it was forwarded to the  president and State Duma deputies for their attention.  Vyacheslav Kostikov said the criticisms and proposals of all  factions, including the Communists and the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia], had been heeded in the treaty. The  press secretary said that although President Yeltsin believes  that the treaty will succeed, he also realizes that not  everybody will support the document.    Vyacheslav Kostikov dwelled on the situation in the Black  Sea  Fleet. In his words, the Russian president is relying on Leonid  Kravchuk's common sense.    Relations with the United States were also touched on at the  briefing. During his telephone conversation with Bill Clinton  last night, Russian President Boris Yeltsin confirmed that  Russia's policies towards the United States remained unchanged.  President Yeltsin noted that our states were striving for  democracy. In the process Russia was mindful of both sides'  interests. Kostikov quoted Boris Nikolayevich as saying that  nobody would succeed in driving a wedge between himself and Bill  Clinton and rejected claims that a crack had appeared in the  Russo-U.S. relationship because of the Bosnian crisis.    Referring to Russia's attitude towards the Balkan situation,  the press secretary said that the president regards our  country's position as being unchanged. Russia has always  objected to air strikes in Bosnia and we are continuing our  attempts to persuade Serbia to cease fire and hold consultations  with all interested parties.     "

According to preliminary statistics provided by a relevant  department, there are 515 within-plan enterprises at fixed  locations throughout the country specializing in retreading  tires, and they can retread 5.74 million tires every year. They  produced approximately 2.1 million retreads in 1986, only  utilizing 37 percent of the capacity. The country can currently  produce 17.62 million sets of new tires every year, while the  actual need is only 15 million sets, so supply is greater than  demand.    In light of the above-mentioned situation, we are asking the  various departments to please observe strict rules. Except for  the enterprises that export all the retreads, from now on,  generally approval should not be granted to the establishment of  Sino-foreign joint-venture enterprises and cooperative projects  engaging in tire retreading, and jointly run enterprises that  current exist should not be granted approval to expand their  scales of operation and capacity.

The survey, covering 140 mid-sized and large companies, which are members of the society, is due to be published tomorrow. It shows that active investor relations is a relatively new practice for British companies. A little less than half the companies surveyed say they have been actively involved in the field for less than five years. Though interest in investor relations has been rising, the bulk of non-staff spending goes on traditional activities. Some 37 per cent of companies' investor relations budgets go on annual, interim or quarterly reports; 12 per cent on meetings with stockbrokers; 9 per cent on annual meetings, and 8 per cent on investor relations consultants. Overall, 85 per cent of the budget is spent reaching UK investors, though the very largest companies spend a quarter of their investor relations budgets overseas. Some 54 per cent have budgets of less than Pounds 250,000 a year and two thirds of the investor relations executives questioned have other responsibilities, such as finance, a company secretary's duties, or corporate communications.

During a news conference, the ambassador said the decision  to  join Mercosur is the exclusive decision of the Chilean  Government, adding that if it wishes to do so, the Chilean  Government can study this possibility without any haste.    Iglesias voiced satisfaction because he has found, as he put  it, a new predisposition in the Chilean authorities regarding  Mercosur, especially in Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat and  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, and in Juan Salazar, the  director of the International Economic Relations Department of  the Foreign Ministry.    The ambassador said this after confirming that Argentine  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will make an official visit to  Santiago on 10 and 11 May, with the main objective of beginning  ""a new style of relations"" with Chilean economic officials,  which he referred to as ""Dialogues of the Southern Cone.""    During his visit, Cavallo will meet with President Eduardo  Frei Ruiz Tagle. He will also deliver a lecture on the  Argentine economic process and will hold working meetings with  his Chilean counterpart Eduardo Aninat. Cavallo will also visit  ""Expomin '94"" -- Latin America's main mining fair -- which will  be held in Santiago next week.    Iglesias emphasized that Cavallo and Aninat have known each  other professionally for 20 years, since the time they studied  at the U.S. University of Harvard. He said he believes this  will strengthen bilateral relations, ""which are already  extraordinary.""    The ambassador added that at an economic level,  Chilean-Argentine integration has had ""fantastic"" achievements,  while bilateral exchange grew five-fold in four years, to $1.2  billion in 1993. He noted that during the first quarter of  1994, bilateral exchange grew by 15 percent with respect to the  same period in 1993, adding that he expects it to reach  $1.4-billion in 1994.     "

Insulza stated that in the multilateral field the two  countries share very similar viewpoints regarding the problem in  Haiti, the hemispheric summit in Miami called by U.S. President  Bill Clinton, and the upcoming OAS meeting.    Regarding the Haitian crisis, the Chilean Foreign Ministry  stated that it recognizes the constitutional Haitian Government  headed by President Jean Bertrand Aristides and recognizes as  its representative the current charge d'affaires in Santiago,  Guy Pierre Andre, who this week publicly repudiated the new de  facto government installed by the coupist military.    In the bilateral field, Insulza said important progress was  made in this area during his visit to Buenos Aires and that the  Argentine Government has voiced its interest in Chile's  expressed desire to seek a commercial agreement with the Common  Market of the South (Mercosur).    The Chilean under secretary, who did not rule out the  possibility that Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa will  make a proposal in this regard during his visit to Buenos Aires  on 8 June, said: ""The Argentine representatives expressed full  support for the Chilean desire and we hope to reach an agreement  in the next few days.""    Moreover, Jose Miguel Insulza announced that in view of the  next meeting Presidents Carlos Menem and Eduardo Frei will hold  in Santiago in August, it has been agreed to establish a joint  committee that will be in charge of assessing the legal and  bureaucratic obstacles that still hinder the fulfillment of  previous agreements, especially in the commercial field.    Insulza added that the presidents believe the agreements  already signed by the two countries are enough for an important  and deep-rooted binational integration process and that the  problem boils down to bureaucratic and legal obstacles in the  two countries that prevent them from working in a more efficient  manner.

This was reported by attorney Juan Salazar, the  International  Economic Relations director, who gave a broad description of the  Foreign Ministry International Economic Relations Directorate's  guidelines.    Salazar reported a substantial increase in the sale of  Chilean services abroad, specially transportation and software  sales, among other lines.    As an example, he mentioned that last year our country  exported services worth $3.2 billion, which represents 40  percent of our country's exports.    Salazar believes this Chilean impetus toward the world  requires that entrepreneurs and the private sector conform to  the new international requirements. He said it is necessary for  executives to be more aggressive and penetrate new markets in  other parts of the world like Asia, specially China and  Malaysia. He said:    [Begin Salazar recording] We have tried to tell them about  this new emphasis. For example, we have strongly mentioned  Asia. There are new programs that [former International  Economic Relations director] Jaime [Lavados Germain] already  mentioned like market (?intelligence) and our country's image.  There are negotiations that we will have to conduct.    We also talked about NAFTA. We talked about countries  outside our region, outside Latin America. We talked about  services, which is a very important area. Instead of using a  meaningless phrase, let's say that this is our second phase.  [end recording]    To implement these programs, for example, PROCHILE  [Institute  for Export Promotion] currently has 35 offices which it plans to  increase to 200 across our country. Juan Salazar said a new  entrepreneurial attitude is required. He said:    [Begin Salazar recording] There is a discrete deterioration  of the Chilean export process. Some people want to blame this  problem on the exchange rate, for example. As international  trade increases, I believe Chile will be facing increasing  competition. We have to refine both the state instruments and  the private sector actions in order to face this competition.  [end recording]    He said it would even be desirable if PROCHILE were  privatized.     "

Zaldivar, whose comments were released  today, said he was really impressed with the dramatic situation  affecting the Cuban people, who ""are starving because rationing  is brutally strict.""    Zaldicar, who belongs to the most important party in the  coalition governing Chile, said cooperation must be sought to  find a political solution that would allow Cuba to evolve toward  democracy.    According to Zaldivar, the way to reach a political opening  must be discussed with Cuban President Fidel Castro. He said:  ""Fidel Castro is maintaining his leadership. I saw that. The  people are with Fidel Castro. And we should take note of that.""    Zaldivar has the impression that Cuba is a besieged region  in  the medieval sense, which even creates the fear that the crisis  may evolve into a collective sacrifice, which he believes would  be inadmissible. He added: ""We should follow a path toward  opening up relations, not with the objective of validating a  regime with which I disagree, but in order to help Cuba in a  transition toward democracy.""    During his stay in Havana, Zaldivar met with the Cuban  ministers of finance and agriculture, but he did not have any  contact with the opposition. Christian Democratic Party  President Gutemberg Martinez, however, will meet with all Cuban  political sectors during the visit he will make to Cuba in the  next few days.    Zaldivar went to Cuba as president of the Spanish foundation  Ibero-American-European Research and Promotion Center, which he  created when he was living in exile in Madrid.    Diplomatic relations between Havana and Santiago were broken  in 1973 after the military coup that overthrew the Chilean  Socialist government headed by Salvador Allende. Relations were  resumed at the consular level in 1990 after the return of  democracy in Chile. Various Chilean Socialist and Social  Democratic sectors of the government Coalition of Parties for  Democracy have expressed support for the full reestablishment of  relations with Cuba, which is expected to be achieved in the  next few weeks.

0,FT943-4583 ,"FT943-4583 _AN-EIHDIACNFT 940908   FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The personal chemistry test - How to choose the right PR consultant      By MOTOKO RICH   Selecting a public relations consultancy may seem a daunting task requiring a great deal of time, long lists of criteria and scores of interviews with potential agencies. But, in many ways, the process boils down to personalities. 'The most important thing is to look for personal chemistry,' says Stephen Whitehead, head of PR for the UK operations of Glaxo, the pharmaceuticals company. Finding the perfect PR is not as simple as spotting a stranger across a crowded room. 'It is not the same as meeting someone at a party and having a nice chat with them,' says Whitehead. 'You want someone who will stand up to you. We do not want someone who is going to say 'yes' all the time, because we believe that out of disagreement comes creativity.' Most companies and PR consultancies agree, however, that a few standard steps must be taken. The first is to develop a concise, but comprehensive, written brief that expresses clearly why the company wants PR. According to Meg Holmes, general manager of the PR Register, which steers clients through the selection process, the brief should set out requirements in a number of areas, including customer relations, corporate affairs, crisis and issues management, internal communications, parliamentary lobbying and links with charities. The next step is to select a range of agencies. Information about consultancies is available in directories such as the Hollis UK Press and Public Relations Annual, which lists 1,200 agencies, separated into specialist categories. Organisations such as the PR Register, the Public Relations Consultants Association, the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and the Institute of Public Relations will also advise companies on appropriate agencies. 'The temptation is to go for too long a list of agencies,' says John Brown, deputy chief executive at Burson Marsteller, a leading agency. 'But it wastes your time as a client and the agency's time in preparing presentations.' He recommends a short list of no more than six consultancies. Brown says companies should whittle down their choices by setting exact criteria for what they want the PR to accomplish. 'By saying we need A, B, C and D you can probably get down to five or six agencies that could possibly meet these needs,' he says. Each consultancy on the list should see the brief, and then prepare a 'credentials' or 'chemistry' presentation. 'After these meetings we guarantee that one or two will drop off the list,' says Holmes. The final two or three agencies should be invited to give a full creative presentation, which usually lasts about an hour. Companies should insist that those who will work on their business give the pitch. 'Some agencies tend to have luminaries to do the presentation and then the secretaries do the work on the account,' warns Steve Gebbett, director and head of marketing at Charles Barker, a London-based agency. The ultimate decision should be based on the programme and how it conforms to the company's brief, awareness of the company's market and competitors, political sensitivity, creativity - and, of course, the all-important personal chemistry. Finally, 'do not think the world will change just because you have appointed a PR company', says Kenneth Miles, director general of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers. 'But do expect something to happen and have an idea how to evaluate it.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P8743 Public Relations Services.

With respect to the decision by eight Cubans to forcibly  remain inside the Chilean Consulate in Havana, the minister  stated that the important issue is to observe international law.

The Family Relations Department sees only 10% of divorcing families. The other  90% either have no children or resolve custody and visitation issues  themselves. Of the 10%, approximately 85% of these families are able to resolve  the issues with the help of their mediator. An additional 10% are referred to  private psychologists of the parents' choosing for evaluation and written  report to the court. Five percent are referred for investigation by the judge,  usually by agreement of the parents. Our department has 3 1/2 investigators,  most of whom have worked in this capacity for 10 to 16 years.    Only 1% of these cases goes to hearing. These represent those families who have  not been able to resolve their differences, even with the help of skilled  attorneys, informal conferences with judges, clinical intervention by mediators  (all licensed mental health professionals), custody investigators and/or  private psychological evaluators.

In some contested hearings, mediators in Ventura County provide expert  testimony to the court, but only with the protections of due process (upon  receiving a subpoena and subject to examination in open court by the litigants  or their legal representatives). While some counties disallow litigants from  calling mediators to testify, other counties do not provide the protections of  due process. Instead, mediators speak with or write memoranda to the court  without the requirements of subpoena or cross-examination.    In order for Ventura mediators to make informal recommendations to the court,  the parties (usually through their attorneys) must both waive this right solely  for the purposes of a conference and may speak with the judge only in the  attorneys' or parents' presence. It is relatively rare that mediators make  statements to a judge under any circumstances. Our goal is to promote  self-determination in divorcing families, to empower parents at a time when  they are on the verge of losing control over their children's lives.    Children usually thrive when two parents are able to put their hurt aside and  reassure the children of their ongoing love. We know through our expression and  through carefully conducted research that children respond to unrestrained  parental conflict in extremely negative ways, both immediately and in the  long-run. We aid families every day in resolving their conflicts so that their  children can grow emotionally, physically, intellectually and spiritually.

The clash involves the burgeoning number of worker protection initiatives being  launched by state and local governments and state prosecutors -- such as  statutes requiring companies to give workers advance notice of plant closings  -- and the attempts of business, sometimes aided by the federal government, to  halt those efforts by asserting that they are preempted by some federal law.    ""In virtually any kind of lawsuit that is filed on employment issues today  there is some kind of preemption defense that can be raised,"" said Glenn  Rothner, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents a number of unions.      Major Case    Rothner is involved in a major preemption case in which Southern California  Edison has asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempts an  employee's right to assert in state court that the company's drug-testing  program violates the California Constitution's right-to-privacy provision.    Cynthia Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who represents corporations in labor  matters, agreed that preemption cases have become increasingly important in  recent years and are now at the cutting edge of employment-related litigation.    The legal battles, ranging from a Los Angeles taxi franchise case to a Maine  severance pay provision, are the outgrowth of some profound shifts in American  life, particularly the diminished power of unions and the increased propensity  of many state governments to regulate certain aspects of workplace life.    The potential impact of many of these cases can be seen by the volume of  friend-of-the-court briefs filed in them. Last year, 17 states, the AFL-CIO and  other groups wrote briefs in support of Illinois in a case where a division of  Magic Chef Inc. asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempted an  Illinois law that prohibits employers from firing workers simply because they  have filed workers' compensation claims.    The case being heard by the Supreme Court today involves a Boston banker,  Richard Morash, who is challenging the constitutionality of a 1985 state law  requiring any employer who discharges a worker in Massachusetts to pay all  unpaid wages, including accrued vacation pay, to the employee on the day of the  discharge.    Morash contends that this rule should be overturned under the Constitution's  supremacy clause because it conflicts with, and is preempted by, federal law, a  contention Massachusetts vigorously disputes.    The Morash case will not be the last word on preemption law, according to legal  scholars. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the Massachusetts law, it could  create a more favorable atmosphere for states to enact similar regulations,  said Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.    In recent years, preemption issues have also been raised in many other cases in  state and federal courts, including a number that ultimately reached the  Supreme Court. The results of the cases have been mixed, but enough of them  have been resolved in favor of pro-worker state regulations that union lawyers  and strategists believe that new avenues have been opened to them.      'Tremendous Inroads'    ""States have been making tremendous inroads in employment law,"" said Jackson,  the San Francisco attorney.    The reason for all the activity at the state level is a recognition of the fact  that the vast majority of American workers are unorganized and in need of more  legal protection, according to Summers, who has been studying the trend.    He emphasized that workplace governance in the United States has not developed  in the manner anticipated when the National Labor Relations Act, authored by  Sen. Robert Wagner of New York, was enacted in 1935. The law gave formal  protections to people participating in union organizing campaigns and put the  government's stamp of approval on collective bargaining.    ""When we passed the Wagner Act . . . we created an image that we were going to  regulate the labor market in this country through collective bargaining"" rather  than controlling it through a series of laws governing separate issues  affecting workers, Summers said.    About 20 years ago, ""it began to dawn on people that this had not come to  pass,"" Summers said. ""We had not achieved a (broad) system of collective  bargaining; it was only a fraction of the labor market. As that awareness  dawned, people began to ask themselves, 'What are we going to do about all the  people who are not protected by collective bargaining that need to have  protection from some other source?' ""      Management Unhappy    Initially, he said, the federal government began to fill some of those gaps  through passage of laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the  Employees Retirement and Income Security Act, the federal statute at issue in  the Morash case. Then state and local governments began to get in on the act  and management was unhappy.    Companies, particularly national companies, are deeply concerned with having to  comply with a welter of disparate regulations on the same subject, so they file  preemption challenges, said R. Theodore Clark, a senior partner at  Chicago-based Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson, the nation's largest  labor law firm on management's side.    UC Berkeley labor law professor David Feller said the preemption conflict  reflects the ironic convergence of two seemingly contradictory trends that have  emerged in recent years.    ""There is now a much larger constituency to provide legislation to protect  individual workers,"" while there is a smaller constituency to strengthen the  National Labor Relations Act, which offers workers collective protections,  Feller said.    ""This is the result of the decline of collective bargaining and the decline of  unionism,"" said Feller, who once served as general counsel to the United  Steelworkers of America.    Former President Ronald Reagan's appointment of conservatives to the federal  bench and the National Labor Relations Board also prompted organized labor to  look for relief in other venues, such as state courts and state legislatures,  said Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer who writes a number of  appellate court briefs for the AFL-CIO. ""People are looking for alternatives to  the NLRB,"" she said.    This represents a marked change from the past, said Washington labor lawyer  Michael Gottesman. Historically, organized labor viewed state courts as  oppressive tribunals that issued picketing injunctions at the drop of a hat and  state legislatures as enemy territory where conservative officeholders  attempted to pass laws restricting organizer activity.      Federal Laws    For years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the labor  movement looked to federal laws as protections that were uniform throughout the  country. In the past, it was predominantly unions that raised preemption  challenges, trying to knock out state laws or administrative decisions it  considered unfair.    Then came Reagan. The increasingly difficult climate for labor in Washington  and at the bargaining table has prompted a fundamental re-examination of how  labor can best achieve its goals, including the use of state courts, challenges  to the all-encompassing primacy of federal labor laws and a willingness to  support cases filed by individual employees seeking the establishment of  minimum labor standards in certain areas.    ""These are tactical choices,"" Gottesman said. ""In an ideal world, the country  would be better with unified labor law,"" but he quickly added that the world is  far from ideal and that the labor movement has to adapt to changed  circumstances.    ""I think it's unrealistic to think (non-unionized) employees will sit idly by,""  waiting to get collective bargaining to give them greater protection. The  movement to give these workers greater protections ""will not go away,""  Gottesman said. ""The labor movement's intelligentsia has been philosophically  reluctant to openly advocate that, as a legal proposition, states have open  season. But the pressures are irresistible.""    And such pressures create complications for labor, said David Silberman, the  AFL-CIO's associate general counsel. ""On the one hand, the notion that a state  could enact a cap on wages or could fix wages certainly takes a lot away from  the collective bargaining process,"" Silberman said. ""On the other hand, there  are all kinds of minimum labor standards that look desirable to us.""    Indeed, organized labor has supported raising the minimum wage beyond the $3.35  an hour the federal government set it at in 1981. There is no preemption issue  on minimum wages and 11 states, including California, have a minimum above the  $3.35 level.    But while no one is raising the preemption issue regarding state minimum wage  laws, many other state laws offering greater worker protection are being  challenged on that basis.      Toxic Chemicals    One of the most heavily litigated issues are state laws directing employers to  give workers and communities information about the toxic chemicals they are  using. Although President Reagan espoused ""states rights,"" his aides supported  legal challenges by business groups to state ""right-to-know"" laws compelling  disclosure of information about toxic chemicals that were stronger than those  enacted subsequently by the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, an agency whose political tilt shifted sharply after Reagan  became President.    A protracted court battle on the state disclosure laws has been something of a  draw. In three separate cases in 1985 and 1986, a federal appeals court in  Philadelphia ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act  preempted state ""right-to-know"" laws as they applied to employees. However, the  court upheld the state laws as they apply to workplaces not covered by the  federal OSHA standard or if the laws are designed to protect the public or the  environment.    In several of the major cases, though, workers, unions and the states have  emerged victorious. For example:    Last June, the court unanimously upheld the Illinois statute on workers'  compensation-related firings in the case of Jonna Lingle vs. Norge Division of  Magic Chef Inc. This was considered a particularly important precedent because  the fired worker, Lingle, was a union member whose contract had a provision  saying that employees could only be discharged for ""just cause.""    The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the company's assertion that Lingle  should be barred from filing a state court damages suit in which she could be  awarded monetary damages because there was a remedy available to her in the  collective bargaining agreement. The company contended that since an  interpretation of the agreement was required, the matter came under the  National Labor Relations Act and was therefore preempted.    But Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion for the entire court said there was no  need to interpret the collective bargaining agreement because the facts showed  that the company had fired Lingle in clear violation of the Illinois law.    In June, 1987, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Maine law  requiring employers to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not  covered by an express contract providing for severance pay. The court held that  Maine's law was not preempted by federal law. Maine's ""establishment of a  minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective  bargaining process,"" the majority opinion stated.    But the states and their labor allies certainly have not won all the recent  preemption cases. For example:    In February, 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that a  Wisconsin statute was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. That law  prohibited a state agency from awarding a contract to a company that had  frequently violated the National Labor Relations Act.    In April, 1986, in an 8-1 opinion, the high court ruled that the city of Los  Angeles' denial of a taxi franchise to a company until it settled a strike  ""destroyed the balance of power designed by Congress"" in the National Labor  Relations Act ""and frustrated Congress' decision to leave open the use of  economic weapons.""    To be sure, there are still situations in which union lawyers argue in favor of  preemption.    But most of the time now, they are arguing against preemption and in favor of  greater state authority in the workplace. Just a few weeks ago, they were  pleased by a highly awaited decision by the Illinois Supreme Court. In a  unanimous opinion, the Illinois court ruled that the federal Occupational  Safety and Health Act does not preempt local prosecutors from bringing their  own criminal cases against employers who knowingly endanger workers on the job.    ""It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended OSHA's penalties  would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or  results in serious physical injury or death to workers,"" the court wrote.    State criminal prosecutions of safety and health violations are considered  important because in 18 years, the federal government has filed only 14  criminal cases against OSHA violators. Although the decision is not binding on  any state other than Illinois, and is likely to be appealed, it is the  highest-level ruling on the issue to date and is considered likely to spur more  criminal prosecutions of workplace safety violations. Local prosecutors from  Boston, New York and Los Angeles, who have filed similar cases, wrote amicus  briefs on behalf of Cook County prosecutors who had charged five executives of  Chicago Magnet Wire Co. with aggravated battery and reckless conduct because of  safety conditions at the company's Elk Grove, Ill., plant.    Jan Chatten Brown, head of the occupational safety unit in the Los Angeles  County district attorney's office, praised the decision, saying that states and  localities had ""a deeply rooted interest"" in protecting worker safety that  should not be usurped.

The clash involves the burgeoning number of worker protection initiatives being  launched by state and local governments and state prosecutors -- such as  statutes requiring companies to give workers advance notice of plant closings  -- and the attempts of business, sometimes aided by the federal government, to  halt those efforts by asserting that they are preempted by some federal law.    ""In virtually any kind of lawsuit that is filed on employment issues today  there is some kind of preemption defense that can be raised,"" said Glenn  Rothner, a Los Angeles lawyer who represents a number of unions.      Major Case    Rothner is involved in a major preemption case in which Southern California  Edison has asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempts an  employee's right to assert in state court that the company's drug-testing  program violates the California Constitution's right-to-privacy provision.    Cynthia Jackson, a San Francisco lawyer who represents corporations in labor  matters, agreed that preemption cases have become increasingly important in  recent years and are now at the cutting edge of employment-related litigation.    The legal battles, ranging from a Los Angeles taxi franchise case to a Maine  severance pay provision, are the outgrowth of some profound shifts in American  life, particularly the diminished power of unions and the increased propensity  of many state governments to regulate certain aspects of workplace life.    The potential impact of many of these cases can be seen by the volume of  friend-of-the-court briefs filed in them. Last year, 17 states, the AFL-CIO and  other groups wrote briefs in support of Illinois in a case where a division of  Magic Chef Inc. asserted that the National Labor Relations Act preempted an  Illinois law that prohibits employers from firing workers simply because they  have filed workers' compensation claims.    The case being heard by the Supreme Court today involves a Boston banker,  Richard Morash, who is challenging the constitutionality of a 1985 state law  requiring any employer who discharges a worker in Massachusetts to pay all  unpaid wages, including accrued vacation pay, to the employee on the day of the  discharge.    Morash contends that this rule should be overturned under the Constitution's  supremacy clause because it conflicts with, and is preempted by, federal law, a  contention Massachusetts vigorously disputes.    The Morash case will not be the last word on preemption law, according to legal  scholars. However, if the Supreme Court upholds the Massachusetts law, it could  create a more favorable atmosphere for states to enact similar regulations,  said Clyde Summers, a University of Pennsylvania law professor.    In recent years, preemption issues have also been raised in many other cases in  state and federal courts, including a number that ultimately reached the  Supreme Court. The results of the cases have been mixed, but enough of them  have been resolved in favor of pro-worker state regulations that union lawyers  and strategists believe that new avenues have been opened to them.      'Tremendous Inroads'    ""States have been making tremendous inroads in employment law,"" said Jackson,  the San Francisco attorney.    The reason for all the activity at the state level is a recognition of the fact  that the vast majority of American workers are unorganized and in need of more  legal protection, according to Summers, who has been studying the trend.    He emphasized that workplace governance in the United States has not developed  in the manner anticipated when the National Labor Relations Act, authored by  Sen. Robert Wagner of New York, was enacted in 1935. The law gave formal  protections to people participating in union organizing campaigns and put the  government's stamp of approval on collective bargaining.    ""When we passed the Wagner Act . . . we created an image that we were going to  regulate the labor market in this country through collective bargaining"" rather  than controlling it through a series of laws governing separate issues  affecting workers, Summers said.    About 20 years ago, ""it began to dawn on people that this had not come to  pass,"" Summers said. ""We had not achieved a (broad) system of collective  bargaining; it was only a fraction of the labor market. As that awareness  dawned, people began to ask themselves, 'What are we going to do about all the  people who are not protected by collective bargaining that need to have  protection from some other source?' ""      Management Unhappy    Initially, he said, the federal government began to fill some of those gaps  through passage of laws such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the  Employees Retirement and Income Security Act, the federal statute at issue in  the Morash case. Then state and local governments began to get in on the act  and management was unhappy.    Companies, particularly national companies, are deeply concerned with having to  comply with a welter of disparate regulations on the same subject, so they file  preemption challenges, said R. Theodore Clark, a senior partner at  Chicago-based Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather & Geraldson, the nation's largest  labor law firm on management's side.    UC Berkeley labor law professor David Feller said the preemption conflict  reflects the ironic convergence of two seemingly contradictory trends that have  emerged in recent years.    ""There is now a much larger constituency to provide legislation to protect  individual workers,"" while there is a smaller constituency to strengthen the  National Labor Relations Act, which offers workers collective protections,  Feller said.    ""This is the result of the decline of collective bargaining and the decline of  unionism,"" said Feller, who once served as general counsel to the United  Steelworkers of America.    Former President Ronald Reagan's appointment of conservatives to the federal  bench and the National Labor Relations Board also prompted organized labor to  look for relief in other venues, such as state courts and state legislatures,  said Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco labor lawyer who writes a number of  appellate court briefs for the AFL-CIO. ""People are looking for alternatives to  the NLRB,"" she said.    This represents a marked change from the past, said Washington labor lawyer  Michael Gottesman. Historically, organized labor viewed state courts as  oppressive tribunals that issued picketing injunctions at the drop of a hat and  state legislatures as enemy territory where conservative officeholders  attempted to pass laws restricting organizer activity.      Federal Laws    For years after the passage of the National Labor Relations Act, the labor  movement looked to federal laws as protections that were uniform throughout the  country. In the past, it was predominantly unions that raised preemption  challenges, trying to knock out state laws or administrative decisions it  considered unfair.    Then came Reagan. The increasingly difficult climate for labor in Washington  and at the bargaining table has prompted a fundamental re-examination of how  labor can best achieve its goals, including the use of state courts, challenges  to the all-encompassing primacy of federal labor laws and a willingness to  support cases filed by individual employees seeking the establishment of  minimum labor standards in certain areas.    ""These are tactical choices,"" Gottesman said. ""In an ideal world, the country  would be better with unified labor law,"" but he quickly added that the world is  far from ideal and that the labor movement has to adapt to changed  circumstances.    ""I think it's unrealistic to think (non-unionized) employees will sit idly by,""  waiting to get collective bargaining to give them greater protection. The  movement to give these workers greater protections ""will not go away,""  Gottesman said. ""The labor movement's intelligentsia has been philosophically  reluctant to openly advocate that, as a legal proposition, states have open  season. But the pressures are irresistible.""    And such pressures create complications for labor, said David Silberman, the  AFL-CIO's associate general counsel. ""On the one hand, the notion that a state  could enact a cap on wages or could fix wages certainly takes a lot away from  the collective bargaining process,"" Silberman said. ""On the other hand, there  are all kinds of minimum labor standards that look desirable to us.""    Indeed, organized labor has supported raising the minimum wage beyond the $3.35  an hour the federal government set it at in 1981. There is no preemption issue  on minimum wages and 11 states, including California, have a minimum above the  $3.35 level.    But while no one is raising the preemption issue regarding state minimum wage  laws, many other state laws offering greater worker protection are being  challenged on that basis.      Toxic Chemicals    One of the most heavily litigated issues are state laws directing employers to  give workers and communities information about the toxic chemicals they are  using. Although President Reagan espoused ""states rights,"" his aides supported  legal challenges by business groups to state ""right-to-know"" laws compelling  disclosure of information about toxic chemicals that were stronger than those  enacted subsequently by the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, an agency whose political tilt shifted sharply after Reagan  became President.    A protracted court battle on the state disclosure laws has been something of a  draw. In three separate cases in 1985 and 1986, a federal appeals court in  Philadelphia ruled that the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act  preempted state ""right-to-know"" laws as they applied to employees. However, the  court upheld the state laws as they apply to workplaces not covered by the  federal OSHA standard or if the laws are designed to protect the public or the  environment.    In several of the major cases, though, workers, unions and the states have  emerged victorious. For example:    Last June, the court unanimously upheld the Illinois statute on workers'  compensation-related firings in the case of Jonna Lingle vs. Norge Division of  Magic Chef Inc. This was considered a particularly important precedent because  the fired worker, Lingle, was a union member whose contract had a provision  saying that employees could only be discharged for ""just cause.""    The Supreme Court unanimously rejected the company's assertion that Lingle  should be barred from filing a state court damages suit in which she could be  awarded monetary damages because there was a remedy available to her in the  collective bargaining agreement. The company contended that since an  interpretation of the agreement was required, the matter came under the  National Labor Relations Act and was therefore preempted.    But Justice John Paul Stevens' opinion for the entire court said there was no  need to interpret the collective bargaining agreement because the facts showed  that the company had fired Lingle in clear violation of the Illinois law.    In June, 1987, in a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court upheld a Maine law  requiring employers to provide a one-time severance payment to employees not  covered by an express contract providing for severance pay. The court held that  Maine's law was not preempted by federal law. Maine's ""establishment of a  minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective  bargaining process,"" the majority opinion stated.    But the states and their labor allies certainly have not won all the recent  preemption cases. For example:    In February, 1986, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous decision, ruled that a  Wisconsin statute was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act. That law  prohibited a state agency from awarding a contract to a company that had  frequently violated the National Labor Relations Act.    In April, 1986, in an 8-1 opinion, the high court ruled that the city of Los  Angeles' denial of a taxi franchise to a company until it settled a strike  ""destroyed the balance of power designed by Congress"" in the National Labor  Relations Act ""and frustrated Congress' decision to leave open the use of  economic weapons.""    To be sure, there are still situations in which union lawyers argue in favor of  preemption.    But most of the time now, they are arguing against preemption and in favor of  greater state authority in the workplace. Just a few weeks ago, they were  pleased by a highly awaited decision by the Illinois Supreme Court. In a  unanimous opinion, the Illinois court ruled that the federal Occupational  Safety and Health Act does not preempt local prosecutors from bringing their  own criminal cases against employers who knowingly endanger workers on the job.    ""It is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended OSHA's penalties  would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or  results in serious physical injury or death to workers,"" the court wrote.    State criminal prosecutions of safety and health violations are considered  important because in 18 years, the federal government has filed only 14  criminal cases against OSHA violators. Although the decision is not binding on  any state other than Illinois, and is likely to be appealed, it is the  highest-level ruling on the issue to date and is considered likely to spur more  criminal prosecutions of workplace safety violations.

Tian said that on April 28, the United States Congress  passed  the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and  1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on April 30.    When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side  expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and  made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian  said, adding that ""We pointed out to the U.S side that these  provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty  and constituted a gross interference in China's internal  affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations.""    The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's  strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the  passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions  detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but  arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the  vice-minister said.    ""I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the  United States Government on this issue"", Tian said.    It is known to all that there is only one China and that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the  government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal  government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the  United Nations and the international community.    With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S.  Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three  Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its  international obligations. But the authorization act states  that ""Section 3 of Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over  statements of government policies, including communiques,  regulations, directives and policies based thereon"", thus openly  trampling on the communique of August 17, 1982 between the  Chinese and American Governments and seriously undermining the  basis of Sino-U.S. relations.    The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by  American cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the  American President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support  to Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations  of which the United States is a member.    ""This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas', `one  China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely  contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one  China' policy,"" Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to  sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in  the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute  position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots,  and is doomed to failure.    The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always  been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century,  and no country in the world, including the United States,  recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly  refers to Tibet as a ""country"", alleging that Tibet is an  ""occupied sovereign country"" and ""its true representatives are  the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile"", and even  asks the United States Information Agency to establish an  ""office"" in Lhasa for the development of educational and  cultural exchanges with the ""people of Tibet"".    He said that it is indeed shocking to see such a contempt  for  the basic norms governing the international relations, such open  infringement of China's sovereignty and attempt to split China.    The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to  safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity,  Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese  territory have ended in total failure with no exception.    ""Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today  will certainly come to grief"", Tian said, and ""We appeal to the  U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its openly-stated position  that Tibet is part of China and undertake not to get involved in  any activities aimed at splitting China.    On the ""Radio Free Asia"", Tian said, China and many other  Asian countries have pointed out clearly on a number of  occasions that the true intention of the United States in  setting up this radio is to use mass media to interfere in the  internal affairs of China and other Asian countries. This act,  however, approves the setting up of such a radio.    Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for  the  universally acknowledged norms governing international relations  and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint  communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to  meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the  peoples of other Asian countries.    Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial  moment right now, and ""We hope that they will move in a positive  direction.""    However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both  sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations.    The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations  authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S.  relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both  countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement  by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and  constructive relationship with China.    The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all  seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are  absolutely objectionable and unacceptable to the Chinese  Government and people. And ""We demand that the U.S. Government  honor its words and adopt effective measures to reverse its  wrong position and erroneous decision so as to strictly adhere  to the principles enshrined in the three joint communiques  between the two countries and the basic norms governing  international relations.""    Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held  responsible  for all the consequences arising therefrom.     "

According to the document, the republic's Ministry for  Foreign Economic Relations is given the right to conduct  auctions at the International Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial  Exchange for the sale of permits to participate in the  implementation of intergovernmental agreements for grain export  shipments during the current year: 3,000 tonnes to Uzbekistan,  500 tonnes each to Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, and Iran, 360 tonnes to  Tajikistan, 150 tonnes to Moldova, and 50 tonnes to Turkmenistan.    Permitted to participate in the auctions are economic  entities that have presented contracts for grain shipments from  the 1993 crop net surplus as of 1 September 1994, and as of 1  November 1994, from the current year's crop under the condition  of priority fulfillment of contracts for grain sales to meet  state needs. All contracts must undergo preliminary expert  review by the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations. Grains  exported in accordance with intergovernmental agreements are not  subject to customs duty. Grain exports through barter  arrangement are permissible.    Anatoliy Savelov, deputy chief of the Department for  Economic  Policy of the republic Cabinet of Ministers, provided the  following comments on the decree:    ""In 1994, in contrast to previous years, a new, unified  procedure was established for selling grain to entities outside  Kazakhstan. Grain sales of the 1993 and 1994 crops will be  effected in three directions: mandatory grain sales to meet  state needs, grain shipments in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements, and sales of other net surpluses  of grain.    ""Mandatory grain deliveries to meet state needs are effected  in accordance with the Decree of the Kazakhstan Republic Cabinet  of Ministers on Purchases and Shipments of Agricultural Output  for State Needs in 1994. According to the decree, the total  volume of mandatory grain deliveries to the state is 7 million  tonnes. This volume is divided among the 17 republic oblasts. In  this regard, it is stipulated that the directors of ministries,  associations, joint-stock companies, and other republic  organizations entrusted with functions as state clients, as well  as the heads of oblast and rayon administrations, are  responsible for the placement and fulfillment of orders for  grain purchases and deliveries for state needs in the full  amount and of suitable quality.    ""Grain producers who have completed their mandatory  deliveries may dispose of the remaining grain as they see fit,  including exporting it.    ""Rural producers have two ways of doing this.    ""The first is to sell the grain through Kazakhstan's  fulfillment of intergovernmental agreements. Here the Ministry  for Foreign Economic Relations conducts auctions at the  Kazakhstan Agro-Industrial Exchange in the sale of permits for  the right to effect export shipments of grain in accordance with  intergovernmental agreements. Obtaining a license in this manner  affords the following benefits: exemption from customs duty of  the entire volume of grain to be shipped, and first-priority  issue of serviceable, covered freight cars for grain shipment.    ""The second method consists of nonauction sale for export to  any country of grain net surpluses for either the currency of  this country or through barter arrangement, at the grain  producer's discretion.    ""In this event, the grain producer, or other economic  intermediary selected by the producer to sell its grain  surpluses, purchases export permits that are sold by oblast  organs of the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations at  regional commodities exchanges.    ""An economic entity is obliged to present a contract for the  grain shipment, including a shipment through barter arrangement,  to the oblast organ of the Ministry for Foreign Economic  Relations for its expert review. It must than obtain a license  and register the contract in question at the regional  commodities exchange.    ""In all cases except mandatory deliveries for state needs,  grain sales must be effected prior to 1 September 1994 for sales  from the remainder of last year's crop, and after 1 November for  sales from the 1994 crop.

Tian said that on 28 April, the United States Congress  passed  the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, fiscal years 1994 and  1995, which was signed by the U.S. President on 30 April.    When this bill was being discussed, the Chinese side  expressed serious concern over the anti-China provisions and  made several solemn representations with the U.S. side, Tian  said, adding that ""We pointed out to the U.S side that these  provisions, which had severely infringed on China's sovereignty  and constituted a gross interference in China's internal  affairs, would cause serious damage to Sino-U.S. relations.""    The U.S. side, however, in disregard of the Chinese side's  strong opposition and representations, went ahead with the  passage and signature of this bill that contains many provisions  detrimental to China's fundamental interests. This can not but  arouse great indignation of the Chinese people, the  vice-minister said.    ""I am hereby instructed to lodge a strong protest with the  United States Government on this issue"", Tian said.    It is known to all that there is only one China and that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, he said, and the  government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legal  government representing the whole of China, is recognized by the  United Nations and the international community.    With regard to the Taiwan question, Tian said, the U.S.  Government has made unambiguous commitment in the three  Sino-U.S. Joint communiques, and is therefore bound by its  international obligations. But the authorization act states  that ""Section 3 of the Taiwan Relations Act takes primacy over  statements of government policies, including communiques,  regulations, directives and policies based thereon,"" thus openly  trampling on the communique of 17 August 1982 between the  Chinese and U.S. Governments and seriously undermining the basis  of Sino-U.S. relations.    The vice-minister said that the act also advocates visits by  U.S. cabinet-level officials to Taiwan and calls on the U.S.  President to take steps to express clearly U.S. support to  Taiwan in bilateral relations and multilateral organizations of  which the United States is a member.    ""This is a deliberate attempt to create `two Chinas,' `one  China and one Taiwan' in the international arena that completely  contravenes the U.S. Government's commitment to pursue a `one  China' policy,"" Tian said, and this attempt by the U.S. side to  sabotage China's peaceful reunification and create tension in  the Taiwan Straits will certainly meet with the resolute  position of the Chinese people including our Taiwan compatriots,  and is doomed to failure.    The vice foreign minister also said that Tibet has always  been an inseparable part of China ever since the 13th century,  and no country in the world, including the United States,  recognizes Tibet as an independent country. But the act openly  refers to Tibet as a ""country,"" alleging that Tibet is an  ""occupied sovereign country"" and ""its true representatives are  the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in exile.""    He said that it is indeed shocking to see such contempt for  the basic norms governing international relations, such open  infringement of China's sovereignty and such an attempt to split  China.    The Chinese people waged protracted and arduous struggles to  safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial integrity,  Tian said, and all attempts to split Tibet from the Chinese  territory have ended in total failure with no exception.    ""Anyone who still wants to follow this beaten track today  will certainly come to grief"", Tian said, and ""We appeal [yao  qiu 6008 3061] to the U.S. Government to strictly adhere to its  openly stated position that Tibet is part of China and undertake  not to get involved in any activities aimed at splitting China.    On the ""Radio Free Asia"", Tian said, China and many other  Asian countries, and to create confusion to undermine stability  in these countries. This act, however, approves the setting up  of such a radio.    Tian said that this action once again shows no regard for  the  universally acknowledged norms governing international relations  and violates the principles enshrined in the three-joint  communiques between China and the United States. It is bound to  meet the resolute opposition from the Chinese people and the  peoples of other Asian countries.    Tian pointed out that Sino-U.S. relations are at a crucial  moment right now, and ""We hope that they will move in a positive  direction.""    However, he said, it depends on the joint efforts of both  sides to improve and develop the bilateral relations.    The above-mentioned contents of the foreign relations  authorization act seriously undermines the basis of Sino-U.S.  relations, runs counter to the fundamental interests of both  countries and peoples, and are inconsistent with the statement  by the U.S. Government that it wants to develop a positive and  constructive relationship with China.    The vice-minister said that China hereby states in all  seriousness that all the anti-China sections in this act are  absolutely objectionable and unacceptable [jian jue fan dui he  jue dui bu neng jie shou di 1017 0414 0646 1417 0735 4815 1417  0008 5174 2234 0649 4104] to the Chinese Government and people.  And ""We demand that the U.S. Government honor its words and  adopt effective measures to reverse its wrong position and  erroneous decision [gai bian qi cuo wu li chang he jue ding 2395  6239 0366 6934 6137 4539 1034 0735 0414 1353] so as to strictly  adhere to the principles enshrined in the three joint  communiques between the two countries and the basic norms  governing international relations.""    Otherwise, he warned, the U.S. side shall be held  responsible  for all the consequences arising therefrom.     "

During the meeting, they discussed  Russian-Cuban trade and economic relations, in particular, the  implementation of the agreement on deliveries of oil and  equipment for a Cuban power generating plant in exchange for  sugar exports to Russia.    Both sides noted that, the schedule of deliveries is being  observed, and the first part of the joint contract will be  implemented in June. The one hundred thousand tonne Cuban sugar  consignment will be delivered to Russian ports at the end of  May, the Cuban ambassador assured Soskovets. In turn, a fleet  of Russian tankers will similarly transport one million tonnes  of the Russian oil to Cuba strictly on schedule.    The Cuban ambassador proposed to adopt a joint decision and  discuss the supply schedule in the contract's second part, and  to prepare the 1995 trade and economic agreement for signing in  August- September, 1994.    On behalf of the Cuban leadership, Rogelio Montenegro  invited  Oleg Soskovets to pay an official visit to Cuba this summer.  Oleg Soskovets gratefully accepted the invitation.     "

Venizelos also referred to the recent statements by Albanian  officials, which have contributed to the artificial tension. We  do not pay attention to these statements, he said, because we  wish for the improvement of Greek-Albanian relations; we are a  country that accepts a large number of Albanians who, either  legally or illegally, work in our country; and we feel our  responsibility as a country trying to achieve stability in the  Balkans.

In the report, the EPA said the recent trade policies, which  provide for ample funds for research and development in the  high-tech area, are effective in giving a competitive edge to  U.S. industries and in boosting the economy.    It is necessary for world trade partners, however, to  establish international rules on government subsidies for  high-tech projects in order to head off ""subsidy competition,""  the agency said.    The EPA acknowledged that the U.S. trade policies are  generally based on free trade principles and promoting market  opening by its world trade partners.    But U.S. antidumping legislation is protectionist and blocks  the rational pricing of goods by foreign companies that mass  produce their goods and sell in bulk, the EPA said.    The U.S. antidumping policy should be discussed at the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), it added.    The EPA report was compiled by private-sector experts and  academics on trade.

Guatemala is a country that is struggling  to consolidate its democracy, strengthen its Constitution,  attain peace, and gain openings in international trade. To that  end, we need the assistance of a team and the confidence that we  can carry out that task.    We are a country that, just as any other developing country,  has very limited economic resources. Consequently, we must  increase the effectiveness of our missions abroad and the effort  of the people who work here at the Foreign Relations Ministry to  achieve all said objectives. As I said before, these objectives  must be achieved with very limited resources, but we are hopeful  and confident because Guatemala deserves it.    In addition, I want to thank Dr. Fajardo for the cooperation  and assistance he is giving me. All persons who preceded me in  this difficult position have done a great job.

Symposium participants tended to see  prospects for  trade relations with the United States and Western countries as only  fair, with Asia viewed as likely to become the focus of China's  external economic development.      The November issue of XIANDAI GUOJI GUANXI, an international  affairs journal affiliated with the well-respected China Institute  of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR), a research think  tank, is devoted to papers presented at an October symposium  sponsored by that institution on ""China's Economy Opening to the  Outside World.""  The papers present current thinking on the full  spectrum of China's economic and trade relations with the world by  participants from government, press, academic, and commercial  circles.  (The appendix to this Foreign Media Note lists the  reported articles, authors, and affiliations represented at the  symposium.)      All symposium articles dealing with further opening up China's  economy to the world give top priority to upgrading China's export  mix by shifting away from low-profit, labor-intensive products.  Chinese Academy of Social Sciences researcher Zhang Shouyi argues  that a low-cost, skilled labor pool gives China a comparative  advantage in ""knowledge-intensive, high-tech products.""  Other ideas  for expanding high-profit exports by other authors include improving  product quality, before and after sales service, and packaging.  JINGJI RIBAO journalist He Ming stresses the importance of in-  country marketing agents and products responsive to consumer demand  when targeting markets in advanced countries.  Others at this  symposium call for implementation of international standards and  foreign managers in China's export enterprises to expand exports.      In reforming the foreign trade regime by ""internationalizing""  Chinese enterprises, state-run enterprises are in the best position  to upgrade their exports, gain overseas market share, and become  multinational corporations.  According to Wang Zhile of the Ministry  of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation International Economic  Cooperation Research Center,  ""Of all the regions of the world,  Asia, and especially East Asia, should be the key region, the target  of first choice for internationalizing Chinese enterprises.""      The image of Asia as China's stepping stone to the world economy  is a common theme in many of the articles, but there is some  ambivalence in the respective arguments supporting that view:  Asia  is seen both as the region of greatest potential for China's  outward-oriented economic growth and as its stiffest competitor.  In  many cases Chinese exports are in direct competition with exports  from other developing Asian economies.  Moreover, low-quality  exports and lack of experience in international business dealings  put Chinese companies at a disadvantage in this competition.  China  is also see as in direct competition with ASEAN countries and  Indochina for foreign investment.      Nonetheless, there appears to be general agreement that China  must concentrate on Asia and Asian markets, both for their high  growth potential in the 9O's and to counterbalance the increasing  protectionism of Western countries.  With Asia, as with the world,  China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub-  regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and  regional fora.  Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission  Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three  triangles.  Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China-  Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore  and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United  States).  The larger triangles have the potential for economic  competition and even conflict.  Huang predicts the large triangle of  the Asia-Pacific will be the ""main battlefield"" in the U.S.-Japanese  struggle for economic leadership.  Huang sees areas of concern in  China's economic relations with both countries.  Japan doesn't want  to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always  ""fly in formation"" following Japan's lead.  According to Huang, the  United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its  political agenda on China.      Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent  theme in the articles.  CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the  United States is ""politicizing"" the economic relationship between  the two countries.  Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on ""unwarranted accusations"" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all ""harmed the bilateral relationship.""  Yan Xuetong, also of  CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, ""Hereafter  the United States will continue to use every pretext, including  constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit  China's exports to the United States.""  Ke Juhan urges the United  States to put the relationship on a more ""practical"" footing,  stating that President Clinton's recent ""intentions, statements, and  actions"" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with  China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved  with China economically, they will ""play an active role"" in  improving the bilateral relationship.      Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations,  three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out.  Wang Lijiu  asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic  relations with Russia.  However, according to Wang, both countries  must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy.  Wang  also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to  resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased  technology trade between the two countries.  In an article on  economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using  barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out  Western competition for those markets.  Finally, Guan Shufen  characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European  countries as ""cautiously optimistic.""  Sino-German economic  relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development.  On  the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade  protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic  industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral  relations.

With Asia, as with the world,  China's strategy for economic development is to begin with sub-  regional and bilateral relations and then move to multilateral and  regional fora.  Huang Fanzhang of the State Planning Commission  Economic Research Center explains this dynamic in terms of three  triangles.  Huang postulates a small triangle (Mainland China-  Taiwan-Hong Kong), a medium triangle (China-South Korea-Singapore  and other ASEAN countries), and a large triangle (China-Japan-United  States).  The larger triangles have the potential for economic  competition and even conflict.  Huang predicts the large triangle of  the Asia-Pacific will be the ""main battlefield"" in the U.S.-Japanese  struggle for economic leadership.  Huang sees areas of concern in  China's economic relations with both countries.  Japan doesn't want  to see China become a competitor, but rather wants China to always  ""fly in formation"" following Japan's lead.  According to Huang, the  United States, on the other hand, is intent on imposing its  political agenda on China.      Criticism of the United States along these lines is a frequent  theme in the articles.  CICIR analyst Ke Juhan asserts that the  United States is ""politicizing"" the economic relationship between  the two countries.  Ke says that conditionality on MFN, U.S.  economic reprisals based on ""unwarranted accusations"" of China's  violation of the MTCR, U.S. anti-dumping duties against Chinese  exports, and U.S. unilateral reduction of China's textile quotas  have all ""harmed the bilateral relationship.""  Yan Xuetong, also of  CICIR, agrees with Ke's contentions and further states, ""Hereafter  the United States will continue to use every pretext, including  constant use of quota limitations and anti-dumping duties, to limit  China's exports to the United States.""  Ke Juhan urges the United  States to put the relationship on a more ""practical"" footing,  stating that President Clinton's recent ""intentions, statements, and  actions"" are beginning to improve the economic relationship with  China and predicting that as more U.S. companies become involved  with China economically, they will ""play an active role"" in  improving the bilateral relationship.      Among the articles on bilateral and regional economic relations,  three on Russia and Europe by CICIR analysts stand out.  Wang Lijiu  asserts that now is the time for China to consolidate economic  relations with Russia.  However, according to Wang, both countries  must work to formulate a unified and coordinated trade policy.  Wang  also proposes setting up a Sino-Russian joint venture bank to  resolve outstanding trade payment issues and calls for increased  technology trade between the two countries.  In an article on  economic relations with Eastern Europe, Qi Degang advocates using  barter trade with cash-poor Eastern European countries to edge out  Western competition for those markets.  Finally, Guan Shufen  characterizes prospects for economic relations with Western European  countries as ""cautiously optimistic.""  Sino-German economic  relations will drive overall Sino-European economic development.  On  the down side, however, Guan sees increasing European trade  protectionism, use of anti-dumping measures to protect domestic  industries, and problems in Sino-French and Sino-British bilateral  relations.

[Rozenbergs] A meeting between Latvian Ambassador to Russia  Janis Peters and U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering was  held at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow on Monday afternoon. The  main topic of the talks was the present state of relations  between Latvia and Russia, especially in the wake of the  Latvian-Russian treaties initialled on 15 March as well as the  Yeltsin order on military bases published on 6 April.    During the talks with Pickering, Mr. Peters stressed that  signing the package of agreements should in no way contradict  the interests of the Latvian people. Pickering confirmed  Washington's readiness to grant $2 million for the dismantling  of the Skrunda radar station. The ambassadors discussed the  possibility of granting vouchers to Russian military pensioners  who express the wish to move to live in Russia, to obtain  apartments. The United States is not yet ready to specify the  amounts of money which it is to earmark for such vouchers. A  serious discussion was held on the possibility of attracting  foreign capital to a Skrunda fund.     "

The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told  Interfax that the two states were to increase mutual deliveries  of oil and sugar in 1994. Russia would export 4 Mn [million]  tons of oil by the end of 1994 (instead of 2.5 Mn tons, the  delivery of which was coordinated in late 1993) in exchange for  2.5 Mn tons of cane sugar, exceeding the earlier expected volume  of deliveries by 2.5 times.    According to Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister  Oleg  Davydov, ""Russia is very interested in importing Cuban sugar  since it has big industrial capacities specially established for  processing of cane sugar.""    Russia and Cuba also intend to develop bilateral cooperation  in other spheres. An International Russian-Cuban Trade Economic  Association Roskuba was established last week in accordance with  the inter-government agreement of December 24, 1993. The  association includes more than 10 Russian state and commercial  structures, for instance the joint stock companies  Aeroflot--Russian Air Lines, Ingosstrakh, Vneshtreidinvest,  Rosdetspetsprodukt, the state committee Rosvooruzhenie and the  Russian Federation Trade Industrial Chamber.    The association's main purposes are to contribute to the  development of trade, direct relations between enterprises and  organizations, mutual utilization of industrial capacities and  investment and to establishment of trans-national commercial,  finance and industrial structures.

The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign  minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth  Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy.    Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for  South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential,  but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council.    He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic  ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.    However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest  trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our interests and international precedents.""    Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the  focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union.    But, he said his country will also be looking beyond  traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among  others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's  Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.     "

Reports that Theofilos  Yeoryiadhis, a PKK agent in south Cyprus who was recently  murdered, was shot and killed by PKK militants and not by the  Turkish Intelligence Organization have prompted Greek officials  to change the direction of their investigation.    It is believed that Yeoryiadhis, who described himself as an  enemy of the Turks and has acted as the PKK contact in south  Cyprus since 1979, split from that organization two months ago.  He was killed by PKK militants, who secretly arrived in south  Cyprus, for failing to heed the PKK's threats.    Meanwhile, the PKK reportedly sabotaged the tourist ship  Athina-Palace in the Port of Piraievs last week. The ship was  destroyed by fire. The cause of the incident has not yet been  established. The ship was scheduled to leave Greece for Izmir  and Kusadasi after calling at several Greek islands in the  Aegean Sea the day after it was destroyed by fire. It has been  claimed that the PKK decided to prevent Greek passenger ships  from visiting Turkey and placed an incendiary bomb in the  Athina-Palace. The explosive was to detonate when the ship  entered the Port of Izmir. However, it detonated prematurely  and the ship was destroyed by fire in Greece.     "

According to the 25 March Maribor daily  VECER, seven of these Slovene-Croatian agreements were ratified  by the Chamber of Deputies of the Croatian Assembly on 24 March.    Describing the proceedings in the Croatian Assembly, VECER  reports that agreements on maritime fishing, reciprocal  implementation of court decisions, legal aid to citizens,  establishment and authority of joint bodies to examine and  delineate borders, economic and trade relations and cooperation,  employment, and cooperation in culture and education were  adopted without debate. One deputy, the paper reports, raised  the issue of layoffs of Croats working in Slovenia and another,  a representative of the ruling Croatian Democratic Community  [HDZ], requested an explanation regarding the rights of Croats  living in Slovenia. Croats in Slovenia do not have the status of  an ethnic minority, VECER points out, and are therefore not  entitled to rights, such as education in their native language,  granted to the recognized minorities: Italians and Hungarians.  An article in the 31 March issue of the Zagreb daily VJESNIK  analyzing Croatian-Slovene economic relations comments that the  joint commission of the two countries' Chambers of Commerce ""is  not active enough."" The article reports that this was also the  opinion of a Slovene economic delegation headed by Vojka Ravbar,  state secretary of the Ministry for Economic Relations and  Development, that visited Zagreb in March to discuss ""unresolved  questions"" of bilateral trade. Explaining the decline in  bilateral trade, the Slovene delegation stated that Slovene  firms had been looking elsewhere for partners, because of cases  in which Croatian firms had failed to fulfill contractual  obligations. The delegation cited the lack of an agreement on a  free trade zone as another negative factor in economic  relations, noting that Slovenia had signed such agreements with  the Czech and Slovak Republics and was in the process of doing  so with Hungary. The latter agreement was signed on 6 April,  according to a Budapest Kossuth Radio report of the same day.    Judging by the statements of the Slovene delegation, VJESNIK  concluded, the two sides agree that problems with  denationalization and privatization had ""slowed"" economic  development in both countries and contributed to problems in  bilateral trade. The sides reported ""dissatisfaction"" with the  state of bilateral trade and viewed the ""politicization"" of  economic problems as especially detrimental to cooperation. An  analysis of Slovene-Croatian economic relations in the 29  January issue of the major Ljubljana daily DELO reports that  trade with Croatia had declined from $8.2 billion in 1990 to  less than $1.5 billion in 1993. Croatia is Slovenia's  third-largest trading partner, following Germany and Italy;  Slovenia holds the same rank among Croatia's trading partners.  Trade is unbalanced, however, DELO notes, with Slovenia having a  ""considerable"" trade surplus with Croatia. In spite of such  negative trends, the paper observes, Slovene economists view  trade with Croatia as important to Slovenia's own economic  well-being.

The two ministers discussed relations between the Ukrainian  and American armed forces, the implementation of the Partnership  for Peace programme and conversion plans, including housing  construction for the demobilised military.    They also signed an agreement under which Ukraine will be  granted 50 million dollars in addition to 135 million it is to  receive under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. The means  will be used to finance the dismantlement of SS-24 missiles.    Radetskyy welcomed the U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian agreement  signed in Moscow as a ""historic move and a way-out of the  nuclear deadlock."" ""This step and the ratification by Ukraine of  the START-1 treaty and the Lisbon Protocol as a nuclear-free  state virtually removes all juridical and other barriers for  Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty,"" he  said.    At the same time, Radetskyy said that ""the fulfillment of  obligations assumed in nuclear disarmament is a costly process.""  He stressed the importance of U.S. assistance for carrying out  disarmament and solving social problems facing the military.    ""We have also reached full understanding on issues  concerning  the Partnership for Peace programme. We understand that  Ukraine's future aims at full accession to European structures,""  Radetskyy said.     "

According to Ramon Pez Ferro, an official of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], the group is headed  by Deputy Anial Pacheco Lopez, who has distinguished himself in  the Mexican parliament, and includes Agustin Basabe, president  of the Border Affairs Commission, Alberto Monteverde, Juan  Adrian, and Alfonso Ribera.    The visitors will meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel  Allende and Lazaro Barredo, acting president of ANPP's  International Relations Commission. The delegation's agenda  includes meetings with leaders of the University Students  Federation and the Union of Young Communists [UJC], meetings  which will acquaint them with the Cuban reality and inform them  of the activities of the younger Cuban generations, Pez Ferro  said.    The Mexican deputies attended the local all-star baseball  game at the Latin American Stadium in Havana to commemorate the  UJC anniversary, the leading organization of young Cubans, on 4  April.    The Mexican deputies' visit to Cuba is part of a program  between the assemblies of the two countries to improve and  expand their relations.    Rodolfo Becerril, president of the Mexican Chamber of  Deputies International Relations Commission, visited Cuba in  February to initiate a program for exchanging experiences during  1994 between deputies of the two countries.

Its decision in the Burlington  Northern vs. Brotherhood of Maintenance Employees case reasoned that the  Norris-La Guardia Act of 1932 prohibited federal courts from enjoining union  picketing in labor disputes. The Norris-La Guardia Act was passed by Congress  because of a long history of excessive and often unfair uses of injunctions  against a wide range of union activities.    Despite the Norris-La Guardia Act and the Supreme Court's Burlington decision  interpreting it, federal trial judges have enjoined the machinist union's  attempts to boycott employers other than Eastern. Many federal judges are  apparently unable to resist the temptation to save the country from what they  perceive to be the harmful effects of a potentially disruptive strike.

In a message  to the Ukrainian navy personnel on Monday, he calls for  preparing within 10 days a new round of talks on naval problems.    In his opinion, what happened in Odessa has been settled for  good, and neither Ukraine nor Russia should refocus on it. He  also called for displaying restraint, standing firm against  provocations, and disturbing actions that might complicate  relations between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukraine's Navy.    On the same day, Bezkorovaynyy sent a letter to the Mayor of  Sevastopol in connection with the city council's plan to discuss  what happened between the Black Sea Fleet and Ukrainian seamen  in Odessa on 8-9 April at an emergency session. The message  blames the incident ""on the gross violation of the Ukrainian  Constitution and laws by some Black Sea Fleet officials.""    In this connection, Bezkorovaynyy suggested that the council  consider the expediency of holding an emergency session or of  postponing it for a later date.    In his opinion, by declaring its allegiance to the  presidents  of Ukraine and Russia, the Black Sea Fleet has virtually gone  out of the Ukrainian leadership's control and become subordinate  to the Russian military alone. All this leads to arbitrariness  and impunity, he said.    According to the agreement signed in Zavidovo in 1992, the  Black Sea Navy Commander is subordinate to the presidents of  Ukraine and Russia alone.     "

The Chinese ambassador in Cairo speaks fluent Arabic, and  even speaks it with an Egyptian accent! He graduated from the  Department of Arabic in Cairo University's College of Liberal  Arts in the class of 1962.    The ambassador told me that his country was being  far-sighted  when it encouraged the Chinese to study Arabic, realizing the  importance of Egypt and the Arab world. This action took place  right after our deceased President Nasir had met with the  Chinese leader Chou En-lai at the Bandung Conference in 1954. In  that year, the two leaders, during this meeting, agreed to  establish cultural relations between the two countries, in spite  of the fact that they did not have political relations.    Shaykh Ahmad Hasan al-Baquri, now deceased, traveled to  Beijing in 1955 at the head of an Egyptian cultural delegation.  This was the first official delegation to visit China after its  revolution against, and overthrow of, the regime of Chiang  Kai-shek. During his stay in Beijing, Shaykh al-Baquri signed a  cultural agreement with the Chinese Government, according to  which the two nations agreed to an exchange of cultural  relations.    It was under the terms of this agreement that the Chinese  Government, in 1956, sent five young Chinese to Cairo to study  Arabic. Yang Fuchang, China's current ambassador [to Egypt], was  one of these five young men. After this group, other groups of  Chinese also came to Cairo to study Arabic, and this process  continued.    In the Chinese Embassy in Cairo there are about eight  Chinese  diplomats who read and speak Arabic. This ability of theirs  enables them to really see what the situation in Egypt is and  enables them to deal directly with the Egyptians instead of  using interpreters.    In spite of how important China is to us, our embassy in  Beijing stills deals with Chinese officials and others by means  of Chinese interpreters! I do not know why the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs in Egypt does not draw upon the services of some  Egyptians who read and speak Chinese. In my opinion, this is  something that would help Egyptian diplomats to better perform  their job.    When I visited China in September of last year, I found out  that the government and large companies in both Japan and Korea,  during the last few years, had begun to send large numbers of  young people to China to study and learn Chinese in order to  make it easier for them to deal with China.    China is the future. But the problem of dealing with China  is  that we do not know the language. I imagine that, during his  visit to China, President Mubarak will give this matter in  particular some of his attention, with the result being that  there will be an increase in the number of groups of Egyptians  being sent to China to study Chinese.    Whoever speaks the language of a country can easily open the  closed doors of that country!     "

In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the  Russian FCS and MVD officially declare that, following a  transfer of a large amount of currency, the FCS detained an  internal service major, a former employee of the Moscow Oblast  Administration Internal Affairs Main Administration Punishment  Execution Administration (dismissed in April 1994), and a major  of justice, a senior investigator of the Russian MVD  Investigative Committee. These persons have now been arrested  and charged under Article 88 (violation of regulations on  currency operations), Article 170 (abuse of official position),  and Article 174, Part 1 (giving a bribe) of the Russian  Federation Criminal Code. An attorney's office staffer has also  been arrested on a charge of committing a crime covered by  Article 174, Part 1 of the Criminal Code. The criminal case  which has been instituted has been forwarded for investigation  to the Russian Federation General Prosecutor's Office. All  three were charged 6 May. No leading employee of the Russian  MVD is involved in this case.    The Russian FCS and MVD deem it necessary to draw attention  to the fact that operational-investigative measures and  investigative actions relating to this case are being carried  out in cooperation with the MVD. This is the usual practice in  such instances. The position of the Russian FCS and MVD  leadership with regard to cases of corruption and official and  other crimes committed by staffers of organs subordinate to them  is well known and boils down to their resolute eradication.  Questions of the reliability and purity of personnel and of  their own security are topical for the whole law-enforcement  system. For counterintelligence and internal affairs organs  participation in exposing and stopping corruption -- not only in  law-enforcement organs but also in other state structures --  constitutes the fulfillment of their immediate duties and  functions of ensuring national security defined by current  legislation. Coordination of the efforts of law-enforcement  organs and special services and direct interaction and close  cooperation between internal affairs and counterintelligence  organs are a very important condition and an obligatory and  natural element of successful operational-investigative work,  particularly in the struggle against the most dangerous crimes.  MVD and FCS staffers have recently carried out a number of  successful joint operations which have ended the activities of  many dangerous criminal groupings which were engaged in the  illegal dissemination of drugs, weapons, and contraband  antiques. Positive results have been obtained as a result of  carrying out the comprehensive ""Putina,"" ""Tral,"" and ""Arsenal""  operations.    In this connection the Public Relations Centers of the  Russian FCS and MVD believe that the dissemination of  fabrications about a confrontation or ""war of monsters"" between  the FCS and the MVD should be regarded as a provocation harmful  to the common cause of combatting crime and corruption and  ensuring the security of the individual, society, and the state.

The tour began  with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that  utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million  tons of steel in 1993.    A management delegation representing this steel company  visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing  cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban  foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's  willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field  in which the island has a considerable infrastructure.    Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the  Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is  considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the  Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be  received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief  of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign  relations, health, and finance.

The results of the  operation of the ministry last year were discussed at the  meeting and the main directions for work in 1994 set forth.  After the proceedings of the collegium, Minister of Foreign  Economic Relations Oleg Davydov invited several Russian  journalists to a meeting, in which he shared his considerations  concerning the status of Russia's foreign trade and answered  numerous questions. We offer our readers a brief report on this  meeting.    Exports Have Stabilized    In 1993 the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  structured  its work on the basis of the program of the Government of Russia  ""Development of Reforms and Stabilization of the Russian  Economy."" It was particularly important for us to actually carry  out the first stage of this program scheduled for 1993-1995. The  ministry concentrated its efforts on this. We continued work to  shape a mechanism for the regulation of foreign economic  activities in the period of transition. It is based on further  liberalization through cutting back measures of nontariff  regulation and switching to mostly economic methods, at the same  time streamlining the system of export and currency control. The  stabilization of exports and the growth of foreign exchange  proceeds testify that the measures being taken are effective. At  the same time, major problems have yet to be solved in the area  of foreign exchange regulation; there have been instances of  violations of legislation in the foreign economic sector.    Despite the overall worsening of conditions for trade,  Russian exports (volume in terms of value) stabilized in 1993,  coming to $43 billion. A considerable positive balance was  achieved in trade with distant foreign countries in the amount  of $16 billion. This was ensured primarily by increasing the  physical volume of deliveries of raw and other materials.    Changes in the geographical breakdown of exports caused the  share of industrialized countries to increase from 58 percent in  1992 to 60 percent in 1993, and that of developing  countries--from 11 to 14 percent, respectively. The share of the  former member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic  Assistance fell from 19 to 17 percent.    Germany, China, Great Britain, Japan, France, the United  States, Hungary, and Finland hold leading positions in Russian  exports. Exports to the countries of Southeast Asia--Hong Kong,  Taiwan, Singapore, and the Republic of Korea--have developed at  a high rate.    In the opinion of the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the slump in industrial production in  Russia, worsening trends on the world market, and failure to  solve the problems of state support for exports, including  funding and insurance for them, have affected the volume,  breakdown, and rate of growth of exports. Besides, exports  experienced powerful pressure from industrialized countries,  which have taken discriminatory measures against Russian trade.  The interest of exporters in making deliveries of a number of  types of products fell sharply. This happened as a result of the  growth of domestic prices, transportation outlays, and high  interest rates on bank credit.    Nonetheless, proceeds in foreign exchange from the exports  of  goods went up in 1993, reaching $16 billion. In the opinion of  the leadership of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations,  this testifies to the gradual assertion of export and foreign  exchange control, especially over the deliveries of  strategically important raw material products.    We Have Begun To Import Less    Compared to 1992, Russian imports fell last year by almost  30  percent and came to $27 billion, which is mainly associated with  the pursued policy of reducing state expenditures, including  those for centralized imports; the latter declined by a factor  of two. We also began to purchase less abroad due to restricting  foreign borrowing, implementing a policy of containing credit  extension, gradually abolishing subsidization of imports from  the budget, and introducing the value-added tax on imported  goods.    Industrialized countries accounted for 54 percent of the  total volume of imports (62 percent in 1992), developing  countries for 18 percent (14 percent), and former member  countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance for 11  percent (15 percent).    The greatest volume of import purchases was generated in  Germany, China, the United States, France, Italy, Japan, Great  Britain, and Hungary.    To be sure, we cannot fail to note that the existing  methodology of registering statistical data in the area of  foreign trade with which the State Committee on Statistics and,  consequently, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations operate  is far from perfect. This methodology was developed with the  quite recently existing monopoly of the state in the area of  foreign economic relations factored in; in many cases, it is  simply not functional. For example, numbers indicate that trade  between Russia and Sweden is declining; but according to Swedish  estimates it is increasing, and at a quite confident rate.    In Stockholm they believe that Russia has moved from 32d to  28th place in Swedish exports. The explanation is quite simple:  Unlike Russian statistics, Swedish statistics are based on  registration of the volume of commodity flows crossing the  border of the country; for this reason, they also register  things exported by private persons. Given our current Russian  reality, whereby customs duties have increased sharply, a  majority of importing companies, for example, importers of  automobiles, perform their operations precisely through private  persons.    In the opinion of Oleg Davydov, the latest changes in the  leadership of the State Committee on Statistics should ensure a  change for the better in this area. In his words, so far it has  been virtually impossible in some cases to obtain accurate data;  he personally encountered this in his numerous attempts to learn  about the volume of trade with Baltic countries.    Great Changes Are Forthcoming    In the near future, by all signs from next year on, the  approach to Russia as a country with state foreign trade will  hardly be applicable. As Oleg Davydov stated, the state is  planning to fully withdraw from this sphere of activities in  1995. All indications are that this will occasion major changes  in the structure of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  itself.    As far as changes directly in the area of export and import  operations are concerned, the determination to discontinue grain  purchases abroad beginning next year is noteworthy. In general,  Russian foreign trade will to a considerable degree depend on  the domestic economic situation, what paths the reforms take,  and what the next steps of the Russian Government in the  economic area turn out to be.    The main avenues for the operation of the Ministry of  Foreign  Economic Relations in 1994 are:    --perfecting the regulatory and legal base for regulating  foreign economic activities (VED);    --cutting back administrative methods and perfecting  economic  methods for the regulation of foreign economic activities;    --reinforcing export and foreign exchange control;    --creating a favorable regimen of trade in relations with  foreign countries;    --ensuring the accomplishment of tasks in export and import  operations to meet federal state needs;    --ensuring support for Russian exports;    --stimulating the attraction of foreign investment to  Russia;    --settling the issue of the repayment of the debt of foreign  states to Russia;    --coordinating and facilitating the development of foreign  economic activities of the regions of Russia;    --improving informational and cadre support for foreign  economic activities.    All the above avenues appear important. However, it makes  sense to focus in particular on problems associated with the  operation of the currency market in Russia. The point is that,  in the environment of a high rate of inflation, the exchange  rate of the ruble on the currency market has recently been  maintained at an artificially high level. As a result, a  paradoxical situation developed in January--even the export of  oil and refinery products from Russia ended up unprofitable at  the maintained ratio of 1,160 rubles [R] to the dollar. Oleg  Davydov believes that had the exchange rate of the ruble not  fallen below the line of R1,500 to the dollar, export shipments  could have simply stopped. Consequently, foreign exchange  proceeds from exports, which come to $3-3.5 billion, would have  ceased.    Therefore, the sphere of foreign economic activities  develops  in a close interrelationship with domestic economic development.  When particular measures are implemented in the economic sphere,  it is necessary to soberly evaluate the entire range of possible  side effects which, in terms of consequences, may prove far more  serious than temporary advantages, even if they set the noble  goal of ensuring stability of the national currency.

I am going to explain the communique they sent us, which has  somehow led to confusion. I will explain what will happen with  the so-called border-crossing visas [mica]. There will not be  changes with regard to indefinite border-crossing visas.  [sentence as heard] All other visas stamped on your passports,  even those that read indefinite, will no longer be so.    In keeping with a worldwide effort to make the automatic  handling of visas more efficient, three years ago the U.S.  Embassy began issuing nonimmigrant visas which are read by  computers. These have a maximum validity of 10 years.    Therefore, starting on 1 January 1995, all indefinite  validity visas issued before 1 January 1995 will be canceled.  In addition, after 1 January 1995, indefinite visas will not be  valid after 10 years of their issue date. Nonimmigrant visas  are those issued to tourists, businessmen, students, and other  persons who travel temporarily to the United States.    In their communique, they posed some questions to try to  clarify the doubts the public may have. One says: What will  happen with the indefinite visas already issued? Beginning on 1  January 1995, indefinite visas stamped on passports will be  canceled 10 years after their issue date. For instance, visas  issued before 2 January 1985 will not be valid as of 1 January  1995, and an indefinite visa issued in 1990 will be valid until  the year 2000.    Another question formulated is: What must people holding  indefinite visas on their passports do? They must revise their  date of expiration, which will not exceed 10 years, and take  steps to obtain a visa for only 10 years, if expired. I repeat,  indefinite visas will no longer exist.    Will this policy affect border-crossing visas, Form I-186?  No. This measure only affects those whose indefinite visas are  stamped on their passports. If you are holding an indefinite  border-crossing visa, there is no problem.    Evidently, this has generated reaction. Why has the U.S.  Government taken this position? Here in our country, some  pronouncements were made on the issue. Foreign Relations  Secretary Manuel Tello ruled out the restriction of U.S. visas  to 10 years starting in 1995 as being an anti-immigration  measure, which is obviously what people thought at first.    Let us listen to Marcela Gutierrez:    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] Foreign Relations Secretary  Manuel Tello ruled out the 10-year limit of U.S. visas as being  an anti-immigration measure by the United States. On the  contrary, he indicated, the U.S. visa policy is very generous.    [Tello] If I receive a visa that is valid for 10 years to  visit a country, I would think it is a very generous visa. I  repeat once more, we grant foreigners visas to visit Mexico for  only 180 days.    [Gutierrez] The foreign minister reiterated our country will  not modify the duration of the visas issued to foreigners.  Interviewed at the Foreign Relations Secretariat, Manuel Tello  stated it is the exclusive responsibility of the U.S. Government  to decide the duration of the visas.    Finally, he concluded it is not irregular that with the  commercial opening, the government of the neighboring country  decided to limit indefinite tourist visas to 10 years. [end  recording]     "

He added that during his visit he would hold talks with the  Iraqi officials on best ways to restore the relations between  Iraq and Germany, stressing that Iraq could play a prominent  role to serve peace and security in the region.    He concluded by saying that the German delegation would  extend help to Iraq in the health and medical fields to ease the  impact of the sanctions.     "
0,FT923-7296 ,"FT923-7296 _AN-CHTBJABQFT 920819   FT  19 AUG 92 / NHS trust sets up pay system      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor   A JOB evaluation system for healthcare employers seeking to introduce local pay bargaining has been developed jointly by Manchester Central Hospitals, which was in the first wave of National Health Service trusts in April last year. Accountants KPMG Peat Marwick developed the system in conjunction with the Manchester hospitals and hopes to sell it to other NHS trusts that want to break away from the centralised pay and grading structure. The Manchester trust employs about 6,000 people and has more than 450 types of job. The new computerised evaluation system is highly complex because each department has very different skill requirements for apparently identical job titles. The system will form the basis of a single pay spine for all the trust's medical and non-medical staff. A progress report by Industrial Relations Services, the research group, says that the Manchester trust has not yet moved to local bargaining for basic pay and conditions. The trust has, however, created 'single-table' bargaining for its 22 staff organisations on non-pay matters discussed at local level. These are for grievance procedures, which are covered by deals replacing NHS agreements. Mr Richard Sugden, trust personnel director, says that the success of the trust will largely depend on how well it manages its pay bill, which accounts for 70 per cent of costs.

The Hungarian-Slovak basic agreement could possibly be  signed during the summer, and it seems certain that Slovak  President Michal Kovac will visit Hungary prior to Hungarian  President Arpad Goncz's visit to Banska Bystrica at the end of  August.    This was reported by the international secretary of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), Gabor Hars, in Bratislava on  Wednesday [22 June], after his talks with leaders of several  major political forces.    In an interview with MTI, Hars said the aim of his visit was  to inform his partners in Bratislava about his party's foreign  policy concepts prior to the MSZP taking over government.    Hars said Slovakia has a priority place in the MSZP's  foreign  policy.    The MSZP is ready to sign the Hungarian-Slovak basic  agreement, together with the border guarantees.    The politician was of the opinion that this could perhaps  take place during Horn's visit to Slovakia, prior to the Slovak  elections scheduled for the autumn.    During his visit, Hars held talks with the vice-president of  the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL), Erzsebet Borza, an  ethnic Hungarian, and the party's ethnic Hungarian parliamentary  deputy, Jozsef Zselenak.    Hars also met former Slovak Prime Minister Jan Carnogursky,  the chairman of the Slovak Christian Democratic Movement (KDH);  the vice-president of the Vladimir Meciar-led Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), Ivan Lexa; the section director of  the Slovak Foreign Ministry, Frantisek Dlhopolsky, and the  chairman of the Coexistence movement, Miklos Duray.

The exercise, the largest of its kind conducted by the commission, is intended to collect information about how far companies are following government guidelines on the appointment and promotion of ethnic-minority employees. The commission says it will not attempt to 'catch employers out' during the investigation. The commission may, however, use the results to press for legislation to be strengthened and the 10-year-old Race Relations Code of Practice, which accompanies the 1976 Race Relations Act, to be updated. A pilot questionnaire has been sent to 18 volunteer companies, including Kingfisher, Boots and National Westminster Bank. The full survey of remaining companies, each with a minimum of 7,000 employees, is likely to go out in July, with publication of the findings early next year. Ms Mary Coussey, the commission's employment director, said that informal contacts 'tend to suggest there's a minority of 'good' employers who have done a fair bit, but their number hasn't grown very much in recent years'. Last year the Department of Employment issued a 10-point plan for employers on how to implement equal opportunities, including race equality policies and practices. The plan recommends companies should develop an equal opportunities policy, set an action plan, provide training for all, and monitor progress in achieving objectives. Mr Tony Ward, Kingfisher's director of human resources and a senior CRE commissioner, said he thought the investigation would show that most companies had equal opportunity policies on race but they were 'not necessarily measuring how effective they were'.

Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have already been  removed from the COCOM lists.    While featuring in the COCOM lists, Poland cannot buy the  world's most advanced commodities and technologies that may be  used for civilian and military purposes.    COCOM demanded from the countries concerned to introduce  legal regulations allowing for a strict control exports of  strategically important goods and technologies to third  countries.    Poland has launched related legislative procedures but  failed  to introduce them in time as required by COCOM as a condition to  abolish the restrictions.    While in Paris the Polish delegation presented the system of  controls created in Poland and actions envisaged to guarantee  their efficiency. The system of controls is supervised by the  Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and a special department  of turnover with goods and technologies of strategic importance.  Its main aim is to control the possible exports of these goods  to third countries.    A French mission has been invited to Poland to convince the  COCOM authorities about the efficiency of the system. So far  over a dozen American, German and British missions have visited  Poland.    According to the Polish commercial counsellor in Paris, it  is  possible that Poland will disappear from the COCOM lists before  March 31, which is the deadline for the COCOM existence in its  present form.

Both sides agreed that the sanctions are unjust and  counterproductive.    The Belarus minister stated that the visit by Vladislav  Jovanovic will contribute to the development of bilateral  relations. He voiced expectations that Belarus will soon pass a  decision to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia at  the embassy level. Vladislav Jovanovic in this way ended a  series of talks with Belarus officials. He previously held  talks with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich and the deputy  president of the Supreme Soviet, Vladimir (Rusiakov). Both  sides stressed the significance of this visit and its  contribution to the development of cooperation between the two  friendly nations now and especially after the abolition of  sanctions against Yugoslavia.    The Yugoslav minister visited Belarus at the invitation of  the country's leadership. This fact also suggests a desire by  both sides to promote cooperation. It is also worth mentioning  that Belarus partners expressed support and solidarity with  Yugoslavia, as well as their disapproval of the sanctions and  their tightening and the international isolation of Yugoslavia.

This shows that relations between the  two sides have eased further, reflects Russia's strategic  conception of fully participating in world affairs, and also  indicates that bilateral relations will enter a new stage of  development.    Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the  Soviet Union, NATO and Russia readjusted their respective  strategies and foreign policies and have reestablished their  basic principles. In January this year, NATO put forth the  ""partnership for peace"" plan to ensure its continuing existence  and development in an attempt to play a central role in Europe's  future security pattern so that it could build up closer  political and military cooperative relations with all European  countries, including the former USSR republics and neutral  countries. Russia's participation in the ""partnership"" is an  important element of its general plan for fully participating in  European affairs.    The Russian president will attend the European Union summit  meeting on Greece's Corfu Island on 24 June and will initial a  partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union.  Between 8 and 10 July, he will attend the G-7 summit meeting in  Naples of Italy and will play a full role in political  consultations for the first time at the ""seven plus one"" meeting.    In order to satisfy Russia's demands, the NATO foreign  ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey on 9 June agreed with  Russia's proposal for expanding the scope of cooperation  consultations beyond the ""partnership for peace"" scheme to cover  issues such as the settlement of the local conflicts in former  Yugoslavia and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. NATO  also accepted the principle of ""no veto and no surprise attack""  and agreed to make public the documents related to the bilateral  consultations on comprehensive security relations. However,  NATO only admitted that such consultations were informal and not  automatic and required that the relevant issues be discussed  individually. It also insisted that Russia cannot veto NATO's  decisions but can be notified beforehand of NATO's major  decisions.    On 17 June, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin arrived  in Brussels and held talks on the details of Russia's full  security cooperation relationship with NATO. Reportedly, the  Russian side put forth a draft version of the cooperation  agreement, including the point that the main objective of the  ""partnership for peace"" is to cooperate to solve crises, calm  down conflicts, arrange peace-keeping actions, and establish an  effective mechanism for maintaining European security and  stability, with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe playing a major role. Russia also proposed that  cooperation be carried out in the fields of preventing nuclear  proliferation, preventing possible new nuclear threats, shifting  the war industry to civilian production, coordinating the  production of new weapons, fighting terrorism, and advancing  disarmament and arms control. This showed that the new  developments in NATO-Russian relations would have a far-reaching  influence on the security pattern in Europe -- and in the world  as a whole -- as well as on relations between various countries.

The two documents are  likely to be negotiated with Syria this year, Czech Deputy  Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra said today. Vondra was  speaking to reporters after his return home from a trip to the  two countries and Iran.    He said that as far as Syria is concerned, all agreements  with that country will be reviewed, which is important from the  point of view of past commitments and accords concluded with  Syria by former Czechoslovakia. Vondra handed over an  invitation for the Syrian foreign minister to visit the Czech  Republic.    Vondra also said that since Syria was a traditional region  for investment and commercial activities by Czech firms, he had  tried to support the activities of Czech business people in  realizing promising projects.    Vondra believes that the issue of Czech liabilities in Syria  dating from the 1970's and particularly from the 1980's will  best be settled through the maintenance of mutual trade  relations. He said Syria was now in a very good position  regarding payments. Over the past two years, particularly after  the Gulf War, it has been a responsible partner, said Vondra.    Pakistan is following the path of extensive privatization of  the state sector. Vondra believes it is necessary for Czech  business people to obtain information about the changed  situation there so that they will be able to orientate  themselves quickly. That was also one of the reasons why the  Czech Government decided some time ago to turn the former  commercial department in Karachi into a general consulate.     "

The top Canadian official will meet with Cuban Government  officials and deliver a speech at the International Conference  on Business Opportunities in Cuba promoted by the British  magazine THE ECONOMIST, which will begin here on Monday.    A Canadian Embassy representative told PRENSA LATINA that  this visit to Cuba falls within the framework of the political  dialogue between the two countries, which has increased since  1989 with the exchange of official visits.    Former Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon traveled to  Ottawa that year, and the following year his Canadian  counterpart, Louise Frechette, visited Havana, where she met  with President Fidel Castro. Both countries have expressed  their satisfaction over the development of the political  dialogue and the expansion of economic ties.    Since the administration of Conservative Prime Minister  Brian  Mulroney, Canada has been strengthening its relations with Latin  America. The current Liberal administration of Jean Chretien  wants to consolidate those relations, particularly in the  commercial arena, and has taken steps in that direction.    At the recent OAS General Assembly, Stewart called for  breaking the isolation orchestrated against Cuba and advocated  Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization.    Prior to that time, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet  stressed Ottawa's rejection of the U.S. blockade against Cuba  and called for an end to the policy.    Canada and Mexico were the only countries in the hemisphere  who in 1962 refused to accept U.S. demands that OAS  member-countries break relations with the island.     "

Secretary of State for Education John Patten said effort  needed to be made to put mutual relations back into the warm  waters.    Malaysia barred British companies from bidding for public  sector contracts in February following publication of  unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Malaysian  leaders in the British media.    Speaking to reporters at the British Council here a few  hours  after his arrival yesterday, Patten said he was disappointed by  the effect of reports in the British press on the relationship  between the two countries.    As Douglas Hurd (British Foreign Secretary) said in the  House  of Commons last Wednesday, we should not allow the press to come  between us, he said.    He said both Hurd and Trade Secretary Richard Needham had  made it clear that Britain wished to see a resumption of normal  relations as soon as possible.    Patten added Britain would continue to work vigorously to  bring about a situation in which the Malaysian Government felt  able to lift its ban on public sector contracts for British  companies.    Certainly the British press had been pretty quiet on this  issue over the last two or three weeks, he said.    Asked about Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's stand on  the matter, he said the Malaysian leader had always been a very  powerful advocate of Malaysia's case internationally.    He said Dr. Mahathir had made his views known especially in  a  very striking letter to the FINANCIAL TIMES of London a few  weeks ago.     "

Of 98 companies which responded to the survey, 25 said they had abandoned collective bargaining in one or more areas of the company but only 10 had abandoned collective bargaining for all workers. Fifteen cited performance pay as the main motive for abandoning collective bargaining, 12 said collective bargaining was no longer relevant for the employees concerned, and 10 said there was already a low degree of union membership among the people involved. Asked to rate the success of de-recognition in terms of its impact on such things as employee commitment and productivity most said it had been 'fairly successful' a few 'very successful' and very few 'fairly unsuccessful'. De-recognised unions often kept some form of representative or consultative rights, especially over disciplinary and grievance procedures. Sixteen organisations claimed to have introduced personal contracts, but these appeared to vary little within individual organisations. The highest levels of sickness absence from work in spring 1993 were recorded in Yorkshire and Humberside, the latest Labour Force Survey says. Four per cent of men and 6.1 per cent of women were absent because of illness or injury for at least one day in the week during which the data was collected. In all regions - except East Anglia, which had the lowest rate of sick leave  -the levels of sickness absence for women were higher. Overall, 4.2 per cent of men were absent for at least one day in the week of the survey compared with 5.4 per cent of women.

The two leaders, who had not talked since June 1991,  decided to establish a stable channel of communication,  especially with respect to autonomy and economic issues and  cooperation in the Congress [of Deputies]. The People's Party  also acknowledges the possibility of taking part in the next  Basque government.    The meeting took place at a private house midway between  Burgos and the Basque Country, and helped break three years of  noncommunication since the two politicians met 12 June 1991.  Accompanied by Jaime Mayor Oreja, People's Party chairman in the  Basque Country, and by Juan Maria Ollora of the PNV, Aznar and  Arzalluz mainly centered their four-hour conversation on the  economic and autonomy situations and on the need to recover a  certain world of values, Mayor Oreja told ABC yesterday.    However, the main aim was to unblock a relationship which  was  virtually nonexistent, since, although both leaders have  attended European People's Party meetings, they have not  directly exchanged a word, although they have indirectly  exchanged many mutual accusations.    Arzalluz expressed his concern about the implementation of  autonomy and even handed the People's Party leader a document  containing his party's stance on the matter, which dwelt  especially on the single social security fund. But there was  most agreement on the situation of ""grave"" economic and  industrial crisis which Spain is experiencing, as Mayor Oreja  explained to this newspaper, and for this reason Aznar and  Arzalluz decided that their respective parties will continue  their contacts after Easter Week.    The People's Party and the PNV are thus establishing new  channels of communication which will also be manifested between  the parliamentary groups in the Congress, although Mayor Oreja  refused to speak of the existence of any common front, but  asserted, on the other hand, the need for less rigidity in  relations between the two parties.    The initiative for the meeting, the same sources added, was  shared, and came following a conversation four weeks ago between  the People's Party chairman in the Basque Country and  Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza.    Emphasis was also placed on giving greater impetus to  regeneration of the institutions. An issue which was broached  very superficially -- ""it really was discussed very little"" --  was terrorism, perhaps in order to avoid tensions in a  conversation which would have made clear the deep differences.  As Mayor Oreja explained, the People's Party is opposed to ETA  [Basque Homeland and Liberty] members' rehabilitation taking  place through a decision of the Basque parliament.    The unblocking of relations between the People's Party and  the PNV occurs against the backdrop of the holding of the next  Basque elections in the fall. In this connection, and since all  the parties seem to be open to any cooperation formula in order  to form a government, the People's Party is not ruling out  joining in that combination, and a PNV-People's Party government  could be conjectured, at least in theory. However, Mayor Oreja  emphasized that the People's Party's sole aim is to rise in this  community, and described any other kind of conjecture as  premature ""until we know the results.""    For his part, Basque premier Jose Antonio Ardanza described  the meeting as very positive, although he would say nothing  about possible future coalitions following the elections. He  stated that it is his party's duty, ""because of the major  government responsibility which it has been exercising since the  transition,"" to maintain relations ""at both ends of the  political spectrum.""

The commission's second review of the 1976 Race Relations Act also calls for a framework of legislation with equality of opportunity as its objective and a duty on employers to adopt goals and timetables where appropriate. Ethnic monitoring is the only way in which discrimination can be systematically detected, the commission says. The home secretary should also be given powers to introduce ethnic monitoring of recipients of public-sector services such as housing and education. Sir Michael Day, commission chairman, said the 1976 act had made a substantial contribution to good race relations, but there was continuing evidence of widespread discrimination. He warned the government to give 'a better response' to the second review than it did to the first, published seven years ago. Among measures the commission is seeking are: A special discrimination division within the industrial tribunal system with power to award victims up to Pounds 30,000 in compensation. Legal aid for discrimination cases in tribunals. The tightening and extension of the definition of indirect discrimination. Laws against racial discrimination in Northern Ireland. The introduction of a specific law against incitement to religious hatred.

According to the compact, which was signed by Palau and the  U.S. in 1982 but only approved last November, Palau will become  an independent and sovereign state.    Kuniwo Nakamura, president of Palau, said the next time  Palau  stood before the United Nations, he hoped it would do so as a  sovereign and independent country and as a member state.    Zhang Yan said China has all along supported the people of  the trust territories in their efforts for national  self-determination and their aspiration for national independent.    ""The Chinese people cherish friendly sentiments towards the  Palau people, we are looking forward to Palau becoming an  independent member of the international community and embarking  on the road of economic development and building up the country  at an early date,"" he said.    Palau is situated in western Pacific, one of important  waterways to the Southeast Asia from the West.    Now it is the only one UN trusteeship land.

Angered by the pro-management way that the law has been administered since  President Ronald Reagan took office nearly nine years ago, the AFL-CIO  president suggests abolishing it even though the 1935 measure was written  specifically to encourage the development of unions to offset the enormous  power of corporations over individual workers.    The law, which is administered by the National Labor Relations Board, never  achieved that balance, and unions now represent an ever-diminishing proportion  of the work force.    Too often, though, unions use their legitimate complaints about the  pro-management enforcement of the law as an excuse for their own failure to  recruit members fast enough to keep up with the growth of the work force.    Fortunately, many union leaders, including Kirkland, are now considering what  more they can do to revive their flagging organizations.    They have started a host of new programs, from low-interest credit cards to  free legal advice, to try to achieve that goal. They are also recognizing that  they talk too much and do too little about the crucial job of organizing new  members.    An organizing institute just opened by the AFL-CIO will study ways of  recruiting members and training organizers. One innovation expected to come  from the institute is a program to help unions pool their resources.    For example, a union that is training apprentice organizers will be asked to  let its apprentices help other unions with major campaigns, thus making  on-the-job training available to the new organizers and helping other unions at  the same time.    Even though some progress is being made, Kirkland contends that unions would  fare better under the ""law of the jungle"" -- that is, no law at all -- than the  time-consuming and costly legal roadblocks that they have been facing under the  National Labor Relations Act.    Few other union leaders go as far as Kirkland, and for all his radical  rhetoric, neither he nor any other officer of the 14-million-member labor  federation has officially asked Congress to repeal the law.    They should not. The law provides sensible general rules of conduct for both  labor and management, though changes are essential to make it work more  effectively, and it must be administered more even-handedly.    Unions often seem to put off major organizing campaigns in the vague hope of  electing state and federal legislators who might pass new laws to make the  campaigns easier to win, one union officer contends.    William H. Wynn, president of the 1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial  Workers Union, recommends forgetting that hope because it won't be realized in  the foreseeable future.    Wynn does not say, as Kirkland does, that unions would be better off without  the National Labor Relations Act, but he does suggest that, whenever possible,  unions should simply ignore the NLRB.    An increasing number of unions are doing just that. They are less frequently  asking the NLRB to conduct elections to determine if workers in a company want  to be represented by a union, a process that can be lengthy and expensive.    Instead, a union often tries to get workers to sign cards saying they want a  union, and if a majority of them sign up, the union goes directly to the  management and demands recognition, bypassing the NLRB entirely.    Wynn says the UFCW has organized about 100,000 members in each of the past two  years, and only 10% of those new members were won through NLRB-conducted  elections.    The union actually made a net gain of only 40,000 members, however, because it  lost thousands of others, mostly due to store closings that resulted from  corporate mergers, leveraged buyouts and consolidations.    There are several effective ways to persuade management to negotiate a contract  with a union that has not gone through the NLRB election process.    One way is to make it ""prohibitively expensive"" for a company to continue  fighting efforts to negotiate a union contract after a majority of workers have  signed union authorization cards, Wynn says.    The union can use the traditional picket lines around a target company's stores  to encourage a consumer boycott. But more interesting is the newer tactic being  used by the UFCW and other unions.    They ask pro-union workers at a target non-union company to look for company  violations of anything from health and safety and minimum wage laws to  anti-discrimination and environmental protection laws.    When violations are found -- and Wynn says they usually are -- the union then  can use the evidence it has gathered to push government agencies for a  crackdown on the violators that often results in fines against the company and  more protection for workers and consumers.    That tactic could cost the target company more in fines and lost time than it  could expect to save by continuing to fight unionization.    The same tactic is being used in labor disputes at unionized companies, but its  effectiveness is still being tested.    Nevertheless, with their new strategies, unions are gaining members without  going through NLRB elections. And when they do go through the NLRB, they are  winning increasing numbers of the elections, although still not a majority of  them.    The self-criticism in which unions are engaging these days seems to be helping  them in a limited way, but much more innovative thinking is needed before they  can again become the powerful force that they once were in this country.

Even though some progress is being made, Kirkland contends that unions would  fare better under the ""law of the jungle"" -- that is, no law at all -- than the  time-consuming and costly legal roadblocks that they have been facing under the  National Labor Relations Act.    Few other union leaders go as far as Kirkland, and for all his radical  rhetoric, neither he nor any other officer of the 14-million-member labor  federation has officially asked Congress to repeal the law.    They should not. The law provides sensible general rules of conduct for both  labor and management, though changes are essential to make it work more  effectively, and it must be administered more even-handedly.    Unions often seem to put off major organizing campaigns in the vague hope of  electing state and federal legislators who might pass new laws to make the  campaigns easier to win, one union officer contends.    William H. Wynn, president of the 1.3-million-member United Food and Commercial  Workers Union, recommends forgetting that hope because it won't be realized in  the foreseeable future.    Wynn does not say, as Kirkland does, that unions would be better off without  the National Labor Relations Act, but he does suggest that, whenever possible,  unions should simply ignore the NLRB.    An increasing number of unions are doing just that. They are less frequently  asking the NLRB to conduct elections to determine if workers in a company want  to be represented by a union, a process that can be lengthy and expensive.    Instead, a union often tries to get workers to sign cards saying they want a  union, and if a majority of them sign up, the union goes directly to the  management and demands recognition, bypassing the NLRB entirely.    Wynn says the UFCW has organized about 100,000 members in each of the past two  years, and only 10% of those new members were won through NLRB-conducted  elections.    The union actually made a net gain of only 40,000 members, however, because it  lost thousands of others, mostly due to store closings that resulted from  corporate mergers, leveraged buyouts and consolidations.    There are several effective ways to persuade management to negotiate a contract  with a union that has not gone through the NLRB election process.    One way is to make it ""prohibitively expensive"" for a company to continue  fighting efforts to negotiate a union contract after a majority of workers have  signed union authorization cards, Wynn says.    The union can use the traditional picket lines around a target company's stores  to encourage a consumer boycott. But more interesting is the newer tactic being  used by the UFCW and other unions.    They ask pro-union workers at a target non-union company to look for company  violations of anything from health and safety and minimum wage laws to  anti-discrimination and environmental protection laws.    When violations are found -- and Wynn says they usually are -- the union then  can use the evidence it has gathered to push government agencies for a  crackdown on the violators that often results in fines against the company and  more protection for workers and consumers.    That tactic could cost the target company more in fines and lost time than it  could expect to save by continuing to fight unionization.    The same tactic is being used in labor disputes at unionized companies, but its  effectiveness is still being tested.    Nevertheless, with their new strategies, unions are gaining members without  going through NLRB elections. And when they do go through the NLRB, they are  winning increasing numbers of the elections, although still not a majority of  them.    The self-criticism in which unions are engaging these days seems to be helping  them in a limited way, but much more innovative thinking is needed before they  can again become the powerful force that they once were in this country.

The latest incident was the persecution of  the Greek minority leadership under serious charges, which may  even involve the death penalty.    A basic prerequisite for the improvement of Greek-Albanian  relations is the protection of the Greek minority's rights in  Albania. The rights of the minority, basic human rights, are  not being protected as, in many cases, the current [Albanian  President Sali] Berisha regime behaves as that of the former  president Enver Hoxha did.    It has been announced that the six Omonoia members, who were  recently arrested, will stand trial and face the most serious  charges under Hoxha's regime penal code, which provides for the  death sentence.    The goal is most obvious: The persecution of Omonoia's  leadership is aimed at terrorizing Greek Albanians and making  them continue their return to Greece.    The method of terrorization by persecuting leading members  of  the minority is well known, but Albania is supposedly moving  toward a democratic system.    Mere talk about democracy is not enough when a just state is  not being established in Albania, a state that will fully  respect human rights. With its actions, Tirana must show that  it is developing into a just state that abandons arbitrariness.    Yesterday, the Government spokesman said that the Greek  side,  in its efforts to improve Greek-Albanian relations, has as a top  priority ""respect for the rights of the Greek Albanians.""    Berisha's regime must evaluate Greece's friendly intentions,  but also realize that no Greek concessions can be made on this  issue. The Greek side must also make this clearer.    Bilateral relations cannot be improved or promoted by  provoking, persecuting, and terrorizing the Greek minority.     "

Commenting on last week's two-day round of talks between the  Lithuanian and Russian interstate teams in Vilnius, Brazauskas  described as ""too long"" the break before the latest meeting.    The Lithuanian president expressed satisfaction over the  results of the latest round of negotiations. The delegations  have started taking concrete steps to solve the issue of  compensation by Russia for the damage caused to Lithuania by the  Soviet Union since 1940, according to Brazauskas. The  Lithuanian Ministry of Economics has been obligated to form a  working group to figure out the damage and to foresee a legal  basis for claiming a compensation.    Progress in talks on the debt of the former Russian  Vnesheconom Bank to Lithuania ""also gives grounds for renewed  hope,"" Brazauskas said. A few years ago the Vnesheconom Bank  expropriated Lithuanian people's savings worth over 7 million  dollars and almost 150 million dollars belonging to Lithuanian  companies.    Speaking about unsettled problems, the Lithuanian president  mentioned the issue of Russian transit over Lithuanian  territory. Talks on the regulations for the transit of Russian  passengers and cargo, expected to be finalized by Lithuanian  negotiators soon, as well as on a visa regime for Russian  citizens are to resume in the near future, according to  Brazauskas.    ""Of course, a lot of problems remain in the fields of  energy,  fishing and environment. So in the future both our negotiators  and the Foreign Ministry will have enough work,"" said the  Lithuanian president.    Brazauskas reiterated Lithuania's position that the military  potential in the Kalinigrad enclave of Russia should be  decreased and the region should be demilitarized eventually. ""It  is an ideal area for the development of economic relations,""  said the Lithuanian president.     "

Mendiandua]    [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Relations between Cuba and  Mexico are diverse, exhibit mutual respect, and have a very  encouraging future in terms of joint ventures and  technical-scientific cooperation, Mexican Ambassador Carlos  Tello asserted here today.    The diplomat said he was optimistic about the future of  bilateral ties with Cuba after having assumed responsibility for  the Mexican mission in Havana in February.    Tello, who is an economist and a professor with a  comprehensive professional vitae, revealed he had already  attended several economic and technical-scientific cooperation  meetings in the few weeks he has been in Cuba.    Regarding reciprocal assistance, he said a mission from the  Mexican Science and Technology Council had recently visited Cuba  and signed an agreement with the State Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation Committee to increase  scientific ties.    According to this agreement, oceanographers, engineers, and  other specialists have agreed to carry out joint studies and to  help each other in specific projects.    Furthermore, the ambassador added, active exchanges between  the universities of the two countries are continuing and a  history seminar for specialists was held just a few days ago.    To give one example of developing relations in the field of  education, Tello noted that a group from the clinic school,  which travels to different parts of the world, recently visited  Cuba to exchange student experiences.    Asked about Mexico's response to Cuba's policy on opening to  foreign investments, Tello said this area is very promising, and  he revealed there are agreements to set up joint ventures to  produce cement and glass.    We are currently negotiating two very important agreements,  the ambassador stressed. One is a comprehensive agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other communications systems which could amount to more than $1  billion. [PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2023 GMT on 1 April  transmits a similar report prefaced with a parenthetical note  asking PRENSA LATINA offices to ""substitute"" the new article for  the one printed here. The new report is identical to the first,  with two changes. The first is a rewording of this paragraph so  that it reads: ""We are currently negotiating an agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other matters related to this field, the value of which could  exceed $1 billion, the ambassador said."" In addition, the  following paragraph has been deleted and the item continues with  paragraph 11.]    The other is the signing of a letter of intent between the  Cuban Government and Mexpetrol to refine approximately 60,000  barrels of crude oil at the Cienfuegos refinery, located in the  country's central region, as well as to manufacture byproducts  that will be sold in the domestic and international markets.    In terms of tourism -- an industry in which the Mexicans are  giving advice to the Cubans -- Mexico and Cuba have signed  agreements to operate hotels such as the Tuxpan, Granma, and the  Old Man and the Sea.    Likewise, Carlos Tello explained that Cuba provides medical,  biotechnology, and social security assistance to Mexico.    Also, both nations continue to exchange experiences,  expertise, and specialists in agriculture, fisheries, and sugar  production, which has resulted in mutual benefits.    The diplomat expressed regret over the current level of  trade, which totalled approximately $124 million in 1992, and he  indicated that there are obstacles, like Cuba's debt with Mexico  and the shortage of freely convertible currency.    The fall of Eastern Europe's socialist bloc was a hard blow  to the Cuban economy because 85 percent of the island's trade  was conducted with this region, a region from which it also  imported 90 percent of its crude oil.    Tello stressed that when these difficulties are overcome,  trade between the two countries will increase several times over.     "

Vice-chairman of the committee Taha Ahmad al-Dawud was  quoted  by a local daily as saying that the plan aims at urging the  world politicians and parliamentarians, and those of Britain and  the U.S. in particular to work for lifting the anti-Iraq  sanctions and holding the U.S. and Britain responsible for the  death of tens of thousands of Iraqis and the destruction of  Iraq's infrastructure.    The plan, moreover, will make it clear that the continuation  of the economic blockade runs counter to human rights and  Washington's and London's claims and boasts of being the ardent  advocates of human rights, said Mr. al-Dawud.    He went on to say that invitation will be sent to a number  of  world MPs to visit Iraq for dialoge and to get acquainted with  the negative consequences of the U.S.-allied aggression and the  continuation of the UN-imposed economic sanctions.    The committee's plan also aims at urging the world MPs to  exercise pressure on their governments towards lifting the  embargo.    Moreover, the National Assembly, through its Arab and  International Relations Committee will work for holding talks  with MPs of the Security Council member-states in addition to  exchanging letters with heads of the world parliaments on their  stands and Iraq's stand vis-a-vis UN Security Council  resolutions and allegations and claims aired by iraq's enemies  to divert the world's attention from the recent positive  development in the stands of a number of the UN Security Council  member-states and in a bid to manipulate the world public  opinion, Mr. al-Dawud concluded.

Hence the contracted project  business will give an impetus to the export of China-produced  equipment and materials. This will not only help increase the  country's foreign exchange earnings, but also will reduce  project construction costs substantially. In order to ensure  the smooth development of this type of business, some concrete  operational procedures and methods have been formulated, based  on practical experience gained over recent years, and a notice  is hereby served as follows:    1. Any company running an international economic and  technological cooperation project, as a contractor or  sub-contractor abroad, which needs to procure necessary  equipment, materials and supplies, as well as machinery and  tools from the home country, can lodge an application directly  to and go through export procedures as required with this  ministry. If the equipment and goods to be exported are subject  to export license control, the company is to apply to this  ministry for an export license, by presenting the project  contract it has signed with the foreign party.    2. The company applying for the export of  China-produced equipment and goods is to submit a photocopy of  the contract concerned, as well as the application form, in  duplicate, for the export of equipment and good with relation to  a contracted project (see Appendix 1), and two copies of the  detailed list of project- related equipment and goods that are  to be exported (see Appendix 2). Both the application form and  the detailed list must be printed on A4-sized paper, as  prescribed by the appendices.    3. The equipment and goods for the export of which an  international operation company has applied are to be used only  by the company itself to meet practical needs in the contracted  works, as declared, and they are never to be used for any other  purpose, nor are they to be resold. In order to prevent  overstocks, the equipment and goods needed to run a contracted  project can be exported in batches and stages so as to keep pace  with the progress of the project.

Brazauskas put accents on educational problems. He said that  meanwhile 127 Polish schools worked in Lithuania while at the  beginnning of the national revival there were only 92. Last  year there were 148 groups for Polish children in the pre-school  institutions.    1200 young people of Polish nationality study at the  institutions of higher education, 400 every year leave for  Poland to study. Brazauskas reminded that last year the Polish  language and literature department had been established at  Vilnius University. 40 students study at the department.    Six specialities can be studied in Polish language at  Vilnius  Pedagogical University. Polish is also studied at Kaunas and  Vilnius Seminaries.    Four Polish periodicals out of eight which circulate in  Lithuania receive the support from the state. Polish radio and  television are broadcasted in Lithuania.    At the beginning of the year 261.5 thousand people of Polish  nationality lived in Lithuania, which made seven percent of the  total population.    There are 35 thousand of Lithuanians in Poland. They have  several schools, a magazine and broadcast radio features from  Bialystok.    Brazauskas said he did not want to set one nation against  the  other, however, Lithuanians in Poland had more cultural  problems.

They also have attacked ARATS as  an ""obstacle"" to cross-strait relations because it did not allow  the SEF to send personnel to accompany the Taiwan victims'  family members to the site of the incident. The material  published by ARATS today clarifies the truth by presenting a  host of facts, thus fully and effectively refuting these  people's wanton distortions and wicked slanders.    As everyone knows, respecting and earnestly implementing  agreements reached between ARATS and the SEF is a precondition  and important basis for establishing mutual trust and  cooperation between these two organizations. In terms of the  two organizations' relations and cooperation, strict observance  and loyal implementation of the relevant agreements involve two  mutually related aspects: One is that both sides must do what  must be done according to the provisions of the relevant  agreements; the other is that neither side should overstep,  under any pretext, the provisions of the agreements or make  arbitrary demands that embarrass the other side. In handling  the aftermath of the ""Qiandaohu incident,"" ARATS strictly abided  by the relevant agreements, did a lot of work, and kept the  communications lines open. This reporter learned that at the  talks between Wang Daohan [ARATS chairman] and Koo Cheng-fu [SEF  board chairman] last year, they discussed how to handle the  problem of one side's personnel proceeding to the site of an  incident on the other side in case of emergency. As an incident  must be handled by the side on which it breaks out, no agreement  was reached at the talks on how one side should authorize a  delegation to proceed to the site of the incident. The SEF's  request to send personnel to accompany the victims' family  members to the site of the ""Qiandaohu incident"" obviously went  beyond the agreements between the two sides, so it is  understandable that ARATS did not agree with the request. What  is noteworthy is that some people in Taiwan made requests  contrary to the agreements, purposely damaged the solemnness of  the agreements, and took advantage of the incident to exaggerate  other issues. This constituted disrespect for the agreements  reached by ARATS and the SEF, and was aimed at instigating some  people who were not clear about the truth to oppose the mainland  and viciously attack ARATS. This fully portrayed their rudeness  and recklessness, and the fact that they had ulterior motives.  Compatriots on both sides of the strait must take precautions  against this.    ARATS and the SEF are authorized mass organizations that  undertake the heavy responsibility of promoting exchanges  between the two sides. Compatriots on both sides strongly hope  that the two organizations can sincerely cooperate in promoting  the two sides' relations. Some people's vicious attacks on  ARATS are not in the least advantageous to the two  organizations' cooperation, but will only cause serious harm to  this cooperation and to relations between the two sides of the  strait. Whether or not facts are honestly respected and the two  organizations' agreements are strictly observed are important  points determining whether cooperation can be smoothly carried  out between the two organizations. If some people in Taiwan  still regard the agreements as trifling matters and take  advantage of contingencies to force others to implement their  unilateral ideas, this will ruin the two organizations' mutual  trust and cooperation, instead of achieving good results. We  will wait and see whether these people will continue to create  obstacles to the two organizations' cooperation or will  cooperate with the mainland and do something practical for the  two sides' exchanges.

However,  the intellectual is further quoted as saying that ""the  difficulty is that some of them are influenced by extremists in  Athens."" There are many moderate Albanians who espouse these  views in private, Nathanail continues. At this time, the problem  of Greek Albanians is beginning to be of concern to both Europe  and the United States because it is one of the foci of crisis in  the Balkans, as demonstrated by the recent border incident in  which allegedly Greek masked gunmen raided an Albanian guard  post. While the Greek Government stresses its wish to improve  bilateral relations with Albania to improve the condition of  ethnic Greeks, the existence of extremist elements in both  countries can seriously undermine this effort at rapprochement,  Nathanail comments. Regardless of their ideological stance,  Albanian President Berisha and Prime Minister Mexi would like to  solve the country's economic problems with the assistance of  countries that do not have direct differences or common borders  with Albania. Given the Albanians' traditional suspicion that  Slavs and Greeks have territorial ambitions against them, they  believe that such assistance must necessarily come from other  large countries such as the United States first, followed by  Turkey and Italy, even at the cost of certain disadvantages,  Nathanail writes. As a result, he continues, Washington is  expanding its penetration of Albania, as is Turkey, since  two-thirds of the Albanian population are Muslims. Based on the  above, it is impossible to be optimistic for the immediate  future of Greek-Albanian relations, Nathanail writes, pointing  out that according to experts from the Greek Center of  International Studies, bilateral relations will worsen before  entering a far-off period of relaxation when Albania realizes  only Greece can save its economy. Until such time, he says, the  Greek minority must survive to be able to play its historical  role.     "
0,FT922-1318 ,"FT922-1318 _AN-CFWA9AEVFT 920623   FT  23 JUN 92 / Equal pay cases up by 200%   THE NUMBER of cases claiming equal pay for equal value being brought to industrial tribunals more than trebled last year compared with 1990, according to an analysis by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group. Much of the increase was accounted for by about 600 cases brought by domestic staff against four Northern Ireland health boards, claiming equal pay with porters. Overall, almost 90 per cent of the applications involved just six employers. The study found that the average wait for cases to be determined by tribunals is just less than 17 months, although cases can take much longer. Two cases settled last year, both without the need for a tribunal ruling, took almost four years and six years to resolve. Long waits reflect the complexity of the legislation. The Equal Opportunities Commission has argued that existing equal pay and sex discrimination legislation should be replaced by a single, more simple act. The principle of equal pay for equal value means that an individual can claim equal pay with someone of the opposite sex, even if they are in a different post in the organisation, if it can be argued that the work makes equal demands. There were 1,313 applications on those grounds last year - the most since 1987, the study found. Equal Opportunities Review No 44, July/August 1992.

He said: ""We do not consider this subject a rift. There is  understanding within the GCC and the GCC members are the closest  of people to each other.""    On a question related to the religious phenomenon in Kuwait,  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that it was an internal Kuwaiti  phenomenon unconnected with the phenomenon of international  religious terrorism or any external body.    He said: ""We accept this phenomenon since we consider it to  be an internal Kuwaiti phenomenon which does not believe in what  others do.""    On a question related to the State of Kuwait's stance on the  Palestinian cause, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that a  differentiation must be made between the Palestinian cause and  the Palestinian leadership, which has wronged Kuwait. He said  that throughout its history the State of Kuwait has been one of  the most supportive of the Palestinian cause and will continue  to support the Palestinian people, but not through the current  leadership.    He recalled that the State of Kuwait has granted $25 million  through international bodies to set up schools and hospitals in  Gaza and Jericho. He explained that only small groups of  Palestinians have been deported from Kuwait, and that those who  left Kuwait have done so at their own will.    In answer to a question related to Kuwait's stance on the  Arab boycott of Israel, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad stressed that  Kuwait abides by the Arab League resolutions related to the  first degree boycott of Israel. He said that after its  liberation from Iraq, Kuwait had been obliged to lift the second  and third degree boycott because of its pressing need for  companies which possess technology and expertise in those areas  destroyed by the Iraqi forces during their occupation of Kuwait.

""Under the capable leadership of President Berisha,  during the past two years Albania became a country with a  positive influence in the Balkans."" Regarding the possible  expansion of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said: ""I think  such a thing will not happen."" As regards the stand of Turkey in  case of a spillover of the conflict in Kosova, Mr. Demirel said  that ""we shall give our support for Kosova and Albania.""  Questioned about the Greek embargo against Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Mr. Demirel  said that it causes a definitive damage to the stability in the  Balkans.    According to the Turkish president, the creation of the  Moslem-Croatian federal state is a step towards peace, while he  described as meaningless the Serbian stand against the creation  of such a state.    With regard to the opposition by Greece, Bulgaria or some  other country to the dispatch of Turkish troops in Bosnia as  part of the UN peace-keeping forces, President Demirel pointed  out that ""it is quite difficult to understand the stand by our  neighbours. In fact we have not sent Turkish troops in the  Balkans. United Nations are asking for Turkish soldiers,  because there is a need there for soldiers to establish peace,  and Turkish soldiers will go there to defend peace. I do not  understand why does this matter become a subject of opposition,""  Mr. Demirel stressed.    In his interview, Mr. Demirel described as ""excellent"" the  level of Albanian-Turkish relations, adding that they will also  continue to be excellent in the future.

Experiments with the joint-stock system in foreign  economic and trade enterprises should be carried out under  leadership, by choice, and in a planned way. When carrying out  experiments with the joint-stock system, foreign economic and  trade enterprises should act in strict accordance with  provisions promulgated by the State Commission for Restructuring  Economy and other organs, including ""Provisions Governing  Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System,""  ""Suggestions on the Standards for Joint-Stock Limited  Companies,"" and ""Suggestions on the Standards for  Limited-Liability Companies."" Departments in charge of foreign  economic relations and trade at all levels should take pains to  organize and guide their own enterprises to experiment with the  joint-stock system and should refrain from rushing headlong into  mass action.    2. In order to strengthen leadership over experiments with  the joint-stock system in economic and trade enterprises, this  ministry has decided to set up a ""Leading Group for the  Experiments With the Joint-Stock System in Economic and Trade  Enterprises"" (for the names of group members, please see the  appendix). The primary tasks of the leading group are: 1) To  study and draw up principles and policies concerning economic  and trade enterprises' experiments with the joint-stock system;  2) To examine, discuss, and comment on applications and  feasibility studies submitted by enterprises directly under the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade (MOFERT) to be  reorganized into joint-stock enterprises; 3) To provide guidance  to local departments in charge of economic relations and trade,  and help them do a good job in experimenting with the  joint-stock system; 4) To study and draw up policies and  management methods for planning, quotas, permits, personnel, and  finance which suit the needs of economic and trade joint-stock  enterprises; and strengthen professional management over  economic and trade joint-stock enterprises; 5) To do a good job  in the propaganda, guidance, and explanations concerning  experiments with the joint-stock system in economic and trade  enterprises; and 6) To sum up and exchange experience gained by  economic and trade enterprises from experiments with the  joint-stock system, and bring about healthy development in the  economic and trade enterprises that experiment with the  joint-stock system.    Offices will be set up under the leading group.    3. Issues concerning foreign economic and trade enterprises  engaged in experiments with the joint-stock system -- such as  their necessary conditions, establishment formalities, and the  issuance of stock to the public -- should be dealt with  according to relevant stipulations, including the ""Provisions  Governing Enterprises' Experiments With the Joint-Stock System,""  ""Suggestions on the Standards of Joint-Stock Limited Companies,""  and ""Suggestions on the Standards of Limited Liability  Companies.""    4. When they are reorganized into joint-stock enterprises,  foreign trade and industrial-trade enterprises in all localities  and under different departments, as well as production  enterprises that have been granted autonomy in foreign-related  economic and trade operations, should subject their operational  scope to reexamination and reevaluation by the MOFERT, and go  through the necessary reorganization formalities in accordance  with relevant stipulations. When applying for autonomy in  foreign-related economic and trade operations, newly organized  joint-stock enterprises first should obtain the consent of the  MOFERT before going through examination and approval formalities  according to relevant stipulations.    Please submit any questions and opinions rising during the  implementation of this circulations promptly to the ""Office of  the Leading Group for Experiments of the Joint-Stock System in  Economic and Trade Enterprises"" under the MOFERT.

The respected director  general's letter does not indicate who invited this 13-man  delegation and what the objective behind this dialogue is. He  also does not clarify if the dialogue with the Iranian chief  editors is the only program or if something else has also been  planned. The choosing of the ETTELA'AT offices as the venue of  this meeting gives rise to the strong belief that the American  chief editors have been invited by ETTELA'AT Publications to  Iran! If this is so, then the question is: On what criterion  was this invitation based? And if there was no criterion, then  what is happening?    The letter from the director general for foreign mass media  affairs at the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance to the  Public Relations Department of KEYHAN Publications invites some  of the chief editors of KEYHAN Publications to attend a dialogue  with the American chief editors. Since the aspects of this  dialogue have not been clarified and the experience of the past  few years has clearly shown that the American mass media, namely  American publications, have continuously had a spiteful attitude  toward the Muslim people and the Islamic revolution, and since  the ugly and black record of the American mass media and  publications shows that they have always distorted facts and  disseminated false reports in order to poison public opinion  toward Islamic Iran and its people, none of the chief editors of  KEYHAN Publications will attend the meeting. The esteemed  Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance is asked to give more  explanations on why this invitation was extended and what the  objectives behind it are.     "

A majority of observers link -- quite reasonably  -- the cyclical growth of tension in this already unquiet corner  of the globe with Tehran's attempts to politicize religious  ceremonies for its own political and propaganda purposes.  [passage omitted]    We should not expect a lowering of the level of rivalry  caused by the two countries' desire to occupy the leading  position both in the region and throughout the Islamic world.    Tehran, which aspires to the role of the expresser of the  interests of all Muslims, will hardly resign itself to the fact  that Riyadh, the ""imperialists' accomplice,"" retains the title  of custodian of Islam's main holy places. The contradictions  between Tehran and Riyadh also concern a wide range of  international problems, including the Near East settlement.  Iran continues to deny the possibility of reaching agreement  with Israel and advocates its destruction.    Under these conditions Moscow's position with regard to  Tehran and Riyadh appears delicate, to put it mildly. On the  one hand, Saudi Arabia is one of the greatest states of the Arab  world, in which it objectively plays an increasingly weighty  role by virtue of its financial, economic, and geostrategic  potential and resources. True, cooperation between our  countries has not enjoyed the necessary development, and the  arms market is in the hands of Western companies -- above all,  U.S. ones -- and will most likely be entirely geared to them for  the next five to 10 years. On the other hand there is Iran,  which borders on the southern underbelly of the CIS and with  which traditional ties have long existed. In this situation  there is no alternative but, at best, to urge the sides not to  work toward something sinful, i.e. an altercation involving  weapons.     "

The State Committee for Land  Relations and Land Development has been ordered to make the  necessary adjustments in the base rates of the appraised sale  value of these rights on the basis of the data of the state  statistical service on the overall level of inflation.    Heads of local administrations, individuals, and legal  entities (excepting state agricultural enterprises) of the  republic may be sellers of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land, and citizens of the  republic may be buyers.    A right of heritable life possession of land is purchased  pursuant to Article 48, paragraph 3, of the republic Land Code  and point 5 of the president's 24 January 1994 decree ""On  Certain Aspects of Regulating Land Relations."" Legal entities of  the republic (excepting state agricultural enterprises) may also  purchase the right to use or lease a plot of land.    Foreign legal entities and individuals are granted plots of  land for temporary use on a lease basis pursuant to the  regulation on the procedure for granting the use of land to  joint ventures, international associations and organizations,  and foreign legal entities and individuals, to perform an  activity on the territory of the republic, as set forth in the  Supreme Soviet decree dated 3 July 1992.    Citizens of the republic are granted without compensation  the  right of heritable life possession of land to operate a peasant  farm or private farm, for market gardening, and for construction  of a private dwelling or dacha within the limits of the quota  established for the respective use, and the right of heritable  life possession of land in excess of those quotas may be  purchased from the head of the local administration.    Local representative and executive bodies fix the size of  plots of land to which individuals may be granted the right of  heritable life possession for these purposes without  compensation.    Individuals who, when the president's 5 April 1994 decree  ""On  Further Improvement of Land Relations"" took effect held plots of  land whose size exceeds that quota retain in all cases the right  of heritable life possession of the portion of the plot of land  that exceeds that quota.    Individuals who previously acquired heritable life  possession  of plots of land to operate a peasant or private farm, for  market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or  dacha may sell to other individuals and legal entities of the  republic their right of possession of plots whose size does not  exceed the established quota.    In cases when the total area of plots of land exceeds that  quota, before conducting a sales transaction individuals must  buy from the head of the local administration the right of  possession of the portion of the plot that exceeds the  established quota.    Individuals granted land to operate a private farm, for  market gardening, or for construction of a private dwelling or  dacha may sell the right of heritable life possession of a  portion of the plot. Use of that portion of the plot must  conform to current legislation.    Individuals and legal entities of the republic who have been  granted use of plots of land or have leased them for  nonagricultural purposes (except for the purposes of  construction of a private dwelling or dacha) may sell that right  to individuals and legal entities of the republic only when they  have purchased that right from the head of the local  administration.    On acquiring the right of ownership to immovable property,  including unfinished construction projects, the individual or  legal entity acquires at the same time, by virtue of the  purchase, the right of possession, use, or lease of the plot of  land on which the property acquired is located. In case of  privatization of immovable nonagricultural property, including  unfinished construction projects, the individual or legal entity  at the same time acquires the right of use or lease of the plot  of land on which the property acquired is located, pursuant to  the procedure established in a decree of the Cabinet of  Ministers dated 9 March 1994.    To conduct a sales transaction, the seller files with the  regional agency of the State Committee for Land Relations and  Land Development a statement of intent to sell his right to the  plot of land and the buyer a statement of his intent to buy that  right.    The regional agency of the State Committee for Land  Relations  and Land Development verifies that the landowner or land user  has documents certifying the right to use the plot of land,  measures more precisely the actual boundaries and area of the  plot of land, and also defines the terms of sale of the right  and its value. In cases of a discrepancy between the actual size  and boundaries of the plot and those indicated in documents, the  remeasurement data are duly submitted for consideration and  approval of the head of the local administration.    The costs related to determining the value and terms of sale  of the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of  plots of land shall be paid by the purchaser at the current unit  rates for the jobs performed, payable to the special budget  account of the regional agency of the State Committee for Land  Relations and Land Development which did the appraisal of these  rights.    The transaction of the sale of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of a plot of land between the seller  and buyer takes the form of a sales contract. The map (sketch)  of that plot is appended to the contract.    The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease passes  from the seller to the buyer when the regional agency of the  State Committee for Land Relations and Land Development  registers the notarized sales contract.    Transactions involving the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land may be conducted  provided there are no land disputes concerning the plots and no  other impediments to conclusion of the transaction established  by legislation.    Suits to invalidate the sale of the right of heritable life  possession, use, or lease of plots of land are taken up in the  courts.    When the right of heritable life possession, use, or lease  of  plots of land is sold, taxation and collection of the state duty  are governed by republic legislation.    The notarized sales contract is the basis on which the buyer  prepares and duly files the document certifying the right of  heritable life possession, use, or lease of the plot of land.    The purpose for which the plot of land is to be used may not  be altered without consent of the head of the local  administration. The document issued previously to the seller  certifying his right to the plot of land is terminated. The  decree has determined the appraised value of the right of  heritable life possession of a plot of land for operating a  peasant farm.    Plots located on land dedicated to agriculture in the steppe  and arid-steppe zones in the plains will cost from 28 to 11,100  tenge per hectare, depending on the soil quality rating.    Plots located on farmland in the semidesert, desert, and  foothill-desert areas are valued between 28 and 2800 tenge per  hectare, depending on the soil quality rating.    The appraised value of the right of heritable life  possession  of plots granted for operating a private farm, for construction  of a private dwelling or dacha, or for market gardening,  including land occupied by structures, is fixed at 300 tenge per  0.01 hectares.    The appraised value of the right of heritable life  possession  of plots of land located within city limits or a zone subject to  special urban planning regulation is multiplied by a factor of  1.2 in cities with a population from 100,00 to 250,000; 1.4 when  the population is between 251,000 and 500,000; 1.6 when the  population is between 501,000 and one million; and 2 when the  population exceeds one million.    Regional agencies of the State Committee for Land Relations  and Land Development have the right to double or reduce by half  the appraised value of the right of heritable life possession,  use, or lease of a plot of land depending upon its location, the  level of building-service equipment, and the level of public  amenities of the area, development of the sector of cultural and  everyday services to the public, the level of public health and  hygiene, and other factors.    The appraised value of the right of use or lease of a plot  of  land is determined in accordance with the procedure whereby an  individual or legal entity acquires the right of use or lease of  the plot of land when immovable property for nonagricultural  purposes is privatized, as set forth in the decree of the  Cabinet of Ministers dated 9 March 1994.    Proceeds which heads of local administrations realize from  the sale of the right of heritable life possession, use, or  lease of a plot of land shall be credited to the republic budget.    Individuals and legal entities transferring the right of  heritable life possession, use, or lease of plots of land as  their contribution to authorized capital of joint stock  companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with  foreign participation, relinquish those rights unless the  charters of those organizations stipulate otherwise.    The right of heritable life possession, use, or lease of  plots of land is reassigned to the aforementioned joint-stock  companies, partnerships, or cooperatives, including those with  foreign participation, according to established procedure.    The donation or mortgaging of the right of heritable life  possession of land by individuals and the mortgaging of the  right to use land by legal entities shall conform to the  procedure established by the republics's Civil Code and Land  Code, and by the Law on Mortgages.

Lippold: ""Taiwan Hoping for German  Activity""]    [Text] Berlin/Taipei -- In view of Germany's restrictive  arms export law, Taiwan has given up hope of a business deal in  the field of maritime arms technology that would be lucrative  for both sides. Taiwan will now build the needed warships  itself. On Monday [28 March], the second of eight frigates  carrying missiles of the Hsiung Geng-II type was put into  service.    Nevertheless, Taiwan wants to improve bilateral relations,  especially trade relations -- in spite of the Federal  Government's pro-Beijing policy. They feel encouraged in this  view by the fact that with the current German ambassador to Sri  Lanka and Bangladesh, Claus Franke, a diplomat will become the  new head of the German trade mission in Taipei. Posting the  62-year-old does not, however, mean that -- as has been reported  in Taiwan -- this office ""has for the first time been given to  an official representative of the Foreign Ministry."" NEUE ZEIT  has been told by the Foreign Ministry in Bonn that Franke will  be given leave to take on his future work for the Federation of  German Chambers of Industry and Commerce [DIHT], which runs the  Taipei office.    But even without upgrading the German representation, April  might take a special place in the history of German-Taiwanese  relations. First, Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt wants to  visit the republic before going to mainland China, and second, a  partnership agreement is to be signed by the districts of  Greifswald (Mecklenburg) and Nantou (Central Taiwan) in the  second week of April.    Closer Cooperation Between Local Authorities    The agreement, which is to be signed by Councillors Herbert  Kautz and Yuang-Lang Lin, is the second such agreement between  districts in the Republic of China and the new laender. In the  summer of 1993, Annaberg (Saxony) and Kaohsiung agreed on  cooperation. The visit to Halle in mid-April of Po-Rung Lin,  the mayor of Taichung, might bring about another agreement.  Several important representatives of industry are expected to  accompany the head of the third largest community in Taiwan.     "
0,FT934-8609 ,"FT934-8609 _AN-DKOCBABFFT 931115   FT  15 NOV 93 / Graduate recruitment rise forecast      By JOHN AUTHERS   EMPLOYERS PLAN to increase graduate recruitment next year following a 20-year high in graduate unemployment this year, a report published by Indus-trial Relations Services says today. The sharp increase in the number of graduates caused by the recent expansion in the number of university places means, however, that the rate of graduate unemployment could still increase. There is also evidence that employers are raising their entry standards to cope with the higher number of separate applications which each student is making. The 190 employers surveyed by the independent pay and conditions group are planning to expand their intakes of new graduates by 6.5 per cent next year. The number of graduates should increase by about 12 per cent. High levels of demand are expected to peg the average starting salary to Pounds 13,463, a rise of only 2.4 per cent since last year. Changes in recruitment methods - either by raising entry standards or by restricting advertisements for vacancies - are being implemented by 42.3 per cent of employers to handle increased demand. Employers are also alarmed by plans mooted by university vice-chancellors to ask graduates to pay towards the costs of their tuition after their graduation through a higher tax. Employers have already noted that fewer students are taking time out before looking for a job because levels of indebtedness are rising. They feel that a form of graduate tax will have administrative consequences for them - and also lead to pressure for higher starting salaries as graduates would face a cut in their net pay. Eight in 10 oppose the idea. 'New' universities, which were polytechnics or colleges of higher education until last year, appear already to have gained broad acceptance from employers.

Following the lead set by President of Kalmykia Ilyumzhinov, the  President of Chuvashia, Nikolay Fedorov, also joined in this  competition. His edict, ""On Supplemental Measures for Regulating  Economic Relations of the Chuvash Republic,"" was officially sent  out yesterday.    [Begin boxed material]    Main innovations in Chuvash taxes    A three-year tax moratorium for new producer enterprises,  except those which have been reorganized; Reduction of the tax  on bank profits to 10 percent; A tax (10-50 percent) on wages  exceeding the minimum wage; A 20 percent fine for cash  accounting.    [End boxed material]    Since it is difficult to think of anything principally new  in  tax benefits, Nikolay Fedorov is resorting to a rather  traditional measure--a three-year tax moratorium granted to all  firms registered after 1 May which operate in the production  sphere. This moratorium does not extend to banks and insurance  companies instituted after 1 May. However, the present  30-percent rate of republic tax on profits is reduced to 10  percent. In the opinion of the developers of this edict, such  benefits are expected to attract investments to the republic's  economy and to stimulate development of the financial  infrastructure (in Chuvashia today there are only 10 commercial  banks, with a total charter capital of 6.2 billion rubles (R)).    Then again, the edict also introduces a number of rather  original limitational measures. Thus, enterprises and  organizations which direct a large portion of their earned  capital toward wages will suffer from the new republic tax,  which will be collected on the sum by which the expenditures for  paying the labor wage of one worker exceeds the minimum wage  level. The rate of this tax will comprise from 10 to 50 percent.  This innovation, according to the intent of its authors, should  act upon the banks, monopoly enterprises in agricultural  processing and other structures where the level of the average  wage sharply exceeds the minimum.    The repeal of benefits on the profits tax for firms which  make their investments outside the limits of the republic is  aimed at facilitating the creation of the republic's own  production base. (Today approximately 40 percent of the builders  of Chuvashia work on the side). Moreover, those enterprises  which try to receive payment for products sold and to spend it,  by-passing the enterprise accounting report, will be subject to  a fine in the amount of 20 percent of the sum received in cash.    The reaction to the edict in the republic was mixed.    In the opinion of Chuvashia's Minister of Economics Igor  Mironov, the announced three-year tax moratorium makes it  possible to expect the rapid growth of economic activity and the  influx of investments already in the nearest future. In his  conversation with our KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Mironov  categorically rejected the supposition that the innovations  would impose a hardship upon the the city and rayon budgets,  which would suddenly lose part of their tax revenues. First of  all, he announced, the edict speaks of enterprises and  organizations which will only now be created. Secondly, the  republic leadership, which is responsible for its actions, is  ready to compensate these losses in the future at the expense of  the republic budget.    Then again, such optimism regarding the attraction of  investments is certainly not indisputable. It is notable that  the namesake of the Chuvash president, the former minister of  finance and currently deputy, Boris Fedorov, quite recently  rejected the affirmations of his involvement in the development  of Chuvashia's economic policy.    The head of the Union of Goods Producers of Chuvashia,  Vladimir Barsukov, expressed his puzzlement at the fact that the  tax benefits introduced by the edict will in no way affect  enterprises which are already in operation. Moreover, he  announced that the punishment for accounting in cash under  conditions of non-payments and the market crisis is ineffective,  and will simply force the enterprises to seek ways around it.

Talking to PRENSA LATINA at the conclusion of the first day  of his official visit to Colombia, which followed his stay in  Brazil and Venezuela, Lage said the general balance of his  visits is positive.    Relations are at a high point in these three countries, and  we have found great receptivity in those governments, great  interest in joint ventures, and many opportunities for  cooperation and economic development, Lage affirmed. Lage said  he felt that the most important aspect of his long afternoon  meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was the frankness  of the in-depth analysis of bilateral relations and problems  between Colombia and Cuba. He indicated that Cuba's ties with  Colombia have made important and significant advances since  Presidents Gaviria and Fidel Castro met last August in  Cartagena. Lage disclosed that he and his host discussed  prospects for strengthening relations, Cuba's opening to foreign  capital, and possibilities for having Colombian businessmen  participate in that process.    He also brought up the subject of furthering commercial  relations through an increase of Cuba's direct purchases of  Colombian oil and exports of Cuban medicines to Colombia.    The Cuban leader felt that as the exchange increases, his  country may find solutions to resolving its debts with Colombia,  which will in turn pave the way for increasing commercial  relations.    Lage indicated that he analyzed specific cooperation in each  sector with the ministers of foreign commerce and agriculture  and livestock and with the planning chief. He will continue  such discussions with the public health, mines and energy, and  economic development ministers and with the management of Banco  de la Republic and the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise.    The Cuban official begins today's schedule with a meeting  with the top leaders of Colombia's major business groups. He  will conclude his visit in the afternoon.     "

The U.S. President was on hand to  welcome his majesty on his arrival at the White House.    The U.S. President emphasized his country's support for  Jordan.    [Begin recording] [Hammad] [words indistinct]  Jordan's [word indistinct] peace in the Middle East, and  [word indistinct] people back home [words indistinct] in this  regard, and what are (?the words) you would have for the  Jordanian people?    [Clinton] The United States is prepared to do a lot to  try to make peace a success, both from the security point of  view and from an economic point of view. My message to the  Jordanian people is that they should support the work the king  is doing now. He is clearly working to protect the long-term  interests of the people of Jordan and is being very careful and  forthright and still courageous in this peace process. And that  the United States will support the friends of peace not just in  the aftermath of the peace agreement, if one can be achieved,  but over the very long run. We believe that our interests are  very much bound up with the success of Jordan and Israel and  Syria and Lebanon and all the other parties in the Middle East.  We think it's a very important part of our future. And we  intend to be there in a very strong way.    [Hammad] Does that include also helping Jordan  (?economically?)    [Clinton] Absolutely. [end recording]    The Jordanian and American sides began an expanded session  attended on the Jordanian side by the prime minister; the Royal  Court chief; his majesty's political adviser; Prince Talal Bin-  Muhammad, his majesty the king's military secretary; and the  Jordanian ambassador in Washington. There will be a closed  session between his majesty the king and the U.S. President and  a special luncheon attended by his majesty the king and Her  Majesty Queen Nur and Bill Clinton and the first lady, Hillary  Rodham Clinton.    Yesterday, the king visited the U.S. Congress where he  conferred with House Speaker Thomas Foley and then the chairman  and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee. The  meeting was held at the committee's initiative for an update on  Middle East developments, and the peace process in particular.  His majesty the king said Jordan approached the Jordanian track  from the perspective of the implementation of the joint agenda,  Jordan's sovereignty and Arab coordination. Jordan, his majesty  added, will not initiate a separate solution and that, in that  regard, other Arab parties had gone ahead of Jordan. His majesty  said that how fast Jordan reaches a settlement with Israel  largely depends on Israel's accommodation of the requirements of  peace.    Asked about lifting the boycott of Israel, his majesty said  that depends primarily on the Israeli position on banning  Jordanian goods bound for Palestinian territory and whether  Israel will reconsider its protectionist posture on trade.    Jordan will extend what support it can for the Palestinian  brothers to enable them to administer the self-rule areas on a  case-by-case basis and whenever the Palestinians request  assistance as needs arise.    Asked about fundamentalist movements that raise anti-Western  slogans, his majesty said extremism was not exclusive to Islam  and that extremism feeds on extremism. His majesty asserted  that Islam is a religion of moderation and that he was proud to  be a Muslim.    The House Foreign Relations Committee showed understanding  for the problems Jordan is facing. Committee members said they  will support Jordan due its positive approach to the peace  process and the democratic climate prevailing in the country.  They also displayed understanding of Jordan's requirements for  development and defense. The representatives applauded Jordan's  experiment and hoped it would serve as a model for the region.    Later this evening, his majesty will conclude a three-day  official visit to the United States by meeting with the chairman  and members of the House Foreign Relations Committee.     "

Papoulias warned Tirana that Athens  could stop the attacks against the Greek minority and described  as unacceptable the position adopted by some U.S. officials that  there is insufficient evidence of the violation of the Greek  minority's rights.    The foreign minister did not rule out that [Albanian  President] Sali Berisha is supported by circles outside Albania.  He also expressed concern over, but called for calm regarding,  the recent Turkish provocations in Istanbul. Mr. Papoulias  announced an initiative by the European Union [EU] at the troika  level in the case of Albania and pointed out that Greece has  lodged representations at all the international forums. He said  that he has sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  on the latest Albanian provocations.    Mr. Papoulias stressed that we are carefully guarding our  borders and linked the problem to the economic support we render  Tirana by tolerating the 400,000 illegal immigrants. He did not  rule out that the Greek Government, using legal measures, might  stop accepting illegal immigrants from Albania and increase the  policing of the borders.    Greece's moderate stance should not be interpreted as  weakness or retreat. We are moderate, but certain issues are  not raised for negotiation, they are self-evident, such as the  rights of the Greek Albanians. This statement was made by  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos when asked about the  government's view of the latest developments in Greek-Albanian  relations. Mr. Venizelos stressed that representations are  continuing. He said that if Albanian provocations do not stop,  our country is ready to adopt measures to guard the borders;  these measures involve using police and customs guards, not the  military.    Asked if the government intends to expel Albanian illegal  immigrants following recent developments, the government  spokesman stressed: The Greek Government would not hold illegal  immigrants hostage to exercise its foreign policy because it is  a country of justice. However, it is determined to exhaust all  legal means.     "

Our Bratislava correspondent Ildiko Nagy reports:    [Nagy] Slovak Radio intends to set a precedent with the  roundtable discussions that got under way today and where the  participants are always invited journalists and a prominent  personality. The guest on the first occasion was President of  the Republic Michal Kovac, who replied to questions concerning  Slovak domestic and foreign policies.    In answer to the Hungarian radio correspondent's question of  what he would consider to be good relations with the new  Hungarian state leadership, the Slovak president stated: On the  basis of the statements heard so far, the future Hungarian  Government will no doubt handle the nationality issue more  realistically; many signs indicate that a solution can also be  found to the matter of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water barrage,  which burdens ties. He said he personally will strive to do  everything in the interest of improving the two countries'  relations because he knows how much other countries are watching  this region and how much they want the Central European  countries to become stabilizing factors. It is his conviction  that the Hungarian side also sees it this way, said the Slovak  president.    In answer to the question of the NEPSZABADSAG [Hungarian  Socialist paper] correspondent of whether he would not like to  open, jointly with Arpad Goencz, the border-crossing points that  are in readiness, Michal Kovac replied that this had been  planned earlier, with the intention of its being a gesture and  of dissolving the tensions that existed at the time. Because at  present it seems that, thanks to both sides, relations are  becoming normal, the continuous settling of issues will be the  task of the two governments and the individual ministries.    The presidential meeting could be the culmination of this,  opined the head of Slovakia, who, on 21 June, when he accepts in  New York the award for fostering good relations between  neighbors, will meet Arpad Goencz, the other recipient of the  award. Here the interstate agreement will also come up for  discussion, opined Michal Kovac, who said he would be happy to  come to Budapest to sign it.     "

Zlatko Kuretic reports:    [Kuretic] [passage omitted] After introductory speeches by  the host and Franjo Greguric, the president of the Croatian Fire  Brigade Association, the rally was addressed by President Franjo  Tudjman. He expressed gratitude to the Croatian firemen for  their contribution in the patriotic war. Speaking about the  firemen's parade in Varazdin, he also said:    [Begin Tudjman recording] This parade speaks about the unity  of all parts of Croatia, of all Croatian counties, about the  unity that we must nurture in all areas because we have  established a single, independent, sovereign, and  internationally recognized Croatian state. There are still  people in the world who cannot reconcile themselves to this  fact. Our Croatia has become, however, not just internationally  recognized, but our sovereign and independent Croatia also has  powerful allies and friends, including, in the first place, the  United States, the most powerful world superpower in one part of  the world, and also our friend China, another world power, in  the other part of the world.    We have good relations with the European Union and friendly  relations with most of the European and other countries in the  world. Croatia's international status is such that we can  devote ourselves to carrying out other tasks before us: the  liberation of the occupied parts of Croatian and the development  of the federation and the confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  From then on, we can devote ourselves in peace to economic and  cultural development and to the tasks our government is faced  with.    In both the economic and political fields, we have achieved  not just surprising results, but a miracle that the world is  admiring. We have curbed inflation. We have created conditions  for the introduction of a new Croatian currency that will be  stable because our efforts and our sweat and blood are in our  hands and will no longer go to foreign capitals. All our sweat  and blood will be in the interests of Croatian men, Croatian  people, and the Croatian state. [end recording] [passage  omitted]     "

He addressed a  session of the NATO Council devoted to the adoption of documents  regulating relations between Russia and the North Atlantic  alliance.    Kozyrev pointed out that the preparation of a programme of  broad cooperation between NATO and Russia has begun on the basis  of proposals earlier submitted by Russia. A special protocol  says that this will be a programme, meeting the dimensions and  significance of Russia's potential. ""An agreement has been  reached on a broad, deep dialogue and cooperation in areas where  Russia is capable of making a unique and important contribution  which conforms to Russia's prestige and responsibility as the  biggest European, world and nuclear state,"" Kozyrev said.    Accepting NATO's proposals, Russia is officially joining the  Partnership for Peace initiative. Taking part in its  realisation as equal partners are both states which were  adversaries in the period of cold war, or neutral countries  balancing between the two blocs. Such broad participation  creates prerequisites for further evolution of the European  situation in the direction of strengthening mutual understanding  and ensuring an equal level of security for all countries. For  all its importance, ""the Partnership for Peace"" is only one  direction for establishing military-political interaction,  Kozyrev said.    Another direction includes activities along the lines of the  Council for North Atlantic Cooperation (NACC), whose potential,  in Russia's opinion, should be more actively used, in  particular, in its peace-keeping activities.    The third direction is the development of a system of  bilateral contacts between Russia, NATO and NACC, which will  include peace- keeping activities, joint maneuvers, cooperation  in conversion. These directions ""fit the framework of the common  choice in favour of cooperation and the formation of a really  single space of security from Vancouver to Vladivostok,"" Kozyrev  said. In conclusion, the Russian foreign minister pointed out  that all efforts should pursue a priority goal -- the creation  of single Europe. ""The key role on the continent is being played  and will be played by the Conference on Security and Cooperation  in Europe (CSCE). This is where Russia's opinion and the  alliance' assessments coincide,"" Kozyrev said.     "

As a result of the undiplomatic remarks made by the  French ambassador to Bonn, this time it was different: One  expected a clarifying word on the alleged or real clouding of  bilateral relations. In the statements immediately after the  incident mutual relations were hastily hailed; however, such  solemn declarations have become hackneyed over the decades.    Thus it was good that Kinkel was able to come up with  something practical in Paris: the idea of presenting a kind of  joint government program for the period that the two countries  hold the presidency of the European Union [EU] -- Germany in the  second half of 1994, France in the first half of 1995. This is  a lofty word for the cumbersome task of mediating, which one has  to fulfill as EU president. Moreover, it is domestic policy  that will play the main role in the two countries during this  time: in Germany because of the Bundestag elections in October,  in France because of the presidential elections in spring 1995.  It is, therefore, uncertain whether good resolutions can  translate into noteworthy action. Still, it is some progress  that an attempt will be made to break out of the shortness of  breath of the six-month rhythm in the EU.    In Paris, Kinkel spoke of a ""joint vision for the future of  the Union."" This is exactly what is lacking. In Germany the  idea is fading that Europe could be unified on the basis of  federal states; with the formulation ""enlargement and  simultaneous deepening,"" Bonn is asking for something like the  squaring of a circle. In France, large parts of the political  class are convinced that German unification has altered the  foundation of the policy of integration -- which is why  Ambassador Scheer only expressed a truism. Views in Paris,  however, differ as to what conclusions should be drawn from it.  Franco-German talks have for a long time been dominated either  by day-to-day political business, or they have degenerated to  noncommittal phrases. It is high time Bonn and Paris compared  what each side means when they speak of ""Europe."" The councils  and bodies where this can be discussed have existed for a long  time. All that is needed is to use them.     "

[Abu-Zayidah] The Israelis attribute terror attacks, car  bombs, and stabbings to Hamas and think that all its members are  the same. However, the truth is that not everybody in Hamas  thinks the same way or has the same logic and views about the  near future. There are many moderate people among them, who  believe in a modus vivendi with the Palestinian rule, similar to  that of the Islamic movements in the Arab countries, such as  Jordan. These people have got nothing to do with terror  attacks, but they represent Hamas.    [Klein] Nevertheless, how will you prevent Hamas from  setting  out on attacks from the Gaza Strip and Jericho?    [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian side will not allow car bombs  or any other attacks to set out from the Gaza Strip. Both  sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, will try to prevent it.    [Klein] Has Hamas given you any indication that it wants to  take part in the process? Palestinian sources claim that Fatah  and Hamas men met on Monday in an apartment in Gaza and that  they secretly decided to integrate Hamas in the Palestinian  police force, which will also include 2,000 inhabitants of the  territories.    [Abu-Zayidah] They want to take part in it. They do not  reject it. However, their integration in the Palestinian police  force has both its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage  is that the police force would be representing everybody and not  just Fatah. The disadvantage is that they might use their jobs  to smuggle weapons and pass on information against the  Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip.    [Klein] How much support do you think Fatah could muster in  the territories?    [Abu-Zayidah] It is all a matter of economic success; of  getting a democratic Palestinian rule established and of  successfully solving economic problems. Fatah may very well  enjoy the support of 90 percent of the population if it  succeeds, and of 30 percent if it fails.

The visits of British statesmen to our republic have  become more frequent. How do you evaluate Britain's position in  the solution of questions of vital importance to Azerbaijan?    [Akhundov] I would note Britain's objectivity both in  respect  to the events in our region and during discussion of all the  first three resolutions in the UN Security Council. The draft of  the latest, fourth, resolution, which Britain is at this moment  correcting, was submitted for Security Council discussion  recently. It differs from Resolution No. 874, with whose content  Azerbaijan has in principle remained dissatisfied and which it  has regarded as a retreat from the provisions of the preceding  Resolutions 822 and 853.    [Correspondent] You mean that Britain is preparing a draft  new resolution?    [Akhundov] Britain is a member of the UN Security Council.  Usually each country on the Security Council makes its  corrections and submits its observations and revisions during  the elaboration of official documents. At the present time the  draft new resolution is being studied at the British Foreign  Ministry.    [Correspondent] May it be maintained that all these visits,  meetings, and talks will somehow influence the opinion of the  world community, help Azerbaijan find new supporters, and  produce specific results?    [Akhundov] The first British parliamentary delegation came  to  Azerbaijan this April. It consisted of representatives of the  Conservative and Labor parties. It was followed on a visit to  our republic by Dr. Clark, representative of the Labor Party and  shadow defense secretary. And, finally, this month--the latest  visit of representatives of the British parliament. The result  of all these contacts was the joint decision to form a special  group in the British parliament for liaison with the parliament  of Azerbaijan and our republic as a whole. This group will  register with the Interparliamentary Union, which may be seen as  a positive factor in Azerbaijan's favor.    [Correspondent] How are relations with the parliaments of  other countries shaping up?    [Akhundov] There are no further such examples of cooperation  as yet, unfortunately. Relations have been established with  neighboring Turkey, but they have not been seen through to the  end. It is very important today that at this difficult, dramatic  time for Azerbaijan foreign countries and the public obtain  objective information and learn the truth. I believe it to be of  considerable importance that Britain itself and the British  parliament are commenting objectively on the events taking place  here. Interparliamentary contacts--a guarantee of the  development of further cooperation between our states--are  taking shape. I have to mention Mr. James Spicer--a sponsor of  the creation of the interparliamentary group. He is the head in  Britain of the Westminster Democracy Foundation, which,  obviously, will perform an important role in relations between  our states. We outlined in the negotiations the first specific  steps, and Mr. Spicer proposed the formation of a group of 10-15  young politicians which would in the future visit Britain. It is  contemplated that the Azerbaijani politicians will meet with  politicians of Britain, visit the British parliament, and  acquire visual lessons in parliamentarianism and democracy. In  addition, we believe that the foundation will associate itself  actively with the implementation of cultural activities.    [Correspondent] In other words, the foundations of further  mutual relations between Azerbaijan and Britain, between the  parliaments of the two countries, are being laid today, now?    [Akhundov] Yes, and this is in itself a very good beginning.  It implants hope of the possibility of cooperation and the  establishment of stable relations with the parliaments of other  states of Europe and Asia and neighboring Iran and Turkey. I  believe that Azerbaijan could find political partners in the Far  East also.    [Correspondent] I would like to hope that this cooperation  will not be of an episodic nature but will become a system and a  direction of the parliament of Azerbaijan's overseas activity.    [Akhundov] We will aspire to constant interaction with all  parliaments of the world. Relations based on cooperation, mutual  trust, and friendship have stood the test of time and given a  good account of themselves and serve only the interests of peace  and stability.    [Correspondent] Than you for the interview.     "

Huang Li, a law professor at Taiwan National Chengchi  University, who has been involved in drafting the ""Regulations  on Taiwan Relations with Hong Kong and Macao,"" believes that  though the Hong Kong Legislative Council yesterday passed the  partial political reform package tabled by Hong Kong Governor  Chris Patten, Hong Kong's basic political setup will not undergo  great changes when it returns to Beijing rule. Unless Beijing  plans to recover sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of schedule,  the passage of the partial bill will not produce too great an  impact on the Taiwan-Hong Kong relationship, he said. However,  he maintained that the Chinese side is unlikely to recover  sovereignty over Hong Kong ahead of time.    Yeh Ming-te, a researcher at Taiwan National Chengchi  University International Relations Research Center, said that  the dispute between China and Britain does not mean Hong Kong  will be in a precarious state and the principle of ""one country,  two systems"" will go down the drain. Beijing will not give in  on political matters and political principles because this is  where the essentials of ""one country"" lie, he said, adding that  on economic matters, including the mode of production, it will  adopt a flexible attitude to give expression to the ""two  systems.""    Commenting on the possible change in Hong Kong and on the  establishment of new ""Taiwan-Hong Kong relations"" after 1997,  Yeh maintained that Chinese in Taiwan should expand their  cooperation and exchanges with Hong Kong in social and economic  fields with the purpose of deriving Hong Kong's experience in  ""internationalizing management"" and bringing benefit to the  Chinese nation.    According to Wu Hsin-hsing, an associate professor at  National Cheng Kung University Political and Economic Research  Institute and a member of the Mainland Committee Consultative  Committee, the strained Sino-British relations will have direct  and indirect influences on the following: The negotiations on  the renewal of the agreement on navigation rights between Hong  Kong and Taiwan, which expires in 1995, because Taiwan may not  be able to find its counterpart for entering into the  negotiations at that time; over 3,000 Taiwan companies which are  registered in Hong Kong but do business on the mainland; the  entrepot trade between Taiwan and the mainland via Hong Kong;  and Taiwan's economy, because Hong Kong and Taiwan have  established close economic and trade relations and Hong Kong  businessmen have invested heavily in Taiwan's stock market. Wu  said that how great the impact will be remains to be seen.    Chen Fei-lung, convener of the Committee for Development of  Economic and Trade Relations between Taipei and Hong Kong under  the Taiwan Federation for Industrial and Commercial Enterprises,  and Chang Ping-chao, chairman of the Foundation for Development  of Across-Strait Commercial Affairs, believes that Hong Kong's  political situation will affect Taiwan business in Hong Kong and  on the mainland for a short time. However, they are optimistic  about Hong Kong's long-term situation. Chen stressed that since  the focus of the world's economic development has been shifted  to Asia, many people throughout the world are upbeat about the  outlook for economic development on the mainland. When Hong  Kong returns to Chinese rule in future, he said, China will  continue to export its commodities through Hong Kong. Taiwan  will have more close contacts with Hong Kong because of progress  in cross-strait economic relations and trade, he added.    Chang believed that though Hong Kong's current political row  has led to conflicts between the Chinese and British Hong Kong  Governments, it has had limited impact on Taiwan businessmen  because, though Taiwan businessmen are developing economic  relations and trade with the mainland through Hong Kong, they  only go through the necessary procedures for the entrepot trade  in Hong Kong rather than relying on the Chinese and Hong Kong  Government to do business. In addition, Beijing will try its  best to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, he added.    However, Chang did not deny that Hong Kong's political row  will affect the stock market and property development, both of  which are very sensitive to political changes.     "

During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message  to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik  de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message  from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South  Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz  al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on  10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president.    The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the  abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation  laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing  equality for all citizens in accordance with the new  constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli  conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard,  the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just  and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon.    Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the  continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of  violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing  of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed  that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that  henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the  expense of its new relations with the Arabs.    The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future  prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after  the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab  and international embargo on dealing with South Africa.    The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual  concern about establishing good relations between the two  countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other  fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume  contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations  between them are established.    Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the  foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic  Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa  Department at the Foreign Ministry.

Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said the three-for-three sweep should  translate to at least $200 million in compensation for the players affected by  a conspiracy that restricted movement and salaries in the winters after the  1985, '86 and '87 seasons. The owners have placed damages at $70 million.    So far, only the remedial penalties for Collusion I have been announced.  Arbitrator Tom Roberts set penalties of $10.5 million on Aug. 31, 1989, but has  yet to announce how it will be distributed and to whom.    Nicolau is expected to announce damages from the Collusion II case before the  end of this season, but Fehr said Wednesday he will be meeting with Nicolau and  Charles O'Connor, executive director of the owners' Player Relations Committee,  in an attempt to (1) reach a compromise settlement on damages from the three  collusion cases and (2) formulate a system of organized distribution as opposed  to a piecemeal one.    ""If we have to litigate every claim, the stain of collusion will go on  forever,"" Fehr said.    The concept of collusion has been credited, so to speak, to former baseball  commissioner Peter Ueberroth. Current Commissioner Fay Vincent has said he will  not tolerate the process during his administration, and the new collective  bargaining agreement contains assurances by management that it will pay treble  damages if guilty of collusion again.    After a long period of incendiary relations, Fehr said there is reason for  optimism. He cited the free market of last winter, the safeguards in the new  agreement and his belief that there will be a good-faith attempt to settle the  issue of collusion damages and distribution without a rash of litigation.    Seventy-six free agents from the winter of 1987-88 are affected by the  Collusion III decision, including Jack Morris, Gary Gaetti, Dave Righetti, Paul  Molitor, Jack Clark, Greg Minton, Mike Witt, Chili Davis and Brett Butler. Some  could receive what is known as new-look free agency, such as was granted Kirk  Gibson as part of Collusion I, allowing him to move from the Detroit Tigers to  the Dodgers.    The crux of the union's Collusion III case centered on the information bank, a  process by which clubs immediately filed their offers to free agents with the  Player Relations Committee, which then made the information available to other  clubs.    ""The fact that there were a number of free-agency contracts signed before and  during the 1987-88 free-agent market does not mean that the market itself was  'free and unencumbered,' "" Nicolau wrote in his ruling.    ""The (information) bank's message was plain -- if we must go out into that  market and bid, then let's quietly cooperate by telling each other what the  bids are. If we all do that, prices won't get out of line and no club will be  hurt too much.""    The owners dissolved the information bank after the union filed its grievance.  Said O'Connor, in a prepared statement Wednesday: ""We strongly disagree with  his ruling, but it should be understood that the events occurred over two years  ago.

Their product quality,  markets, clients, and prices are subject to the relevant  departments' supervision, administration, and coordination.    2. The work of printing and making trademarks on exported  canned food must be handled according to the Administrative  Method of Printing and Making Trademarks promulgated by the  State Administration for Industry and Commerce. If trademark  registrants are foreign trade enterprises, the registrants or  enterprises authorized by the registrants should be responsible  for supervising the work of printing and making the trademarks.    3. Production enterprises are not permitted without  authorization to sell others canned food with foreign trade  enterprise trademarks which are produced for and used by foreign  trade enterprises. If, for special reasons, production  enterprises have to sell at home exported canned food which uses  the trademarks of foreign trade enterprises, they are, in  principle, not allowed to use the registered trademarks of  foreign trade enterprises. If it is really difficult to change  the trademarks, they should, with the consent of the trademark  registrants, add another seal with the words ""For Domestic  Sale,"" which is not smaller than 2.25 square cm and which is not  easily altered, at the conspicuous site of the trademarks.  Canned food labelled for domestic sale is not permitted to be  exported again.    4. The code names of the production plants, production  dates, and product code must be printed on exported canned food.    5. Generically packed canned food without any trademarks is  not allowed, in principle, to be exported to Hong Kong, Macao,  and the Southeast Asian regions.    Units and individuals which violate the above-mentioned  regulations will be dealt with according to the relevant  regulations, and those violating the criminal law will be turned  over to judicial organs for investigation and the determination  of criminal responsibility.

In the opinion of Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov, the ""revolutionary breakthrough"" in his  sphere could cause more headaches than tangible progress today.    Consistency and gradualness in the liberalization of  Russia's  foreign trade was defined in the Russian Federation Government's  March memorandum on economic policy submitted to the IMF. To  wit, as of 1 July it was planned to abolish quotas except for  seven important items: oil, gas, electricity, diesel fuel,  copper, aluminum, and nickel -- for these it was planned to  retain quotas at least until the end of 1994.    This memorandum was approved by the government. The Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations followed the memorandum, Minister  O. Davydov said. In his opinion we were obviously getting ahead  of ourselves with the edict. Because from its more than terse  text it could be understood that we have already carried out a  virtually 100 percent liberalization of exports. But is that  the case today?    A mechanism of currency control over exports, that is over  the movement and receipt of profits, has not yet been created.  And since that is so, arguments about the leakage of capital  out of Russia will be justified. The Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations, the Russian Federation State Customs  Committee, and the banks must work out this mechanism by the end  of the year.    The application of quotas and licensing affect the export of  energy carriers to the greatest extent. Quotas for gas can be  repealed painlessly -- we have one monopolist, ""Gazprom,"" in  this field -- and the sale of gas is determined by the  throughput capability of the gas pipeline and by demand. As for  oil, Oleg Davydov believes that for the exporter the main thing  has always been to be on schedule in pumping it through the oil  pipeline. And whereas previously quotas were established in the  government following the proposal of the Ministry of the Economy  and the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, now the same quota  allocation system will merely be moved to a greater extent into  the pumping system.    In general, the state does not have the right to abandon the  tool of licensing, the minister asserts. After all, there are  licenses for military equipment, dual-application technology,  and so forth. So, without giving a detailed explanation of where  they remain and where they do not, one cannot speak of repealing  them. Transforming the authorization system for issuing licenses  into an application system -- that is, easing it -- is another  matter, but here the mechanism must be retained -- that is the  position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations.    The fact that exports must be expanded if there is no  domestic demand is not doubted. That would be greatly promoted  by a reduction of export duties, which are an anachronism.  According to the above-mentioned memorandum, we undertook to  reduce them by 38 percent in September. According to Davydov,  this will provide a considerable incentive: The advantage to  the producer will increase, many goods will become competitive,  and our budget will grow more effectively from export profits.    Another anachronism of ours is the institution of special  exports, created by the specific nature of our development. But  now, with the repeal of quotas and licenses, special exports  cannot be abolished, at least until the end of the year.  Otherwise, it will be impossible to control export and  correspondingly the receipt of profits from export.    The drafters of the president's edict had the correct  strategic aim -- the liberalization of foreign trade -- but in  this case they clearly leapfrogged natural and previously  designated stages. That is the gist of the foreign economic  relations ministers' comments. Nonetheless, the edict will be  implemented by the usual means of supplementary documents.    Of course, what has been said does not do away with some  questions. The edict was not prepared without the government's  participation, and before it was sent for the president to sign  Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin signed the document. So the very  fact that it has been criticized by a minister is quite out of  the ordinary. Let us also add that in the opinion of some  independent experts the edict's criticism by the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations can be explained -- the department is  defending its own interests connected with the possibility of  giving or failing to give permission for the export of raw  materials.

King Husayn also succeeded in convincing President Clinton,  his administration's officials, and the U.S. Congress of the  importance of the effective and influential Jordanian role in  the achievement of comprehensive peace and restoring security  and stability to the region.    During his meetings and talks with President Clinton and his  administration's officials, and with various economic, security,  and political U.S. institutions, His Majesty King Husayn managed  to confirm his knowledge and experience in managing crises and  confirmed that the Jordanian role in the region cannot in any  way be marginalized or ignored.    His Majesty King Husayn also persuaded the U.S.  Administration to take care of priorities and to work on  addressing the standing issues and problems with Israel before  talking about the possibility of reaching peace with it.  Through the U.S. Administration, he managed to convince Israel  of these requirements, which are the requirements for peace.  Therefore, an agreement must be reached on delineating borders  and restoring Jordan's share of water since it is a question of  sovereignty before anything else.    His Majesty King Husayn managed to explain to the U.S.  Administration and the U.S. Congress the economic and social  difficulties facing the country as a result of the second Gulf  War, the blockade of al-'Aqabah, and the Arab boycott and the  damage it has brought to the Jordanian economy. He stressed  that unless these issues are addressed, it will be difficult to  talk about peace and mutual goodwill in the bilateral ties.    His Majesty King Husayn succeeded in presenting all these  facts to President Clinton and his administration officials. He  received a positive response to his demand and an  acknowledgement of the soundness of his view and positions and  the sincerity of his intentions and tendencies.    Therefore, His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington and  his meetings and talks there were, by all standards, a success.    This success, however, particularly on the level of the  peace  talks, will not be at the expense of the Arab brothers or their  rights. Jordan has from the beginning been committed to, and  will continue to be committed to, the comprehensive peace.    This Jordanian commitment made President Clinton stress his  administration's commitment to support a settlement on all  tracks in order to reach a comprehensive peace.     "

0,FT933-13605 ,"FT933-13605 _AN-DGSCZAABFT 930719   FT  19 JUL 93 / Doubts over effectiveness of Japan-style work practices      By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff   PENT-UP resentment from British workers over the imposition of Japanese-style working practices could have a 'devastating effect' on industry as the recovery continues, according to a report commissioned by the government and due to be published tomorrow. The review of the influence of Japanese companies on UK labour practices finds 'little evidence that Japanese-style international competitiveness can be achieved in Britain by copying some, or even most, Japanese working methods'. It also raises questions about the effect of having to 'work as hard as humanly possible' on the quality of employees' lives. The study, conducted for the Department of Employment by Industrial Relations Services, an independent pay and conditions research group, says British manufacturers are using the threat of Japanese competition to push through reforms in working practices. The report's author, Ms Sue Milsome, says this tack has proved more persuasive than the more accurate 'but less compelling' argument that 'competitive pressures demand changes in working and management practices'. Labour law reforms and the recession have probably had more influence on working methods in Britain than the example of companies like Nissan, she says. The report warns that the introduction of some working methods favoured by Japanese companies could increase British industry's vulnerability. For example, 'just-in-time' production means companies do not keep buffer stocks. A sudden stoppage by workers could mean immediate lay-offs in other plants, as happened during the 1988 Ford strike, the report also says. It warns: 'At some point . . . the British economy will recover. If there is a great deal of pent-up resentment against Japanese-style working practices, and the fragility of production systems has been increased . . . worker dissatisfaction leading to industrial action could have a devastating effect.' The study also points to the current debate in Japan over karoshi - death through overwork. Karoshi, it says, is mainly as a result of the large amounts of unpaid overtime performed by Japanese workers. It concludes that the Japanese economic miracle, which has so impressed western observers, is probably coming to an end. 'It may be that Japan's employment practices, in particular, will be jettisoned as Japan becomes a mature economy, so British employers should be wary of imitating practices that are only appropriate in a climate of ever-increasing growth.'

The preservation of the Customs Union was important from the  point of view of the expected integration into the European  Union, the support of European thinking and general strategy for  the future, Moravcik told journalists today.    He said that open questions between the two countries should  be solved but expressed doubt that they could be solved during  his cabinet's six-month term of office. ""However we are ready to  make use of this space,"" he stressed, adding that he would  consider it wonderful if the division of the former federal  property could at last be settled.    Moravcik said that his cabinet intended to settle previously  tense Slovak-Hungarian relations.    ""We are interested in expanding cooperation,"" Moravcik said.  He confirmed Slovakia's interest in Hungarian Foreign Minister  Geza Jeszenszky's postponed visit to Bratislava taking place but  admitted that it was being hindered by difficulties surrounding  the conclusion of the Hungarian-Slovak readmission agreement.    ""I firmly believe that we will find a way to overcome this  problem,"" Moravcik said, adding that Bratislava was ready to  open new border crossings between Slovakia and Hungary.    Moravcik rejected Meciar's warning against the penetration  of  Hungarian capital into southern Slovakia, arguing that capital  was essentially international and to look for its ethnic origin  was ""counter-productive.""    The signing of a basic Slovak-Hungarian inter-state treaty  was an open question in relations between Slovakia and Hungary,  Moravcik said. He said that Bratislava expected the treaty to  confirm the current border, which would eradicate fears of  ethnic minority irredentism and possible territorial claims from  the south. However Budapest is making the recognition of  collective rights of the half- million Hungarian minority a  condition, which Bratislava rejects, Moravcik said.    Jeszenszky's visit, planned for last autumn, was again  postponed after Bratislava made the conclusion of a readmission  agreement on the return of illegal emigrants a condition for  opening new border crossings between the two countries.  Budapest refuses to conclude such an agreement for fear of an  influx of Romanian refugees into its territory.    As regards the current state of Slovak-Polish relations  Moravcik said: ""We are greatly interested in developing these  relations but we cannot find a mechanism to realize them. We  realize that our deeds are lagging behind our words."" He  mentioned the possibility of the Polish premier visiting  Bratislava.     "

In a Monday  interview with Interfax he said that the latest statement by  Dudayev actually undermined the budding talks between Chechnya  and the federal government bodies.    On Sunday in an interview televised by NTV, Dudayev, who  seemed very irritated, once again accused Russia of fanning  tension around his republic and threatened to apply adequate  measures to Russia.    At a meeting with the press, Filatov said it was most  strange  that Groznyy actually refuses to continue the dialogue because  he claimed it was the Chechen leadership that came with the  initiative of the meeting between presidents Boris Yeltsin and  Dzhokar Dudayev.    Filatov regretted that instead of a policy of negotiations  Dudayev chose the policy of seeking enemies.    He described as a dirty game the attempt of the Chechen  leader to label the decree of the Russian president on the  expansion of the zone of the state of emergency in North Ossetia  and Ingushetia as the occupation of Chechen territory by Russia.  He said the spreading of the state of emergency regulations to  Malgobek and Sunzhen regions of Ingushetia neighboring on  Chechnya was agreed upon by Yeltsin and the Ingush President  Ruslan Aushev and directed at strengthening stability and peace  in the region.    Filatov recognized that Dudayev is the actual Chechen leader  who cannot be disregarded but said that a threat to Russian  society comes from that area. He said arms are smuggled from  Chechnya to Russia, trains are robbed, other crimes committed.    ""In any case Russia has two problems to resolve in Chechnya:  socio-economic and fiscal, it has to protect Russian citizens  there"", Filatov said. He stressed that if passengers and cargos  crossing Chechnya by rail are not protected, Russia might face  the necessity of altering the railway route.    Filatov said that despite the failure of the talks with  Groznyy Moscow will try to analyze the reasons and define the  way of normalizing relations.    The sharp anti-Russian statements on the part of Chechen  President Dzhokar Dudayev make it impossible that Moscow appoint  representatives for the talks on settlement of relations between  the Russian federal bodies and Groznyy, Kremlin Chief of Staff  Sergey Filatov told Interfax today. He stressed that the  president had earlier wanted new Minister for Nationalities and  Regional Policies Nikolay Yegorov to be the Russian chief  negotiator at the talks with Chechnya.     "

[passage  omitted] Viktor Chernomyrdin sees no serious problem in the  significant difference in value between the Russian and  Hungarian deliveries.    [Chernomyrdin] It has various reasons. I would not hold  either side responsible for that, and I would certainly not  blame either of them. The transitional, semi-market nature of  the Russian economy has of course a considerable influence on  this. [passage omitted] The creation of the legal basis of a  market economy is now taking place in Russia. The bilateral  agreements to be signed in Budapest, for instance, will  partially serve this purpose. Economic processes cannot be  changed all at once. However, I am certain that the imbalance  in Hungarian-Russian exports and imports will gradually decrease.    [Izbeki] The issue of debts inherited from the Soviet era is  also a subject matter in which our countries are ahead of  everyone else. The Russian Government is determined to settle  this debate once and for all and as soon as possible. Viktor  Chernomyrdin answered my question regarding this. He welcomes  the Hungarian proposal that part of the still outstanding debt  of about $800 million would be invested here in Russia. The  details, of course, are yet to be discussed, but in theory, it  is supported. Thus, I see no problem regarding this. The debt  issue can be resolved, he added. Russia is a reliable partner  in energy deliveries as well, he said.    [Chernomyrdin] We undertake responsibility for what we have  promised and agreed on. [passage omitted] As far as our  neighbors are concerned, in my view, Ukraine has to handle this  matter in a civilized manner, as it is customary in the world.  The diversion or tapping of deliveries, or similar non-business  methods are unacceptable. Russia and the recipient European  countries expect nothing less from the transit countries than to  fulfill their business obligations.    [Izbeki] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been Russia's prime  minister since December 1992, is of the view that the Russian  reforms, the economy's transformation, could not have moved  forward any faster, more successfully and less painfully than  they did. [passage omitted]    Concerning the power struggle within the Russian top  leadership, Viktor Chernomyrdin denied the allegation that he  was striving for greater power than what he currently has.

High on  the talks, which will be attended by senior Jordanian and  American officials, are Jordanian-U.S. ties and regional issues.    Earlier today, his majesty visited the Congress, and met  separately with Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas  Foley, and the House Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Lee  Hamilton, and 23 committee members.    The committee had asked for the meeting for a briefing from  his majesty on the latest developments related to the Middle  East peace process. Members of the House Committee said  Jordanian-U.S. relations had developed after the Gulf war. They  said they understood problems facing Jordan and many committee  members said they would support Jordan in view of its positive  stand toward the peace process and the democratic climate  prevailing in the Kingdom.    His majesty told the committee that Jordan would act  according to the agenda with Israel on the agreement two weeks  ago on border demarcation, water, and security issues. His  majesty said the agreement was progress towards peace, and added  that Jordan will demand completion of other items on the agenda.  His majesty told the House Committee it was premature to talk  about the proposed confederation between Jordan and the  Palestinians, and both peoples could choose the sort of  relationship between them when the Palestinians gain their  rights on their national soil.    Asked if Jordan would sign a peace treaty with Israel after  the border and water issues are resolved, his majesty said  Jordan would act according to the agenda, noting that Jordan is  a sovereign country and an advocate of Arab coordination.    His majesty said a speedy peace treaty primarily depended on  Israel's response to the requirements and conditions of peace.  His majesty said lifting the Arab boycott against Israel  depended largely on the results of negotiations ending the  blockade of Jordanian goods bound for the occupied Palestinian  lands, and a reconsideration of Israel's protectionist policy.    His majesty told the House Foreign Relations Committee that  Islam is a religion of moderation, and fundamentalism was not  restricted to Islam, but there were other extremist religious  movements, and Islam should not be viewed through fundamentalism.    His majesty said Jordan would offer all possible support for  the Palestinian administration in the autonomous areas.    Yesterday, his majesty met U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry following talks with Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and other U.S. administration officials.    During their meetings, both sides have underlined the  closeness of bilateral relations.     "

In other words, Berisha's reaction is not defensive but  clearly aggressive. It's aim is to rally and incite the  fanaticism of the Muslims in his country and in the other Balkan  areas where his fellow nationals live as a minority. The  Albanian leader has not concealed his intentions to link what he  calls the ""Albanian issue"" to the problem of the former  Yugoslavia. It is for this reason that he looks forward to  (instead of wishing against it, as the whole world does) the  expansion of obscurity and unrest in Kosovo, Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM], and other areas where  there are Muslims and Albanian-speaking minorities.    For many months now the Berisha regime, without even the  pretext of last Sunday's incident, has insisted on portraying  the country as directly threatened by Serbia and Greece. The  goal of Tirana's tactics was to ensure the strongest possible  support from the United States and West European countries by  being in the position of a weak and threatened state. At the  same time, the Berisha regime apparently believed that it was  securing an alibi for its future moves and ""reactions"" in  pursuing a solution to the ""Albanian issue.""    So, last Sunday's incident was so opportune and helpful to  the Albanian plans as to be suspicious, possibly incriminating  those who hasten to exploit it in a relentless and extremist  manner.    Our country has maintained a stance toward Albanian and  Berisha's provocations that exceeds the limits of tolerance and  has already entered the field of an unjustified and obviously  unequal retreat. In addition to the moral, material, and  economic assistance we have granted the Berisha regime, the  Greek people are currently hosting almost all the unemployed  Albanians who entered the country illegally. The Greek people  are also being hit by an unprecedented crime wave that also  comes from our neighboring statelet...    All these things are being pointed out not to highlight our  country's strength or to threaten reprisals against the Berisha  regime, they are merely designed to make Tirana see reason and,  of course, warn that the Hellenism of North Epirus is not being  offered as a victim of pressure and blackmail. Its rights are  safeguarded internationally and the guarantor for these rights  is, naturally and primarily, the national metropolis of the  Greek minority...     "

Bosnian officials and the UN also exchanged harsh words over the origin of an unprecedented fire-fight between government soldiers and French peacekeepers on the slopes of Mount Igman outside Sarajevo. Eight Bosnian political parties supported a demand that 'Rose must go' published in Sarajevo's daily newspaper, Oslobodenje. They accused the British commander, whose year-long tour of duty ends in January, of having 'done everything to water down the decisiveness of the free world in punishing crime and fascism'. He was more interested in protecting British interests than implementing UN resolutions, they claimed. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, sprang to Gen Rose's defence, expressing 'full confidence' in him and voicing 'gratitude' for his 'wonderful work'. UN spokesman Colonel Tim Spicer said Gen Rose was not concerned about the Bosnian criticism and there was no question of his leaving before his assignment ended. 'The job of a peacekeeper as opposed to a peace enforcer is a difficult path to walk and there is no question that Gen Rose has walked a central line in furtherance of the mission given to him.' The general's reputation among Sarajevo residents soared last February when his tough diplomacy helped end the siege of the city and restore relative normality to daily life. His standing sagged two months later when Moslems thought him too soft in responding to the Serb assault on the Gorazde enclave, and it fell further in August, when the UN failed to stop the Serbs from reimposing a partial blockade of Sarajevo. UN officials stress, however, that from the start his efforts to ensure a normal life for as many Bosnian civilians as possible have met with far from universal co-operation from Bosnian officials and generals. The February ceasefire in Sarajevo required some very tough talking to Bosnia's Moslem leaders as well as to the besieging Serbs. Two bursts of machine-gun fire raked a Sarajevo tram yesterday, wounding nine people, one of them seriously, Bosnian police and hospital officials told Reuter. 'It was the sower of death,' said a Bosnian policeman, referring to a heavy machine-gun with a distinctive sound much feared by residents because it is often loaded with exploding bullets. 'This was the worst single incident our hospital has handled since February,' a doctor said.   Countries:-  BAZ  Bosnia-Hercegovina, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

He said Argentina ""is showing  its potential to the world.""    Menem recalled that bilateral relations had run into ""an  infinite number"" of problems, just as they do with other  important nations, but stressed that beginning with his  government, ""an immediate decision was made to change course by  implementing more realistic policies at both the national and  international levels."" Menem said this last night while opening  American Week at the Pacifico Mall in Buenos Aires. U.S.  Ambassador James Cheek participated in the ceremony.    The chief of state reiterated that Argentina must be ""among  the top 10 countries in the world because it has the necessary  natural and human resources."" He emphasized, ""We must not forget  that after having been among the world's top 10 countries some  40 years ago, we slid to 100th position in 1989."" He stated: ""It  has been difficult to overcome the innumerable obstacles that  hampered Argentina's escape from stagnation, frustration, and  involution.""    The president stressed that ""an enormous apparatus that  sought to frustrate had been mounted"" in the country,  ""converting it into a nation of favor trading and privileges  because the state dominated and did everything unsatisfactorily.""    Defending his state reform policy, Menem highlighted the  fact  that ""after five years, Argentina has moved from 100th place to  16th place among the economic powers."" He said, ""Argentina must  once again be among the top 10.""    Menem admitted that ""not everything is right"" in the  country.  He justified this saying that other stagnated nations ""needed  decades to revert the situation while we took just 5 years.""  Menem said, ""No matter who governs, by the end of the century we  will be much better off if we continue on this course.""    The chief of state indicated that enhancing the current  policy ""is the best proposal for the current stage and for  advancing against the scourges that affect us and the rest of  humanity.""    Menem defined these ""scourges"" as ""poverty, drug  trafficking,  terrorism, and crime, which actively grow through new methods.""  He said: ""The proposal for new laws and a more coherent  relationship among all nations is the best answer to these  scourges which undermine our best foundation: An organized  society.""    More than 40 recognized U.S. enterprises are participating  in  the event. The opening ceremony took place in the center of the  mall where a 12.5-meter model of the Statue of Liberty, which is  located in New York harbor, has been erected.     "

He also agreed to reply to questions by a correspondent  of this program.    Asked whether there will be any changes in the government  economic policy after the Seimas debate on a government no-  confidence vote, Slezevicius said:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] We have very carefully studied  all statements without exception by Seimas members. We have  analyzed all critical remarks and focussed our attention on many  of them during the preparation of a corrected government  program. As you know, the no-confidence issue is one side of  the matter, but now, in accordance with our constitution, we  have, after a change of more than a half of the members of the  cabinet, submitted a new government program to the Seimas. [end  recording]    Having stated that the stability of the litas is helping the  development of the economy but is not sufficient to make this  development more dynamic, Slezevicius continued:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] In our program we emphasize  our  attention on those issues which require a very fast solution.  This includes taxation policy, the administration of taxes, the  control of borders, and improvement of the work of the customs  offices. And, of course, it is very important to step up the  investment process. [passage omitted]    A limiting factor in the development of the economy is the  very high cost of credits, and, of course, not a single investor  is able to use local credits for investment processes. This is  closely connected with the credit resources of our commercial  banks and with the stability of these banks. Together with the  Central Bank, we have to accomplish a great deal in this sphere,  so that the price of credits in our country goes down in a more  dynamic manner than now. [end recording]    Slezevicius then stressed the government's tasks in creating  favorable trading conditions for Lithuania's industry and  businessmen and mentioned that at a foreign policy coordinating  committee meeting relations with Russia were discussed today.  Then he continued:    [Begin Slevevicius recording] As you know our relations with  Russia are being extensively discussed. They are closely linked  with the strategic situation of the Kaliningrad region and with  the necessity of normalizing transit through our country. As it  happens, our country is situated between two territories of  Russia and our task is to find together with Russia mutually  acceptable means of solving all problems.

Mitterrand, during a 30-minute meeting with Qian Qichen who  arrived earlier Saturday, said he wanted to ""give a new  departure to our relations. It would be beneficial for both our  countries.""    The French president was quoted by his spokesman Jean  Musitelli, who added that the meeting ""confirmed the desire for  a rapprochement"" on both sides.    Mitterrand notably said that ""we must increase initiatives  now that we agree that things should improve.""    Qian told reporters after his meeting with Mitterrand that  ""the future of Sino-French relations is very promising,"" when  asked about prospects for economic and industrial cooperation.    But later Foreign Minister Alain Juppe rebuked China for its  human rights record, saying ""a lot must still be done"" in that  area.    But Juppe said that Qian's trip to France marks ""a new  departure"" in Franco-Chinese relations following the healing of  the year-long rift over French arms sales to Taiwan.    He said in addition to the human rights issue his meeting  with Qian also focused on nuclear proliferation, regional  conflicts and the role of the UN Security Council of which  Beijing is a permanent member.    The minister's three-day official visit was scheduled after  Franco-Chinese relations returned to normal on January 12 when  Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms contracts with Taiwan.    Relations had been strained for a year after a contract for  the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by  the sale of gunboats, but Juppe said these contracts would be  honored although France would not be signing any new arms sales  agreements.    Mitterrand noted that ""in recent years, Franco-Chinese  relations went through difficulties, particularly because of a  dip in trade,"" according to Musitelli.    Qian, pointing out that China was experiencing high growth  rates, said his country ""is a market with strong potential for  foreign businesses, particularly French ones, which are welcome.""    French businessmen are keen to return to the lucrative  Chinese market after being excluded over arms deals with Taiwan.    A pro-Tibet committee on Thursday urged French authorities  to  push the issue of human rights in the autonomous region during  Qian's visit.    Qian was due to meet French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  on Monday. Balladur is soon to pay a visit to China, probably  in March.    On Monday he is also to meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher to discuss human rights issues, conditional on the  United States renewing China's most favoured nation status next  June.

Following is our radio  comment on the relations between Vietnam and Japan:    Over the pasts years, relations between Vietnam and Japan  have developed rapidly. The turning point of the development  was the visit to Japan by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in March  1993. During this visit, the Japanese Government welcomed and  highly valued Vietnam's policy for renovation. After the  resumption of Japan's ODA [Overseas Development Aid] for Vietnam  at the end of 1992, the Japanese Government promised to further  strengthen and develop the economic, scientific, and  technological cooperation with Vietnam to a level in conformity  with the potentials of the two countries. This commitment has  been implemented effectively, especially after the lifting of  the U.S. embargo against Vietnam.    Since early this year, many high level government  delegations  and businessmen from both Japan and Vietnam exchanged working  visits in each country to discuss effective measures to  strengthen bilateral relations. Recently at the reception given  to Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan in Tokyo, Japanese Foreign  Minister Kakizawa affirmed Japan's unswerving policy to  cooperate with Vietnam. Also in this occasion, Japan voiced its  support for Vietnam to take part in regional organizations  including ASEAN, and for Vietnam's activities in the Asian  Pacific region.    Economically, Japan is the biggest trade partner of Vietnam.  The two way trade turnover in 1993 was nearly $1.3 billion.  Japan is the fifth largest investor in Vietnam. At the press  conference in Hanoi during his working visit to Vietnam, Mr.  (Akira Mishio), chairman of the Joint Japan Vietnam Economic  Committee, said that Japanese businessmen showed great interest  in Vietnam. He said that 1994 was a year for Japan to invest in  Vietnam. Japan's position will be changed when the  Japan-invested project on cement factory in north Vietnam with a  total capital of over $200 million is completed.    Nineteen ninety-four is also the year that Japanese  Government has honored its commitment. On 28 January 1994,  representatives from the Japanese Government and the Vietnamese  Government signed exchanged notes and agreement on the Japanese  ODA granted to Vietnam in the fiscal year 1993 with the total  value of $426 million. A number of other agreements on the  Japanese Government's assistance to the development in economy,  education, and health care in some localities in Vietnam were  also signed.    This time Mr. Shigekazu Sato and his party are in Vietnam to  discuss with Vietnamese agencies concerned to promote economic  cooperation between the two governments, especially the Japanese  Government ODA in the form of loan to Vietnam.

The measure, announced without warning on March 3 by the  Slovak government, immediately imposed the tax on all consumer  goods from all countries. It was the second trade barrier thrown  up by the Slovaks in three weeks.    Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, rushing to protect his  country's exporters, responded with a 3 percent devaluation of  the Czech crown in relation to the clearing ECU (the European  Union's currency unit for trade payments between the two  republics). The move effectively made Czech goods 3 percent less  expensive in Slovakia and Slovak goods 3 percent more expensive  in the Czech Republic.    Slovak Finance Ministry officials described the tax as an  attempt to raise money to shore up the country's trade deficit  with the Czech Republic. They said it would remain in place for  six months.    ""It's only temporary,"" said ministry spokesman Miroslav  Polacek. ""We have to get a better position for the balance of  payments for the Slovak Republic. It's not for the defense of  our internal market.""    Since the Czech-Slovak monetary union ended in February  1993,  Slovakia has run a consistent deficit with the Czech Republic.  Bratislava paid Prague $100 million to cover its deficit for  December 1993 and January 1994. In February, however, Slovakia  did not owe the Czech Republic anything, according to a  spokesman for the Czech National Bank.    Klaus said he recognized the move as ""legitimate,"" but added  that the two sides should reevaluate their customs union, the  special arrangement that allows the two countries to be treated  as a single trading bloc.    ""[The customs union] will exist,"" said Czech government  spokeswoman Klara Pospisilova, ""but probably the rules will  change."" Officials would not comment on details of possible  changes, but Klaus will likely meet Slovak Prime Minister  Vladimir Meciar next week.    The new Slovak tax also raised the hackles of the  international community, which had previously voiced loud  opposition to a Slovak measure introduced on February 11 that  suddenly required that certificates of quality for foodstuff  imports be presented at the border.    ""We are not opposed to the measure as such. We are aware of  their economic difficulties,"" said Gerhard Sabathil of the  European Union's Prague delegation. ""[But] there's a clear  obligation of the country to consult such measures beforehand  with the EU. And as we told them this three weeks ago when they  introduced the certificates, it's really disappointing.""     "

Speaking to reporters at the Japan National Press Club, Haas  said Germany has intensified its relations with East and  Southeast Asia, adding Bonn's new Asia policy, adopted in  October, ""singles out Japan as major partner in the region.""    A cooperation council for high technology proposed during  German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Japan in February 1993  will likely be formally established when Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa visits Germany as part of a European tour in May, he  said. Through the council, representatives of both governments  and the high-tech industries of both countries and research and  development personnel will meet on a regular basis to exchange  views on the latest technological developments and sound out  possible joint projects.    Haas, who will leave his Tokyo post on April 29 after more  than three and a half years in Japan, said Bonn ""very warmly  welcomed"" the priorities set by the Hosokawa cabinet, citing  political reform, decentralization and deregulation. However,  he indicated that political developments since August, when  Hosokawa's coalition government took power ending almost four  decades of Liberal Democratic Party rule, have put a damper on  Bonn's initial enthusiasm.    ""We had high, possibly too high expectations and may have to  prepare ourselves for some disappointment,"" Haas said. ""You  sell twice as much as you buy from us,"" said Haas, urging more  Japanese efforts to adjust the bilateral trade imbalance which  reached 930.44 billion yen in Japan's favor in 1993.    ""The Germans feel that Japan can and should be more open to  its competitors and to international division of labor,"" the  ambassador said, adding that Germany hopes to solve trade  problems in a multilateral context.    Turning to cultural relations, Haas acknowledged that  Germany  should correct another imbalance -- the number of Japanese  studying in Germany is seven to eight times higher than the  number of Germans studying in Japan, he said. Haas, who is  fluent in Japanese, said, however, ""it is simply not true"" that  speaking the partner country's language is a prerequisite for  mutual understanding.    With the increasing global interdependence English will  become the mode of communication in German-Japan relations  anyway, he said. ""This is not a bad development,"" Haas said,  adding that bilateral relations need to be taken somewhat ""out  of the hands of specialists.""    Son of a career diplomat, Haas spent almost his entire  childhood in Japan and China. In the 1960s he served as a  junior officer under his father, who was then the German  ambassador to Japan. Bonn has not decided yet who will succeed  Haas.     "

Under the auspices of the Orange County Human Relations Commission and the U.S.  Justice Department, more than 200 participants convened in a series of panel  discussions at the Garden Grove Civic Center not far from Little Saigon, the  largest Vietnamese business center in the nation.    ""We need to make a beginning and bring together law enforcement and the  Southeast Asian community. We hope this will provide a chance to identify  problems and goals,"" said Barbara Considine of the Human Relations Commission.    Orange County is home to about 130,000 Southeast Asian immigrants, mostly  concentrated in Westminster and Garden Grove. Police departments in both cities  have developed specialized units and educational programs to fight crime in  Laotian, Vietnamese and Cambodian neighborhoods.    Considine said the conference's recommendations to improve police relations in  the Southeast Asian community will be formalized in a report by the U.S.  Justice Department for national distribution.    For almost eight hours, panelists addressed a wide range of both cultural and  criminal problems encountered by police. They cited increasing gang activity by  Southeast Asians, drug use, auto theft rings and violent crime often  perpetuated by highly mobile youths who flee to other parts of the country.    Asian crime experts said the gang situation is expected to worsen as the newest  immigrants from Southeast Asia arrive in United States. About 1,000 a month  settle in Orange County.    Unlike the educated and professional class that immigrated immediately after  the Vietnam War, the latest arrivals are often poor, uneducated youths who do  not have families -- characteristics that make them particularly susceptible to  gang recruitment.    Police said the immigrants are hampered by language barriers, ignorance of the  court system and cultural differences. Police themselves have to deal with a  lack of cooperation by Southeast Asian crime victims and difficulties  recruiting Southeast Asians for police work.    Among other things, law enforcement officials said, Southeast Asians are  hesitant to report crimes or cooperate with officers because of fear of  retaliation and a traditional mistrust of police, who were often corrupt in  their home countries.    To overcome the difficulties, panelists said, law enforcement must develop  persistent public relations efforts and educational programs to develop trust  in the Southeast Asian community. They highlighted the use of police  substations, anonymous hotlines, bilingual programs, Asian advisory committees  and special liaisons who keep in regular contact with business owners.

""Individual anti-Russian statements by  Turkish representatives should be viewed as a reflection of the  inner political game,"" director of the Russian Foreign  Ministry's 4th Asian Department Valeriy Yegoshkin told Interfax.    He said that the recent statement by Chief of the Turkish  General Staff Dogan Gyuresh to the effect that Russia continued  to pursue an imperial policy in the region must not be perceived  as a symptom of cooling in Russian-Turkish relations.    To quote Yegoshkin, this statement was made in a complicated  inner political context and was intended for inner use. Anti-  Russian statements had been made in Turkey before. However, the  statement in question went far beyond the limits of the  admissible, which caused a sharp response in Russia, he said.    The Ankara officials have isolated themselves from this  statement. General Gyuresh also asserts that he was  misunderstood, he continued. In his opinion, Russia and Turkey  had good prospects for cooperation. Although various Turkish  quarters have a different attitude to Russian-Turkish  rapprochement, it is early yet to talk about the deterioration  of bilateral relations, he said.    Yegoshkin doubts that a serious clash may occur between the  Russian and Turkish interests during the division of spheres of  influence in the Black Sea region and the Turkic republics of  the former Soviet Union. ""The Turkish representatives we are  dealing with try to isolate themselves from the pan-Turkic  moods. They say that Ankara recognizes Russia's legitimate  interests in the Turkic world and does not try to assume a  dominating role. We have no reasons for treating them with  misgiving,"" he said.    Speaking about free navigation through Bosporus and  Dardanelles which Turkey is trying to limit, Yegoshkin expressed  hope that Ankara will not disregard the opinion of the world  community. ""If it does, it may find itself in complete  isolation. Not a single country has supported the introduction  of new rules. Moreover, Turkey's strongest critics are its  neighbors, who are against barriers complicating the passage of  their ships through Bosporus and Dardanelles, he said.    Commenting on the utilization of the resources of the  Caspian  Sea by all countries of the region, Yegoshkin said the position  of Azerbaijan created certain problems.    The countries of the Caspian region have equal access to the  Caspian Sea which not divided into territorial waters or  economic zones, he said.    To quote Yegoshkin, Baku has a different opinion. Azerbaijan  would like to own a large part of the Caspian Sea and attract  foreign companies for developing the Caspian oil deposits.  Azerbaijan's unilateral moves may damage the interests of other  Caspian countries. Such problems must be tackled at a  negotiating table by all the countries concerned, he said.     "

Several occasions arose in the last decade and a half for  improving Irano-American relations, but so far there has been no  change in the status quo.    An analytical review of the history of the two countries'  relations reveals that two key factors were instrumental in  shaping U.S. policy towards Iran prior to the Islamic  Revolution. First was the U.S. fear of Communist domination of  the oil-rich Persian Gulf region, and second was America's  political immaturity combined with its military and economic  supremacy which deprived the United States of the chance to  understand the realities of world politics.    The United States never understood the Islamic Revolution in  Iran because it never appreciated this country's culture and  history. If the universal definition of politics is war fought  without arms, then Washington's policies towards  pre-revolutionary Iran must be defined as war fought by coercion.    Despite the friendly disposition of Iran towards the United  States in the late 1940's and early 1950's, American policies,  stemming from U.S. power, gradually soured the initial and  cordial relations between the two countries and changed it into  an antagonistic relationship. The role of the United States in  toppling the nationalist government of Dr. Mosaddeq in 1953, and  the subsequent U.S.-sponsored policies of Iran which neglected  this country's religious, historical, and cultural backgrounds,  was the final straw that broke the back of Iran-U.S. friendly  relations.    The Islamic Republic's anti-American stance in the past 14  years is a natural reaction to U.S. actions in Iran since the  50's and is based on the principle of ""he who sows the wind will  reap the whirlwind."" Iranians' collective opinion of the U.S.  has changed, they no longer think of the United States as  synonymous with names such as Morgan Shuster [served as Persia's  treasurer-general in 1911] and [Arthur] Millspaugh [U.S. adviser  to the Persian Ministry of Finance 1922-1927]. The new American  image in the Iranian mind is one of an imperialist government  with less than friendly designs for the Islamic Republic.    Washington has preferred to look at the world from the point  of view of a superpower, while the Islamic Republic, which was  founded on the principle of mutual respect in its dealings with  other countries, refuses to bow to superpower pressure. The  U.S. is faced with the same dilemma in Europe where it took on  the role of the dominant Western power during the Cold War.  Today's European efforts to undermine U.S. authority is the  logical outcome of 45 years of slave-master relationship between  Europe and the United States.    The as yet undefined ""new world order"" has provided an  opportunity for the U.S. to rethink its basic policies vis-a-vis  the rest of the world.     "

Both sides seem to  have gone through a routine exchange of their respective  positions without conceding any ground. While Mr Talbott  reiterated the Clinton administration's view that the supply of  military equipment, including F-16 fighters, will assist the  verifiable capping of the production of highly-enriched uranium  for making nuclear weapons in Pakistan, India has refused to  endorse the deal and expressed concern over the move to supply  the weaponry. Given the history of distrust between India and  Pakistan and, for the matter, between India and the United  States it was difficult for India to accept what it sees as a  step that will boost Pakistan's military strength at a time when  the latter is in a particularly belligerent mood. The American  side argues, perhaps somewhat tendentiously, that the supply of  military equipment will not affect the India-Pakistan military  balance, but New Delhi obviously thinks otherwise. Indian and  Pakistani forces are currently evenly matched if there is a  short, sharp conflict. But the addition of 38 fourth generation  fighters along with 3C Orion maritime reconnaissance and strike  aircraft is liable to tilt the balance against India.    Contrary to expectations, the American visitor did not bring  any package of ""suggestions"" on the nuclear non-proliferation  issue for India. This may have been due to the awareness that  the issue just does not fit into the U.S.-Pakistan matrix and  requires to be addressed separately. It is possible that  Washington may have decided that the complex South Asian scene  has to be untangled gradually and has decided to devote the  first part of its efforts to Pakistan. It has to be remembered  in this context that it was American forbearance that resulted  in Islamabad not only acquiring the bomb but also the delivery  systems in the form of the first batch of F-16s. In any case  there are far too many imponderables relating to Washington's  new initiative in South Asia, the attitudes of Pakistan and  China being the most obvious, to come to any immediate  conclusion about future prospects. Mr Talbott cannot but be  aware that in its first year, the Clinton administration had not  only ignored South Asia, but through statements of the President  and some of his officials unnecessarily soured the relationship  between New Delhi and Washington to an extent not seen recently.  Insofar as it sought to make amends, the visit was useful, as  were the nuances suggesting that America might be willing to  deal with India as India, and not as a function of its  relationship with Pakistan. But he should not be surprised if he  detected a note of scepticism in Indian responses.      "

Judicial relations were partially suspended by Washington  following a disagreement with Colombian Prosecutor General  Gustavo de Greiff.    The request was made after the Colombian Government told the  United States that ""under no circumstance"" can it accept that De  Greiff be criticized by U.S. State Department officials, who  have publicly stated they do not trust him and therefore have  stopped sending to Santa Fe de Bogota evidence against drug  traffickers.    Sanin, in statements to the press, indicated that Colombia  and the United States should uphold together the struggle  against the common enemy, drug trafficking, which gets an upper  hand when judicial authorities do not cooperate. Colombia's  rejection of criticism against De Greiff was included in a note  sent by Sanin to the U.S. State Department. The U.S. State  Department on 18 April sent a letter to the Cesar Gaviria  government denouncing the prosecutor general's behavior.    Washington's protest was prompted by a letter De Greiff sent  the U.S. judge in charge of the case of Colombian drug  trafficker Dandenis Munoz. In the letter De Greiff said that  Colombia had no pending charges against this criminal concerning  the attack against an Avianca airplane, which killed 107 people  in November 1989.    The prosecutor general's letter was sent at the request of  Munoz's lawyer. Munoz is serving a six-year sentence in New  York for using illegal identification. U.S. political and  judicial circles believe there was ""improper meddling"" by De  Greiff in the case.    The U.S. Government, through the State Department protest  note, criticized De Greiff and cast doubt on his resolve to  fight drug trafficking, thus increasing tension over the past  few months between U.S. judicial authorities and the Colombian  prosecutor general.    The quarrel began in 1993 when de Greiff said in a news  conference in the United States that it would be good to develop  ways to legalize drug trafficking in view of what he called  ""little interest"" by developed countries to halt consumption and  at the same time reduce the mafia's economic power.    When referring to the protest note sent to the U.S. State  Department, Sanin said that despite the fact the Gaviria  government has conceptual differences with de Greiff, it does  not accept that the prosecutor general be cast under a bad  light, especially on an international level.    ""Colombia does not accept, under any circumstance,  statements  against the prosecutor general, who is an efficient and properly  qualified person, committed to fighting crime and drug  trafficking,"" the foreign minister said.

On Friday, the Industrial Relations Commission ruled that by pursuing an industry-wide pay claim the union involved - the Transport Workers Union - was seeking to avoid 'enterprise-bargaining', and that its right to immunity from legal action should be withdrawn.

In a friendly, frank, and businesslike [you hao tan shuai he  qiu shi 0645 1170 0982 3764 0735 3061 1395] atmosphere, Chinese  President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng had held separate  talks with the Estonian president on the current state of and  prospects for bilateral relations and other issues of common  interest.

As the Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamed Mahathir put it,  links between the two countries stretched a long way back, but  it is only over the last two decades that the bilateral  relationship has reached a new level of understanding and  cooperation.    ""In the last five years or so, bilateral relations have  increased by leaps and bounds in many fields of cooperation,"" he  added.    The visits by the state and government leaders to each  other's country deepened mutual understanding and trust and  pushed the relations into a new stage of all-round development.    Earlier this month, Mahathir visited China for the third  time. During the visit he met with President Jiang Zemin and  Prime Minister Li Peng respectively, exchanging views on the  bilateral, regional and international issues of common concern.    Since Mahathir's first visit to China in 1985, the two  governments have signed ten agreements including those on trade,  aviation, marine transportation, investment guarantee, avoidance  of double taxation, establishment of the joint economic and  trade commission, information and science and technology.    Two-way trade has been recording a double-digit growth since  1987 with 1993 seeing a 21 percent increase to 1.79 billion U.S.  dollars from 1.475 billion U.S. dollars in 1992. China has  stood as one of the biggest buyers of palm oil of Malaysia, the  world's largest producer.    Two-way investment has covered a wide range of industries  with a considerable expansion in volume and is moving toward  internationalized cooperation.    Incomplete statistics show that the number of Malaysians  travelling to China rose from 11,200 in 1989 to 125,200 in 1993  while the number of the Chinese touring Malaysia surged from  9,000 in 1990 to 85,000 in 1993.    Last year the two governments agreed to set up  consulates-general in each other's country. The Malaysian  Consulate-General in Guangzhou started business by the end of  last year while the Chinese one will be opened in Kuching,  Sarawak soon.    ""On many major international issues, we are delighted to see  that our two countries share extensive common understanding and  have been maintaining good cooperation. We highly value the  Malaysian Government for its upholding justice and speaking out  to safeguard the rights and interests of the developing  countries in the international affairs and for actively  promoting the political stability and economic prosperity of  this region,"" Chinese Ambassador Qian Jinchang said recently.    ""We have full confidence in the future development of the  bilateral relationship. We believe that the development of  long- term, stable and friendly relations between China and  Malaysia on the basis of the principles of peaceful coexistence,  is not only in conformity with the fundamental interests of our  two peoples, but also beneficial to the peace, stability and  development of this region,"" he added.

A few months later, 15 people are gathered in a circle, sipping coffee and  nibbling on egg rolls in a Korean-owned carpet shop on Garden Grove Boulevard,  the pulse of the Korean merchant and social center of Orange County. They are  there for the third session of a dialogue.    The Orange County Human Relations Commission, with support from the city of  Garden Grove and the Korean Chamber of Commerce, brought together this group of  Korean merchants and Anglo residents to reduce simmering tensions and discuss  issues of mutual concern. Many are the same players from the council chambers,  but in a different setting and working under different rules.    A Korean immigrant explains to the group how in spite of his 20-plus years in  the United States and his U.S. education, he never entirely forgets that he is  different. He has an Asian face and speaks with an accent; he's always a little  bit an outsider. Hence the love for ""Koreatown,"" a kind of emotional/social  sanctuary where one can breathe the luxurious air of an insider for a few  minutes each day.    A longtime Garden Grove resident talks about feeling like an outsider in  ""Koreatown."" Being American is about being united as one community, she says,  not creating separate clusters within a city.    Garden Grove, once dotted with orange groves and home to the annual Strawberry  Festival, was already stretching beyond its rural, small-town roots well before  the Korean immigrants began to arrive in the mid-'70s.    Veteran residents point to the construction of the Garden Grove Freeway as the  beginning of the end of Garden Grove Boulevard as a thriving hometown business  district. The boulevard slumped into economic decline, and the Koreans, like so  many immigrants before them, discovered in the boulevard a tremendous  opportunity to prosper and be self-sufficient in their adopted land.    The fact that not one of the participating Korean merchants is a resident of  Garden Grove raised a sore point: Outsiders. What is the acid test,  participants wondered, for loyalty to one's community? Does one who owns  commercial property have less of a stake in a community than one who owns  residential property? How long must one reside in a community to establish a  sincere commitment? One interesting discovery from the dialogue: The mayor is  the only native-born resident of Garden Grove in the group.    Differing cultural values can also create tension. For example, immigrants have  an intense drive to succeed, for their children to succeed. Assumption:  Native-born Americans are not hard-working, not goal-oriented, don't care if  their children get an education. Assumption: Koreans are elitist, too  status-driven.    Participants adjust the focus on their cultural lenses for a moment. ""Of course  we want good things for ourselves and our children. But there are many  definitions of success,"" an Anglo participant says to agreeing nods. ""I  understand,"" a Korean man responds. ""But this broader interpretation of success  is a luxury for a new immigrant. Perhaps for the next generation.""    And what about senior citizens? The American institution of nursing homes  becomes a topic for discussion. Koreans explain traditional Asian values of  respect for elders and the extended family unit. Assumption: Americans don't  care about their elders, don't have a strong commitment to family.  Anglo-Americans share emotional anecdotes about the frustration, the pain in  choices made for aging parents, about exploring innovative solutions to  shortcomings in today's elderly care. A critical value, they point out, is  independence, to not be a burden to one's adult children.    One Korean member mentions that local Korean leaders are exploring options for  elderly housing, because, given the alternative, many Korean elders would  rather be on their own. The imaginary lines that divide ""us"" from ""them"" begin  to blur.    In another session, dialogue members talked about awarenesses that had been  created as a result of the meetings. ""I found that Americans were more  generous, kinder than I had thought before,"" one participant said in a  statement seconded by other Koreans. Their original, negative impression was no  doubt helped along by their experiences in City Council debates.    Again, the lines blur as to who is the insider and who is the outsider.    One of the future challenges for the dialogue members will be to explore how to  help the Korean and Anglo communities adjust the focus on their lenses as well,  to move beyond assumptions about culture or newcomers versus old-timers and  work together to reduce community tensions.    A similar challenge, or opportunity, exists for Orange County in general. Just  as Garden Grove Boulevard is no longer what it was before the freeway, so too  has the county's face changed in recent years.    The County Board of Supervisors created the Human Relations Commission to  transform inter-ethnic conflicts into opportunities to build strength from our  differences.

Medvedev questions Shakhray on  Moscow's relations with the regions, particularly Tatarstan and  Chechnya.    Commenting on the significance of Boris Yeltsin's visit to  Tatarstan earlier this week, Shakhray says: ""The Russian  president's visit to Tatarstan was not only to solve economic  problems but also to check the way in which the treaty on the  delimitation of competences and authorities was being  implemented. In essence it was a demonstration of the fact that  the method developed for tackling regional conflicts has  importance outside Russia as well, because this visit took place  against the background of the crisis between Kiev and  Simferopol, the Crimean problem.""    He continues: ""I personally believe that taking account of  Ukraine's specific features, of the fact that it is a unitary  state, the method that was used to tackle that regional crisis  is suitable for the Ukrainian situation. It is suitable for the  Dniester Republic, and for Karabakh, but it is most clearly  suitable for tackling the Crimean problem.    ""Three years ago, relations between Moscow and Kazan were  almost identical to those that have developed between Kiev and  Simferopol. There were shows of force; there were decisions by  the Supreme Soviets annulling each other's resolutions; there  was a decision by the Constitutional Court; and there was a  referendum. We had enough self-possession and commonsense to  avoid a scenario involving force, and to find a proper and  civilized scheme for solving the problem. One was found, taking  account of reciprocal interests, involving compromise, talks,  and the delimitation of authorities.""    Asked about relations between Moscow and Chechnya, Shakhray  says that politicians both in Russia and in Chechnya are now  looking for a way out of difficult economic situations: ""I  would say there are two points that one ought to concentrate on.  They are the coordinated fight against crime and the tackling  of economic problems. This is the way toward a general easing  of the situation and toward a draft treaty on the division of  competences and powers.""    Medvedev then asks Shakhray whether Ruslan Khasbulatov could  come back to Russian politics as a deputy from Chechnya.  Shakhray says that at the moment there is a conflict between  Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and Ruslan Khasbulatov.  Shakhray continues: ""I have to think of a situation whereby  Khasbulatov and Dudayev reach agreement between themselves. In  essence, they can agree that Dudayev concludes an economic  agreement or a treaty with Russia and holds elections to the  Federation Council. If Khasbulatov stands as a candidate for  these elections -- although he might discard politics altogether  -- but if he stands as a candidate one might suppose that he can  be elected during the elections. Then the republic will remain  under Dudayev's leadership. Khasbulatov will then move from the  republic to the Federation Council. This is not science  fiction, this is a political combination, a political option  that politicians both in Groznyy and in Moscow have to think  about.""     "

From there and as part of  the process of integrating into its geographic surroundings,  Cuba will promote commercial, cultural, and athletic relations  with the entire eastern Caribbean.    Just before leaving for Bridgetown, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro  Cabezas told PRENSA LATINA that the Barbadian Government's  decision to authorize the opening of a Cuban Embassy in its  territory was further confirmation of the Caribbean countries'  willingness to integrate the largest of the Antillean islands  into the region where it rightfully belongs.    ""Cuba and Barbados have had diplomatic relations since 8  December 1972, but based on our country's rapprochement with the  Anglo-Caribbean community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market],  we now have the opportunity to establish a Cuban mission in  Bridgetown, Cabezas said.    He reported that the main purpose of his activities in  Barbados and as concurrent ambassador to the eastern Caribbean  region will be to strengthen economic and commercial relations  with the region and promote cultural and athletic ties, for  which there is excellent raw material in the Caribbean and a  considerable amount of experience in Cuba, he added.    Cabezas explained that one of his goals is to implement a  sports and cultural cooperation agreement signed with Barbados  in 1983 but never put into affect.    The ambassador announced he will present his credentials to  the Grenadian Government on 5 April. Cuba reestablished  relations with that country in March 1992. Relations between the  two countries cooled as a result of the events surrounding the  overthrow and murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the  subsequent 1983 U.S. military invasion.    Cabezas is accredited as concurrent ambassador to the  Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Bahamas, St.  Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.    The only Caricom members yet to normalize relations with  Cuba  are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, and Barbados. As of  this past December, Cuba has maintained a joint commission  before Caricom.    At the beginning of the current decade, the Cuban Foreign  Relations Ministry launched a diplomatic offensive in the  Caribbean that was crowned by the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations with nearly all Caricom pact members and Cuba's  admission into the organization's cooperation mechanisms.    The climax of the regional rapprochement was Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina's official seven-nation tour this past  November. On that occasion, Robaina stated that the region has  become one of Cuba's foreign policy priorities.    Cabezas said that at the end of April, Cuba will participate  in the First Global Conference on Sustainable Development by  Small Insular States, which is sponsored by the United Nations  and is scheduled to take place in Barbados.    He added that Cuba expects to participate in the event with  the best proposals prepared by the country's social, scientific,  and ecological nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Cuba  expects to share its achievements in areas of common interests  with its sister nations.     "

During the opening ceremony of the first subregional  cooperation meeting of representatives from Argentina, Bolivia,  Chile, and Peru, Mario Soliz said he hopes effective policies  for trafficking control will be established.    During the first session of this meeting, which will last  until 3 February, the Bolivian Government raised two programs  that represent the basis for the alternative development  strategy: the opening of export markets and the establishment of  a Subregional Fund for Alternative Development [Fondo  Subregional Para el Desarrollo Alternativo]. National  International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio said the  Bolivian Government is committed to combating drug trafficking,  its consequences, and one of its main causes: poverty.    Soliz explained that the basic task for the four cooperating  countries is to enhance control and coordination at various  levels within that broad area of thousands of kilometers of  shared borders.    Soliz said: ""There are highways, roads, railways, sea  routes,  and airways, which are clandestine routes for drugs, chemicals,  and precursors. These borders are currently violated by  criminal drug organizations.""    In the case of Bolivia, Soliz said, this violation has a  very  serious cultural component because coca, a sacred element for  Bolivians, seriously worries the world when its use does not  conform to the traditional practices that have been a custom in  our area for hundreds of years.    The social defense secretary said: ""Despite efforts by the  Bolivian Government in the field of drug enforcement,  eradication of coca crops, and alternative development policy,  drug trafficking activities have increased.""    After indicating that Bolivia has achieved significant  advancements, Soliz noted that 47 percent of the entire coca  crops existing in 1987 have been eradicated.    Soliz added: ""Nevertheless, while our country was conducting  this huge task, supported by international cooperation, the  international drug cartels attempted to increase the illegal  crop.""    Soliz indicated that this subregional meeting of  representatives of the four participating countries shows the  responsibility of establishing an alliance against the ""deadly  challenge"" posed by trafficking to their governments and  populations. He said that discussions will focus on all the  aspects of the drug problem, including the opening of export  markets for products yielded by the replacement of crops within  the framework of alternative development and ways to increase  the effectiveness of interdiction.    The social defense secretary said the discussions will also  involve controls on chemicals trafficking and issues of a  scientific, moral, and human nature, including the worrisome  question: Why do people take drugs?    National International Relations Secretary Jaime Aparicio  said the efforts made by the producing countries, like Bolivia,  are not matched by the international community.    Aparicio stressed: ""This meeting is part of a drug  enforcement strategy that views with interest a solution to  illegal drug production, trade, and abuse.

It was also the largest manufacturing plant that labor has organized in Los  Angeles in more than two decades, according to Dave Sickler, the AFL-CIO's  regional director and one of organized labor's most fervent advocates of  organizing immigrants.

In addition, Canada wishes to explore the possibility of  creating a technical and scientific cooperation sub-group in the  Mexico-Canada Ministerial Commission, similar to a sub-group  recently established between Mexico and the United States.    The sub-group would attend to matters related to scientific  exchange programs between the two countries, human resources  follow-up, technology transfer, and environment protection and  improvement programs. The two countries approved the creation  of the sub-group, which is expected to meet at the next  Ministerial Commission's session, according to the Foreign  Relations Secretariat.    It has also been reported that a new proposal for a  memorandum of understanding on fishing cooperation that the  Canadian Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans presented to the  Mexican Fisheries Secretariat is still being negotiated.    According to bilateral agreements, Mexican inspectors at  Canada's request would travel to eastern Canadian provinces in  the first week of April 1994 to conduct phytopathological  inspections of apple orchards.    The Canadian Government's request to lift the current  tariffs  on wheat and barley exports to that country is also being  studied. Several enterprises consider the possibility of  investing in energy and mining. The enterprise Canada World  Construction will spend 300 million new pesos to mine granite  and limestone in Izucar de Matamoros. Campbell Resources will  prospect for and mine gold.    In this first visit, the prime minister will attend the  closing of the industrial and services exposition, Canada  Expo-94, where more than 450 enterprises are represented and  which is Canada's largest commercial venture abroad.    President Salinas reportedly had dinner with Chretien  yesterday. The prime minister today is scheduled to meet with  Salinas at the Los Pinos official residence. Chretien will meet  with Mexican congress members and offer a reception at the Banco  General de Canada. He will also meet with Mexico City Mayor  Manuel Aguilera Gomez, will stand at attention at the Homeland's  Altar, and hold a news conference at the Canadian Embassy.     "

Cape Town, in the  meantime, has become one of the fastest growing cities in africa.    These trends emerge from statistics supplied by the latest  [South African Institute of] Race Relations survey. The survey,  recording the results of the most recent census, shows that  between 1986 and 1991 the population of South Africa (excluding  the `independent' homelands) grew at an average rate of 1.9  percent. A year, compared with 2.3 percent. Between 1980 and  1985.    Nevertheless, by the year 2018 the country's population will  be close to 80m [million], the maximum number of people South  Africa's water and other resources can support.    In 1993 the total population (including the ten homelands)  was 40.3m, according to an Urban Foundation estimate quoted in  the survey.    Key projections, recorded in the survey, indicate that by  2010, 69 percent (33.2m) of the total African population will  live in urban areas and 31 percent (15.2m) in rural areas. This  means that some 22m additional people will have to be provided  for in urban areas by 2010.    By 2000 the population of Natal will comprise 23 percent of  the total South African population, of which 54 percent will be  living in the Durban area. With an average growth rate for its  African population of more than 13 percent a year between 1982  and 1992, Cape Town is one of the fastest growing cities in  Africa. The African population of Cape Town more than trebled  between 1982 and 1992 from 200,000 in 1982 to more than 900,000  in 1992 -- an increase of 350 percent.    Despite widespread school disruptions, the survey records  that the proportion of the population with standard six or more  increased from 32.6 percent in 1985 to 37.4 percent in 1991.  Those with some form of post-matric education increased from 3  percent in 1985 to 3.7 percent in 1991.    The survey notes, however, that 3m people over the age of 18  (10 percent of the population) have no schooling at all, while  1.4m (14 percent of the population of school-going age) are not  at school.    The survey records that Zulu, Afrikaans and northern Sotho  are the most widely spoken home languages in the country and the  majority of South Africans are Christians. Of these the largest  proportion (5.4m people) belong to African independent churches,  followed by the Dutch Reformed Church (3.2m people) and the  Roman Catholic Church (2.3m people).    According to the World Bank, the survey notes, the pattern  of  urbanised land in South Africa is contributing to the  inefficiencies of its cities. This includes the spatial  separation of (former) black and white cities, the high  concentration of jobs and services in (former) white areas, and  the location of high-density, low-income areas on the fringe of  the cities.    Recommended solutions include increasing the densities of  residential areas (which would require a change in current  land-use zoning regulations) and concentrating settlements  around urban centres.

Mr. Vu Quang,  director of the government committee for religious affairs, in a  recent interview with the Vietnamese weekly DAI DOAN KET (Great  Solidarity) provided an outline on these issues.    Mr. Vu Quang said that in the middle of last month, the  Vatican sent a representative delegation headed by Deputy  Foreign Minister Claudio Celli to Vietnam for a week to work on  issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics and issues of mutual  concern. That follows the 1990 visit of Cardinal (?Wilsur  Heshgaray) to Vietnam. The cardinal and the Vietnamese  Government agreed that the Vatican would inform the Vietnamese  Government of all issues relating to Vietnamese Catholics, and  only make a decision upon agreement reached with the Vietnamese  Government. These issues include Vatican policy, the  consecration of cardinals, bishops, and issues of mutual  concern. When there are contradictory opinions, the two sides  will meet for discussion. Up to now, the Vatican has sent four  delegations to Vietnam, and Vietnam has also sent delegations to  the Vatican. Eighteen bishops have been consecrated out of the  approval of the Vietnamese Government upon office from the  Vatican. During the last month visit to Vietnam, the Vatican  reaffirmed the 1990 agreement. The Vatican delegation  acknowledged that it was illogical to have a number of dioceses  without bishops, as the Vatican delayed making a decision on  personnel that the Vatican has proposed in the first place in  which the Vietnamese Government has already approved. This  time, both sides agreed to find a solution to the issue soon.  The Vietnamese Government has agreed on the personnel proposed  by the Vatican and to the bishops of Hanoi and Hue dioceses.    As for the cases of Khanh Hoa and Thanh Hoa provinces, the  Vietnamese Government will consider an answer to Vatican in the  shortest period of time. In Ho Chi Minh City, both sides agreed  to keep up Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh in his position with full  responsibility and power. The Vietnamese Government will  discuss with the Vatican the successor to the archbishop in the  Ho Chi Minh City Diocese.    Vietnam makes clear that the Vatican by asking Vietnamese  Catholic priests not to join the Committee of United Vietnamese  Catholics with the reason that the priests should not carry out  political activities, the Vatican has [word indistinct]  Vietnamese law, citizen rights, and human rights for the priests  who have the rights to participate in social and patriotic  activities. Vietnam makes clear that while the Vatican  prevented Vietnamese Catholic priests from joining the Committee  of United Vietnamese Catholics and other social organizations it  lets some overseas Vietnamese Catholic priests carry out  political activities, and the Vatican itself, slandering the  situation of Vietnamese Catholics, and against the Vietnamese  Government. It is a lack of goodwill attitude towards Vietnam,  causing obstacles to normal relations between the Vatican and  Vietnam.    The head of the Vatican delegation will report to the  responsible priesthood in the Vatican on discussion in Vietnam,  to remove all obstacles to normalize relations between the  Vatican and the Vietnamese Government.

The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.     "

The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.     "

By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA ANA      One young Latino chases another through a parking lot and slams him against the  trunk of a car.    ""Chill out! Chill out!"" the youth under attack pleads. But the fight goes on  and both combatants fall to the ground.    ""Cut!"" the director barks, and the two men break apart and smile. An  appreciative audience of extras and crew applauds.    Though the seconds-long fight scene took hours to produce, it will not find its  way into a Hollywood movie or an episode of MacGyver.    Instead, it will become part of a training video for police officers in Orange  County. The fight between the two young men -- which in the film occurs at a  family party -- sets up the entrance of two police officers who demonstrate how  to close down the rowdy affair without inciting the guests to more violence.    Through such examples, the Orange County Human Relations Commission and Santa  Ana Police Department -- which co-produced the film -- hope to show police  officers that a better understanding of culturally and ethnically sensitive  situations can make their jobs easier and boost their image in minority  communities.    One of the videos is aimed at raising police officers' awareness of Latino  culture and another will deal with the Vietnamese community.    Editing has begun on the Latino video, which recently finished shooting with a  mix of professional and amateur actors at locales around Orange County -- from  a Santa Ana burger stand to the surf and sands at Huntington Beach.    The script for the video, to be called ""Common Ground,"" was written by Jose  Cruz Gonzalez of the Hispanic Playwrights Project at South Coast Repertory. One  of its main points is that Latinos, like police officers, place a high degree  of importance on being treated with respect.    The script calls for an ""Adam-12"" type format in which a pair of actors playing  police officers are seen in re-enactments of actual incidents. The incidents  were chosen to show how recognition of cultural differences can defuse  potential confrontations and improve the image of police in the Latino  community.    In one scene, for instance, the senior officer agrees to honor the request of a  suspected wife-beater who wants to be handcuffed outside his house and out of  sight of his children.    ""It doesn't hurt to take a minute and explain what we're doing. Besides, maybe  next time his kids see one of us they won't be afraid,"" the actor/officer  explains to his partner.    In the party scene, officers respond to a complaint about noise at a  quinceanera, a traditional Mexican-debut celebration marking a girl's 15th  birthday.    Aware that a fight between two youths has just occurred outside, the officers  take the girl's father out of earshot from the others and explain that the  party is out of control. They courteously ask him to tell everyone to go home.    ""Respect,"" the officer later tells his partner. ""That's all it takes.""    The project has received an outpouring of support and donations from Latino  groups and businesses, police departments and corporate donors, according to  Vicki Plevin, who is co-producing the videos for the Human Relations  Commission.

Jay Palomino of Westminster, vice president of Manos Unidas, said the group's  members felt their participation was important to help make officers more aware  of cultural differences. In times past, ""they didn't have the ethnic  sensitivity they should have,"" he said.    One incident that outraged Westminster's Latino community was the July, 1988,  shooting of 18-year-old Frank Martinez in his back yard during a birthday  celebration for his mother. Police maintained that Martinez and an angry mob  attacked three officers who were at the home to question Martinez's brother  about a neighborhood gang incident. Martinez's family, however, has claimed  that police shot the unarmed youth as he tried to rise from the ground and  flee.    The Orange County Grand Jury decided not to indict any of the officers involved  in the shooting, but the family has filed a $110-million lawsuit against the  Westminster Police Department, alleging violations of civil rights.    Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Human Relations Commission, said the  video project was approved in hopes of improving understanding between police  and Latinos.    ""It is very desirable among (police) departments to build better relationships  in the Hispanic community,"" Kennedy said.    Santa Ana Police Officer Kevin Brown served as technical adviser on the  project, making sure that the two actors looked, talked and appeared like real  officers. Among other things, he made sure that they carried their flashlights  in their left hands in case they needed to reach for their guns in a hurry. And  he showed them how to carry billy clubs on their laps in a patrol car.    Plevin said the project is also receiving technical help from police  departments in Westminster, Anaheim, Garden Grove, Huntington Beach, San  Clemente and Fullerton, and from the Orange County Sheriff's Department.    The videos, which are being produced on a $10,000 budget, are intended  primarily to be shown to police officers at roll calls before they head out on  daily patrol, Plevin said.

Severance of Iran-U.S.  ties 15 years ago on this day is one of those events which took  place after the lapse of just a few months following the victory  of the Islamic revolution in Iran.    Hence the events which occurred in that juncture and also  with the years following the severance of Tehran-Washington ties  are indicative of an open opposition in the two countries  relations. This opposition which clearly emerged following the  victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran due to the  anti-arrogant character of the Islamic Republic of Iran and  termination of US intervention in Iran's internal affairs, in  fact is viewed as the main reason for the severance of ties  between Tehran and Washington.    At present too when these severance of ties have entered the  16th year, it seems that the statesmen in Washington are still  faced with doubt in accepting the reality of the Islamic  revolution and improperly [word indistinct] the present status  of Iran on the international and regional scenes.    A glance at the record of the statesmen in Washington  vis-a-vis Iran, during more than a decade, specially in the  recent years show that the U.S. statesmen have constantly tried  to force their demands on Iran.    Hence it must be said that it is the mode of thinking of  U.S.  statesmen and also their unrealistic approach towards bilateral  relations which has taken the Iran-U.S. ties out of a rational  and principled course.    It is however indisputable that Washington's insistence on  continuing this trend has entailed the removal of favourable  grounds for establishment of ties between the two countries.    It is clear that as long as the US insists on continuing  such  a policy no positive change in the two countries' ties can be  expected.    On the other hand the hostile performance of the U.S.  leaders  during the recent months also showed that the U.S. continues to  pursue its desire for isolating the Islamic Republic of Iran on  the international scene and that the US officials have made  great efforts in this connection in order to prevent Iran from  expanding its ties with the European governments including those  of Germany, France as well as Japan.    The U.S. has put its European allies under pressure to  achieve its goal.    But these efforts which were primarily aimed at putting  economic pressure did not reach anywhere and as political  analysts say the U.S. policy in this connection has failed.    At any rate according to political analysts the Islamic  republic of Iran is considered as a powerful country which is  playing a vital role in the trend of the regional developments.    This role is being assessed as significant by the U.S.  leaders in so far as the central Asia and the security of the  Persian Gulf are concerned.    And this is the reality which the U.S. leaders are forced to  accept.    Any how during the past fifteen years the Islamic Iran has  proved that it wants peaceful coexistence in the international  community and will never compromise the principles of the  revolution with any country including the U.S.     "

For the first time it is  willing to host an official Israeli delegation for at  international economic forum. These two developments are enough  to indicate the change in Israeli-Jordanian relations over the  last week. There are in addition, however, reports on a series  of economic projects of great importance to both Jordan and  Israel which are in an advanced stage of negotiations. Among  these projects are the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal Project; a joint  park in the 'Arava; establishing a civilian tourism  subcommittee; building a road from al-'Aqabah to Taba via Elat,  and establishing a tripartite Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian  framework for dealing with banking and financial issues.    This assortment of issues indicates that Jordan views the  peace process not merely in declarative terms, but as a means to  advance and implement its vital interests. Jordan no longer  regards itself as the guardian and representative of the  Palestinian problem. From now on it will try to compete with  the Palestinians over the benefits accruing from the peace  process.    The Gaza-Jericho agreement undoubtedly facilitated the  Washington talks this week. Jordan's concern lest it will lose  economic strongholds such as the banks and the supremacy of the  Jordanian dinar to the Palestinians also contributed to the  success. These strongholds harbor a lot of political power  which can influence the functioning of the Palestinian autonomy  as well as Jordan's economy, which is at a dangerous low.    Israel, for its part, has always wanted to maintain normal  neighborly relations with Jordan, and such relations have  existed de facto. The open bridges policy inaugurated by Dayan,  the generally calm border maintained by Jordan, and the secret  meetings between Israeli leaders and King Husayn only  strengthened the relations between the two countries. Israel  and Jordan have both regarded each other as strategic partners  for foiling the establishment of a Palestinian state.    Israel is interested both in the autonomy's success and in  strengthening Jordan's status in the region. In fact, the two  are mutually dependent. Without cooperation with Jordan the  Palestinian economy will crumble and will become a dead weight  on Israel's economy; without cooperation with the autonomy, on  the other hand, the Jordanian economy might suffer deeper  unemployment, a loss of income, and the rise of radical elements.    Now that the Palestinian problem has been detached from the  negotiations with Jordan and has become an independent problem,  negotiations with Jordan can become an easier affair. It is  relatively easy to solve the border demarcation problem between  Israel and Jordan, because this border does not constitute a  strategic buffer as does the Golan Heights. Other controversial  issues can be solved via reasonable negotiations. With a  modicum of goodwill these negotiations will resemble  negotiations between friendly countries.    It is still hard to assess whether Jordan has proceeded with  Syria's blessing or despite its opposition. Syria has still not  given up its efforts to delay the process until negotiations  with it score significant progress. Until the agreements are  signed, we should be cautious in our assessment of the process.  There is no doubt, however, that the quick progress made in  negotiations with Jordan could facilitate the negotiations with  Syria and Israel's acceptance by the entire Arab world.     "

Indeed, no country is more important to our national interests,  as the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said when launching an  Australia-Indonesia trade and cultural promotion in Sydney on  Wednesday [16 March]. This is a political tenet that will  become even more apparent as the Asia-Pacific region fulfills  its economic potential.    Three of the world's four most populous nations -- China,  India and Indonesia -- are in Asia. All three are involved in  phases of unprecedented economic growth. Australia's challenge,  as a democracy becoming more independent of its non-Asian  traditions, is to develop ways to participate in this expansion  and to benefit from it. Our success depends on enhancing our  relations with nations about which many Australians still hold  alien and fearful views.    In these terms Indonesia is integral to Australia's destiny.  Bilateral relations have been rigorously tested over the years  -- hardly surprising between two such disparate neighbours.  There will be other difficult encounters in the future. As Mr  Keating said, ""We are different people with different cultures  and different views on issues which matter to us."" The strength  of the relationship will depend on being able to manage those  differences. The evidence is both sides are prepared to make  the effort.    The political understanding between Canberra and Jakarta is  perhaps sounder now than at any time since the first few years  of Indonesian independence. Efforts to broaden mutual contacts  are supported on both sides. Both nations are committed to the  Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation [APEC] forum as a vehicle for  regional policy development -- with most APEC members  considering Indonesia's leadership as fundamental to the group's  success. On issues of defence, security and regional  co-operation, such as the United Nations effort to restore  peaceful government in Cambodia, Jakarta has been active and  positive in its involvement.    At another important level, the governments of Queensland,  Western Australia and the Northern Territory have shown  initiative by developing extensive links with Indonesian  regions. Two-way traffic in trade, education, defence and  tourism is growing -- though it continues to be modest in terms  of potential projections.    These developments have been largely guided by the advent in  Jakarta of a regime that, while not democratic in the western  tradition, can be characterised as moderate. The challenge  inside Indonesia to liberalise the political system without a  loss of national stability is also being faced in a positive  way. The prospects for a smooth succession from the long reign  of President Suharto appear good. The system is not as open as  Australians are used to. But in the peculiarly Indonesian  context of having to balance complex political, military and  ethno-cultural allegiances it has been successful in raising  living standards for most people, and in a relatively stable  manner.    It would be wrong to raise expectations about the Australia-  Indonesia relationship beyond what can be sustained. Our  peoples and languages are and ever will be different. So are  the values we admire in our respective societies. However, the  relationship is gathering strength. Continuing efforts to  remove misconceptions on both sides are needed. But thanks to  the broadening of mutually beneficial contacts, there is less  excuse for the relationship to be clouded by misunderstanding or  ignorance.     "

They warned that Saudi Arabia's cold reception could push  Jordan further towards Syria -- Israel's arch Arab foe.    King Fahd cold-shouldered the Jordanian monarch during his  visit, ignoring the opportunity for a reconciliation meeting.    It was King Husayn's first trip to Saudi since July 1990,  just before the Gulf crisis erupted. But he cut short his visit  Wednesday when he was ignored by Saudi authorities.    Relations between the two countries soured during the Gulf  crisis when Riyadh accused Amman of backing Iraqi President  Saddam Husayn, whose forces had invaded and occupied Kuwait.    Although ties with Saudi Arabia have traditionally been  complicated because of old rivalries between the two ruling  families, Jordan has found itself increasingly isolated in the  rest of Arab world since the end of the war.    Officially, Jordanian authorities played down the Saudi  trip,  saying the only purpose had been the king's pilgrimage.    But privately a senior Jordanian official commented: ""There  was a clear desire by the Saudis to humiliate not only the  Hashemite family...but also the Jordanian Government.""    And although the snub clearly came from Riyadh, Jordanian  leaders say it was prompted by the United States, keen to step  up pressure on Amman to sign a peace accord with Israel.    Israel and Jordan signed a common peace agenda in Washington  on September 14 -- a day after the historic Israeli-PLO autonomy  accord was agreed -- to serve as a framework for future talks  between the two countries.    But several sticking points remain, notably border  demarcations, water sharing rights and the issue of the  Palestinian refugees who fled to Jordan in the 1967 Middle East  war.    In January King Husayn held talks with U.S. President Bill  Clinton during a visit to Washington discussing Jordan's debt to  the United States, the side-effects of the UN-imposed embargo on  Iraq for Jordan and prospects for restoring links with Saudi  Arabia.    ""Sign a peace treaty with Israel and all these issues will  be  sorted out,"" a senior Jordanian official, who asked to remain  anonymous, quoted the U.S. President as saying.    But King Husayn has said he is anxious to avoid protracted  negotiations, which have marked the Israeli-PLO relationship.  The dialogue has been suspended since the February 25 Hebron  mosque massacre.    Jordan remains unwelcome in other Gulf states apart from  Oman  and Qatar. Jordanian officials announced Thursday that King  Husayn is to visit Qatar for the first time since February 20.  An unconfirmed report said the visit would take place on March  20.    Relations with Egypt are also cool and Amman's estrangement  from the Palestine Liberation Organisation was revealed when PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat chose not to tell Amman of the secret  talks with Israel which led to September's accord.    Officials say that as a result of Jordan's isolation it is  being pushed closer towards Syria, in a move bound to worry U.S.  leaders.    But in Jordanian political circles the message Thursday was  that following the Saudi snub, King Husayn has even less reason  to make conciliatory moves towards Israel.     "

Economics Minister P.K. Chiang, who just returned from  Penang, Malaysia, where on Saturday [23 April] he attended the  first meeting of the Council of Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce  in Asia, said his ministry will do its best to push for the  signing of bilateral investment guarantee pacts and agreements  to avoid double taxation with every Southeast Asian country. It  will also seek to set up formal channels of dialogue and  communication with governments there.    The Economics Ministry estimated that at least 3,200  production lines of local manufacturers have been relocated in  Southeast Asian countries. Two-way trade between Taiwan and  those countries reached US$6.62 billion in the first quarter of  the year, a 9.3 percent increase over the same period last year.    According to statistics released by the cabinet-level  Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the number of ethnic  Chinese in Southeast Asia has surpassed 30 million, which  accounts for 86 percent of the total number of overseas Chinese.    In view of the huge number of ethnic Chinese in the region,  Chiang urged both state and Koumintang run enterprises to invest  in Southeast Asia to match the government's ""southern strategy,""  which encourages local business people to invest in Southeast  Asia rather than in Mainland China.    THE ECONOMIST, a British news magazine, recently reported  that the economic strength of ethnic Chinese in Southeast Asia  is of vital importance to the region. Ethnic Chinese in  Malaysia only make up one third of the total population there,  but they hold nearly 50 percent of listed stock shares.    Likewise, the Chinese minority in Indonesia accounts for  only  3 percent of the total population, but owns 70 percent of all  companies in the country. Except for the petroleum industry and  state-owned corporations, ethnic Chinese control about 50  percent of Indonesia's economy, the magazine said.    In Thailand, Chinese make up 12 percent of the population,  but control as much as 90 percent of the entire country's  capital. Fifty percent of Thailand's financial and banking  institutions are also under control of ethnic Chinese.    Given the prevailing economic strength of ethnic Chinese in  Southeast Asia, the government has begun paying attention to its  relations with ethnic Chinese population there while trying to  sell its ""southern strategy.""    In an effort to build warm relations between Taiwan  investors  and ethnic Chinese businessmen, Mainland Affairs Council  Chairman Huang Kun-hui and his deputy, Kao Koong-lian, will soon  visit countries in Southeast Asia to promote the southern policy.    By explaining the government's position and its strategies,  Huang and Kao hope to start a formula under which Taiwan  enterprises and ethnic Chinese communities in those countries  can break into the mainland Chinese market hand in hand.    The Mainland Affairs Council and the Economics Ministry will  also draw up new plans to jointly encourage more local  investments in southeast Asia.    Chiang said the government's southern strategy was not  designed to curb Taiwan investments in Mainland China, but is  meant to offer an alternative for Taiwan industries keen to  expand into overseas markets.

During the meeting President Berisha told Anderson: We are  assessing your mission's efforts to preserve stability and  prevent the conflict, because Albania is deeply interested in  preventing this conflict. However, we observe with anxiety that  the tension continues to remain high and the danger great. The  latest developments in Gorazde and the defeat of the United  Nations and other institutions have greatly increased  possibilities for the conflict to spread down through the region.    Regarding the crisis in Albanian-Greek relations, President  Berisha stressed that the Albanian side has continuously tried  for a policy of understanding and cooperation with its southern  neighbor. However, he said, we ascertain that besides the  Greek-Serb alliance, the Greek Government has continuously used  the Albanian refugee factor as pressure against our country's  sovereignty.    On the other hand, Greek Government officials have attempted  to manipulate certain minority elements to fulfill Greece's open  territorial vindications against Albania. The last case -- the  massacre by the Greek commando at the recruit barracks in  Peshkepi e Siperme -- was an attack against Albania's  sovereignty, for which the Greek Government should bear  responsibility. The Greek commando came from Greek territory  and returned to this territory, too. It had all the  characteristics of a commando of the Greek special forces or  forces with special training. That is why we have raised this  problem to the UN Security Council and the CSCE and have asked  the European Union to set up a commission, despite  investigations carried out by our both commissions, because  Greece cannot be a party in the judgment.    However, we are determined to overcome contradictions  through  dialogue and hope that the other side shows the same will as  well.    Regarding Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], President Berisha stressed that Albania is  profoundly interested in cooperation with this Republic and in  its stability. A considerable percentage of the population in  that Republic is Albanian. I can say that with their  participation in the government, the loyalty they have shown  toward the coalition, and the democratic means and methods they  have used and continue to use to realize their human and  national rights, the Albanians are and will be a factor of  stability.    Without negating the achievements in the field of rights and  freedoms, we insist that the realization of their human and  national rights is an important condition for Macedonia's  stability. In this aspect, the census of the population, the  opening of the schools, and the increasing commitment of the  Albanians in the official structures can be considered by us as  important steps.    For his part, Anderson expressed his concern over the  situation in the region and particularly in Macedonia. The  pressure exerted from Serbia, the possible explosion of a  conflict in Kosova, and the blockade from the south endanger the  stability of this Republic. In this direction, the cooperation  between Albania and Macedonia is useful and serves stability in  the region. We consider the solution of many questions that  preoccupy the Albanians there to be an indispensability and we  are insisting that the Macedonian Government fulfill the demands  of Albanians. We are presently working to accomplish the census  of the population and hope that it will be held in June this  year.     "

What is this -- a new policy from Tokyo or coincidence?    After Boris Yeltsin's visit to Japan, the process of the  clarification of relations between Moscow and Tokyo through  conflict and outrage has entered a sluggish stage: It is  thought that there will be no more surprises, pleasant or  unpleasant. Only professional Russian patriots still suspect  President Yeltsin and Minister Kozyrev of harboring a secret  desire to sell off the Kuril islands.    In the president's entourage, beginning with Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, there are no politicians prepared to  fulfill the provisions of the 1956 Soviet-Japanese declaration  and renounce either two or four islands at the southern end of  the Kurils chain.    When Tokyo objects to Russia's full-fledged participation in  the G-7 conference, this looks like an attempt to obtain  something from Russia by barter.    When Koji Watanabe, Japanese ambassador in Moscow, spoke to  me he protested keenly: The new prime minister cannot take a  tough line. Hata came to Moscow as foreign minister and vice  premier in mid-March and talked with Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Andrey Kozyrev about expanding dialogue between the two  countries and about Russia's role in the world economy.  Meanwhile, the future premier was not received by Boris Yeltsin  on that occasion, a fact which hardly left the Japanese visitor  with fond memories.    The top Moscow leadership has lost interest in political  talks with Japan. The level of diplomacy has fallen to that of  Poland.    Ambassador Watanabe refuses to recognize that  Russian-Japanese relations are deadlocked:    ""From the day that I arrived in Moscow back in January this  year I have heard the most appalling predictions about  hyperinflation, disorder, and political destabilization. Not  one of them has come true.""    The 60-year old Koji Watanabe is well known for his love of  an open fire, which he kindles himself, his nostalgia for the  warmth of Italy, where he represented his country before coming  to Moscow, and the frenetic energy with which he acquainted  himself with all the even slightly well known people in the  Russian capital in just a few months.    ""I do not know whether I understand correctly what is going  on in Russia,"" Koji Watanabe remarked. ""Sometimes it seems to  me that I have understood something but then the next week I  come to the conclusion that I was hasty...""    Russian diplomats specializing in Japan consider Koji  Watanabe a hypercautious diplomat who avoids improvization and  adheres strictly to instructions received from Tokyo.    The Washington embassy is regarded as Japan's most important  mission; it has 50 percent more staffers than the Moscow  embassy. The embassies in Moscow and Beijing are in second  place. And Tokyo treats its embassies differently.    The small embassy building on Kalashnyy Lane used to have a  dining room for more than 60 diplomatic staff. The Japanese  Foreign Ministry considered it an unnecessary luxury to pay for  a chef and the dining room was closed. To make up for it,  staffers at the Japanese embassy in Moscow have been given three  weeks' extra recuperation leave. That detail provides the best  illustration of how the Japanese see life in Russia.     "

The number of racially motivated assaults or attempted assaults increased  nearly 5% over 1987, according to the report, while ""gay-bashing"" accounted for  the majority of hate crimes committed against homosexuals -- 64%.

On January 4, Barbados Foreign Minister Brandford Taitt and  South African Foreign Minister R.F. Botha had exchanged letters  indicating their intention to establish formal relations.    For over 30 years, Barbados had maintained a firm distance  from South Africa because of apartheid.

0,FT941-2325 ,"FT941-2325 _AN-ECVCOAA4FT 940322   FT  22 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Americas embrace 'open regionalism' - Stephen Fidler on rapid - some say worrying - trade integration      By STEPHEN FIDLER   Economic integration in Latin America seems to be going forward at breakneck pace. Hardly a week passes without a trade deal being signed or a new initiative announced. In the last few weeks, Brazil has launched an initiative for a South American free trade area and Mexico has signed a free trade agreement with Costa Rica. The US administration also has announced that a summit of the leaders of elected governments in the Americas would be held in Miami in December. Free trade in the western hemisphere will be one of the main talking points, with the coming into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico at the start of the year. These government moves are being accompanied by a sharp rise in trade within the region. Other Latin American countries accounted for 16.7 per cent of the region's exports in 1992, up from 10.8 per cent in 1990, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America. Trade expanded by more than 50 per cent in 1991 and 1992 and grew further last year. US exports to Latin America have doubled in seven years, rising to more than Dollars 80bn in 1993. Most governments claim the proliferation of free trade areas, customs unions and bilateral trade deals point in one direction - to what they call open regionalism. This means intensifying their relationships with other countries in the region while remaining open to the outside world. But not everybody believes that the haphazard network of trade alliances is necessarily benign. Mr Moises Naim, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in Washington and a former Venezuelan minister, says that far from being the building blocks of a hemispheric free trade zone, sub-regional free trade agreements 'are more likely to be stumbling blocks'. The Madrid-based Institute for European-Latin American Relations argued last year that the current round of market-driven regional trade accords - with ever greater links between those countries with the most dynamic economies - could reinforce rather than reduce wealth differentials among countries in the region. Even free trade with the US may not yield many trade benefits. A 1992 report from two World Bank economists suggested only Brazil and Mexico would benefit substantially from free trade with the US since most exports from most other countries already face low duties there. In July, Washington will name those countries that, in principle, would be eligible to negotiate free trade agreements with the US. The nomination does not commit the US to negotiations and says nothing about whether accession to Nafta or a bilateral trade accord with the US is the right way forward. The list will be next reviewed in 1997. In spite of the lack of trade benefits, most Latin governments will be anxious to see their names on the list. They are emphasising other reasons for joining Nafta: insurance in case the world further develops into regional trade blocs and the increased investment they believe is implied by being in the Nafta club. The process towards Nafta may not be that easy. Despite its promises to Chile that it will be next on the US free trade agenda, the administration of President Bill Clinton may not want to open another trade debate in a hurry. A lot of political capital was spent on securing the Nafta accord and other countries do not have the strategic significance to the US that Mexico has. Nonetheless, Nafta's attraction may well loosen the ties that are binding Latin American countries together. Argentina is generally thought to be next in line after Chile for Nafta treatment, but it is committed to negotiate with the US as part of Mercosur, a regional common market to come into force next year with Uruguay, Paraguay and Brazil. Yet Brazil's economic problems and the traditional mistrust of its governments for the US mean that Nafta is a low priority for Brazil. While Mercosur governments this month reiterated their intention of trying to negotiate jointly with third parties such as the US, Brazil also took the opportunity to launch its own South American free trade zone. The Brazilian government stressed that this was not meant to be a competitor to Nafta and that the two initiatives were complementary. But to some governments in the region, the initiative looks like a Brazilian attempt to recover some political weight lost in the region over the last decade and to counterbalance North American influence. Whatever the case, some economists believe the idea may have real economic merit if it gives neighbouring countries free access to the big and still relatively protected Brazilian market. 'In the short run,' says Mr Naim, 'Latin American exports could increase more through freer access to the Brazilian market than they could by signing a free trade agreement with the US.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- THE FASTEST GROWING TRADE RELATIONSHIPS IN LATIN AMERICA Reciprocal exports (Annual growth rate %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Relations governed by broad liberalisation agreements Argentina-Brazil       15.3   -4.5   18.4   24.2   22.1   43.3   59.0 Colombia-Venezuela      5.6   35.6    6.2   15.6   31.9   27.1   47.1 Argentina-Uruguay      35.4   28.3    3.8   -2.4   20.8   37.5   33.7 Argentina-Paraguay     16.7   11.5   -0.8   28.0   39.6    9.9   50.8 Chile-Mexico          -48.5   33.0  226.9  -17.8   16.2   13.6   44.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1986   1987   1988   1989   1990   1991   1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Relations not governed by agreements Brazil-Mexico         -32.3   -9.7   19.7   47.3   17.6   40.5   63.6 Mexico-Venezuela      -23.5   54.1    1.8   46.9  127.6  -19.9   54.3  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Commodity Trade Data Base (Comtrade) of the United Nations Statistical Division (Unstat), and other official sources.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

He admitted that the problems with the  islanders are currently ""the same as those of 160 years ago.""    The foreign minister thus referred to reports that indicate  that the Kelpers [Falklands Islanders] could negotiate the  exploration for oil with Chile, and that in no way will they  accept a joint venture with Argentina.    Di Tella said that this topic ""is in no way new"" because  ""the  British do not want Argentines on the islands, but they do not  have the same reserve for the Chileans.""    In remarks to a radio station, the foreign minister termed  the position of the islanders as ""lamentable,"" and warned that  the lack of contact with the continent ""will in time become a  ridiculous whim.""    Regarding the July 1994 meeting between Argentine and  British  delegations to evaluate possible bilateral cooperation in the  extraction of oil in the area, Di Tella highlighted his  ""pessimism"" on the probability of reaching an agreement.    ""We have said we are willing to cooperate on the oil topic  before seeking a definite solution to the problem of  sovereignty,"" he explained.    The foreign minister said the results of the negotiations  are  negative, adding that Argentina ""will legally oppose oil  exploitation.""    Although he acknowledged that ""until now the Kelpers have  been willing to evaluate the topic of cooperation,"" Di Tella  believes ""this could or could not imply Argentina's presence on  the islands.""    ""With respect to the Malvinas Islands, I believe our overall  relations suffer the same problems as 160 years ago,"" the  foreign minister admitted, adding that the government ""is  treating the situation with much greater importance than before.""    The foreign minister acknowledged that ""very important  progress has been made in communication with the islanders,  despite official resistance.""    ""I have written letters, sent them presents, spoken over the  radio, and publicly acknowledged that we believe it is important  to recognize their way of life. But we are still far from a  normal relationship,"" the foreign minister said about the  Kelpers.    Di Tella did not reject the possibility that Great Britain  may contract enterprises from other countries to extract oil,  although he added: ""This invitation will be difficult for them  because no one will want to participate in a zone that is in  litigation and where Argentina can proceed legally against  anyone who cooperates in the exploitation.""    Asked to name the organizations before which Argentina could  submit its complaints, the foreign minister replied: ""The United  Nations and the courts of the countries that import the oil.""    With respect to the participation of YPF [Government Oil  Deposits] in the bid to exploit oil through the Romano Houston  enterprise, which apparently bought plans of the areas where oil  presumably exists on the islands, Di Tella stated that he did  not know if the area is rich in oil.    Regarding the purchase of plans, Di Tella explained that ""it  was simply a way for YPF to obtain information,"" adding that  ""some very serious people believe there is no oil on the  islands.""    Finally, the foreign minister stated that the agenda for the  July summit ""does not contain the topic of a possible visit of  President Carlos Menem to Great Britain.""     "

It will be followed by a trip by a Chinese  minister to Paris and by a trip by French ministers to China in  order to develop economic relations. Indeed, the Chinese  believe that, in several spheres, French industry can bring them  a lot, and it can also bring a lot to employment in our country,  for instance through the development of power stations,  telecommunications projects, and -- it remains to be seen  whether this takes place -- projects for the export of French  wheat to China.    The aim was to turn a page in our relations and to resume  relations which would be more fruitful and more useful for the  two countries. This was my aim, and I believe that this aim has  been achieved.    [Harrouard] You tackled the issue of human rights with the  Chinese authorities. You chose to do so discreetly because you  believe that it is more efficient. However, dissidents were  arrested during your stay. Didn't that disturb your visit?    [Balladur] From the moment attitudes towards economy and  trade get closer, we enter the 21st century where attitudes  concerning political freedom, human rights, must be closer.  This is what I told my interlocutors. I told them it was an  evolution for which all countries should prepare themselves. As  for the precise problems which may arise, I mentioned them in a  purely private conversation and I had the opportunity to say  that, as far as this was concerned, it seemed to me that it was  more efficient to remain discreet because one should refrain  from upsetting one's interlocutor unnecessarily.    Let us look at what other countries do, those who would like  to give the impression that they can lecture others on this  subject: They are often those who ignore the beliefs they  usually show off when it is in their interest. As far as we  French are concerned, we must do two things simultaneously: We  must continue to assert our general beliefs -- this is our right  -- while respecting the attitudes and the beliefs of the others,  and making sure that, through understanding and dialogue, things  will evolve gradually.    [Harrouard] Does your visit to China mark the desire of the  prime minister to be more involved in international affairs, and  to go on more visits abroad?    [Balladur] I believe that, by far, my main task is in  France.  This is the main reason behind my mandate. Nevertheless, in  order to improve the situation of our country... [pauses] it is  starting to improve in the economic sphere and as far as  employment is concerned, although there are still many  difficulties. However, there are a whole range of international  matters which, quite obviously, are of interest to the  government. I believe that, as far as foreign policy is  concerned, our constitution gives responsibility to the  president, of course, and to the government, and that they must  carry them out on good terms. This is what happened for the  preparation of my trip to China, this is also what happened as  far as GATT was concerned, or last year's monetary crisis. I  have no plans to travel to any other foreign country in the near  future. Should I have other plans, it would be because I  consider it an important issue which affects the life of our  country and its economic and interior policy.     "

A similar measure has also been taken  between Britain and Russia. Meanwhile, the Russian and American  armed forces have arranged a joint military exercise for the  first time in early July, however, although only 500 soldiers  will be involved, the details have yet to be worked out. In  light of the sensitive discussions by the Russian press  regarding the areas along the Volga as the site of the exercise,  several American senators have suggested that the site of the  exercise should be changed to a U.S. military base, and now the  two sides are discussing the matter.    Both issues have symbolic significance. The former signifies  an ""end to the era of viewing each other as nuclear opponents""  between the two countries; the latter indicates that although  Russia and the United States are no longer ""nuclear opponents,""  it is not easy to build a new relationship in concrete terms.  These two matters quite clearly reflect the current situation  of the Russian-U.S. relations.    After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russian-U.S.  relations once became very ""hot,"" and the press in the West  called the situation a ""honeymoon"" in Russian-U.S. relations,  holding that this was a ""romantic period"" after the two  countries experienced a cold war and confrontation for more than  four decades. Since the end of last year, difficulties in  relations between the two countries have begun to increase. In  February this year, Russia acted alone to intervene in the  Sarajevo crisis, using vigorous political mediation to get rid  of NATO's air strike plan, thus, ending the ""honeymoon"" period  in Russian-U.S. relations. It seems that the relations between  the two countries are changing into a new phase.    There are many reasons for Russian-U.S. relations to change  from ""honeymoon"" to a condition of cooperation on the one hand  and competition on the other. One important reason is that  although the ideological factor which played a vital role in the  Soviet-U.S. relations in the past no longer exists, the  geopolitical interests of Russia and the United States, the two  big powers in the world, remain unchanged, and to a great extent  this determines the basic orientation of Russian-U.S. relations.  National interests, the status of a big country, and influence  on the world have already become the foundation stone of  Russia's diplomatic strategy. It seems that the United States  has not abandoned the ""restraining strategy"" it once used in the  past. The suspicious and precautionary mentality in the  relations between the two countries still exists.    Judged from a certain stance, changing the targets of  nuclear  warheads to the high seas also vividly reflects a new pattern of  relations between the major powers after the cold war: Gone are  the days when a clear line between friends and foes could be  drawn and confrontation between groups could be seen. A new  picture, more complicated and characterized by a condition in  which one is neither friend nor foe or both friend and foe, has  emerged. Proceeding from their own basic interests, Russia, the  United States, and other major Western powers attack, defend,  charge, and retreat in the big chess board of international  politics, and maneuver among various political groupings, to  strive for a better position in the emerging new world pattern.

Santamaria granted an interview to PRENSA LATINA, during  which he noted that important events had taken place in the past  few hours regarding relations between the two Latin American  countries.    Camilo Penaloza, Colombian deputy economic development  minister, ended a visit to Cuba yesterday. He was leading a  delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island.  The Colombian Navy training vessel Arc Gloria docked in Havana  Port, bringing a message of friendship to the Cuban people.    Moreover, the civil aeronautics directors of Colombia and  Cuba signed an agreement that will soon lead to the  establishment of regular flights by their airlines to link the  capitals and other cities of both countries.    As for the visit paid by the businessmen, Santamaria  explained it represents a specific step forward in the area of  possible joint business ventures by means of direct meetings  with the people who are able to invest in Cuba.    He also said the business delegation identified specific  points of cooperation and a new meeting was scheduled with  high-ranking Colombian and Cuban officials with the goal of  signing specific agreements. The meeting will soon be held in  Santa Fe de Bogota as bilateral talks move into their next round.    The visitors, he said, held meetings in which they were  informed of the Cuban economic outlook and the country's future,  as well as being informed of new types of foreign investments  approved by the Cuban state.    The diplomat said there is going to be continuity in these  types of visits, which are aimed at providing Colombian  companies with direct knowledge of existing opportunities in  Cuba for the establishment of enterprises that benefit both  sides.    Santamaria talked with great enthusiasm about the  aeronautics  agreement that has just been signed. He described the agreement  as the primary goal of the diplomatic mission in view of its  economic importance.    The agreement was based on the existence of actual market  needs because clear possibilities already exist for having  several weekly flights between the capitals and cities of Cuba  and Colombia, as is shown by the increase in the number of  tourist flights during the current year, he said.    The ambassador said the increase in the number of flights  between the two countries, not only for tourists but also for  businessmen and government officials, contributes to the  dynamics of bilateral relations.    It is an important agreement that was signed thanks to the  constructive position of Cuba, which can expect from us all the  loyalty one can expect from a brother country, he said.    In addition, Santamaria talked about the status of the  negotiations for expanding the partial agreement, which will  also allow, in the area of trade, a significant increase in  bilateral relations.    To this effect, the Colombian Government is currently  conducting consultations with the private sector regarding  tariffs that will affect more than 800 products included in the  expansion, which were the object of previous agreements in the  last meeting held in Havana.    We hope that in June or July of this year, the Colombian and  Cuban foreign trade ministers will sign the corresponding  document based on the work already done and the technical  meetings that have already been held, the ambassador said.

The minister asked the U.S. Government to intercede with the  UK in a gesture of political trust, to improve relations between  the two countries.    Nevertheless, Di Tella made it clear that trade relations  with the UK are excellent. But he stressed: We are in a very  bad mood over the embargo imposed on Argentina concerning the  re-equipment of its Armed Forces.    The Argentine foreign minister also confirmed the decision  to  remove the mines installed in the Malvinas Islands during the  1982 military conflict.    Here is a report from (Gaston Sulage):    [Begin recording] [(Sulage)] Thank you very much. Today,  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella opened a round of talks at San  Martin Palace between Argentine Foreign Ministry and U.S. State  Department officials with a broad agenda, basically including  issues linked to bilateral and regional security.    Foreign Minister Di Tella addressed Thomas McNamara, U.S.  State Department acting principal secretary for  political-military affairs [title as heard], and U.S. Ambassador  to Argentina James Cheek. Here are Di Tella's remarks:    [Di Tella] Have we managed to transmit the image of a  peaceful and cooperative Argentina to the world only to a  certain extent, as there is a country that is your and our ally  that doubts this image, namely the UK.    This is a very important issue for us. The UK not only  blocks material equipment like spare parts for a Rolls-Royce  turbine or airplanes, an issue that was discussed and for which  we are very grateful for the final decision you made, but  obstructs in a different way by expressing doubts about the  Argentine Republic. And the UK is a key country in the Western  alliance.    I actually believe the UK does not harbor any doubts. It  (?depends) on a disabling bureaucracy. It is hard to find a  bureaucrat who changes his or her opinion and takes the  initiative of saying dismissed [preceding word in English] on an  issue that has been dragging on for 12 years.    Nevertheless, this is a problem that bothers us a lot, not a  bit, but a lot. And I believe you can do a lot -- not a bit --  to end it.    I believe you have made a great effort concerning the  Skyhawk  issue. We appreciate your effort, not only as a material  gesture, but as a political gesture of trust, which actually is  what really counts.    We believe that the UK is allowing this issue to fade away.  It has its own internal lobbies [preceding word in English] and  does not want to appear one day saying: We have discontinued  the embargo.    Nevertheless, the embargo really puts us in a bad mood, in  an  extremely bad mood. Either the embargo is really justified or  else it involves people who read the newspapers every 10 years,  as there has been an overwhelming wealth of data here. Those  who do not want to acknowledge this overwhelming wealth of data  on a new Argentina at the international level are not aware of  what is happening in Argentina.    [(Sulage)] Di Tella also made it clear that the relationship  between Argentina and the UK is ambivalent because it is  surprisingly perfect commercially and culturally.

In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year. Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to be invited to London soon. The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries.

All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, and relevant units should abide by the  requirements of this ministry on halting the infringement of  trademark rights; act in light of local conditions in their own  localities and units; organize relevant export enterprises, and  especially the leaders of these enterprises, to study  conscientiously the circulars of the State Council and the  Supreme People's Court on dealing relentless blows to the  production and sale of fake commodities; and enhance their legal  awareness of trademarks.    2. All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, chambers of commerce, and head offices  should take responsibility and organize export enterprises in  their own localities or under their industries and trades to  conduct overall inspections of the possible manufacture and sale  of commodities using already-registered trademarks (including  accepting trademarks designated by foreign clients). Immediate  action must be taken to redress errors as soon as they are  uncovered.    3. No foreign trade enterprise is allowed to make use  of sales promotion activities -- such as trade fairs,  advertisements, and propaganda activities of any kind -- to  provide conveniences to factories engaged in the production of  counterfeit goods, including purchasing, exhibiting,  publicizing, and acting as agents for export commodities bearing  trademarks registered by others.    4. All localities should regard the use of trademarks  as part of their appraisal of the accomplishments of foreign  trade enterprises and their leaders. Enterprises that have  seriously violated trademark rules and regulations in their  daily operations will be deprived of their right to participate  in the annual appraisal and selection of outstanding enterprises.    5. All economic and trade commissions and departments,  foreign trade bureaus, chambers of import and export trade, and  head offices should report to this ministry promptly any case in  which an export enterprise is punished by judicial or industrial  and commercial departments for manufacturing and selling  commodities using the registered trademarks of others, as well  as for other law-breaking activities concerning trademarks.    6. Once export enterprises holding export permits are  certified guilty of producing and selling quota-administered  commodities using trademarks registered by others, MOFERT will  notify the relevant permit-issuing departments to suspend the  issuance of export and quota permits to such enterprises.  According to the seriousness of each case, this ministry will  suspend or annul the enterprise's autonomy in the export of  relevant commodities, or even terminate its right to handle  imports and exports.    It is a long-term task to eliminate counterfeit commodities  and halt trademark infringement. All economic and trade  administrative departments, as well as all relevant units,  should adopt feasible measures, work in close coordination with  the departments in charge, reinforce efforts to supervise and  guide export enterprises, and halt counterfeiting and  law-breaking activities in foreign trade according to the law.  This ministry will investigate and affix the responsibility on  leaders of competent administrative departments for failure to  take effective measures, for serious dereliction of duty, for  repeated infringements of rights, and for other serious problems.

0,FT932-10622 ,"FT932-10622 _AN-DEGCQAF4FT 930507   FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (4): Two sides face new realities - Labour Relations      By STEPHEN WISENTHAL   TECHNOLOGICAL change, increased world competition and a reduced supply of raw materials have created a new relationship between organised labour and Canada's forest industries. While friendly may be too strong a word for dealings between the opposing parties, the unions have become more co-operative, and employers have been prepared to reward concessions on work practices. In many areas, such as the conflict with environmentalists and the challenge of international competitors, the two sides have recognised that their interests are similar. The unions' attitude to change in the workplace is based on the calculation that it is better to lose a few jobs at a mill than to have no mill at all. Mr Doug Smyth, head of research at the Vancouver-based Canadian branch of the International Woodworkers of America (IWA), says efficiency is vital. 'You have to increase productivity to survive in world markets. We not only went along with the productivity improvements (requested by management) but in many cases we insisted on them so the jobs of our members would be protected,' he says. The IWA in British Columbia was one of the earliest unions to face the new reality. In the cyclical downturn from 1980 to 1982, employment in the wood products sector which the IWA dominates fell at about the same pace as production. But when demand picked up in 1983, employment stayed at about the same level and productivity soared. Mr Mark Thompson, a professor of industrial relations at University of British Columbia, points to a long-term pattern, with workers being highly paid and militantly unionised, and companies responding by becoming more capital-intensive. Some sectors have slipped from the IWA's grasp. Most remaining shake and shingle mills - hit by high US duties - have gone non-union or have special deals. The plywood industry has also suffered, with some mills going to employee co-operatives. But in the core dimension lumber sector, the IWA remains entrenched. To face its strength, employers in British Columbia work through combined bargaining bodies. Forest Industrial Relations (FIR) represents companies on the coast, and there are two equivalent organisations in the interior. Unlike the lumber industry, the pulp and paper sector has always been very capital-intensive. Automation has increased in recent years, but there has not been the same scope for large productivity gains. The greatest pressure on the pulp and paper industry is coming from US mills where employees have agreed five- and six-year no-strike contracts which provide for 365-day-a-year operation. Canadian unions have fought hard over the years for the right to take off statutory holidays such as Christmas Day, but now the employers want to talk again, because of the cost of having half a billion dollars' worth of machine sitting idle. Mr Thompson suggests that employees may have to give up some of their holidays and other provisions to allow 365-day operation in Canada. 'Emotionally, that's hard for a union to swallow'. In the latest downturn, there have been some pulp and paper mill shutdowns on the west coast, and there will probably be more, but the axe has fallen hardest in the east. Mr Bob Strother, vice-president of human resources at Noranda Forest, says: 'Because of competitive pressures, there has been a lot of downsizing and restructuring. A lot of mills in the east are not competitive and a lot of jobs have been lost permanently.' Shutdowns are having an effect. Mr Strother says: 'There's an increased recognition by everybody involved that everybody's interests have to be accommodated.' One indication of change has come at four Ontario box plants owned by Domtar, where 500 workers have agreed an eight-year contract retroactive to July 1991. Their union, the Independent Paperworkers of Canada, broke away from the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers of Canada, saying that union had failed to be flexible enough to ensure the survival of members' jobs. It remains to be seen if similar agreements can be reached in current negotiations in eastern Canada. Most of the industry agreed three-year contracts in 1990, the majority of which expired at the end of April. The BC pulp and paper industry's contract - agreed after a 5 1/2 -week strike in 1992 does not come up until next year. In the pulp and paper sector, there has been a clear differentiation between British Columbia and eastern Canada. In the east, contracts have been reached through 'pattern bargaining'. The unions reach an agreement with one major employer and then try to impose those terms on the rest of the industry. In BC, the pulp and paper industry has traditionally negotiated with the unions at a single table. But now the employers have abandoned their joint negotiating body in favour of mill-by-mill negotiations. The Pulp and Paper Employee Relations Forum (analogous to FIR in the wood products industry) will now act as an adviser to individual companies, rather than handling negotiations directly. The unions are expected to react by attempting to establish pattern bargaining in BC. Ideally, this will allow more flexibility to reach agreements which reflect the requirements of each mill. But the last strike was about work practices and next year's negotiations could be fairly sticky. One indication of the new climate of co-operation in British Columbia is the Western Wood Products Forum, where the IWA and six of the biggest wood products industry employers work together on non-collective bargaining issues. Mr Chris Duke, its executive director, says the forum is an attempt to build consensus on how to solve industry problems. Its latest report concludes that thousands more jobs will be lost as the availability of fibre declines over the next 10 years. Another issue is the fate of workers laid off from mills. Their skills are often not readily transferable to other industries and many forest products plants are based in one-industry towns. Despite having to share some pain, Canadian forestry workers are among the most productive and best paid in the world, and they are going to fight to keep it that way.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.

""Thailand never interferes in the internal affairs of  another  country,"" he said.    ""The Cambodian request for arms assistance is a matter  concerning only the donors and the recipients. Thailand cannot  interfere or get involved.""    Cambodian Co-Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh said on Monday  that Bangkok's opposition to overseas military aid for his  government was hypocritical and amounted to unacceptable  interference.    Cambodian leaders have repeatedly accused Thailand of aiding  the Khmer Rouge [KR] Through trade and by providing a safe haven  on its soil. Thai authorities however, have denied helping the  guerrillas.    ""When they (government troops) lose (on the battlefield),  they always find a scapegoat or someone to blame,"" the Foreign  Minister said in response to the Cambodian government  allegations against Thailand.    Foreign Ministry Director-General of East Asian Affairs  Department, Don Pramutwinai, pointed out that Thailand did not  object to the foreign supply of arms to the Phnom Penh  government, as it had only expressed its opinion and goodwill to  see lasting peace in Cambodia.    ""We just expressed our feelings as a neighboring country  which has always been affected by the fighting in Cambodia. The  provision of arms by outsiders would prolong the conflict and  would absolutely not bring peace to that country,"" Mr Don said.    Prince Ranariddh said Foreign Minister Norodom Sirivut had  met the ambassadors of the United States, France, Britain and  other countries to officially ask for military assistance to  fight the Khmer Rouge.    Defense Minister Wichit Sukmak commented that arms  assistance  was ""the least appropriate thing"" for the Paris Peace agreement  signatories to conduct.    His deputy minister Sombat Rotphothong said whoever wanted  to  assist Cambodia should consider whether that assistance would  bring about peace in the country.    Maj-Gen Sombat noted that the solution to Cambodian problems  would only be reached through political means, not military  support, ""otherwise the Cambodian people would be the ones who  suffer most.""    Gen Wichit reiterated Thailand's firm stand to see national  reconciliation in Cambodia and the hope that the conflict would  be settled through peaceful means.    ""If the fighting continues, the repercussions on Thailand  could not be avoided for we share a common border. We have no  involvement but are burdened with such negative results,"" he  said.    Asked if foreign military assistance would violate the 1991  peace agreement, Gen Wichit said such was the case because the  accord aimed at reducing and controlling arms in Cambodia.    ""If there is still military support to one particular  faction, the fighting will be prolonged and never end,"" Gen  Wichit said.    Meanwhile, Cambodian ambassador-designate to Bangkok Roland  Eng was yesterday invited by the Foreign Ministry to discuss the  invitation extended to Cambodia to attend the ASEAN Regional  Forum (ARF) scheduled for Bangkok in July.    Director-General Don quoted Mr Eng as expressing interest in  participating in the meeting. However, Cambodia this year could  not immediately join as they first need to have access to the  Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the Southeast Asian nations  and hold observer status.    Mr Eng was also quoted as saying that he would take up his  position in Bangkok soon.    He told reporters after a 30-minute discussion with Mr Don  that he believed Thailand would want to see roundtable peace  talks held as soon as possible and the Cambodian government was  trying its best to organize such a meeting.

She was president of the Orange County Mental Health Assn. from  1981 to 1986. And she has worked with scores of other community interest  groups.    But it was her work with the Minority Business Council that earned her the SBA  recognition. The council sponsors seminars, speakers and social events that  often cross cultural lines.    For example, she said that members of the Vietnamese community provided  entertainment during a Korean harvest festival in October.    ""We have to learn to be together,"" she said, ""before we can work together.""    Chuoc Vo-Ta, executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange  County, said Krone encouraged merchants to appeal to customers from outside the  Vietnamese community.

But it was her work with the Minority Business Council that earned her the SBA  recognition. The council sponsors seminars, speakers and social events that  often cross cultural lines.    For example, she said that members of the Vietnamese community provided  entertainment during a Korean harvest festival in October.    ""We have to learn to be together,"" she said, ""before we can work together.""    Chuoc Vo-Ta, executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce in Orange  County, said Krone encouraged merchants to appeal to customers from outside the  Vietnamese community.    ""She gives us advice,"" he said. ""She advises people that it's time to get into  the mainstream.""    James D. McClellan, chairman of the minority business council, said Krone has  been an inspiration to the organization and the community.    She ""lets people see there is a commonality of business objectives across all  cultures,"" he said. ""And that sharing of ideas allows people to work together.""    SBA spokeswoman Sandy Sutton said the eight winners will be honored in May at a  dinner in Washington.      Photo, Patricia A.

The trial threatens to trigger a crisis between the two countries. Athens accuses the authorities in Tirana of fabricating the charges in order to intimidate Albania's Greek minority. Since the trial began on August 15, the Greek government has deported some 40,000 illegal Albanian immigrants and blocked European Union financial aid to Albania. Greece has warned that further measures will be taken if the men are found guilty. All five defendants are members of the Omonia political movement which campaigns for Greek minority rights in Albania. Diplomatic efforts to ease tensions between the two countries appear to have failed. A US envoy, Mr Richard Shifter, was sent to Tirana and Athens by President Bill Clinton over the weekend to urge conciliation and encourage the Albanian authorities to drop the case.

Des had also got the church to back his own pet project: helping Richard Branson and Lord Young win a licence for a lottery whose profits would go to charity. David Sheppard, Bishop of Liverpool and chairman of the Church of England Board of Social Responsibility, last week issued a press release explaining why he hoped that the licence would go to 'a company committed to passing on the largest possible proportion of profits to charity'. Quite a PR coup. So how come no one took any notice? Maybe because Sheppard's press release carried a rather stale December 24 dateline.

By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      In a direct challenge to President Bush, key Senate Democrats are drafting a  three-year, $2-billion aid package for Eastern Europe that is far more than the  Administration has requested for nations emerging from Soviet domination.    A proposal prepared by Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  would provide the lion's share of the additional funds -- $1.2 billion -- for a  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development now being formed by Western  European countries.    In addition to Poland and Hungary, already targeted in a $738-million aid  measure enacted last fall, the draft plan would authorize aid for  Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. It allows the  President to decide how the funds should be divided.    So far, Bush has asked only for $300 million in aid for a single year, starting  Oct. 1, and has deferred a decision on whether to join the European Bank as a  regular member. Under the Senate Democrats' tentative proposal, however, the  United States would contribute $400 million to become a bank member and also  establish a special $800-million trust fund under Washington's control to  target assistance to Eastern Europe.    The draft, which could be voted upon by the committee within the next two  weeks, reflects Democrats' belief that the President has been too timid in  extending a helping hand to the emerging nations and in establishing a foothold  for American business firms in the region.    ""As our military presence in Europe is reduced, the United States must greatly  enhance its economic presence,"" said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.),  chairman of a subcommittee on international economics and trade of the Foreign  Relations panel. ""Without presidential leadership, change will certainly occur  in Europe, markets will be created, new businesses will prosper, but the United  States could well be left out.""    The bank was proposed by France to finance public works and new private firms  in the former state-run communist economies. The Administration has said it  will take part in the bank only if it refuses to lend to private or public  projects in the Soviet Union.    In discussing the draft bill, Biden said no funds would be provided directly to  the Soviet government. But it would allow the President to allocate funds for  private or government organizations to help promote democratic institutions in  the Soviet Union, he added.    For example, he said, the President would be able to allocate funds to the  AFL-CIO for helping to create more effective trade unions for Soviet workers,  Biden said.    ""This is a penetration program, not an aid program,"" he said. ""The goal is to  penetrate the Soviet Union with American values.""    Under the Democrats' tentative plan, the President would be authorized to  appoint a director for American business initiative in the region, with  ambassadorial rank, to promote U.S. firms' interests.    The draft legislation also would create American business centers in former  Soviet Bloc countries to help promote U.S. exports and investment.    A committee aide said the panel may include Bush's request for $800 million in  aid for Nicaragua and Panama in the legislation to step up aid to Eastern  Europe. The funds for the Central American aid would be deducted from proposed  defense spending, Bush has said.

Saudi Arabia would like to correct the trade  imbalance, expand scientific cooperation, and increase the  number of joint ventures. The thorny issue of prices of  pharmaceutical goods is still a subject of discussion.    The two delegations consisted not only of representatives of  various ministries, but also members of chambers of trade. On  the Swiss side, there were also representatives of those  industrial branches interested in entering the Saudi market.  Saudi Arabia has emerged as a very keen consumer of Swiss  products in recent years. Swiss exports to Saudi Arabia have  increased from 859 million Swiss francs in 1990 to 1,491 million  in 1993. Forty percent of these exports consist of jewelry, or  50 percent when one includes watches. Chemical products and  machines are also major Swiss exports to this country.    On the other hand, imports from Saudi Arabia have sunk  dramatically. In 1990 they still amounted to 540 million  francs, but in 1993 they only reached a level of 275 million.  Ninety percent of Saudi Arabia's exports to Switzerland consist  of gold and crude oil. Delamuraz expressed Switzerland's  concern for more Saudi imports, and gave an assurance that there  were no quantitative restrictions on exports outside the  agricultural sphere. The Saudis mentioned the possibility of  increased exports of petrochemical products to Switzerland, but  Delamuraz said that Switzerland's market potential for such  goods was rather small.    At the end of 1993 there were 21 industrial joint ventures  involving Swiss capital in Saudi Arabia, plus another 19 joint  ventures in the services sector. The Saudi delegation expressed  its interest in an expansion of this cooperation, and suggested  possible projects in the food, chemical, and plastics sectors,  and in the production of instruments. These cooperation  possibilities are to be discussed in greater depth at a special  seminar in Geneva attended by representatives of Swiss private  industry. In this connection, Federal Councilor Delamuraz  recalled the usefulness of concluding an agreement on the  protection of investments and on avoiding double taxation, and  invited his guests to commence appropriate negotiations with  Switzerland.    The Saudis were interested in scientific cooperation in,  among other things, the electrical industry and in railroads.  The ongoing difficult debate on the subject of prices of  pharmaceutical goods was summarized, and referred to a separate  commission for further talks. Until now, the Swiss factory  prices of these goods, without the profit margins of pharmacies  and wholesalers, have been used when setting prices in Saudi  Arabia. In the future, the Saudis want to work out an average  price on the basis of prices in 42 different countries, and  apply this average price in Saudi Arabia. The Saudis explained  this intention last year at a meeting in Basel.    The Swiss pharmaceutical industry representatives criticized  this method as administratively cumbersome and insufficiently  representative, because the list of drugs involves too many  countries and provides too little information. On its part, the  Swiss delegation suggested that instead of calculating prices of  drugs on the basis of the prices in 42 countries, these prices  should be calculated on the basis of prices in just seven  countries whose economic performance is similar to Saudi  Arabia's. Swiss drug manufacturers want to be certain that the  prices of pharmaceutical goods exported to and sold in Saudi  Arabia are sufficient to contribute to the costs of the  manufacturer's research to an extent that befits the economy of  an oil-producing country.

Dhar    [Text] New Delhi, 27 Dec. Having suffered several  diplomatic reverses in the current year, the Government of India  is planning new initiatives in the new year to neutralise the  negative impact abroad of many internal political developments  that have put the country on the defensive.    Since the Prime Minister has been discharging the duties of  the Foreign Minister also on account of Mr. Dinesh Singh's  indisposition, indications are that a change is in the offing in  the stewardship of the External Affairs Ministry. Mr. P.V.  Narasimha Rao now realised that Mr. Dinesh Singh's indisposition  has affected his mobility at a time when India is under severe  pressure internationally on the minorities issue, human rights,  non- proliferation etc. and needs to respond vigorously at all  international forums.    Foreign policy reverses culminated in the cancellation of  the  G-15 summit, about whose objectives the External Affairs  Ministry's top brass was not at all clear. Apart from the  protocol arrangements, not much thought was given to making the  gathering purposeful nor were any new approaches to the problems  of developing countries sought to be defined in an era of new  economic groupings.    The draft declaration approved by the G-15 Foreign Ministers  makes dismal reading and strikes no new path. The three heads  of Government of Indonesia, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia saw the  inadequacy of the document and deferred its consideration. With  senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry having  realised how irrelevant the G-15 had become, nothing could be  done to bring the foreign dignitaries to New Delhi.    The traumatic religio-ethnic experience through which the  country has been passing for over a year, leading to upsurge,  communal violence, bomb blasts of unprecedented severity,  escalated terrorist violence in Kashmir leading to retaliatory  action by the security forces, have had a negative impact on  external relations. The Government has not been able to derive  full advantage from the economic reforms because of political  uncertainty at home, the securities scam which has brought about  the Finance Minister's resignation, the question mark till  recently on the Congress Party's performance in the elections to  the five State Assemblies, escalated extremist violence and  growth of fissiparous tendencies.    Pakistan has taken full advantage of the ethnic situation  and  developments in Kashmir and together with other members of the  Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) forced India into a  defensive position at all international gatherings, including  the United Nations.    The change of administration in the United States has  increased pressure as regards human rights, non-proliferation,  technology transfer, environment and Kashmir, Indo-U.S.  relations received a severe jolt, though both sides are now  playing it cool. However, External Affairs Ministry sources  insist that the Government, while adjusting its foreign policy  to the realities of the new international situation, has  succeeded in protecting India's economic, political and  territorial interests despite adverse circumstances. Even with  regard to technology transfer, the country's had been  safeguarded despite embargos.    ""With no country is it possible to have a totally smooth  relationship because we do not toe anybody's line. We have a  structured and calibrated equation with each country. Relations  with others cannot always be smooth because India is a large and  complex country."" It is also argued that the Ministry did not  get the political leadership it deserved in such crucial times  when the whole international scenario has changed and old  equations are no longer relevant.    It is admitted that the Prime Minister's personal  initiatives  helped the country to further stabilise relations with China,  Iran, Israel and South Africa the last two were only recently  accorded diplomatic recognition. A whole gamut of possibilities  has opened up with the Central Asian republics, though relations  with Russia are again passing through an uncertain phase after  the cancellation of the cryogenic rocket-engine deal.    In the new year, priority will be accorded to normalising  relations with Pakistan and addressing the Kashmir question and  the exercise will begin with the meeting of the foreign  secretaries of the two countries. The United States has created  enough confusion over Kashmir and even Pakistan is now cool to  suggestions from Washington regarding possible solutions to the  Kashmir issue. It will be India's endeavour to keep the  dialogue with Pakistan going on substantive issues while hoping  that external sponsorship of terrorism in Kashmir will cease.    The reverses suffered by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the  recent Assembly elections have sent out the message that India  will not abandon its secular principles and that a solution of  the Babri mosque controversy will be evolved soon.    The second priority will be to expand relations with the  European Union (EU) with which a political dialogue is to be had  to give additional weightage to the agreement on an upgraded  relationship with it. Most EU members are to be reassured of  political stability in India and also the determination to  pursue market reforms with vigour to attract more investment and  joint ventures which are still at a very low level. High  technology flow also needs to be accelerated.    Relations with neighbours, except Pakistan, are good and  will  be further developed. Attention is being given to resolving the  Ganga waters issue with Bangladesh and a meeting between Begum  Khaleda Zia and Mr. Narasimha Rao is expected to materialise  next year, which may help ease the tension on this score.  Relations with Tehran which is supportive of India's case on  Kashmir, are to develop further and a land link established  between India and the Central Asian republics through Iran for  free flow of trade and commerce.    The pressure on India to sign the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] and subscribe to the MTCR [Missile  Technology Control Regime] which have somewhat abated may again  grow. India is expected to stand firm by its commitment to  universal non-proliferation, as opposed to the discriminatory  regime, and press for a major review of the NPT in 1995. India  is also to make it clear that it will not roll back its missile  development plan in the face of China's missile, including ICBM  capability and Pakistan's IRBM programme, which is backed by  China's technical expertise. Concern over China's arms export  policy is heightened by the fact that weapons flows to Pakistan  (which is soon to be taken off the Pressler book) will increase  Islamabad's belligerence. In view of its desire to expand  economic cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region, India will  seek closer relations with ASEAN countries or terms of greater  liberalisation of it economy. Most ASEAN countries appear keen  to be business with India and strengthen its economy lest China  becomes an economic giant and in future, constitutes a military  threat to the region as a whole.

Among other things, he dealt with  Albanian-Greek relations. Also attending the meeting were DP  General Secretary Tritan Shehu; Rexhep Uka, minister without  portfolio for local government problems; Minister of Education  Xhezair Teliti; Genc Ruli, deputy for the Gjirokaster  constituency; and Sokrat Kalidhopuli, chairman of the district  council.    ""We came to this open meeting,"" Mr. Selami said, ""as  representatives of the party in power -- the Democratic Party --  and of the local state organs, to listen to your concerns and  exchange opinions on how to solve all the problems that are  soluble.    ""The DP has been governing the country for the last two  years. Over this period, there have been both achievements and  shortcomings, but we have never concealed the latter. It has  been a difficult period, but one that has also been full of many  hopes. It has been and still is characterized by successes on  the road toward democracy and a market economy, toward Europe  and Western civilization. It is the beginning of a long haul  toward our future, in which much remains to be done, because  democracy is a thing that always strives for perfection. Aside  from problems of the economic reform and its implementation, and  problems regarding Gjirokaster itself, it would be of great  interest to broach here the relations with our southern  neighbor, Greece, to discuss the grave incident of April 10, and  to have your opinions on these issues. This is another reason  why we came to Gjirokaster.    ""We are living at a time of great change,"" Mr. Selami  continued, ""a time when the period of destruction and overcoming  communism unfortunately, in our region, very soon gave way to a  period of war fraught with extreme nationalism that today is  reflected in its most acute form in the former Yugoslavia, and  Bosnia in particular. This crisis, the greatest one since World  War II -- not only on a regional scale, but also on a European  one -- is also one of the world's greatest crises. In this  respect, our policy has always been one of finding a peaceful  solution and negotiation, ruling out any change of frontiers by  force. However, at the same time it has been a policy of  defending Albanian interests. In this regard, we think that  these sorts of problems will remain in the region. Peaceful  solutions, not only in Bosnia, but also other parts of  Yugoslavia, look extremely remote. In Kosova and elsewhere,  there are big problems. We are therefore of the opinion that a  host of difficulties relating to the international situation are  becoming added to the natural difficulties that our reform --  one of the deepest and most radical ones -- has brought in  Albania....""    Dealing with Albania's relations with our southern neighbor,  which is also a member of the European Community, PD Chairman  Eduard Selami stated: ""We have been and continue to be in favor  of good relations, but things have not gone as they should.  Certain things have become tense and aggravated. As for the  incident, you have already heard our stern condemnation and  denunciation of the perpetrators. We have complained about this  to the relevant international bodies, urging them to find the  culprits and put the responsibility for what happened on those  who really deserve it. In the context of our state-to-state  dealings, this event has impaired our relationship, but there  has been no lack of determination on our part, and it must be  mentioned that Greece, too, has responded positively to our  resolve. We therefore think that, through good will and  dialogue, these issues can be resolved. However, it remains our  precondition that the culprits must be identified. They must  accept their responsibility, and Greece should also admit its  responsibility here, because it is involved in an incident that  requires a just solution. The matter has been put before all  the international bodies and the various groups set up to  investigate the case. They will clarify many things, but it is  natural that Albania, as the injured party, has reacted strongly  in its own right. Such incidents tend to strain the relations  between our two countries. The incident we are speaking about  is not an isolated one. There are certain circles in Greece  that are interested in destabilizing relations with Albania.  This can be seen in the inhumane Greek conduct towards the  Albanian refugees as well as other provocations stemming from a  certain concept -- the concept of Vorio-Epirus.    ""As the party in power, we always follow a straight line. We  have respected and continue to respect the Greek minority  because we appreciate its contribution; it sees its future in  Albania and does not play any destabilizing role, but on the  contrary makes its own contribution to democracy in Albania. As  we continuously perfect democracy in Albania, the demands of the  Greek minority will certainly increase. Our relations with the  Greek minority, which in Gjirokaster have a long and positive  tradition of humane cooperation, must not serve as the cause of  a breakup in our relations with Greece. It is a pity that time  and again there emerge extremist attitudes, irresponsible  declarations, and certain stands that aggravate the situation.  We, as the Democratic Party, have welcomed members of the Greek  minority into our ranks, placing them in government posts, in  parliamentary positions, in the education system, and so on. As  far as we are concerned, the Greek minority is a factor of  stability. We will continue marching along the same road of  good understanding with Greece, because it is not only to the  benefit of Albania and Greece, but also to that of our region as  a whole. We really do want cooperation, but we also want mutual  obligations to be honored. Our two neighboring countries, being  the most ancient countries in the Balkans, must render their  services to stability and peace. The PD is of the opinion that  the time has already come for Greek-Albanian relations not to be  dominated by ancient instincts and nationalistic spirits founded  on extremist religious attitudes.""    The meeting was also addressed by Messrs. Shehu, Uka,  Teliti,  and Kalidhopulli, who answered questions put by the audience.    After the meeting, Mr. Selami and other dignitaries went to  pay condolences to the family of the martyr Fatmir Shehu, the  army officer killed in the 10 April massacre.     "

The delegation from Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body which handles ties with China, will make preparations for a trip to Beijing by SEF secretary-general Cheyne Chiu later this week. Mr Chiu will visit China from April 7 to 11 to plan a meeting between SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu and Wang Dao-han, head of China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait, in Singapore later this month. The association, like the SEF, is a non-governmental body which handles ties between the two sides in the absence of official ties. Taiwan has banned official contact with Beijing since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. But trade and civilian ties have expanded rapidly since political tensions eased in the late 1980s. The Singapore meeting would focus on ways to protect Taiwanese investment in China and co-operation to fight crime.   Countries:-  TWZ  Taiwan, Asia.     CNZ  China, Asia.

The research organisation, which received detailed responses from 33 out of the 160 first- and second-wave trusts, found that some staff working for 80 per cent of the respondents were on local terms, but they were mainly managers or specific occupational groups such as healthcare assistants. Some analysts argue that a crucial element in the government's health reforms is the more effective use of labour, with local managers breaking away from the Whitley system of national pay bargaining. 'Lack of management time and resources' is the reason most frequently given for caution in making change. Slightly more trusts have cut staff than increased it (12 and 10 respectively) since gaining self-governing status and over 40 per cent of respondents expect staff numbers to fall in the next 18 months.

Dr. Sidqi extended his condolences to his  majesty and the Jordanian family over the death of Her Majesty  the late Queen Mother Zayn. They then discussed developments in  the peace process and stressed the urgency for policy  coordination among the Arabs to further the cause of a just and  comprehensive and lasting peace in the region. They also  underscored the need to coordinate economic policies, given the  changes sweeping the region, particularly in the economic area.  Under such circumstances, Arabs must exchange views in all  areas to advance economic and social conditions and, by  extension, regional peace and stability. The meeting was  attended by Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, Royal Court  Chief al- Sharif Zayd Bin-Shakir, and the Jordanian-Egyptian  ministerial committee members.    His majesty gave a statement to the Egyptian media team,  visiting with Dr. Sidqi:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] How does  your majesty see future cooperation with Egypt?    [Husayn] There is a wide scope for that. I was happy to  learn about the subjects that the joint committee addressed. I  think the two sides are determined to further our cooperation  and integration. I am impressed by the resolve the parties have  shown to attain our joint objectives for our common good.    [Correspondent] How does your majesty feel about recent  developments, particularly with reference to the peace process?    [Husayn] Our position is clear and has been so since 1974.  We recognized the PLO as the sole legitimate representative of  the Palestinian Arabs. Thanks be to God, the PLO is doing its  job advancing the objectives of our Palestinian brothers and in  this effort it has our full support. We hope the recent  developments will before long yield positive results and advance  the rights of the Palestinians on their national soil.    [Correspondent] Are you in touch with President Mubarak over  the Jordanian-Israeli track?    [Husayn] Our coordination to advance the cause of a just and  comprehensive peace that future generations can live with is  ongoing.

Of course, Jordan is in a special position in terms  of its association with the cause and the kinsfolk. Also what  is going on will have an impact on Jordan. I think that the  same largely holds true for Egypt. President 'Arafat is  visiting us today; we hope to find out what we can do to help  out. [end recording]    Dr. 'Atif Sidqi spoke to our political affairs  correspondent:    [Begin Sidqi recording] This is not the first time that I  have met with his majesty the king. His majesty is a first-rate  statesman in global, as well as in regional terms. I am  impressed by his astuteness, experience, and familiarity with  the ins and outs of Arab and world issues. We talked at length  about regional developments and the peace process. He is as  firmly committed as we are in Egypt to the peace process. We  look forward to that process yielding out benefits for all the  states of the region. We also discussed bilateral relations,  which, thank God, are good, even though it is some time since  the joint committee last convened. However, work had not really  stopped as we noted at today's committee meeting. His majesty  pronounced himself fully satisfied with the relations between  Egypt and Jordan and the committee's work. He urged that we  keep up the work to further these relations. [end recording]     "

La GANGA, Times Staff Writer      Worker exploitation has increased dramatically in Orange County, and it will  end only if government agencies are given the resources to investigate  complaints against employers and enforce existing labor laws, according to a  county Human Relations Commission report released Friday.    In the past 3 years, the number of workers complaining to the commission about  abuse at the hands of their bosses has more than quadrupled, the report says.  Non-payment of wages is the most common labor code violation, and undocumented  workers are the most common victims.    ""The Division of Labor is undermanned and is not able to investigate adequately  the number of complaints,"" said Dr. Daniel H. Ninburg, chairman of the  commission. ""With the collection of lost wages from the employers, there's  difficulty in follow-through."" The result is a growing class of workers who  cannot pay for rent, food or medical care but who fear losing their jobs, bad  as those jobs may be.    In 1985, the Human Relations Commission received about three or four worker  complaints a month; by spring, 1988, the average number was 20. The commission  convened a forum on Labor Day to find out why there are so many more complaints  now and how to address them.    What they heard was a litany of complaints from workers, overloaded social  service groups and law enforcement agencies and from ethical employers who  argued that they cannot afford to compete with their unscrupulous counterparts.    The commission based its report and recommendations on testimony heard at the  forum.    At the heart of the matter, the report says, is the so-called underground  economy, ""an extensive black market"" that not only affects workers and  employers but also robs the state and federal governments of tax revenue and  adds to the burden on social service agencies.    The employers at fault, experts say, pay cash when they pay wages at all, keep  no records and fail to provide mandated safeguards for their workers.    In 1985, the last year the underground economy was studied in depth in  California, the Commission on California State Government Organization and  Economy estimated that such activity accounted for as much as $40 billion in  business transactions annually and defrauded the state of more than $2 billion  a year in taxes.    Among the major findings in the report:    * There is an ""alarming incidence,"" particularly in the construction and  landscaping industries, of workers being abandoned without being paid.    * The State Labor Code is unclear regarding the extent of the state Labor  Commission's ability to collect wages on behalf of defrauded workers. There is,  therefore, a ""low success rate"" in collecting from employers who ignore  commission decisions.    * Labor commission budget cuts, including the 25% reduction in 1983, have  ""severely limited that agency's ability to adequately handle the labor abuse  that exists.""    * Workers' ignorance of their basic rights and their fear of retribution  compound the problem, as does the fact that many employers are unaware of basic  labor code provisions.    * Exploitation of domestic workers ""goes relatively unchecked."" Further, when  these workers are terminated without pay, ""they are not only unemployed but  also left homeless.""    The report makes a score of recommendations for ways to combat the problems and  to educate the workers.    The report will be sent to the Board of Supervisors, government leaders in each  of the 28 cities in Orange County and to the Legislature, Ninburg said.    ""I think one of the most important recommendations is for the state Legislature  to pass legislation clarifying the responsibility of the labor commission to  carry through the collection process,"" Ninburg said.

Al Gore's praises of the Argentine  economic policy before his arrival -- reiterated upon his  departure -- coincide with a growing degree of understanding in  other areas, like cooperation between the United States and  Argentina in operations undertaken by the international  community.    These bonds between the two countries enable them to openly  discuss matters of common interest. Gore raised two issues that  the Reagan and Bush Republican administrations already had  deemed a priority, namely the law on patents -- strictly  speaking, on intellectual property -- and the fight against  drugs.    With regard to patents, Gore reiterated what U.S. Trade  Representative Michael Kantor stated not long ago -- that  Washington gives top priority to the passing of a law that  guarantees foreign pharmaceutical companies' rights to the  patents they have obtained for their medicines. As for drug  enforcement -- which will be one of the main agenda items at the  summit of the Americas' heads of state in Miami this year -- the  United States continues to uphold the advisability of Latin  American armed forces playing some role in this area.    President Carlos Menem conceded that a delay in the  enactment  of the patents law may be a stumbling block in bilateral  relations. He commented on the possibility -- previously  mentioned by Kantor -- of Argentina being included on a list of  countries liable for economic sanctions. This could happen if  considerable progress has not been made in this respect by 30  April. Menem also referred to another possible negative  consequence in the future, namely, the indefinite postponement  of Argentina's joining NAFTA, whose only current signatories are  the United States, Canada, and Mexico.    It would be totally erroneous to interpret the tone of these  warnings as proof of a misunderstanding between both countries.  The Patents Bill already has been submitted to Congress and  even though some of its points -- which to some extent affect  local vested interests -- have been met with opposition, there  is no reason to doubt it will be approved. Argentina's stance  -- like other countries in the hemisphere -- on the struggle  against drug trafficking is different from that of the United  States as far as the Armed Forces' possible role in this area,  but both countries are totally of one mind with regard to the  final objectives and the coordination of efforts.    The U.S. vice president's visit enabled the Argentine  Government to once again protest -- and quite understandably so  -- U.S. subsidies for their agricultural exports. Once again,  the answer was that Washington has no intention whatsoever of  damaging ""legitimate"" exporters like Argentina and that  subsidies are a response to EC practices. Obviously, this  position does not satisfy Argentina at all, but it spells out  the policy furthered by the United States, which also contends  that the issue of subsidies to farmers must be discussed within  the framework of GATT negotiations and cannot be settled  bilaterally.    The wide coverage given to the differences over these  questions clouded what -- at least in speeches -- constituted  the reason for the vice president's visit: the arrangement of  the December presidential summit in Miami and his presentation  at the World Conference on Telecommunications Development.  Gore's presentation on a future ""information superhighway,""  which will link data banks in the entire hemisphere, conjured up  visions of a not far-off future on which they are working  unstintingly. It would be wise to pay attention to this project  and get ready for what will seemingly mark the beginning of a  new era, in which communications developments will impose a new  rhythm to relations between nations in the Americas.

This statute specifies a system of measures for  monitoring the export of certain types of raw and processed  materials, equipment, technology, scientific and technical  information which can be used in the production of weapons or  military equipment (hereafter referred to as dual-purpose goods  and services).    2. The procedure for monitoring the export from the Russian  Federation of dual-purpose goods and services requires the  following:    --the preparation and issuance of conclusions on the  possibility of exporting dual-purpose goods and services  included on List No. 74-rp of Certain Types of Raw and Processed  Materials, Equipment, Technology, Scientific and Technical  Information Which Can Be Used in the Production of Weapons or  Military Equipment the Export of Which is Monitored and Effected  Under License (hereafter referred to as the List) ratified by  order of the President of the Russian Federation on 11 February  1994;    --the licensing and drawing-up of customs accounts of  dual-purpose goods and services.    3. All subjects of economic activities under the  jurisdiction  of the Russian Federation, regardless of form of ownership in  the conclusion of contracts for export (transfer or exchange) of  dual-purpose goods and services included on the List, must  indicate in the text of the contract the end users and the  purpose for which the exported goods and services are to be  used, the commitment of the importer that such goods and  services will be used only for purposes not directly or  indirectly related to the production of weapons or military  equipment and will not be reexported or transferred to anyone  whomsoever without written orders to that effect from the  exporter.    The obligations must be specially drawn up by the importer  in  an authorized state agency of the importing nation for each  specific transaction for the delivery of any item of export  included on the List in the form of an international (or  national) import certificate or the like in the form of a  document containing the obligations specified in the first  paragraph of this point with a certified translation into  Russian.    4. In the absence in the importing nation's legislation of  standards governing the monitoring of exports of certain types  of dual-purpose goods and services or the absence of a  dual-purpose good or service imported from the Russian  Federation on the national control list of the importing nation,  an official document (notice) to that effect must be issued by  an authorized state agency of the importing nation.    In this case the obligations of the importer contained in  the  text of the contract constitute an adequate basis for effecting  the export. To the documents indicated is attached an extract  from the commodity registry of the importing country or some  other document confirming the legal status of the foreign  importer according to the legislation of the nation in which he  is located, with a certified translation into Russian.    The contract text must define the situation with respect to  the exporter's right to verify that the good or service will be  used in accordance with the stated purpose.    Setting up the monitoring of the obligations of foreign  importers with respect to the use of dual-purpose goods or  services imported from the Russian Federation is carried out by  the procedure established in Decree No 1030 passed by the  Council of Ministers and the Government of the Russian  Federation on 11 October 1993.    If violations or nonobservance of the obligations are  revealed during the verification, the contract is subject to  abrogation.    5. The licensing of the export (transfer or exchange) of  dual-purpose goods or services included on the List, is  mandatory for all the subjects of economic activities within the  Russian Federation and is performed for all types of foreign  economic activities, regardless of the form of ownership,  including direct production and scientific and technical  relations, border and near-border trade, and commodity exchange  operations, in accordance with this Statute.    The export (transfer or exchange) of dual-purpose goods and  services included on the List is effected only under one-time  licenses issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of  the Russian Federation.    The issuing of a license is based on a conclusion of the  Commission for Export Control of the Russian Federation under  the Government of the Russian Federation on the possibility of  exporting (transferring or exchanging) dual-purpose goods or  services.    A conclusion from the Commission on Export Control of the  Government of the Russian Federation under the Ministry of  Economics of the Russian Federation (Russia's Export Control) on  the possibility of exporting (transferring or exchanging)  dual-purpose goods or services constitutes the basis for issuing  a license.    The following are submitted for obtaining a conclusion in  the  Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation (export control  department): A request for the issue of a licence drawn up in  accordance with the requirements established by the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation; a copy of  the contract; a copy of the agreement between the Russian  producers and the exporter (when the export of the good or  service is being effected through a middleman); the originals of  documents describing the obligations of the importer (if they  are not contained in the contract text) and the state agency of  the importing nation as specified in points 3 and 4 of this  Statute.    A conclusion on the possibility of export is valid for a  period of no more than 20 days following the receipt of said  documents. The conclusion is sent by the Ministry of Economics  of the Russian Federation (the export control department) to the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian Federation  and the requester.    The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of the Russian  Federation sends information (in a coordinated form) on licenses  based on conclusions of Russia's Export Control to the Ministry  of Economics of the Russian Federation (export control  department).    Permission to reexport is issued to Russian exporters based  on a conclusion of Russia's Export Control on the possibility of  reexporting. For this purpose the Russian exporter submits to  the Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation (the export  control department) certified copies of the contract between the  foreign importer and a third person containing the obligations  stemming from the contract and drawn up in the authorized state  agency of the country of the third person in the form of an  import certificate or other document specified by its national  legislation.    6. The temporary withdrawal beyond the borders of the  Russian  Federation of equipment (products), processed materials,  technology, scientific and technical information contained on  the List for showing at exhibits and fairs and for advertising  purposes may be effected without a license based on conclusions  of Russia's Export Control.    In order to acquire a conclusion on the possibility of  temporary removal a request is submitted to the Ministry of  Economics of the Russian Federation (export control department)  containing the name of the item of export (indicating the TN VED  [not further identified] code) and the quantity, the purpose of  the removal and the way in which the object is to be used; the  name of the exhibition (or fair); locations where the object  will be used, periods during which the object removed will be  kept abroad; name and address of Russian organization effecting  the export; foreign contracting parties; the name of the customs  agency which will draw up the customs forms on the object; and  also the obligations of the Russian organization removing and  returning the item.    A conclusion on the possibility of temporary removal is  issued within a 20-day period following the receipt of said  documents. The conclusion is sent by the Ministry of Economics  of the Russian Federation (the export control department) to the  requester for submission to the customs agency indicated in the  conclusion. A copy of the conclusion is sent to the State  Customs Committee of the Russian Federation.    7. The removal of processed materials (items), equipment or  technology containing information which is a state secret is  effected in accordance with the Law of the Russian Federation  ""On State Secrets.""    8.

Of  course, there was a reason for this skepticism. After all,  relations between Russia, which started on the path to  democracy, and a united Germany were supposed to be built on a  principally new basis. But it is not that easy to establish such  a basis in a short time. Especially since both countries are  experiencing great difficulties in the economy, the social  sphere, and domestic political life.    However, daily difficulties have not overshadowed the  long-term promising objectives of bilateral cooperation. In the  opinion of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, Germany  remains, as before, a key country for Russia, and an important  trade-economic and political partner. Seventeen percent of our  foreign trade turnover falls to it. The regular meetings of the  top leaders of Russia and the FRG indicate the scale of current  Russo-German relations. It is known in Western capitals that no  other state leader in Europe will maintain such close contacts  with Moscow as Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    But, of course, by far not everything is smooth in relations  between Russia and Germany. First of all, the Germans are  disturbed by the fact that until now Moscow has not been in a  position to pay its total debt in the amount of DM87 billion,  which piled up as far back as Soviet times. To regulate the  situation, in 1993 the Russian Federation and the FRG signed an  Intergovernment Agreement on Consolidation of the Debt of Russia  and the Former USSR, in accordance with which we were granted a  deferment for 10 years. Germany is making considerable efforts  to include Russia in the system of world economic relations, to  a considerable degree assisting the development of Russia's  relations with the European Union. There is talk in particular  about the formulation of a treaty on cooperation and partnership  on conditions that are acceptable to Russia. The Germans are  also supporting Russia's officially becoming the eighth member  of the G-7, first and foremost in the political sphere.    Moscow and Bonn support multilateral contacts on military  policy. Joint military-naval exercises of large units of the  Russian and FRG navies will be held this year. Troop exercises  on the tactical subunit level are also being planned for the  future. A center for training and retraining our servicemen who  are returning from Germany for civilian specialties was opened  recently in the Russian capital with the financial assistance of  the FRG.    Russia and Germany are activating cooperation in  international affairs that has attained significant maturity,  first and foremost in UN and CSCE policy. The FRG has declared  its readiness to support Russia's application to join the  Council of Europe. Bonn, which has many times shown itself a  supporter of creating strategic partnership relations between  Russia and NATO, supports the inclusion of Russia in the new  structures of collective security of Europe.    Bonn has welcomed the efforts of Russian diplomacy to lift  the crisis situation around Sarajevo, and it supported Boris  Yeltsin's proposal on convening a meeting of the leaders of  Russia and the leading European states and the United States to  consider questions of a Bosnian settlement.    Leading circles in the FRG pay appropriate attention to the  appeals of representatives of the Russian leadership to use the  FRG's influence on the question of observing the rights of the  Russian-speaking population in Estonia and Latvia in the spirit  of the decisions of international human rights organizations.  They believe that the problem of ethnic Russians in these  countries should not become a ""bone of contention"" in interstate  relations, and they appraise pertinent anti-Russian statements  of individual Baltic leaders as unacceptable and out of place.

The Iranian delegation enjoyed a warm welcome during their  visit on June 13-15, and the Turkish press reflected the mutual  understanding between the two countries.    Newspapers and television channels gave wide coverage of the  visit by the Iranian delegation, and there was no mention of the  fact that the delegation has not visited the [Ataturk]  Mausoleum, a source of tension and dispute between the two  countries.    Iran impressed the Turkish public with its stance regarding  terrorism, particularly the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK). The  anti-PKK statements made by Iranian officials, coupled with the  fact that they had handed over a number of terrorists, made a  favorable impression on Turkish officials.    This visit laid a solid foundation for President Suleyman  Demirel's visit to Iran, which will take place on July 25, a  Turkish official told the TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN].    ""Iranians were very positive regarding our concerns about  PKK  activities in the Turco-Iranian border region. They reassured  us that they would never condone terrorist activities that  targeted Turkey. They proved this by handing over to us scores  of PKK members who had been caught on their soil. Turkey and  Iran also shared similar views on regional issues. Both sides  want to improve their mutual relations,"" one of official said.  Meanwhile, Turkey has reacted to Iran's concerns on terrorism  in a similar manner.    Asked if Turkey would turn over to Tehran members of the  Iranian opposition Mojahedin-e Khalq Party detained in Turkey,  Interior Minister Nahit Mentese said: ""We will not allow any  anti-Iranian activity on Turkish soil. We will not shelter  anyone who can harm Iran.""    One Iranian official told TDN that they were delighted with  Turkey's response. ""They assured us that they would prevent  anti- Iranian activities in Turkey. Time will tell whether  these guarantees hold true, but we trust in the words of the  Turkish officials,"" he noted.    Mentese announced that Iran and Turkey would struggle  against  terrorism together. ""Our agreement covers issues other than the  PKK,"" Mentese concluded.    Besharati stressed that positive and constructive contacts  had been made during his visit.    ""We have no dispute with Turkey,"" he said. ""Our borders are  closed to Turkey's enemies. There are no members of the  subversive and separatist PKK on Iranian soil. Turkey does not  have a closer or more sincere friend in the region than Iran.""  As the Iranian delegation left Turkey for Tehran on Monday [13  June] morning, Besharati aid: ""Turkey and Iran should follow a  common policy regarding Northern Iraq. We informed Turkish  officials about our stance and strategy on this issue. During  our meetings with Turkish officials, we said that Iran supported  the territorial integrity of Iraq and was opposed to the  establishment of a Kurdish state in the region.""    The Problem of Northern Iraq    Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry spokesman Ataman said that the  terrorist organization has benefited from the instability in  Northern Iraq.    ""The Kurdistan Democracy Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani  and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani  held a meeting in Silopi on June 13... During the meeting we  informed them of Turkey's stance and on the country's views on  the latest developments in the region,"" Ataman noted. He said  that Kurdish leaders were aware of the fact that Turkey  considered a renewal of the elections in Northern Iraq  unnecessary.    Pointing out that the way to stability in Northern Iraq  should be sought for in Iraq, Ataman concluded: ""This attitude  was also expressed by the communiques published after the  meeting of Iran, Turkey, and Syria, and that of Turkey, the  United States, France and Britain. A dialogue should be created  between Baghdad and Northern Iraq.""     "

That is, all the  political and social forces of the country have been consulted  and have been associated with this effort aimed at setting up  transitional institutions to reach a national consensus on the  resumption of the electoral process of course, and to build the  new Algerian society. I do not think it is appropriate to speak  of government versus opposition. I think this concept is  completely false. There is a state and a government that are  trying to organize, to the best of their ability, the  transitional period, and a political elite that has its own  interpretations, something that is normal in a democratic  regime. The aim is to achieve this consensus around the key  points included in the transitional platform, which should  guarantee the continuity of the Algerian state, the continuity  of the republican order, the defense of individual rights and  freedom, as well as respect for the elements constituting our  national character and the rejection of violence as a means of  obtaining power and keeping it.    The democratic process has never been interrupted in  Algeria.  This is in fact why we can still see parties pursuing their  activities freely. The press is also free. We should not  forget that not long ago in Europe, these problems of transition  were experienced by at least two countries. In Spain, the  Moncloa Pact had to be signed to manage the transition toward a  multiparty system and the emergence of a republican state. In  Portugal, it took no fewer than four transitional governments,  if I remember correctly, to form a constitutional government.  The issue here is the transition from a system of partisan  democracy to a democratic multyparty system.    [Bouziane] Minister, how do you assess the relationship  between Algeria and France?    [Dembri] Good on the whole. We are pleased at this moment to  see that there is a great understanding of the Algerian  situation on the part of French political circles. Some  worst-case scenarios are entertained by some editorials of the  French press, but on the whole, it is obvious that putting the  problems of Algeria within the Mediterranean framework at the  moment is, beyond the confines of any relationship, good for  joint development. This joint development will force us to look  at the problems of the future in terms of solutions that we  should find together to everything that concerns the economy and  movement of persons and property, etc.    [Bouziane] At the diplomatic level, Minister, we have  recently noticed Algerian diplomatic activity particularly  concerning Mali, with the signing of the National Pact, and  Niger. What is the future of a settlement of the Tuareg problem  in these two countries?    [Dembri] Listen, we are doing what a neighboring country  should do: aspiring to build a prosperous community. At the two  levels of cooperation and security, we have built a  Sahelian-Saharan community, which we hope to see integrated and  homogenous.    [Bouziane] Does this mean that Algeria will soon organize  direct negotiations between the Niger Government and the Niger  Tuaregs?    [Dembri] This does not matter. There are three mediators in  this conflict. There is the Burkinabe mediator, the French  mediator, and the Algerian mediator. The meetings -- and a few  of these will be held -- should take place on a rotational basis  in the different countries involved. A meeting has already been  held in Ouagadougou. Our mediators recently met the two parties  to these negotiations. A meeting is secheduled to take place in  Paris, I suppose, on 15 June, and we will try of course to  contribute positively, as always, because we have to guarantee  peace, security, and development in all this Sahelian-Saharan  region.

In an interview with the Iranian news agency's correspondent  in Khartoum on Sunday [3 April], Professor Saraj said the media,  parliamentary, and political circles were responsible for  America's hostility towards Sudan. He said the United States  had never been concerned with the restoration of peace in  southern Sudan, and that it used the rebels in the south as a  pretext to put pressure on the Sudanese Government. [passage  omitted]    He emphasized that Sudan will not accept threats and will  never give up its Islamic path, whatever the pressures.    He said the United States cannot internationalize the  conflict in southern Sudan, as that would constitute a violation  of Sudanese sovereignty. Sudan is ready to defend its  independence and territorial integrity.     "

Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for  this.    [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since.  Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was  not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa.  Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that  imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I  believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to  hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then  still in prison, and with the ANC.    [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years  we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades?    [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in  fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the  sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977.  This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the  black South Africans. They seriously supported the  Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO  all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the  change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced  and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South  Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the  previous, very pro-Israel, white regime.    [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this  eliminated?    [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts.  That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect  were followed through to the date set for their termination. No  new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations  between us have completely decayed.    [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will  continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this?    [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two  countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export  there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish  community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a  year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition,  and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and  he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future.  Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting  dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South  African leadership.    [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African  cooperation regarding black Africa in general?    [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though  I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of  country will South African become? So far, it has been a  Western country with a black population that could not even  vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another  Third World country with the symptoms of such countries,  including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or  will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous  wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the  case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the  ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as  Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will  continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very  intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African  countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to  cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however,  doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]     "

This week Moscow carried out an ""offensive"" across  the entire line of the ""Vietnamese front"": on Thursday talks  were also held between the chiefs of the two countries' general  staffs. The discussion focused on questions related to the  servicing of the Russian military base at Cam Ranh.    After the removal of the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam,  Russia, remembering the losses of many East European and Asian  markets, decided to change its tactics for the protection of its  interests in that country. And although, according to Mikhail  Fradkov, first deputy ministry of foreign economic relations,  Russia has not yet felt competition from the United States in  the Vietnamese market, Moscow has already felt a slight chill in  relations with the ""Hanoi comrades."" And in order to ensure  against possible unpleasantness in the future, Russia has placed  its stakes on not only preserving but expanding the spheres of  cooperation.    As a KOMMERSANT correspondent learned, the greatest  difficulty in the talks was caused by the problem of Vietnamese  indebtedness (its the overall volume today comes to $10  billion). And that is why Mr. Fradkov called the decision to  reinvest at least part of it in setting up joint ventures in  Vietnam ($80 million worth) the ""Russian delegation's greatest  success."" Two Russian-Vietnamese joint ventures for the  production of latex and activated charcoal were chosen as  targets of investment. It was possible to reach agreement for  part of current indebtedness to be paid in the form of  deliveries of goods ($70 million worth).    On the other hand, in the opinion of [Le Suan Chin], the  head  of the administrative offices of the Socialist Republic of  Vietnam government, the Vietnamese side's main victory was to  get a considerable expansion of the list of mutual deliveries of  goods in 1994, as well as the list of industrial facilities in  Vietnam whose construction will be carried out with Russia's  assistance. However, whereas such construction was financed with  Soviet state credits during the existence of the USSR, today all  projects are being financed jointly by Russian and Vietnamese  firms. And since both sides' funds are limited, in the talks a  decision was made for Russia to take part in an international  bidding for Vietnamese facilities (international organizations  will serve as the sponsor in them). The new projects will  include the construction of the [Yali] Hydroelectric Power  Station and several electric power networks and roads.    The question of debt was also addressed in the talks between  Mikhail Kolesnikov, the chief of the general staff of Russia's  Armed Forces, and his Vietnamese colleague [Dao Dinh Luen], in  which First Deputy Minister of Defense Andrey Kokoshin also took  part. The problem is that, according to an intergovernmental  agreement, the Vietnamese side is supposed to cover all expenses  for the maintenance of the Russian material and technical supply  center (read Russian Navy base) at Cam Ranh and credit them  toward repayment of its debt. So far use of the base has been  free for Moscow, but it is not out of the question that as the  debt gets repaid, Hanoi will more and more insistently press the  question of rent for Cam Ranh (which it prefers to speak of so  far in Aesopian language).    Some Figures on Cooperation Between Russia and Vietnam    In 1993 trade between Russia and Vietnam came to $500  million  (this year the plans are to raise it to $1 billion).    Russia's principal spheres of activity in Vietnam are power  station construction (two hydroelectric power stations--the  [Chan] and the [Khuabin]--and the [Faley] Thermal Electric Power  Station are already in operation, and the [Yali] Hydroelectric  Power Station is under construction) and petroleum extraction.

By announcing on 6 April that Russia would join the  program in the near future, President Yeltsin temporarily put an  end to the argument in Russia. It is reported that Russia is  likely to sign the program's framework agreement on 21 April.    The ""partnership for peace"" program was approved at a NATO  summit meeting early this year. Its main contents are: NATO  will not be expanded for the time being, but will establish a  partnership with countries in Eastern Europe and the  Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS] so that they can ""make  a gradual transition toward NATO member status.""    Russia welcomes the NATO ""partnership for peace"" program,  holding that it will prevent another split in Europe, but that  it is not fully in keeping with Russia's interests. The Russian  Government is sharply divergent on whether it should join the  program. The Foreign Ministry and Defense Ministry hold:  Russia cannot prevent NATO from developing relations with East  European countries. If Russia disregards this reality, it will  be excluded from the new European security system.  Participation in the program will be conducive to coordinating  its relations with the United States and other Western countries  and it can transform this program internally to make it conform  to Russia's interest. Russian parliamentary leaders and others,  however, are opposed to hurriedly joining the NATO mechanism on  the grounds that it is out of keeping with Russia's status as a  big power and that it will probably result in Russia losing its  room for diplomatic maneuvering and its right to carry out arms  trade and hamper strategic cooperation within the CIS. The  parliament's International Affairs Commission approved a  resolution saying that only when NATO accords Russia ""special  status"" will it join the program.    Under such circumstances, while announcing that Russia would  join the program, President Yeltsin emphatically pointed out:  Russia's partnership with NATO should ""be in keeping with  Russia's status and role in world and European affairs and with  Russia's military strength and nuclear status"" and ""be different  from other countries' relations with NATO in terms of scope and  contents."" Judging by the Russian leader's statement, the  ""special status"" Russia is seeking in the NATO program generally  includes the following aspects: allowing Russia to attend NATO  membership meetings and join in making important policy  decisions; recognizing Russia's ""special responsibilities""  toward the former Soviet region; and taking into consideration  Russia's interest on such issues as military transformation and  defense structures. Moreover, Russia also wants to link its  participation in ""partnership for peace"" with its participation  in the G-7 economic group so as to get more economic aid.    Russia's demand for a ""special relationship"" poses a  difficult problem for NATO. Acceding to its demand is  tantamount to a recognition that the CIS belongs to Russia's  sphere of influence, thus upsetting the course of Eastern  European states joining the program. Poland, the Czech  Republic, and Ukraine have warned NATO that ""accommodating  Russia"" is likely to scuttle the entire ""partnership for peace""  program.    In fact, NATO and Russia have their own axes to grind. The  United States and its allies are attempting to fill the  ""security vacuum"" in Eastern Europe and establish a new system  of European security, with NATO as the nucleus. Russia,  however, is worried that NATO will place Eastern Europe in its  sphere of influence and thus threaten Russia's security  interests. Therefore, it wants to maintain Eastern Europe as a  buffer zone, with Russia and the West guaranteeing its security.  It wants to develop a partnership for Europe as a whole through  the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council. This actually reflects the  strategic differences between the two parties. Consequently,  even if Russia signs the ""partnership for peace"" program, it  will still bargain hard with the West about the essence of this  program.     "

On February 22, the U.S. Government instituted judicial  proceedings against Aldrich Hazen Ames, the former chief of the  CIA's Soviet counter-intelligence branch, and his wife Maria,  charging them with spying for the former Soviet Union and Russia.    Three days later, the U.S. Government expelled a Russian  diplomat from the Russian Embassy in Washington.    It's widely believed that the incident will have a major  impact on Russian-U.S. relations.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher personally handed  an statement of protest to the Russian Embassy in Washington,  declaring that the U.S. could not tolerate Russia installing  spies in its country and describing the incident as a very  serious matter.    Commenting on the case, U.S. President Bill Clinton  suggested  that as a result the U.S. will completely re-evaluate its  foreign policy toward Russia. Many senators in the U.S.  Congress insisted that amendments should be attached to policies  on aid to Russia.    In the last two years, the United States and Russia have  been  seeking a strategic partnership in their relations. In January  their presidents met in Moscow and signed a declaration  announcing that the two countries had entered a stage of  ""strategic partnership"".    However, there are still contradictions and differences  between the two countries on matters of vital interests.    Russia has always claimed that it has ""special interests and  responsibilities"" in the new republics which have emerged in the  territories of the former Soviet Union. Russia has taken it for  granted that it has the right to send its peace keeping troops  into these republics and has taken economic measures to  safeguard its interests in them.    Meanwhile, the United States has been using the carrot of  economic aid to various republics and countries in the area as a  means of containing Russia's influence.    The United States, for example, has supported the three  Baltic republics in their request for the withdrawal of Russian  troops and has offered more economic aid for the Ukraine. It  also signed an accord of ""democratic partnership"" with  Kazakhstan.    Observers here consider that the proposed U.S. plan for  expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),  which it has described as a ""partnership for peace"", poses a  threat to Russian interests in East European countries where it  previously had traditional influence.    So far, the Russian Government has kept a tight rein on its  response to the U.S. spy allegations. The Russian intelligence  agency has also kept silent, despite Russia's known displeasure  about the U.S. decision to publicly announce the allegations and  the charges without consulting it in advance.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in a statement  last Thursday [24 February] that the Ames issue should not be  placed at the top of the Russian-U.S. relations agenda.    Kozyrev said he believed that the issue won't set back the  hopes for a partnership for peace between Russia and the United  States. The Foreign Ministry also expressed its hope that the  issue could be settled before the political and diplomatic  interests of both countries were put in jeopardy.    Sources from Russian intelligence agencies here said they  were bewildered by the dramatizing of the spy issue on the part  of their American colleagues and the U.S. Government.    An official with the Russian intelligence agency said in an  informal talk that spies from the U.S. are also active on  Russian territory and hence the Ames issue should be tackled  within a framework drawn up between the intelligence agencies of  the two countries.    However, press commentators in Moscow are convinced that the  uproar in the U.S. about the issue will have an adverse effect  on the future development of the relations between the two  countries. They believe that the approach now used by the two  sides to calm down the row will, to some degree, dictate where  their bilateral relations will head for.     "

The PRCA says that while former board members remain with the two companies, neither will be considered as members. The Institute of Public Relations, the other professional body, is still deciding on its response.

The reports on Russia's refusal were  distributed by Reuters Tuesday with reference to Greek Minister  for European Relations Theodoros Pangalos.    Laar told Interfax that Russia's step could be viewed as a  diplomatic attack intended to obstruct Estonia's integration in  such structures as the European Union, West European Union and  NATO keeping it within the scope of its influence. Laar pointed  to the support rendered by Western Europe to the Baltic States.  France's proposal to discuss Baltic-Russian relations, in the  first place border disputes and ethnic issues, and promote their  rapid resolution at the Paris conference was another sign of  this approach.

As he commented on the U.S. congressmen's proposals, the  Mexican diplomat stressed the position already taken by the  Mexican Embassy in Washington. ""The nature of the Mexican  electoral process is something that concerns neither the U.S.  Congress nor the U.S. Government.""    As for the concept of ""foreign visitors"" which the Mexican  Congress already included in the Federal Code of Institutions  and Electoral Procedures (Cofipe), Rozental pointed out that the  government ""so far"" has not anticipated inviting any foreign  figure or institution to witness the development of the general  elections. ""Should there be an agreement on this issue among  the nine political parties, I am sure the government would not  oppose it.""    He also explained that the procedures to extend the  invitations will ""not necessarily"" be accomplished through the  Foreign Relations Secretariat. ""In that case, the Federal  Electoral Institute [IFE] and Government Secretary Jorge  Carpizo, as IFE president [as published], must extend the  invitations.""    According to a document by the UN Electoral Assistance Unit,  headed by Horacio Boneo, the Mexican Government is reportedly  studying the possibility of authorizing ""foreign visitors"" who,  it is believed, would join the group of almost 15,000 national  observers who will verify compliance with the laws at the 94,000  electoral booths that will open nationwide on 21 August.    Last week, these observers, members of a large network of  nongovernmental organizations grouped under the Observation 94  Civic Alliance, agreed with the United Nations to set up a  mechanism to receive training and counsel from the UN Electoral  Assistance Unit.    Meanwhile, the process to reform Cofipe to allow the  presence  of ""foreign visitors"" ended on 13 May, as the Congress  unanimously approved the inclusion of this new concept in  Mexican legislation. The only thing left to do is to include the  definition, responsibilities, and limitations of these  ""visitors"" in the regulating law.    So far, only the Confederation of Industrial Chambers has  planned to invite some foreign institutions, including the  commission headed by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, as  ""visitors."" It is expected political parties will hand out  their own invitations to similar institutions and personalities.    The Bonior-Torricelli initiative, which is based on the  concept that NAFTA must foster a spirit of ""familiarity"" among  its three members in all fields, including politics and  democracy, failed to receive the endorsement to be presented to  the U.S. House of Representatives. It seems only 14  representatives are supporting it, and the Foreign Affairs  Committee is refusing to back it.    ""I have the impression that in addition to a few  Mexico-bashers [previous word published in English] there, no  further support is going to be found; Bonior and Torricelli will  achieve nothing."" The deputy secretary stressed that the  wording of the initiative by these two Democratic congressmen  has ""meddling undertones,"" and it is completely fruitless.    ""The U.S. Government, even Bill Clinton himself, has  supported all efforts made so far to improve the electoral  process and, above all, the foreign observation issue, which we  are resolving on our own [motu propio]. This  Torricelli play does not even help.""    The duo had previously presented several initiatives on  Mexico. The two of them were very active in opposing NAFTA  because they thought Mexico lacked the merits to become a  privileged member of the northern hemisphere. Recently, they  attempted to encourage Congress to discuss the Chiapas conflict.    ""I feel Torricelli, with his Cuban perceptions on his back,  is very resentful because he failed to convince our government  to support his anti-Cuban policies,"" said the deputy secretary.  As for Bonior, ""this is his revenge for failing to halt NAFTA.""  The thing ""is that neither of them knows Mexico, and it shows.""     "

The DTI's Bureau of International Trade Relations [BITR]  clarified that the decision of the United States to maintain its  present level of sugar importation, including the substantial  amount exported by the Philippines, is based precisely on the  conversion of its quantitative restrictions on the import of  that product to tariff equivalents. This, in effect, is what  the principle of tariffication is all about. BITR Director  Antonio Buencamino pointed out that conversion of import  ceilings to tariff increases to effect the same degree of  protection for country's competitive industries.

""The numbers mentioned are  totally unverified,"" a U.S. Embassy spokesman said, and added:    ""There is talk about 40, 60, or 70 people, but I only know  about 25."" The same spokesman said that what actually happened  was that the witnesses were summoned normally and according to  the law, except for a few cases where certain persons were  summoned by the police.    These remarks give rise to reasonable questions even among  the Albanian opposition, whose leading members claim openly that  the shadow of some U.S. secret agencies hovers behind the  Albanian Government's actions.    Commenting on [Albanian President] Sali Berisha's policy,  Servet Pellumbi, first vice chairman of the Socialist Party of  Albania, sarcastically said yesterday that ""one can find many  good things about Berisha, but ideas are not among them."" He  added:    ""No matter how crazy Berisha might be, he cannot possibly  act  alone."" As he explained, it is impossible for the policy of  Berisha and the Albanian Government not to be guided by other  foreign powers and primarily the United States. However, he  stressed: ""We should know, however, that the U.S. policy toward  Albania is not unified. There is congressional policy, State  Department policy, and the secret agencies' policy.""    Pellumbi added that things in the political field recently  seem to be changing as the U.S. Embassy is slowly approaching  the other political parties, even the Socialist Party.    Leading members of other Albanian parties agree with this  assessment by Servet Pellumbi and they also maintain that this  means a change in the stance of Americans toward Albania.  However, this view is not shared by a foreign diplomat in  Tirana, who said that the Americans' opening up to all the  Albanian parties shows precisely their determination to be  regulators of domestic affairs in Albania--and in a broader  sense of its foreign relations--for a long time.    According to a statement to a Greek correspondent by Servet  Pellumbi, the Socialist Party of Albania insists on the path of  dialogue with Greece and not the escalation of tension.  Pellumbi made it clear that this position forms the basis of  criticism that the Socialist Party of Albania makes against the  government and President Seli Berisha on the issue of  Greek-Albanian relations.    At the same time, Pellumbi expressed satisfaction at the  cool  and reasonable stance maintained by the Greek Government during  the recent crisis in the two countries' relations and stressed  in particular the fact that the Greek side did not play its card  of Albanian immigrants as the Konstandinos Mitsotakis government  had done in the past. He added that the latter fact had a  favorable effect on the Albanian people and it is something  which, as he noted, Berisha himself did not understand.    On the subject of the Albanian president, Pellumbi said that  he has no cohesion in his policy whatsoever and that he seems to  like Europe but his mind is really elsewhere.    However, referring to Greece, the socialist leader said that  there are some chauvinistic circles from which he believes the  Greek Government should be cut off and moreover that Greece  should respect the autocephalous status of the Albanian Orthodox  Church and not link it to the Albanian state from which it was  already separated as of 1928.    Pellumbi also condemned the ugly incidents during Easter and  stressed that ""unfortunately, the two countries' governments  became involved in them afterward.""    In conclusion, Pellumbi stressed that until now the U.S.  Embassy in Tirana has supported the Albanian Government's  policy. Concerning Europe, he said that ""for Berisha it  constitutes the font in which he will be pardoned for all the  violations of political and human rights in the name of the  internal and external `dangers' facing Albania and which  nevertheless are the result of the lack of capability of Berisha  himself and his government.""

Speaking during a session of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, Mr Qian said the turmoil was Russia's internal affair, but he hoped the situation would stabilise quickly. Mr Qian's non-committal references to the constitutional crisis in neighbouring Russia - their border is the longest in the world - reflect an apparent attempt by Beijing to remain neutral in the crisis. Unlike western leaders, the Chinese have given no indication that they support Mr Yeltsin; or, on the other hand, that they might favour his removal. China's media reporting appears to have been scrupulously even-handed. China's communist leaders have never evinced much public enthusiasm for Mr Yeltsin, who visited Beijing last December. Chinese hardliners have in the past denounced him as a 'traitor to communism'. Diplomats say that while China's leaders may lack full confidence in Mr Yeltsin, they are more frightened of alternatives such as the emergence of more militant Russian nationalism along their western flank.

The survey of 527 private and public-sector companies also found that nearly two thirds of respondents predicted that the minimum wage would have no effect on pay differentials, while a further fifth expected a limited effect. A recent survey by the British Hospitality Association, which represents employers in hotels, restaurants and catering, calculated that a minimum wage would increase the wage bill by only 5.9 per cent, although that figure rose dramatically to 65.5 per cent if all differentials were maintained. On job losses, 85 per cent of managers did not foresee their organisation reducing staff.

Industrial Relations Services, which found average awards at 3.6 per cent in the final quarter of last year, said that eight out of 10 deals were above the inflation rate during that quarter. The union-funded Labour Research Department has also found average settlements settling at 3.6 per cent in the three months to the end of January.

The United States  Justice Ministry claims that the Ames couple has spied against  the United States since 1985. The U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher has lodged an official protest with a Russian  diplomat who was invited to the Department of State. In Moscow,  the U.S. Ambassador Pickering voiced a similar protest at his  meeting with Russian Foreign Ministry officials. Radio Moscow's  reporter, Aleksandr Peripetchko has asked the chief of the  Public Relations Bureau of Russia's external intelligence, Yuriy  Kobaladze, to comment on the arrest of the American couple on  charges of spying for Russia:    [Kobaladze] Firstly, it is unclear for what reason the  Russian external intelligence is believed to be involved in that  affair. This question should be addressed to the Americans,  those who made the arrest, those who formulated the charges,  U.S. Administration officials. This is not our business. We  never comment on such issues. This is a generally recognized  practice for all secret services. The Russian intelligence is  no exception. No comments are made on whether this or that  person was, or is, involved in intelligence operations. All  professionals are perfectly aware of that. So is the public at  large. This is the reason why I refrain from any comments.    [Announcer] A BBC report said that the United States does  not  want another round of mutual expulsions, so frequent in the Cold  War years. Yet it hopes that Russia will recall from the United  States those diplomats who have worked with the Ames couple.  Washington would also like to hear promises from Moscow that  nothing of the sort will happen in the future. What does the  public relations official of the Russian external intelligence  think of that? Yuriy Kobaladze:    [Kobaladze] If we avoid focusing on this concrete episode  and  speak in broader terms, the Russian intelligence has never  pledged to curtail intelligence activity. No other Western  intelligence, including the American one, has ever done so  either. Moreover, Washington keeps saying that in the wake of  the break-up of the Soviet Union, its interest in Russia's  problems and in the problems of other former Soviet republics  has grown and not reduced. The Americans say they must increase  the presence of the intelligence in that region. They have  talked a great deal about what they call human intelligence.  This euphemism means recruiting agents. The American  intelligence and other foreign secret services have been very  active in that respect.    [Announcer] One of Russia's central dailies, IZVESTIYA,  earlier this month published an interview with the chief of  Russia's Federal Counterintelligence, Mr. Golushko. In that  interview he said outright that several people have been  arrested on spying charges. The damage one of them has caused to  Russia is similar only to that of the Penkovskiy affair in the  60's. This is only one of the examples of how active Western  secret services have been in Russia. Washington seems to be  expecting Moscow to take certain steps to restore stability in  its relations with the United States, the more so since the  United States President Bill Clinton has described this as a  very serious incident. Is that so? Yuriy Kobaladze:    [Kobaladze] What we would like to say is that individual  episodes should not be used to build up tensions in Russian-U.S.  relations. That is a Cold War tactic. If we really live in a  new world, a world of cooperation and good-neighborliness, it  would be senseless to fan this hysteria.    [Announcer] One cannot but agree that even in this changing  world, an intelligence service will remain so. It will continue  to have its own specific interest and use its own means. It  remains to be seen whether this episode will have a negative  effect on Russian- U.S. relations or not.     "

Let us expand the issue now and move south.  The Greeks are eyeing Cyprus with a hearty appetite and are  waiting for the day they will get the entire island. The reason  is that Cyprus is about 80 km away from our southern coast,  while it is much further away from Greece. Now, if the Greeks  get the entire island -- and that is what lies behind the plans  for a so-called federation -- they will consider it a continent  and thus lay claim to its continental shelf and territorial  waters. As a result, Turkish ships will not be allowed in the  sea traffic from the Canakkale Strait to Iskenderun Bay. This  is the equivalent of strangling someone.    The Greeks would not be satisfied if we agreed to a  federation in Cyprus, if we granted state status to the Fener  Patriarchate, if we installed church bells in the St. Sophie  Museum, and if we even gave them Istanbul and Izmir. Little by  little, they are tightening the circle around us. On one side,  they are establishing a close friendship with Syria and Egypt  and trying to form another hostile front against us from the  south; on the other hand, they are supporting the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] and trying to get their hands on our  southeastern borders. Furthermore, they are trying to establish  a partnership with the Slavic states such as the Russian  Federation, Bulgaria, and the new Yugoslavia. These states have  their eyes on us and have demands of their own from us.  Therefore, they are more than willing to become partners in such  a hostile front against us. This would leave Turkey totally  surrounded by a ring of fire, and we would not be able to live  on our land.    Please do not think that this is the script of an adventure  film or an imaginary fear. It is just another one of the  developments we have been repeatedly faced with throughout our  history and from which we managed to extricate ourselves each  time with God's help. It is not a new development.    I always say: Sooner or later, we will find ourselves in a  confrontation with the Greeks. In fact, Greek foreign policy is  based on enmity against Turkey and on war between Turkey and  Greece. They are not afraid to repeat that incessantly. For  now, they are coping with the issue through Cold War methods and  diplomacy, because of the imbalance of power between us and  because they have not yet solved their other foreign policy  problems. For example, even if they share certain common  aspects with Greece today, the Bulgarians have always had  certain demands from that country. Let us not forget the  incidents at the end of World War II. There is also the case of  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].  It is still a hot issue. The Greeks are afraid that if they  ask FYROM ""to unite against the common enemy,"" then FYROM will  say: ""Let us reach agreement on our own problem as well.""    The imbalance of power between Turkey and Greece is obvious.  Our population is 10 times greater than that of Greece. Greece  cannot handle our ground forces. Furthermore, I do not think  that Greece's big brothers in the West would do much more than  say to it: ""Good for you""; neither do I think they would run  the risk of a new world war that would start in the Balkans.    Besides, from the legal point of view, we would be the right  side in any Turkish-Greek confrontation. There are several  logical reasons for that. It would be something like a  ""defensive war.""    I hope my dear readers will not think that I am a warmonger.  I am a peaceful person. When you are pushed against a wall,  however, and people are trying to strangle you, there is nothing  else you can do.    If that happens, how would the fact that both countries are  NATO members affect the situation? Let us discuss this tomorrow.     "

It will also seek to re-negotiate its extradition treaty with Washington, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. Mexico's Foreign Relations Ministry said the ruling was 'invalid and unacceptable'. It 'transgresses essential principles of international law', it added. The Mexican government called the kidnapping a criminal act. The US Supreme Court ruled on Monday that Dr Humberto Alvarez Machain, indicted for the torture and murder of a DEA agent in 1985, need not be returned to Mexico as his kidnapping and spiriting away to the US did not break any US law. The decision to repatriate Dr Alvarez was a question for the executive branch, the court said. The ruling overturned an appeal court decision that the abduction was illegal. The Supreme Court decision puts the Bush administration in an awkward position. While it supports the right to seize suspects abroad for trial in the US, it has also called for increased international co-operation in the war on drugs.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Iranian First Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hashemi, Iranian  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother and former head of  Iranian radio and television, is expected to visit Turkey on May  2, diplomatic sources told TURKISH DAILY NEWS [TDN].    ""Economic and political issues will be discussed by Turkish  officials during this visit. Hashemi will hold a meeting with  Turkish Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Ozdem Sanberk and is  expected to be received by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and  President Suleyman Demirel,"" a high-ranking Iranian official  told TDN.    Hashemi will outline the Iranian government's views on  latest  developments in the region and the world, the same source said.  ""The Karabakh question, the Bosnia problem and the issue of  northern Iraq will be the main topics of the consultations. The  views of the Turkish and Iranian governments are quite similar  on these subjects. The question for the two friendly countries  is how to act together to solve these problems. Economic issues  will also be discussed by Turkish and Iranian officials. There  is a political will to accelerate economic relations between the  two countries,"" he disclosed.    Iran has recently launched a new liberalization project,  designed by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, that aims to create a  powerful economic system, which will integrate Iran into the  global economic system. Hashemi-Rafsanjani is proposing a  privatization campaign for state-owned enterprises, to lift  government subsidies, to develop Iran's resources other than  crude oil, to encourage exporters and lessen the Iranian  economy's dependence on oil revenues.    Meanwhile, a Turkish delegation, comprising Eximbank,  Treasury and State Pipeline company (BOTAS) officials, will  visit Iran in early May.    During the visit, Turkish and Iranian officials will discuss  the natural gas pipeline project, which there are plans to  extend to Europe via Turkey. Iran, which ranks second in the  world in terms of natural gas resources, is attaching great  importance to this project since its oil export revenues are  declining due to low world market prices. Turkey is also trying  to break its dependence on natural gas imports from the Russian  Federation.    Turkey has taken an extremely positive stance toward this  project. ""We want to realize it as soon as possible,"" Hayrettin  Uzun, general director of BOTAS, told TDN.    The delegation will determine the conditions of the purchase  by Turkey of 3 million barrels of crude oil from Iran. This  deal was decided on at the Turkey-Iran Joint Economic Commission  meeting in Tehran in February.    The talks will also focus on the economic difficulties  facing  both countries. Iran, which is trying to reschedule its foreign  debts to Western countries, is expected to propose repaying its  $70 million debt to Turkey in cash instead of with crude oil,  despite its shortage of foreign currency. Turkish and Iranian  officials will discuss how to develop the two countries'  secondary resources with the aim of increasing their revenues.  Economic relations and opportunities for cooperation with the  Central Asian republics will be two of the main items discussed  during the talks.    Security Talks    Meanwhile, the eighth Turkey-Iran Joint Security Committee  meeting is continuing in Tehran, having begun on Monday.  Interior Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Muharrem Goktayoglu is  attending the meeting, as the head of the Turkish delegation.  Decisions reached in previous security meetings and the  activities of the subcommittees are among the topics being  debated.    The committee is working on developing new policies to be  implemented in the future.    The Joint Security Committee was established by a security  agreement signed in 1992 in Tehran. According to this  agreement, Iran has been handing over members of the outlawed  Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to Turkey.    The security agreement foresees the type of cooperation  between Turkey and Iran that will lead these countries to  handing over individuals who are suspected of perpetrating acts  against either country. Within the framework of this agreement,  joint security committees and subcommittees hold periodic  meetings to discuss latest security developments.     "

The sources said that in the China-Mongolia Treaty on  Friendly Relations and Cooperation, which will replace an  earlier bilateral treaty dating from 1960, each side will pledge  not to join military or political groups directed at the other.    Nor will they conclude any agreement with a third country  which threatens the other country's sovereignty or security,  according to the draft treaty.    The treaty, to be signed Friday between Li and Mongolian  Premier Punsalmaagiyn Jasray, further says that neither country  will allow a third country to use its territory to threaten the  sovereignty or security of the other, the sources said.

The expulsion order is the latest in a  series of rows between the two countries.    Iran's charge d'affaires Gholamreza Ansari was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see  Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg, according to THE  GUARDIAN newspaper.    The Foreign Office refused to comment on the expulsion, but  officials confirmed the meeting took place.    The expulsion follows a row over British charges that the  Iranian intelligence services had been in contact with the IRA.  Tehran denied the charge and claimed that Britain had bugged  its London embassy.    Relations between Britain and Iran have been strained since  the Islamic revolution in 1979. Ties between the two countries  were severed in 1989 over the Salman Rushdie affair, when  Iranian religious leaders issued a fatwa [Islamic legal ruling]  calling for the killing of the author. But links were restored  the following year.     "

According to one of its members, Konstantin Zatulin,  chairman  of the Committee for CIS Affairs and Relations With Compatriots,  the delegation ""went practically everywhere and met practically  everyone."" ""Certain obvious conclusions"" of the group were  offered the Duma at the end of the past week, in the form,  specifically, of a draft federal law on a suspension of Russia's  participation in the sanctions against the FRY [Federal Republic  of Yugoslavia].    ""We consider it essential that the Duma address to the  parliaments and peoples of the world a message reflecting its  idea of how the Yugoslav conflict should be settled,"" Konstantin  Zatulin shared his conclusions. ""First, an immediate cease-fire,  without any conditions. The second idea is an appeal to  parliaments that they not add fuel to the fire. Finally, the  third initiative concerns a conference with the participation of  the great powers and the Balkan countries, which would discuss,  in particular, the prospects of a lifting of sanctions in  respect to the new Yugoslavia.""    [Sharyy] This initiative is, obviously, the main conclusion  that the group of Russian deputies reached in the course of  their trip?    [Zatulin] Yes, and it is reflected in the documents of the  State Duma: that it be recommended that the president, the  government, and the Foreign Ministry adopt vigorous measures  within the UN framework for a repeal of sanctions. I would like  to explain why Carthage, which is to be destroyed, is in this  case to be restored. Sanctions are pernicious and ineffective.  However paradoxical, they have united the Serb people now living  on the territory of various states. Militarily, the prohibitory  measures do not play a big part: The armed might of the Serbs is  great enough. But when it is a question of the position of the  civilian population, the prospect of social conflicts.... Here,  yes, sanctions are simply strangling Yugoslavia. The immorality  of an attempt to bring an entire people to the brink of  extinction is obvious.    That Russia formerly adopted the decision to participate in  the sanctions is a cause of constant internal political  friction. We were in too much of a hurry, disregarding the  country's national interests, and all of Russia's subsequent  diplomatic maneuvers have been clumsy attempts at  self-rehabilitation.    [Sharyy] The Duma occupies a hard-line position in respect  to  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it would seem?    [Zatulin] Deputies structuring their relations with the  diplomats on a confrontational basis is not what I would want.  But we are having to do this, unfortunately: Compliance with the  decision of the State Duma is being monitored, and unless the  Foreign Ministry and the government take the appropriate action,  we shall be forced to pass a law on Russia's unilateral  withdrawal from the regime of sanctions. This is a disputed,  declaratory decision, which will do little, but it will help  Russia preserve its honor. And honor is something in itself. It  is absolutely pointless for our foreign minister to imagine  himself a latter-day George the Dragon-Slayer, who is intent on  lancing socialism and communism in Serbia.    I am concerned for the friendship of Russia and Serbia, but  I  do not believe that friendship can justify everything. What kind  of friendship of Moscow and Belgrade, generally, are we talking  about? The Serbs had and continue to have a desire to rely on  Moscow, but our Foreign Ministry has never endeavored to lend a  hand. Russia cannot allow a people that are related to it to be  reduced to a primitive condition. The Yugoslav conflict has  demonstrated that no one can be confident of his own security  with a hungry, confused neighbor, one armed to the teeth, what  is more. The Serbs, like the Russians, are not in a position to  secure for themselves a decent life but they could perfectly  well spoil the life of others.     "

However aside from compensation for nuclear arms  removed from our territory -- $175 million -- the United States  is going to earmark another $10 million for the creation in Kiev  of an international scientific center that would employ  scientists who used to work in defense industries. According to  U.S. experts, Ukraine should receive some $1 billion for the  weapons-grade uranium extracted from nuclear warheads.    However, it is too early to speak of direct economic  assistance for our state, that is investments, the sponsoring of  foreign trade, and so on. People from U.S. financial and  business circles prefer a reserved stance regarding investments  in the Ukrainian economy. Inflation, the absence of market  infrastructure and mechanisms to protect investments make  Ukraine unattractive for businessmen.    U.S. experts link economic chaos in Ukraine to the current  leadership's inability to resolve economic issues. Analyzing  the results of Ukrainian legislative elections, a correspondent  of the influential THE NEW YORK TIMES in particular points out:  ""Mr. Kravchuk used to talk about reform a lot, but he did  nothing to implement it. At the same time, he kept criticizing  the former legislature for hampering his efforts."" Similar  skeptical remarks about the activities of Leonid Kravchuk and  his team in the economic sphere, however, are fully compensated  in the sphere of foreign policy.    In the opinion of the West, the Ukrainian head of state  reaped dividends by signing the tripartite declaration.  Ukraine's gradual nuclear disarmament and access to the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty is now connected with the name of  Kravchuk. For the United States, this issue is much more actual  than problems of the Ukrainian economy. That is why Kravchuk,  despite his inability to carry out economic reform, has become  very popular with Americans due to the service he paid to the  United States. Washington understands perfectly well that under  the current Ukrainian Administration, economic changes in our  state will have to wait. That is why there are attempts to limit  U.S.-Ukrainian relations to those areas that can yield much more  than risky investment in our economy. One such sphere concerns  the military, where U.S. interests are being gradually shifted  from Russia toward Ukraine. The primary reason for this is  probably official Kiev's consent to disarm, as opposed to the  ever growing aggressiveness of Moscow's foreign policy and  attempts to enter the superpowers' club.    The United States and NATO are currently concerned over the  concentration of Russian forces pulled out from Central and East  Europe along Russia's southern (the northern Caucasian military  district) and northern (the Leningrad military district)  borders. Under the provisions of the Treaty on the Reduction of  Conventional Arms in Europe signed in 1990, Russia is to reduce  its hardware so that by November 1995, 580 armored vehicles, 700  tanks, and 1,280 artillery pieces remain in each of these  districts.    According to U.S. analysts, however, Russia is very  sluggishly reducing its arms and by the deadline in 1995 will  still have a surplus 2,000 armored vehicles, 400 tanks, and 500  artillery pieces. Russia's desire to concentrate a large amount  of hardware along its borders is no secret. During the March  conference between U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and  Russian Army Chief of Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov in Moscow, the  Russian general directly stated that it is necessary to review  the quotas of arms stipulated by the treaty.    At any rate, until November 1995 Russia has the legal right  to keep unlimited amounts of arms along its borders, despite  negative reactions by Turkey, Norway, and other NATO members.    In this situation, the United States may display interest in  Ukraine as a possible ""buffer zone"" between Russia and East  Europe. The Partnership for Peace project, to which Ukraine has  acceded, envisions joint maneuvers and at the same time does not  bind NATO's hands with commitments.    In light of the current realities, future U.S.-Ukrainian  relations will hardly cross the framework of military  cooperation.     "

While Meciar was frequently a  partner who was difficult to figure out, given a little  patience, when it was always necessary to wait awhile before he  would cool off over a problem, in the end it was generally  possible to come to agreement with him. That was also made  simpler by the fact that Meciar's basic disposition is expressly  political, which makes it possible to find compromises not  always immediately measurable in terms of money. Although the  seemingly softer Moravcik does display a willingness to exercise  more restraint in listening to the views of the Czech partners,  he unequivocally stresses Slovak commercial and economic  interests in relationships with the Czech Republic, interests  which, even in his opinion, are not now being met with equality.  His economics ministers go still further and openly state that  they will be more difficult partners for Prague than were their  Meciar predecessors.    Above all, the Moravcik government is currently concerned  with the customs union which ideologically divides Slovakia into  its opponents and defenders, the latter of which seem to be  diminishing with the passage of time. It would appear that the  number of defenders is diminishing, even despite warnings  sounded by leading Slovak economists. For example, Prof. Jozef  Kosnar, who is considered to be the principal economics expert  at the SDL [expansion unknown], when responding to a question by  HOSPODARSKE NOVINY as to what he thinks of the contribution made  to Slovakia by the customs union stated: ""Elimination of the  customs union would be a greater economic blow for Slovakia than  was the elimination of the federation in the political sense.""  However, there are only a few public officials in Bratislava who  would be willing to publicize such a view. Following the advent  of the Moravcik government, however, there was an express  increase in the number of those who publicly made no secret of  the fact that they consider the customs union as something which  not only makes no contribution, but as something which even  harms Slovakia. One of the members of the government who shares  in formulating the financial policies of the Slovak Republic  even believes that the very origin of the customs union was a  mistake for Slovakia. He adds that a small state which is  beginning its existence should primarily provide opportunities  for its manufacturers even at the price that their products are  more expensive and possibly even of a lower quality than  imported products.    Given the growing criticism of the current content of the  customs union, it is interesting to monitor the Slovak media.  Even those who had subjected Meciar's economic policies to  crushing criticism and had favored an understanding with the  Czech Republic are now stressing the need for a consistent  approach by Moravcik toward Prague in bringing about ""more just  conditions"" for trading for Slovaks with Czechs. The Slovak  approach in matters of the customs union is visibly  accelerating. It is passing from those realized technical  barriers in the image of attestations, certificates, and import  tariffs toward manifesting demands that changes be effected in  the clearing accounting procedures as well as in the customs  union itself. This type of activation which, in Bratislava, is  already slowly exceeding the limits of a campaign, even has its  political motivations: Under opposition criticism, Moravcik  cannot afford to be clearly less of a patriot in the eyes of the  public prior to the elections. But the matter is primarily more  pragmatic. The efficiency of the Slovak economy is approximately  one-third less than that of the Czech Republic and Slovakia must  come to terms with a lower standard of living than the one it  was accustomed to in the federation. That finding is leaked to  the public because no one within the coalition or the opposition  has the political courage to fully admit it. That is why all  potential sources that could slow down the currently continuing  economic failure of the country are being sought out all the  more tenaciously.     "

""Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can obtain a  departure visa but anyone who enters an embassy violently loses  that right,"" Castro said in a statement for the Colombian  station Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN).    Castro said Cubans who are of age can request visas to leave  the country, but they cannot always obtain visas from the  corresponding embassies and therefore decide to occupy the  installations.    On Wednesday, nine persons forcefully entered the Chilean  Consulate in Havana while 20 others are currently at the German  Embassy and 118 at the Belgian ambassador's residence demanding  authorization to leave the island. Castro said the Cuban  government has the obligation of protecting the embassies. He  added, however, that force should not be used.    Yesterday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National  Assembly of the People's Government, noted the need to ""prevent  in a civilized manner"" the violation and vulnerability of  diplomatic missions. He stressed that Cuban authorities will  refrain from dislodging the several civilians who occupied the  embassies by force, adding that no reprisals will be taken  against them if they change their attitude. ""It is necessary to  prevent in a civilized manner"" the forceful occupation of  embassies ""if we do not want the law of the jungle to prevail or  even prevent the disappearance of diplomatic service,"" Alarcon  stressed.    He said that so far the countries affected by those  incidents  have cooperated with Cuban authorities in trying to persuade the  occupants to voluntarily and peacefully leave the installations.  Alarcon, a former foreign minister, said the occupation of  embassies is the result of U.S. immigration policy, which denies  visas to Cubans who want to emigrate to that country.    In his statement to RCN -- one of the most important radio  networks in Colombia -- Castro also referred to Cuba's relations  with the United States, denying the possibility for ""direct  contact"" at this time. He stressed that U.S. President William  Clinton is very interested in obtaining his reelection and  therefore power groups, which he did not identify, are  pressuring him to maintain the sanctions against Cuba.    Castro said he is pleased with the election of Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, but ruled out  the possibility that he can promote Cuba's return to the  regional organization in the very near future. For Cuba, its  return to the OAS is not a priority; what we view as a priority  is the end of the economic blockade the United States has  maintained against the island for more than 30 years, Castro  stressed. Castro described the blockade as ""inhuman and  criminal."" He added that it is not justified because the Cold  War is over and said it has hurt Cuba more due to changes in its  trade activities, 80 percent of which were carried out with the  socialist bloc.    Consulted about the situation in Colombia -- a country  facing  guerrilla groups comprised of several million armed men --  Castro denied his country interferes in the internal affairs of  other countries. He recognized that for some time, Cuba  actively supported revolutionary movements in Latin America  because they supported the [Cuban] policy toward the United  States, but he explained that that situation has changed. He  said his country's relations with Latin America are based on  mutual respect and nonintervention in the internal affairs of  each nation.    Castro refused to comment on the possible results of  Sunday's  presidential elections in Colombia. He only said he hopes the  elected president will continue working to further improve the  electoral process.    Castro recognized that he does not have the same energy as  when he was 20 or 30 years old. He added that he will retire  when the right time comes, after overcoming the current  difficult moments because he does not want to look like a  deserter. He said he would like to have ""a small piece"" of land  in Cuba to rest and dedicate his time to reading. He noted,  however, that he still works 15, 16, or 17 hours daily.     "

At first  glance, some people who had lost face vis-a-vis the power of the  United States as a superpower said that this would weaken and  defeat Iran and called for the removal of the elements that had  led to the deterioration of Iranian-U.S. relations. However,  the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted a decisive  stance and removed the negative impacts of this incorrect  interpretation which was weakening the revolution. By  describing U.S. relations with Iran as relations between a wolf  and a lamb, Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, rejected  such unjust relations and explicitly stated that not only are  these relations not to the benefit of Iran but they are also to  the detriment of the revolution and its sacred objectives.    With the passage of 14 years since the complete severance of  Iranian-U.S. relations and with the developments and changes of  conditions in the various fields that have come about, the issue  of Iranian-U.S. relations is again in the limelight, and some  people are optimistically advising the resumption of relations.  The reasoning of this group is that, given our country's  economic problems, we can solve these problems if we establish  relations with the United States. This group claims that by  improving our relations with the United States, we can enjoy  U.S. assistance and that the obstacles that the United States  creates on the international scene will be removed, thus  allowing us to enjoy assistance and support by other countries  too, which will make us stronger in dealing with problems.    There may be a similarity between this group's argument and  the argument of those who intended to oust the Sandinists from  the Nicaraguan power scene. When the duel between the  Sandinists and the opposition coalition started in Nicaragua,  the anti-Sandinists' reasoning was that once they came to power  and relations with the United States improved, all of  Nicaragua's problems would be solved. With this promise, this  group succeeded in gaining power with a very small majority of  votes. But contrary to what the propaganda had said, neither  was there the flood of U.S. assistance to Nicaragua nor did  Nicaragua's economic problems end. The assistance that the  United States allocated to Chamorro's government was not an  amount that could solve Nicaragua's problems. It was only a  tool to control that country.    Under the current conditions, even as some people speak  about  a change in U.S. behavior toward Iran and consider the desire of  U.S. officials for improved relations with Iran reason to  establish relations with the United States, a look at White  House politics makes us realize that no change has taken place  in that country's behavior. Use of instruments such as human  rights and nuclear arms to defame Iran in international forums;  efforts to prevent assistance to and support for Iran by  international organizations; and efforts to upset the relations  of European countries and Japan with Iran to inflict as much  pressure as possible on Iran all show that the United States'  hostile position regarding Iran has not changed. Moreover,  Iranian assets continue to be frozen in the United States even  though, on several occasions, Iranian officials have called on  the United States to halt its policy of blocking Iranian assets.    The enmity of the United States toward Iran is actually the  result of the independent policies of the Islamic Republic of  Iran. What the United States wants is that Iran give up its  independent path and follow U.S. policies. As long as the  Islamic Republic of Iran continues on its independent path, the  United States will not make peace or establish friendship with  the Iranian nation. This is why, when commenting on the unjust  and hostile U.S. stance on Iran, the esteemed leader of the  Islamic Republic compared the current conditions for the  establishment of relations with the United States with the  conditions that prevailed in 1980 and said that nothing has  changed. This is why, in answer to whispers about the  commencement of talks with the United States, he stated that  beginning talks with the United States is a prologue to  impositions and defeats.     "

After a short period of  general openness of the political life, which was, perhaps, only  during the term of office of the ""contract"" Sejm, we saw a  comeback to a secret life. There is usually one rule: The  opposition meets and discusses matters openly, whereas the  governing parties hold meetings behind closed doors.    The opposition which invites mass media to all its meetings,  organizes press conferences, and shares information whenever  journalists want it, stresses in this way that it has nothing to  hide from the people. This attitude changes radically the  moment the opposition becomes a governing party.    Through a Ladder to Lansk    It should be admitted that as far as avoiding journalists or  giving evasive answers is concerned, the consecutive governing  parties display inexhaustible invention.    After one of the meetings of the directorate (that is, the  leadership of the present governing coalition) last autumn,  journalists learned that the politicians discussed... potato  harvesting.    After submitting his resignation from the post of deputy  prime minister and finance minister, Marek Borowski entrenched  himself in his office and it was difficult to ""squeeze"" a word  of comment out of him.    The ladder that Democratic Left Alliance leader Aleksander  Kwasniewski used to leave the Sejm premises will probably go  down in the history of the Polish parliamentary system.    Recently sessions of politicians held outside Warsaw have  been very popular. In a forest it is much easier to hide from  journalists and all information reach the media with  considerable delay. It is difficult to say what purpose this is  supposed to serve -- the information reaches the media sooner or  later anyway.    Perhaps it is the spring that makes the politicians seek  refuge from the media outside Warsaw. Last Friday in Jablonna  there was a meeting of the National Council of Radio and  Television and the leadership of the Polish Television  (participating in the meeting was, among other persons, Wieslaw  Walendziak, the Supervisory Board of the Polish Television and  the Board of Directors, the directors of the First and the  Second Program, as well as the heads of the regional sections).  Invited to the meeting was also Government Press Office Head  Dariusz Jadowski and President's Spokesman Andrzej Drzycimski  (the latter did not arrive). The meeting was, needless to say,  closed to the press, even though it was devoted to the  activities of a component of the mass media -- the television.    The government decided to hold a session of the Council of  Ministers in Lansk. The government building is hidden in a  forest near a beautiful lake. It is separated from the nearest  village by kilometers of forests. Behind the doors there are no  crowds of journalists demanding immediate answers to thousands  of inquisitive questions.    The Government Point of View    Freedom of speech and openness of the political life are  undoubtedly cumbersome to the participants of this life. The  openness of the political life is desirable for those who do not  participate in it, and it serves the purpose of calling those  who are governing the country at the moment to account. Those  who are in power do not like to be called to account. They are  not very favorably disposed toward independent press, because it  discusses issues that they would willingly conceal. The  existence of the free press forces the subordinated press to be  objective -- it cannot omit important information because it  would lose its readers. Therefore, subordination of the entire  press is a desired state of affairs for all those who are in  power. Since this state of affairs is not easy to accomplish,  politicians are hiding.    They say that playing politics far from people's eyes is  quite common also in countries with rooted democracies. No one  is surprised by the fact that government spokesmen refuse to  make any comments. Western parliaments are not visited by large  groups of journalists, as is the case in our Sejm.    On the other hand, however, in deeply rooted democracies no  one accuses the press of speculating, being aggressive and  nonobjective, and of pursuing sensational news only, instead of  showing positive models and printing official communiques when  they are issued.

But unfortunately so since, as  specialists believe, Ukraine could lose in it more than it finds.    Well, judge for yourselves. We offer for your attention  our correspondent's interview with Pavel Petrenko, chief  specialist of the Department of Foreign Economic Relations of  the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.    [Oleynik] So Ukraine is an associate member of the CIS  Economic Union. May it be hoped that many problems of economic  disintegration will now be overcome more successfully?    [Petrenko] If we attempt to avoid emotions and operate only  with facts and intellect based on strict economic realities, the  situation is defined as follows. The development of the CIS  Economic Union in the interests of all its participants, as the  treaty declares, will depend primarily on the possibilities and  readiness for cooperation of the participants, first and  foremost on the national systems of the management of foreign  economic relations.    An analysis of the treaty testifies that the majority of its  articles do not, to put it mildly, coincide with the interests  of the people of Ukraine. In the legal respect, for example, the  treaty is not adjusted and requires an enormous amount of  supplementary exegesis and clarification. This state of affairs  automatically enables one of the strongest parties to the treaty  to immediately avail itself of these lacunae, which promise  Ukraine nothing but losses.    The rights and obligations of Ukraine in the treaty are not  balanced or weighed. It is not at all clear how Ukraine's banks  will participate in the shaping of currency-financial and  banking legislation of the Economic Union. It may be forecast  even now, therefore, that realization of the treaty will  undoubtedly have ambiguous consequences for Ukraine and its  trading partners not only on a CIS scale. This applies primarily  to the spheres of the so-called ""four freedoms"" which were  determined by the Treaty of Rome of the countries of the  European Union: free movement of goods, services, manpower, and  capital.    [Oleynik] Does it not seem to you that realization of the  terms of the treaty in the deformed space of the CIS, hopelessly  backward in the legal and technical-economic respect and not  even remotely reminiscent of the former Union space, is simply  unrealistic?    [Petrenko] I am sure it is, unfortunately. The preamble to  the treaty even speaks of the formation and development of a  common economic space. And an attempt is made even to decipher  these terms.    Article 3, say, specifies the free movement of goods, a  coordinated tax, price, foreign economic, and customs policy,  and the harmonized economic legislation of the Contracting  Parties. But what is meant by this free movement of goods,  primarily for Ukraine? If we are guided by the treaty, Ukraine  is required to provide for the unimpeded transit across its  territory of goods from the customs territories of other  countries of the Economic Union or any third country. That is,  Ukraine will once again be left with precious little, as it was  in the times of the USSR.    Free trade does not, incidentally, prevent the importation  into Ukraine of commodities exerting a negative influence on its  environment. No provision is made together with the abolition of  tariff and nontariff regulation and the lowering and elimination  of duty, taxes, and charges for the preservation of  quota-determination for commodity imports and exports. For  Ukraine such a state of affairs--Viktor Pynzenyk is absolutely  right here, incidentally--is unequivocally disadvantageous  inasmuch as it has a negative balance of payments with Russia.    [Oleynik] The treaty provides for concerted tariffs on  materials-handling operations. As experts maintain, it is in  fact a question of regulation of the rate of profit of Ukrainian  transport enterprises. They note the improper formulation of the  question of the parties' ""common customs tariff"" and the  ""coordination of the participants' foreign economic trade.""    [Petrenko] The disastrous consequences for Ukraine, as an  independent subject of foreign economic activity which is only  just attempting to plug its national economy into the system of  the world economy, are obvious in this respect. If we keep to  the letter of the treaty, the doors to the market of European  states will be closed even more tightly to Ukraine. And, believe  me, we will be guaranteed technical and technological  backwardness even longer.    According to Article 7, the parties ""will pursue a  coordinated policy in the sphere of the development of transport  and communications geared to the efficient transportation of  freight."" It is a question, of course, of freight that is  shipped via Ukraine. It is reasonable to ask: Why is particular  emphasis being put (for the umpteenth time) on the transport  system? The answer lies right there on the surface--thanks to  exploitation of Ukraine's transport systems and enterprises and  the elimination of taxes and charges on freight (Articles 5 and  6) that is conveyed across our borders, the parties to the  treaty will strengthen the economy of their states at our  expense.    And what price the explanations in Article 9 to the effect  that the parties ""will undertake without mutual concordance  unilateral actions of a noneconomic nature to restrict access to  their markets."" How is the term ""of a noneconomic nature"" to be  qualified? Economics, just like nature, does not have things  that are purely independent of something or other or of  consequences. Who has computed what restricted access to CIS  markets of its rolled metal and machine-building and chemical  products would cost Ukraine? Thus Ukraine is on the one hand a  subscriber to the treaty, on the other, sanctions of a  ""noneconomic nature,"" which would inevitably entail not only  financial but also social difficulties, could be applied to it.    [Oleynik] How are we, from the viewpoint of an independent  state, to understand Article 13, which says that ""...The Parties  will coordinate their investment policy... in sectors of mutual  interest.""    [Petrenko] We could agree to this were we to forget that the  imperial system of management in Ukraine bled the national  economy white, leaving us a deformed structure of industry. But  we would then have to forget about the main assignment of the  current and prospective development of the economy of Ukraine--a  reorganization of its economic structure for the needs of the  populace.    Articles 14 and 15 speak of the creation of an interstate  free trade association, according to which the Ukrainian  currency would belong to a multi-currency system, and the  Russian ruble would be detached as something intermediate  between multi- and mono-currency systems. We are talking about  the formation of a currency union which is to provide for mutual  settlements based on a common (reserve) currency. It is not hard  to foresee that the functioning of the currency union will  ensure only the stability of the ruble, and the national  currencies of the other states will be working concertedly for  the accomplishment of the goals identified by the ""ruble""  currency union.    And Article 16 proposes the creation of a payments union,  which would provide for payments in the national currencies via  multilateral clearing in the Interstate Bank of the CIS. This  union is intended for the achievement of the full convertibility  of the currencies as integration processes intensify and would  necessarily be transformed into a unified currency system. It is  clear even to the nonspecialist that we are talking about the  restoration of the Soviet settlements system.    [Oleynik] But perhaps these are, indeed, merely proposals?    [Petrenko] An analysis of the treaty testifies that the  ultimate goal of the Economic Union is gradual deprivation of  the independent states first of economic, then of political  levers. The proposed methods and principles of the formation of  a currency and monetary system among the states of the CIS are  not news, incidentally. They existed at the time of the Council  for Economic Mutual Assistance, but in this case the authors of  the treaty took account of the CEMA omissions. The mechanism of  mutual settlements and influence on the economy of the  participants in the CIS Economic Union which has been created  blocks as much as possible the structural reorganization of  Ukraine. This is evident from the content of Articles 17 and 18,  which ""guarantee"" for the Ukrainian currency a Procrustean bed  until such time as the Russian ruble becomes fully convertible.  Only after this, if we have not lost the state by this time,  will it be possible to commence structural transformations of  the economy, but this will be many times harder to do than now.    [Oleynik] And what will guarantee the standardization of the  tax system of the participants in the Economic Union, which  presupposes a common mechanism of taxes and tax rates?    [Petrenko] Harmonization of tax policy based on a unity of  methodology of consideration of production costs is required of  the parties to the treaty. Article 29 proposes for this the  creation of common executive and coordinating institutions. What  does this mean? That we have, in fact, to give up our own tax  system, which is essential for strengthening our economy, and  hand over the planning of all processes of economic life to  supra-state executive and coordinating institutions.    In addition, the Economic Union specifies that within the  framework of the treaty the leadership of the states' foreign  economic relations shall be exercised by a discrete organ of  administration. It should be expected that it will in time be  accorded the functions of central organ of planning of the CIS  states in the sphere of foreign economic activity. The  performance of the said functions will inevitably entail the  creation of a vast bureaucracy, and a great deal of money will  be spent on this. At the same time, on the other hand, Russia  has thus far blocked all questions concerning the shareout of  assets earned together, the gold and currency reserves, the  Black Sea Fleet, and such.    Thus the Economic Council in the form in which it exists  today and in which Ukraine has already agreed to participate  with associate-member status will accomplish the intentions of  the neo-allies and deliver a crushing blow to the sovereignty of  Ukraine. Following which it will take us a long time to approach  even today's level of political and economic independence.     "

By the end of the decade annual aid spending would be raised from last year's 0.56 per cent of gross domestic product, or FFr30bn (Pounds 3.64bn), to 0.7 per cent, he told a meeting of advisers from the Direction des Relations Economiques Exterieures, the state foreign trade board. Its current aid budget, which has risen by 6 per cent a year over the past decade, is already well above the 0.31 per cent average for the Group of Seven richest industrialised nations. 'We are aiming to ensure durable development in these countries,' he said. At the same time Mr Sapin recognised that budget constraints would oblige France to be more selective in channelling aid. Concessional finance would be limited to the poorest countries. Sales to other markets would be offered export credit insurance through the Coface state organisation according to those countries' risk premiums. Mr Sapin was speaking on the second of a five-day gathering of the trade board's 172 foreign-based economic councillors, called as part of a campaign to improve its sensitivity to the needs of French exporters and companies planning foreign investments.

[Krietov] How were Russian relations with the DPRK and the  ROK in 1993?    [Yakovlev] Relations between Russia and the two Koreas were  developed in various areas last year. Let us recall what Russia  has inherited from the former Soviet Union.    Relations between Russia and the DPRK have been complex and  painful. The ROK has treated us with a certain suspicion  [ilchonghan pulsin]. Seoul did not understand how Russia would  develop and how Russia's development would effect the situation  on the Korean peninsula.    What did we do last year? Russia and the DPRK reassessed the  grounds of relations between the two in 1993. The reassessment  was made on the line of big changes in Russia, the Korean  peninsula, and all over the world. We have dissolved the DPRK's  misgivings that Russia would take a biased policy while adhering  to the ROK's view on South-North dialogue. We are working with  Pyongyang in political and economic areas and help in removing  obstacles to South-North relations.    Deputy Foreign Minister Kunadze visited Pyongyang last year  as a special envoy of the Russian president. During this visit,  Russia and the DPRK agreed to amend treaties on and legal  grounds of relations between the two countries, including the  1961 Russia-DPRK treaty, and to resume and activate contacts  between the two countries' foreign ministries, including  contacts in the United Nations.    In 1993, Russia and the DPRK signed a treaty on scientific  and technological cooperation and a treaty on cooperation in the  fishery area. They have continued mutual cooperation in the  DPRK lumbering business in the Russian territories. I emphasize  that this is complementary [sangho powanjok] cooperation. We  will continue such cooperation based on the amended grounds.    We are generally satisfied with the development of relations  between Russia and the ROK. We have developed practical  [silmujok] cooperation based on the grounds of relations between  the two countries. We remember that a treaty that secures a new  atmosphere [sae chuserul hwakposikinun choyak], a lump-sum  economic agreement, and a series of important documents, and a  series of other important documents between Russia and the ROK  were signed when President Yeltsin visited Seoul in November  1992.    We continued political dialogue with the new ROK  administration of President Kim Yong-sam last year. Based on  our mutual political understanding, we have solved even problems  rooted in the past. When I say this, I have a series of  problems, including the one involving the ROK airliner, which  was shot down in 1983, in mind. Another series of problems,  including the one involving the burial of radioactive waste in  the Sea of Japan, have not yet been solved.    We highly assess ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's visit  to  Russia in the summer of 1993. During this visit, Russia and the  ROK confirmed their mutual interest in the results of Russia-ROK  relations in various fields, the same view Russia and the ROK  hold on many world and business issues, and each other's  willingness to cooperate in resolving those issues.    It is more important, however, that contacts of people,  including sportsmen, art groups, businesses, and scholars, have  become more active. This reinforced the atmosphere of mutual  trust not only on the official level but also between the people  of Russia and the ROK.    A schedule of cultural cooperation for 1994 has been signed.  This has increased the possibility of learning the history,  culture, and traditions of each other's country. Relations  between scientific and educational organizations of the two  countries have been promoted comprehensively, and contacts  between the two countries' scientific academic organizations.  Scientific and technological cooperation has also rapidly been  developed. Hundreds of Russian experts and scholars are working  in the ROK, and many ROK experts are in Russia.    [(Yakovlev) continues] An important aspect of relations  between Russia and the ROK is economics. Regrettably, the  relations had a difficult time last year due to the adverse  economic situation in Russia and decreases in production in the  ROK. The volume of trade of goods between the two countries  amounted to $1.5 billion.    We plan to start 25 large-scale projects this year after  overcoming difficulties facing economic cooperation. They  include construction of an ROK industrial complex in the  Nakhodka free economic zone and a gas pipeline between Russia  and the ROK via the DPRK.    [Krieto] How do you assess the overall situation on the  Korean peninsula?    [Yakovlev] The situation on the Korean peninsula is very  complicated. Pyongyang and Seoul signed the Agreement on  Reconciliation, Nonaggression, and Exchange and Cooperation in  February 1990. North-South talks and premiers contacts started.  Regrettably, they discontinued soon because the disagreement on  mutual inspections and the Washington-Seoul decision to resume  the Team Spirit military exercise. This issue is now being  resolved in the course of talks between Washington and  Pyongyang. We demand that the talks be concluded with success.    Russia resolutely opposes nuclear weapons proliferation in  any form, and we oppose the emergence of nuclear weapons on the  Korean peninsula. Safeguards are necessary to prevent the  emergence of nuclear weapons. Safeguards will be ensured when  the International Atomic Energy Agency's [IAEA] rules are  adhered to strictly. We demand that all (?problems) between the  DPRK and the IAEA be resolved completely without specific  national circumstances being considered.    We fully support the Joint Declaration on the  Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, signed by the DPRK and  the ROK. We think this declaration will give impetus to  Seoul-Pyongyang talks on denuclearization. Russia, China, the  United States, Japan, and other countries concerned must promote  a favorable environment for denuclearizing the Korean peninsula,  alleviating tension, and promoting North-South trust.    [Krieto] What do you think of the future of relations  between Russia and the ROK?    [Yakovlev] It is time Russia and the ROK start carrying out  the various large-scale projects that were agreed on during  President Yeltsin's visit to the ROK. We are looking forward to  new summit talks in Moscow this year. We must hold the talks  based on results from the implementation of the previous  agreements.    We plan to develop cooperation with the DPRK, first, in the  economic field. The two countries must form a joint committee  on the treaties existing between them.    We must [word indistinct] an organization for regular  negotiations on urgent issues on the Korean peninsula and  restructure the DPRK's debt to Russia, which amounts to over 3  billion rubles at 1990 prices.    The repayment of the debt is not an issue that can be  resolved in a year but must be resolved based on more efficient  forms of economic cooperation. Collectivization of agriculture  [words indistinct] is one of them. Experts say we can pool the  potential of the DPRK, ROK, China, and Russia to develop natural  resources, build social infrastructures in Russia's Far East,  and develop the Tumen River estuary bordering Russia, China, and  Korea.    Russia's policy toward the Korean peninsula has also focused  on improving North-South relations. As President Yeltsin has  said, the North and South hold the key to national  reunification. An important task of Russia's policy is to help  the DPRK and ROK use it.    No doubt, Russia's interests on the Korean peninsula can be  promoted when Russia maintains normal good-neighbor relations  with the North and South.     "

Mr Huang Kun-huei, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, told reporters that the delegation would leave for China in a week. The 24 were found dead on March 31 in a burned-out boat on a lake in China's Zhejiang province. Earlier, Taiwan had demanded an open trial for three suspects arrested by Chinese authorities last week and more details on the investigation before it would accept China's suggestion to send a delegation. Beijing's semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits sent a letter to its Taiwanese counterpart over the weekend promising that China would answer questions about the case, Mr Huang said. 'The most important thing now is to find the truth and hammer out compensation for families of the victims . . . so it is still imperative to hold talks on the incident,' Mr Huang added. The case has prompted Taiwanese groups to call for a boycott on tourism to the mainland and for a suspension of new investment projects. It has also heightened the impression in Taiwan that Beijing remains an unreliable partner.   Countries:-  TWZ  Taiwan, Asia.     CNZ  China, Asia.

Addressing the third meeting of the First Council of the  Chinese mainland's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS], Wang Zhaoguo said: Relations across the Taiwan  Strait made major advances last year. The publication of the  white paper on the Taiwan Issue and China's reunification, which  comprehensively and systematically expounds China's principled  stand and policies on the Taiwan issue, has had both an  immediate and far-reaching impact on the development of  relations across the strait and on China's reunification. After  the attempt by the Taiwan authorities to participate in the  United Nations was thwarted at the 48th UN General Assembly,  some people in Taiwan began to publicly advocate the so-called  two Chinas as a phase. This merits our close attention and  vigilance.    Speaking of the working-level talks between the two sides of  the Taiwan Strait, Wang Zhaoguo said: The characteristics of  the working-level talks between the ARATS and the Strait  Exchange Foundation [SEF] have become somewhat different from  those of the past. This is reflected mainly in the fact that  the SEF tried to use the handling of administrative matters to  create so-called independent sovereignty and complete judicial  jurisdiction, thereby achieving the goal of making the mainland  and Taiwan two equal political entities.    Wang Zhaoguo stressed: In light of this, we must uphold the  principle of one China and, based on the common understanding  that the ARATS-SEF talks are nongovernment, economic,  administrative, and functional in nature, avoid sensitive  political issues to seek common ground while putting aside  differences. We must make active efforts to advance the talks  and to produce positive results on administrative matters.    Wang Zhaoguo spoke highly of the ARATS's fruitful efforts in  promoting cross-strait exchanges and developing relations  between the two sides in the two years since its establishment.    He said: During the last year, thanks to the joint efforts  of all localities and departments and the people throughout the  country, including the Taiwan people, economic and trade  relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have  developed more rapidly. Exchanges in personnel and in other  areas have made new breakthroughs. The number of Taiwan  businesses investing in the mainland has increased sharply.  From January to November of last year, indirect trade between  the two sides reached $12.1 billion. The two sides have forged  closer economic interests. More than 1.5 million people visited  the mainland from Taiwan last year. The number of people from  Taiwan's higher hierarchy and public figures from all walks of  life has increased 50 percent from the same period in 1992.  More people from the mainland also visited Taiwan to carry out  a wide range of exchanges. Facts show that exchanges in  personnel and in other areas have a positive impact on the  development of relations across the strait.    Wang Zhaoguo called for consistent efforts to promote the  establishment of direct postal, trade, and navigational ties  between the two sides and to push for the exchanges between  people on the mainland and Taiwan and exchanges and cooperation  in every field in accordance with the policies of peaceful  reunification and one country and two systems. He called for  vigorous economic cooperation in particular to jointly  revitalize China's national economy.    He said: In line with the development of the situation, the  State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office will coordinate with the  relevant State Council departments to authorize the ARATS to  hold talks with Taiwan's SEF on economic matters, science and  technology exchanges, and cooperation in the development of  energy resources, while continuing their talks on administrative  matters.    He urged the ARATS and SEF to institutionalize meetings  between their responsible persons and to further promote contact  and cooperation with each other in accordance with the relevant  agreements reached during the Wang-Gu talks. He also said that  he hoped to see an early, successful materialization of the  second meeting between Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu  [Ku Chen- fu] to advance the development of cross-strait  relations.

""Furthermore, our organizations will begin to receive nuclear  fuel exhausted at the Paks AES after a five-year interval at the  station. We cannot refuse to accept it. That would mean  breaking obligations and undermining Russia's international  reputation as a reliable partner.""    ""Let me explain"", Kaurov added. ""Russia receives exhausted  fuel and not radioactive waste from Hungary. The two things are  not at all the same. During processing, useful components are  given off that are used as repeat fuel for an AES. Russia's  Minatom enterprises have highly effective and ecologically sound  processing technology for nuclear fuel.

0,FT933-13200 ,"FT933-13200 _AN-DGUCEAG9FT 930720   FT  20 JUL 93 / China renews Taiwan link      By REUTER      BEIJING   CHINA has invited an official from Taiwan to visit the mainland, the first such contact since the ideological arch-rivals held historic talks in Singapore in April, Reuter reports from Beijing. China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits extended the invitation to Mr Cheyne Chiu, secretary general of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, the official Xinhua news agency reported yesterday. Both organisations were set up as ostensibly unofficial bodies to explore and foster bilateral contacts. The letter asked the Taiwan side to propose dates and an agenda for Mr Chiu's visit, Xinhua said. Mr Chiu visited Beijing early this year to arrange the Singapore meeting between Mr Wang Daohan, chairman of the Chinese body, and Mr Koo Chen-fu, his Taiwanese counterpart. The talks marked the first direct contact between the Cold War rivals since Chiang Kai-shek and his vanquished Nationalists fled to Taiwan at the close of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing and Taipei espouse eventual reunification of Taiwan and China, a goal that is opposed by Taiwan's growing opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party. Cross-straits relations have warmed in recent years as the rivals have become economically interdependent. In Taipei, officials said the government was studying conditions under which it could exchange representative offices with China, but added that such a breakthrough in relations is unlikely soon.

At the time of the Raphel controversy, the  official aide memoire had not only characterised the  American position as being a ""qualitative shift"" but ""an  excessively negative policy assertion."" If an assistant  secretary's remarks had occasioned such strong language, it is  indeed surprising that the American president's own record of  insensitivity to Indian concerns are meriting such polite  responses.    The press statement issued in New Delhi on Wednesday, in  fact, goes out of its way to signal to the United States that  while something has to be said about President Clinton's  tendency to appear to be rooting for Pakistan, the United States  need not take it amiss because as it notes ""India shares  President Clinton's strong interest in reducing tension in South  Asia ..."" In the light of the comfort that anti-Indian elements  in Kashmir and Punjab have got from the president's remarks  beginning with his lumping Kashmir as an area where civil war  was taking place, to his expression of common concern over human  rights in that state with the country which has supplied the  insurgents there with direction, training and weapons, South  Block's pussilanimity is bound to encourage rather than  discourage the White House in persisting with its tilt. There  can be no doubt of the encouragement that the remarks will give  to sundry terrorists, insurgents and nations like Pakistan who  have a grouse against India.    Remarkably, the Indian response has failed to highlight the  major gap in President Clinton's remarks as well as what ought  to be the major thrust of its own policy pinpointing the role of  Pakistan as an abettor of state-sponsored terrorism. New Delhi's  failure in convincing America, and indeed the world, of this is  not because it lacks evidence of Pakistani actions, but that it  is unable to find courage to express its outrage at events like  the Bombay blasts, or the continued support for cross-border  terrorism from Pakistan.    Though 1993, especially after a series of statements and  actions from Washington D.C., began to indicate that a  pro-Pakistan tilt was emerging, officials in New Delhi have been  advocating that India turn the other check so as to move ahead  on an agenda which benefits India such as trade, investment,  technology transfer and even a dialogue on non-proliferation  issues. Unfortunately, they have permitted the United States to  push its own skewed agenda which is being perceived by many to  be inimical to India's sovereignty. Instead of finessing India's  most important, and in a sense, difficult relationship, South  Block seems to be responding in a confused and ad hoc fashion  which is only likely to see increased American meddling since  no one has bothered to spell out any Indian bottom line in its  relationship with the United States till now.    A major weakness of the Indian response has been its  excessively defensive tone. In the world of  realpolitik it signifies that either India is weak or  that its case is. Considering the access being given to foreign  diplomats, and most recently the International Red Cross to  visit Kashmir, such a posture towards Washington appears  strange. India is involved in fighting a difficult battle in  Kashmir. Foreigners, including Americans who have seen the  difficulties faced in Somalia and Bosnia are reacting not so  much to India's record, which is middling-to-bad in Kashmir, but  its defensiveness, which in some eyes betokens a weakness which  can be exploited.    Almost egregiously, Wednesday's statement has made claims on  India's nuclear posture that require some clarification from the  government. In responding to its observation that ""Pakistan's  nuclear intentions are well-known and confirmed time and again,""  the statement declares ""India neither has nor intends to acquire  weapons of mass destruction."" This is an extraordinarily  definitive statement which appears to be at variance with the  much more ambiguous, and therefore deterrent, posture adopted by  the government till now that it will do whatever needed for the  defence of the country, and its unstated belief that its  unsafeguarded nuclear power programme and proven nuclear  capacity are its real insurance against nuclear adventurism, not  brave words.

U.S. Role in Balkans Favored    In the 12 December Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Nikos  Marakis reports on the views of the Greek Government and the  opposition regarding the role the United States and the European  Union (EU) should play in the Balkans. In a departure from past  policy, Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou now believes that  Greek interests in the Balkans and elsewhere are served ""almost  exclusively"" by a complete harmonization of Greek and U.S.  foreign policy. This view, Marakis says, is shared by Minister  of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and Minister of Defense  Yerasimos Arsenis.    Marakis also writes about the discussion of the issue within  the opposition New Democracy (ND). Party luminary Andreas  Andrianopoulos believes that Washington, to establish ""control""  over the southern Balkans, will promote the establishment of a  new Yugoslav federation under Serbian hegemony including the  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). According to  Marakis, Andrianopoulos worries that aligning Greek policy too  closely with that of the United States might involve the country  in a potentially ""explosive"" contest for influence in the  Balkans, pitting France and Germany against the United States.  Another ND luminary, Yeoryios Souflias, argues that Greece  should follow its natural pro-European orientation and  simultaneously maintain good relations with the United States,  Marakis writes.    A contrasting view is held by ND official and former  Minister  of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis who, according to Marakis,  believes that the U.S. reaction to former Prime Minister  Konstandinos Mitsotakis' Balkans policy was so negative that  Washington succeeded in engineering the fall of the Mitsotakis  government. Varvitsiotis represents an ""anti-Atlantic"" faction  in the ND which includes almost all Eurodeputies and deputies  from areas favored by EU grants, Marakis writes.    FYROM Recognition by European Countries Viewed    The decision by six European countries to establish  diplomatic relations with the FYROM stems from their disdain for  Greek demands, Thodhoros Rousopoulos writes in the 19 December  Athens KIRIAKATIKI ELEVTHEROTIPIA. Even Sweden and Finland,  whose application for European Union membership will be reviewed  during the Greek EU presidency, were part of this initiative.  While a Greek veto on membership is unlikely, Rousopoulos cites  Ministry of Foreign Affairs sources as saying that Greece may  use delaying tactics to postpone entry of these countries in the  EU. According to Rousopoulos, however, Greece lacks leverage in  the EU, and other member countries are likely to grant  diplomatic recognition to the FYROM.    `Macedonian Struggle' Lost    Rikhardhos Someritis writes in the 5 December TO VIMA TIS  KIRIAKIS that Greece has now lost the ""Macedonian struggle.""  Even should the FYROM disintegrate from internal pressures, as  some Greeks hope, the result would be a resort to extremist  organizations even more dangerous to Greece and to peace in the  Balkans, Someritis believes. Probable integration of FYROM  territory by Bulgaria, Serbia, or Albania would add to regional  instability. The Greek Government should focus on the huge  costs of prolonged ""Skopje-mania,"" Someritis warns, noting the  courageous policy of reconciliation adopted by South Africa,  Israel and the PLO, and others. Dialogue and honest compromise  can never be considered ""treason,"" Someritis concludes.    Greek Economic Relations With FYROM    Stavros Tzimas reports on economic relations between Greece  and the FYROM in the 16 December Athens daily TA NEA. A large  quantity of goods such as aluminum sheeting, mineral ore,  phosphates, lumber, wheat, and oil transit the Greek port of  Salonica on the way to Skopje, and about 100 Greek companies  have been established in the FYROM. Many have ceased operations  due to the political crisis, but some Greek firms continue their  activities, Tzimas reports. About a dozen jointly-owned or  Greek-owned firms are located in the Monastir area and a Greek  entrepreneur is the majority shareholder of a private bank that  recently opened in that city. A large Greek clothing company and  an export-import firm are presently active in Skopje, while a  food-packaging company is said to be ready to start operations  again as soon as the crisis ends.    Poll on FYROM    A brief article in the 19 December TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS  reports the results of an opinion poll on the ""Skopje problem""  conducted by the MRB organization in Athens and Salonica between  2 and 12 December with 1,OOO respondents. Opinions were about  evenly divided between those (4O.1 percent) who said that the  situation has taken a ""negative turn"" for Greece since the  October elections won by PASOK, and those (42.8 percent) who  said that it has remained ""unchanged.""

For historians of the esoteric, Karol Wojtyla - also known as John Paul II - is high on the list of suspects. His culpability was scrutinised in London yesterday at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. The case for the prosecution is that in June 1991 His Holiness allegedly egged on Catholic Croats and Slovenes to separate themselves from Orthodox Serbs. A diplomatic campaign, partly waged through the German press, was then conducted to secure international recognition of their independence. Nonsense, says Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, papal Secretary for Relations with States - foreign minister for short. John Paul II 'never pressed for the disintegration' but instead 'suggested democratic openings within the constitutional framework'. Moreover, 'in messages to all the leaders of the republics seeking independence . . .the Holy See considered it desirable that a form of confederation be preserved', only changing its mind after the federal army began attacking Croat and Slovene civilians. Up piped Misha Gavrilovic, of the Serb Information Office. Yugoslavia 'was and is . . .a federation'. Papal calls for a confederation mean the Pope advocates Yugoslav dissolution.

0," LA041489-0138   44062    April 14, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 1; Column 1; Metro Desk      695 words      VIET GROUP WANTS OFFICIAL RECALLED;    MEMBERS UPSET OVER WESTMINSTER COUNCILMAN'S REMARK      By DAVID REYES, Times Staff Writer      A leader of Orange County's Vietnamese community announced plans Thursday to  recall Westminster City Councilman Frank Fry Jr., who voted to deny a parade  permit sought by a group of South Vietnamese military veterans while telling  them, ""If you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam.""    ""The Vietnamese community will not sit still for this,"" said Arthur Suchesk, a  spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee who pledged to  start the recall drive.    Fry's statement, made at a Westminster City Council meeting earlier in the  week, was racially insensitive, Suchesk and Vietnamese veterans have charged.  The armed forces day committee sought a parade permit and approval to block  traffic on busy Bolsa Avenue in Westminster's Little Saigon.    Fry, who joined three other council members who voted against the request, told  the group's representatives that they should commemorate their war dead on a  U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day or Veteran's Day.    ""It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be Americans. If  you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam,"" Fry said. ""That may  be unfair, but that's my opinion, and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of  people around here.""    Fry made the controversial statement during the city's first council meeting to  be broadcast on cable television.    ""His statements were uncalled for,"" said Tony Lam, a Vietnamese community and  business leader. ""It's an insult. He's so naive to make that kind of a  statement. We're trying to be in the mainstream of America, yet, on the other  hand, we're trying to maintain our cultural heritage. That's why we work in  harmony. But that kind of a statement really breaks up the harmony.""    The Orange County Human Relations Commission on Thursday condemned Fry's  comments and called for both an apology and a reconsideration of the parade  request after hearing from three representatives of the Vietnamese veterans'  group.    ""The Orange County Human Relations Commission deplores the comments attributed  to Councilman Fry as an affront to the Vietnamese community and to the general  community,"" Commission Chairman Daniel Ninburg said in a statement issued after  the regular commission meeting.    ""These remarks caused the issue before the council to be clouded by  emotionalism. We therefore urge Councilman Fry to apologize . . . and we call  on the City Council to reconsider its denial in an atmosphere free of  prejudiced comments,"" the statement continued.    The Westminster City Council voted 4 to 1 late Tuesday to reject the proposal,  which would have honored all soldiers who fought the Communists in Vietnam.  Only Mayor Charles V. Smith, a Korean War veteran, supported the parade.    Tien Nguyen, another committee member and former officer in South Vietnam's air  force, said the parade would have commemorated all Vietnam veteran ""comrades in  arms,"" including those from New Zealand, the Philippines, Canada, Thailand, the  United States and South Vietnam.    ""This has nothing to do with the issue of assimilation; it's just to honor  their dead and our dead. That's the issue here,"" Suchesk said.    The veterans' group plans to mobilize the Vietnamese community and mount an  ""anti-Fry"" campaign with demonstrations, stories in the Vietnamese-language  media and posters publicizing Fry's statement, Suchesk said.    On Thursday, Fry, whose brash, off-the-cuff statements in the past have landed  him in similar embarrassing situations, denied that he is a bigot.    ""I'm not a racist. My vote was a protest against some of the divisiveness we  now have in the city,"" Fry said, alluding to Westminster's growing Vietnamese  community, which has established its own aggressive business base but still  retains its cultural identity.

""The Vietnamese community will not sit still for this,"" said Arthur Suchesk, a  spokesman for the South Vietnamese Armed Forces Day Committee who pledged to  start the recall drive.    Fry's statement, made at a Westminster City Council meeting earlier in the  week, was racially insensitive, Suchesk and Vietnamese veterans have charged.  The armed forces day committee sought a parade permit and approval to block  traffic on busy Bolsa Avenue in Westminster's Little Saigon.    Fry, who joined three other council members who voted against the request, told  the group's representatives that they should commemorate their war dead on a  U.S. holiday, such as Memorial Day or Veteran's Day.    ""It's my opinion that you're all Americans and you'd better be Americans. If  you want to be South Vietnamese, go back to South Vietnam,"" Fry said. ""That may  be unfair, but that's my opinion, and I'm sure that is the opinion of a lot of  people around here.""    Fry made the controversial statement during the city's first council meeting to  be broadcast on cable television.    ""His statements were uncalled for,"" said Tony Lam, a Vietnamese community and  business leader. ""It's an insult. He's so naive to make that kind of a  statement. We're trying to be in the mainstream of America, yet, on the other  hand, we're trying to maintain our cultural heritage. That's why we work in  harmony. But that kind of a statement really breaks up the harmony.""    The Orange County Human Relations Commission on Thursday condemned Fry's  comments and called for both an apology and a reconsideration of the parade  request after hearing from three representatives of the Vietnamese veterans'  group.    ""The Orange County Human Relations Commission deplores the comments attributed  to Councilman Fry as an affront to the Vietnamese community and to the general  community,"" Commission Chairman Daniel Ninburg said in a statement issued after  the regular commission meeting.    ""These remarks caused the issue before the council to be clouded by  emotionalism. We therefore urge Councilman Fry to apologize . . . and we call  on the City Council to reconsider its denial in an atmosphere free of  prejudiced comments,"" the statement continued.    The Westminster City Council voted 4 to 1 late Tuesday to reject the proposal,  which would have honored all soldiers who fought the Communists in Vietnam.  Only Mayor Charles V. Smith, a Korean War veteran, supported the parade.    Tien Nguyen, another committee member and former officer in South Vietnam's air  force, said the parade would have commemorated all Vietnam veteran ""comrades in  arms,"" including those from New Zealand, the Philippines, Canada, Thailand, the  United States and South Vietnam.    ""This has nothing to do with the issue of assimilation; it's just to honor  their dead and our dead. That's the issue here,"" Suchesk said.    The veterans' group plans to mobilize the Vietnamese community and mount an  ""anti-Fry"" campaign with demonstrations, stories in the Vietnamese-language  media and posters publicizing Fry's statement, Suchesk said.    On Thursday, Fry, whose brash, off-the-cuff statements in the past have landed  him in similar embarrassing situations, denied that he is a bigot.    ""I'm not a racist. My vote was a protest against some of the divisiveness we  now have in the city,"" Fry said, alluding to Westminster's growing Vietnamese  community, which has established its own aggressive business base but still  retains its cultural identity.    ""I hate to see two of everything like we got going in this city,"" Fry said. ""We  have two chambers of commerce, and we even have two Lions clubs.""

Sison, self-exiled Communist Party of the Philippines  (CPP) chairman, is losing his grip on Philippine and Western  Europe cadres. Lucas Fernandez, believed to be the alias of  revisionist bloc leader Nathan Quimpo, wrote in a letter from  Amsterdam, The Netherlands, that Sison is no longer enjoying the  support of communist members abroad.    In a press statement, the Armed Forces of the Philippines  Civil Relations Service (CRS) quoted Quimpo as saying ""almost  all solidarity groups in Western Europe, North America, and the  Asia- Pacific Region have started distancing themselves from  Sison.""    Quimpo said the Sison-led Stalinist bloc has lost support  from revolutionary, progressive, and centrist political parties,  including the Eurocommunities, left socialists, ""greens,"" social  democrats, and labor parties. As gleaned in his letter, he said  over 60 percent of CPP members in Western Europe and 70 percent  of National Democratic Front (NDF) members in the Philippines  oppose Sison's leadership.    He accused Sison of steering the underground movement  towards  a more extremist and violent strategy against the government.  ""Sison is slowly transforming the CPP-NPA-NDF [Communist Party  of the Philippines-New People's Army-National Democratic Front]  into another Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path),"" Quimpo said.

Aluminium exports in January-May were 978,200 tonnes, up from 495,800 tonnes in the year-ago period, a ministry official said. The official, who declined to be named, said an initial January-June estimate of 1.25m tonnes had been revised. The latter figure was published by the State Statistics Office in its latest report on the economy. An official of Aluminiy the country's aluminium producers' group declined to comment on the figures. Russia and other major world aluminium producers agreed earlier this year to cut output in a bid to prop up the market. The agreement was in response to a sharp fall in aluminium prices caused by a surge in Russian exports following the breaking up of the Soviet Union. Prices have since risen strongly. Data released at a meeting of the producers in Australia this month showed that Russian output fell to 220,800 tonnes in June from 236,100 in November 1993. That data also indicated, however, that exports in the first five months of this year amounted to about 800,000 tonnes, roughly in line with the 1993 total of 1.9m tonnes.

The Foreign Secretariat announced in a communique that the  candidacy of Salinas, whose presidential mandate ends in  December, is being presented because the chiefs of state who  participated in the Fourth Ibero-American Summit supported the  Mexican president's aspiration to that post. The summit among  the chiefs of state of Latin America, Spain, and Portugal took  place last week in the Colombian port city of Cartagena de  Indias.    Spain and Portugal withheld their support because of  commitments in other international forums, but the rest of the  heads of state who are members of the Ibero-American forum  agreed that Salinas would properly represent the interests of  the Latin American nations.    The WTO will replace GATT as of 1 January 1995 as part of  the  agreements reached at the 15 April meeting in Marrakesh.

He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He will also meet opposition politicians and business leaders. In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year. Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to be invited to London soon. Mr Di Tella is trying to win over the Falkland islanders by convincing them that Argentina has changed for the better. He has met Falkland representatives and broadcast to the islands via the BBC World Service. But suspicious Falklanders reject his advances and Britain refuses to discuss the islands' political future. The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries, the Falklands' main source of revenue. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement. However, Britain refuses to lift its arms embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in 1982.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     ARZ  Argentina, South America.

By the end of this April, foreign investment in China's  restaurants, tourism transport, construction of tourist spots,  and tourist entertainment facilities totaled more than 10  billion U.S. dollars.    About 53 percent of total input in China's tourism industry  comes from foreign investors. In addition, tourist projects  which are to be financed through foreign investment under  government plans will further increase this ratio to 72.9  percent of the total investment in China's tourism.    So far, according to the official, the State Planning  Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade  and the State Tourism Administration have jointly approved 88  projects of construction and reconstruction of hotels with  25,600 guest-rooms, which drew a total foreign investment of  1.88 billion U.S. dollars.    With the introduction of foreign funds, the official noted,  China has greatly improved its tourist services and further  expanded the accommodation designed for overseas visitors.

As evidence and precise reports convey, the Republic of  Uzbekistan Government continues its interference, in various  forms, against the Muslim people of Afghanistan and national  sovereignty of the ISA [Islamic State of Afghanistan]. For  instance, this interference has clearly been felt since the  beginning of the current fighting in Afghanistan. Relations and  good-neighborliness taken into account, the ISA brought this  issue to the attention of the related authorities of the  Republic of Uzbekistan in a friendly manner through diplomatic  channels, and was expecting such interference to be prevented.    But, unfortunately, against the expectation of the ISA and  the Muslim nation of Afghanistan, not only was this interference  not stopped, but it was intensified. The ISA strongly protests  against such interfering acts by Uzbekistan in the internal  affairs of Afghanistan, which demonstrate the unfriendly policy  of that country, and is against the UN Charter and all  internationally accepted current norms and principles, and  demands from the authorities of that country to seriously  refrain from the repetition and continuation of such  interference which will have grave consequences for and negative  impact on the relations of the two neighborly countries.  Otherwise, the ISA cannot remain indifferent toward such  interference.     "

[Melescanu] Our country's leadership has been concerned with  halting the economic decline since 1990, but due to the existing  internal and external conditions, this goal was only achieved in  1993. It happened because of the continuous efforts to  restructure and technologically reequip our industrial  enterprises, to privatize whole sectors of our national economy,  such as trade, tourism, and construction, and to return the land  to the peasants. At the same time, we completed a restructuring  of the banking system, decentralized foreign trade, and  supported free enterprise in the small industry and services  sectors. This year we plan to carry out a major privatization  of industry.    These results can increase the confidence of business  circles  in the developed states in the opportunities for cooperation  with Romania, which for us will lead to an increase in foreign  investments and support from the international financial  organizations.    [Gotev] How do you view the prospects for the development of  Bulgarian-Romanian relations, which includes taking joint  foreign policy initiatives in the Balkans and the Black Sea zone?    [Melescanu] Romania ascribes particular importance to  comprehensively developing its relations with Bulgaria. No  disputed or unresolved problems remain between our countries.  Since 1990, Romanian-Bulgarian cooperation has been progressing  positively in all fields. Despite the fact that we have no  top-level official contacts for one year, I am sure that the  relations of cooperation and good-neighborliness between Romania  and Bulgaria will continue to advance further in the interest of  both countries, so as to provide a model of stability in the  Balkans. At the same time, I think that Romania and Bulgaria  should actively cooperate in formulating a coordinated foreign  policy line for cooperation in the Balkans and the Black Sea  zone. Our country will use every occasion to hold consultations  with Bulgaria with a view to adopting decisions to the benefit  of stability, trust, and prosperity in our region.    [Gotev] Where do Romania's preferences lie: toward the  European alternative, or toward affiliation to the Balkan  Orthodox region?    [Melescanu] The point of European and Euro-Atlantic  integration is precisely to develop a united, stable,  democratic, and prosperous Europe. As far as the Central and  Eastern European countries are concerned, this is the only way  to confirm and consolidate their national, political, economic,  and security interests. It is evident that regional and sub  regional cooperation has a very important part to play within  the all-European architectural framework. Projects such as the  Central European initiative, Black Sea economic cooperation, and  Balkan cooperation when the tragic Bosnian conflict ends are a  necessary complement to the our state's efforts toward European  integration. The tracing of new lines of demarcation in Europe,  whether based on ethnic, religious, economic, or security  criteria, may become a risk factor for our continent's  stability. Romania has constantly and firmly spoken out for  averting such artificial barriers, which can only become  substitutes for the ideological barriers with which we are so  familiar.    [Gotev] What priorities does Romanian diplomacy have for  1994?    [Melescanu] Our priorities may be defined as lying in three  complementary directions. First, we want to continue the  process of integration with the political, economic, and  security structures of Europe and the Euro-Atlantic alliance.  Ratifying and bringing into effect the association treaty with  the EU, concluding a treaty with NATO within the Partnership for  Peace Initiative, establishing long-term relations with the  Western European Union, and switching over to a ""permanent route  forward"" within the Council of Europe -- these are only some of  the goals we have set ourselves for the near future.    Second, we want to impart fresh dynamism to our relations  with neighboring states and other countries in the region. The  conclusion of basic political treaties with states like Hungary,  the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine can  assist the ascending development of Romania's relations with  these states, and at the same time create a favorable political  climate.    Third, in our foreign policy efforts we want to expand and  diversify our relations with states or groups of states in other  geographical zones with which Romania maintains permanent and  fruitful relations.

After Chancellor Helmut Kohl's  trip to India last year and the return visit by Prime Minister  Rao in February, FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt's trip  to Delhi is the third visit to India by a German minister this  year.    Guenter Rexrodt has come to participate in the 11th meeting  of the ""Joint Economic Committee"" in the Indian capital. This  committee has been meeting at the ministerial level since 1988;  thus it is a routine matter. However, Rexrodt is going at an  important time in India's economic development and in  German-Indian economic relations.    Three bilateral treaties, an amendment to the German-Indian  double taxation agreement, a new aviation agreement, and an  investment protection agreement are in different stages of  preparation. The double-taxation agreement is practically  concluded, and the German side is reportedly satisfied with the  result.    Agreements on Investment Protection    The FRG economics minister wants to finish the preparations  for signing the aviation agreement in Delhi. It will bring  about additional landing rights for Lufthansa in Indian cities  and, in addition, help Air India in expanding its tourist  business. The ""investment protection and promotion agreement,""  is also virtually ready for signature apart from a few  ""technical-juridical details."" After Great Britain, the FRG will  be the second country with which India will conclude such an  agreement.    The 20-person economic delegation accompanying the minister  stresses that the visit will naturally also deal with  down-to-earth business. Rexrodt told correspondents that he  wants to advocate several specific projects, among others in the  fields of telecommunications, machine-building, iron and steel,  energy, and food industry.    In New Delhi, Rexrodt will also meet with Indian Prime  Minister Rao, Finance Minister Singh, and Minister of Commerce  Mukherjee, as well as the minister of civilian aviation and  tourism, the minister of post and telecommunications, and the  state secretary in the Foreign Ministry.    In the meetings with Rao, Singh, and Mukherjee, it is likely  that not just ""bilateral issues"" will be discussed, because the  Indians' worries concerning the GATT conference in Marrakesh are  currently the dominating economic policy issue in New Delhi.    Rexrodt's doubts whether environment-specific trade barriers  are the best way to make free world trade compatible with the  environment are not only shared by New Delhi, but are seen as a  neoprotectionist specter, together with other initiatives, such  as ""trade-related work norms"" and countervailing duties against  ""social dumping."" In contrast to the skirmish with Washington,  New Delhi hopes that it will find a few common points with Bonn  in these fields.    In the bilateral sphere, it is intended to look for new ways  to strengthen German-Indian partnership in trade and industrial  cooperation. If German industry ""is underrepresented in the  Asian-Pacific region,"" as the Federal Government's Asian concept  says, this quite certainly also applies to India because German  industry has only a very moderate share in the current boom in  India, especially regarding investments.    Bilateral Trade Stimulated Again    Even though German investments in India have doubled every  year since 1990 (measured by the approved applications), the  German share in total foreign investments in India has, at the  same time, declined from second place to 10th place. Only  regarding the number of cooperation projects (173 in 1993) have  German companies successfully maintained their traditional  second place among India's partners in technology.    It seems that German investment capital is still shy.  Several large projects of renowned companies, such as Siemens,  BASF, and Mercedes-Benz, to cite just a few, permit, however,  the conclusion that a change is emerging in this field.    German-Indian trade has also been stimulated again after an  extended period of stagnation. Trade volume rose by 12 percent  in 1993; thus, for the first time exceeding 6 billion German  marks. This is a sum that Rexrodt called ""very, very small"" with  a view to China. ""We are not here without euphoria,"" Rexrodt  said, referring to the missed opportunities, ""and we are not  just thinking of China anymore.""    Customs reductions, great plans for expansion in the field  of  infrastructure, reorganization of the nationalized companies,  and a quickly growing large market give the go-ahead for major  business with India. The glitches in implementing these plans  will be the main subject of the ministers' meeting in New Delhi.     "

The first, of course, is the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] with the prolonged  impasse over ways to solve it within the framework of the United  Nations.    Second, there is the issue of Greek-Albanian relations,  which  deteriorated despite the Greek Government's intention to the  contrary.    On the issue of Skopje, the government is attempting a  spectacular turn in the negotiating process without so far  facing any serious objection or trouble by the opposition  parties, or by a large part of the Greek public. This means the  government appears willing and ready to discuss, still under  Cyrus Vance's auspices, the issue of Skopje in its entirety, in  one phase, including the final name, and of course under two  conditions:     -  The Greek countermeasures will remain in  effect.    -  Possible secondary agreements during the negotiations  will not depend on the achievement of an overall agreement on  the issue, which will include a solution to the name issue.    This spectacular turn attempted by the Greek  Government--which was considered almost ""inconceivable"" not long  ago--was helped during the prime minister's talks at the White  House. From the two leaders' official statements after their  long private talks, it became evident that the two sides agree  that there should be a new way to ""approach"" the issue, so that  the differences between Athens and Skopje will smooth out and  the negotiating process will be maintained. [passage omitted]    With the new process formula under discussion, both sides  could maintain the maximum of their demands.    FYROM President Kiro Gligorov could claim that his demand  for  negotiations on all issues has been accepted, while Athens could  insist on the implementation of its measures until Skopje meets  the conditions it has set (constitution-flag-propaganda) before  lifting them.    The ""secret"" of this approach--if it is finally adopted--is  that it offers Gligorov all the time he needs until the  critical, for him, elections in the fall, while at the same time  it allows Athens to maintain an active, but more relaxed,  process of negotiations in New York.    It is more than obvious that Athens seeks relaxation in the  issue of Skopje, since a swift solution of the issue is not  possible. On the contrary, and despite its desires, the Greek  Government faces a serious deterioration in its relations with  Tirana that does not appear about to subside as long as Albanian  President Sali Berisha's side systematically attempts unilateral  provocations, which, however, for the time being fall flat.    The recent meeting in Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi did  not produce anything substantial toward diffusion of the crisis.    Tirana's official statements and Berisha's remarks prove  that  the Albanian Government attempts, at least orally, to present  Greece as the number one ""threat"" to its security. Furthermore,  it insists on superficial diplomatic acts on the international  scene which have already been absorbed and which have led  foreign governments friendly to Tirana to ""advise"" it to  decrease its offensive tones toward Athens.    Despite all that, Tirana appears determined to ""play with  Athens' nerves"" by exerting obvious pressure on the Greek  minority but also with disguised, but perhaps very serious,  pressure on the Albanian Orthodox Church and especially on  Archbishop Anastasios.    Maybe Tirana's continued provocative stance does not target  the Greek Government, which does not seem willing to depart from  its very calm policy toward Albania. It possibly targets the  ""sensitive nerves"" of the opposition parties such as New  Democracy and Political Spring.    ""Angry"" or even extreme statements and reaction by  opposition  parties will give Tirana the opportunity to claim that the  current government's calm policy is not a stable factor in  Greece's policy toward Albania, and therefore Tirana has every  reason to ""be afraid"" of the future regarding the Greek  intentions toward it.    The tour by Miltiadhis Evert, official opposition and New  Democracy chairman, to the Greek minority areas of Albania [7-8  May] will perhaps be a very good opportunity to reject and  dispel all the above claims by Tirana. Anyway, prior to his  tour in Albania, Evert had an in-depth, but also ""discreet""  briefing by the Foreign Ministry.     "

The policemen had boarded the iron-hulled ship while it was  trying to escape from their two Makung-based police cutters, but  discovered the crew barricaded behind a locked cabin door, which  they tried without success to break down.    After a two-hour stand-off, they were forced to jump into  the  sea when the mainland vessel made a drastic turn to the west and  sped up to enter the territorial waters of Mainland China.    All six were immediately picked up by the trailing police  boats.    By jumping off the smuggling boat, the policemen prevented a  rerun of a similar incident two years ago in which a mainland  iron- hulled vessel kidnapped a Taiwan patrol guard when the  guard boarded the mainland vessel to arrest the crew for  smuggling.    The guard was repatriated to Taiwan a couple of weeks later  after bargaining between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), the two semi-official  organizations edicated to the promotion of civilian exchanges  between Taiwan and the mainland.

The Indian-born writer, in hiding for over four years since the fatwa was ordered by the late Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, said the meeting was 'probably the most important day of the campaign.' 'It will send a message around the world - to our allies and to Iran,' he told a London press conference. 'It is very important that the British government is now leading from the front.' Mr Major's first meeting with Mr Rushdie, indicating a further hardening of Britain's line, is likely to incense Tehran, which claims Mr Rushdie's book is blasphemous. Downing Street said yesterday Britain had great respect for Islam, but added that the fatwa did no service to its religion. Mr Rushdie gave no details or proposals discussed with Mr Major, saying he had undertaken not to reveal concrete plans. Relations between Iran and Britain were 'frosty and might get frostier any second,' he said. Downing Street said no specific action had been decided yesterday. The prime minister had underlined his full support for Mr Rushdie's rights as a British citizen and expressed concern that Iran had not repudiated the fatwa.

This incident has caused a  great uproar in the U.S. Government and among the public. In  particular, the U.S. Congress sternly criticized Yeltsin, who is  relying on U.S. political and economic support, for his  hypocrisy and maliciousness in stabbing Clinton in the back.  Secretary of State Christopher gave a serious warning, saying  that this kind of practice was unacceptable. All of a sudden,  apart from the discord sown by the Bosnia question,  Russo-American relations have once again turned to a low ebb  because of the Russian spy case. Now, what must be seen is  whether or not the United States will accept Congress' view and  take retaliatory action? How will they retaliate? What impact  will the retaliation have?    The Russian Government was embarrassed by the revelation,  but, at the same time, it openly admitted the issue and stressed  that this was an ordinary matter which should not be overstated.  Russia also hit back at the United States by saying that U.S.  espionage against Russia has never stopped, but is as intense as  during the Cold War era. Hence, Russia urged the United States  not to exaggerate the case as if it was a political incident and  not to ""revert to the psychology of the Cold War, since making  use of the espionage issue to vigorously stir up trouble is  against the spirit of international partnership."" (Yeltsin's  press secretary Kostikov)    Ames, the arrested Russian spy inside the CIA, started  working in the CIA in 1983 [date as published] and was the CIA's  counter-narcotics section chief. Since 1985, from the time of  the former Soviet Union until recently, including the period  when the Soviet Union dissolved and Yeltsin assumed office, Ames  had been passing secret information on U.S. espionage activities  against the former Soviet Union and Russia and received $1.5  million from the former Soviet Union and his Russian contacts.    Movie-Like Trick Used To Pass Information    Two years ago, the FBI started a secret investigation into  Ames' suspicious activities and discovered that, when Ames had  gone secretly to Venezuela and Columbia in South America on  counter- narcotics investigations, he had seized the opportunity  to contact intelligence agents of the former Soviet Union and  Russia. Ames also marked a post box in suburban Washington and  dropped pieces of information so that other Russian spies could  secretly find them by following the clue. The trick was like  something from the movies.    The Clinton administration was shamed into anger after the  case was revealed. Apart from lodging a formal protest with  Russia, the U.S. Government also asked a Russian diplomat at the  Russian Embassy in the United States, who was known to be  directing Ames' activities, to voluntarily leave the country.    Difficult To Build Relations of Mutual Trust    Of those people whose identities as U.S. agents were  betrayed  by Ames to the former Soviet Union and Russia, 10 were executed.  In this connection, the United States considered it intolerable  and suggested that retaliatory action ought to be taken.    This incident has been revealed at a time when the Cold War  has ended and when the two former enemies of the United States  and Russia have become allies. The KGB of the former Soviet  Union has ceased all of its activities and the CIA no longer  considers Russia as its biggest prospective enemy. However, the  Russian spy case has precisely emerged at a time when the two  countries are jointly greeting the 21st century, and both sides  feel that it is difficult to explain away this case to their  peoples and to the world.    (Stiaposen), first deputy chief of the ""Russia Federal  Counterintelligence Bureau,"" said at a press conference in  Moscow as early as last month that, although the Cold War had  ended, foreign espionage in Russia had never abated. In  particular, U.S. and British intelligence agents have been  capitalizing on Russia's economic difficulties to recruit a  large number of Russians, including officials, to gather  information for the United States and Europe. Over the past  year, a total of 20 Russians recruited by the CIA have been  arrested. He said that Yeltsin was aware of these cases.    The United States and Western Europe were displeased with  Russia's announcement that it was to interfere and send troops  to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Now, the Russian spy case will make it  more difficult for the United States and Russia to build  relations of mutual trust.     "

Cuban visitors, most of whom are U.S. residents, requested  certain changes to the visa system, the creation of an official  organization to handle their affairs, and the opening of several  consulates in the United States.

0,FT921-1776 ,"FT921-1776 _AN-CCWA7AA3FT 920323   FT  23 MAR 92 / Little benefit to managers in demise of closed shops      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor   THE NEAR-disappearance of the closed shop after more than a decade of Conservative government has produced neither great gains nor losses for managers, according to a paper prepared for a conference today to be held by the Centre for Economic Performance Industrial Relations Group. The report suggests that many closed shops are 'sleeping dogs'. They avoid legal problems because nobody gets sacked for not belonging to a union, but in other ways operate much as they did in the past. A poll commissioned by the Department of Employment in 1989 found that 2.6m people thought they were still in closed shops. That represented a fall of 50 per cent since the high point of the closed shop at the end of the 1970s. But, as the report points out, 2.6m is a high figure for an institution that is meant to be unlawful. They suggest that the 'real closed shop population' - closed shop agreements that continue to exist in spite of it being illegal to sack someone for leaving the union - may be 500,000. The report concludes that the managerial indifference which marked the rise of the closed shop in the late 1970s seems also to have attended its demise in the 1980s.

National Police (PN) Director Oswaldo Fernandez declared  that  the incident in which U.S. Sergeant Maurice Neal was wounded in  the shoulder by a Panamanian policeman does not have ""any effect  on U.S. relations."" In this regard, Fernandez added U.S.  Southern Command authorities and Panamanian PN exchanged reports  on the case, adding it is ""indeed true"" Neal evaded and ran  through a Panamanian police checkpoint.    Regarding whether the reaction of the police to fire on Neal  is justified, Fernandez said that ""it is too early to tell,  because we must first verify the situation and hear the account  of events from the PN Office of Professional Responsibility,""  which is investigating the case.    The Panama-based U.S. Southern Command maintains  approximately 10,000 soldiers in installations along the length  of the 80-km interoceanic Canal. U.S. troops must abandon these  installations totally by 31 December 1999, as stipulated by the  Canal Treaties signed by the two countries in 1977.     "

[Zlenko] The problem of Crimea should not be linked to these  negotiations. What we discussed with the Russians was the  question of the Black Sea Fleet. On this point, we made  progress, but not significant progress.    We are in agreement on the partition of the fleet, but there  has still been no compromise on the question of bases, despite  Ukraine's concessions. We have accepted that the headquarters  of the Russian fleet should be in Sevastopol, and that  Sevastopol should be a Russian base, but Russia is demanding  other bases, which is not acceptable. We are prepared to make  arrangements for the location of other port facilities but we do  not want to have conditions dictated to us.    This is our territory, but we say that this problem  absolutely must be solved and that the status of the fleet must  be decided once and for all. Second, Russia must force its  military to accept the law of the foreign country in which it is  based. The fleet must not interfere in Ukraine's internal  affairs.    [Mandeville] Is it doing so now?    [Zlenko] Yes, we think that there was interference in the  conflict between Kiev and Simferopol. The statements by the  Black Sea Fleet press center are misinformation and increase the  risks of provocation in Crimea. We have warned Moscow  journalists of this danger. Some are spreading rumors about the  arrival of Ukrainian troops, which I refute. The Ukrainian  troops which were there are still there, but there are no new  ones.    [Mandeville] With regard to Crimea, [Russian Foreign  Minister] Andrey Kozyrev spoke of the danger of  ""Yugoslavization.""    [Zlenko] Parallels of this kind are not appropriate. It is  true that there is a risk of provocation, but we will solve this  question. It is an internal Ukrainian problem. We will not  tolerate any attack on our country's territorial unity, which  the 1992 Crimean Constitution calls into question. Calling our  territory into question would not only be a danger for the  Ukrainians, but for the whole of Europe.    Ultranationalist Machinations    [Mandeville] There is a debate in Ukraine on the best way of  facing the secessionist threats. Some think that the unitarian  state should be strengthened, whereas others think that a  federal state would make it possible to avoid losing  everything...    [Zlenko] I do not deny that there are supporters of a  federal state in our country. But I think that there is no  reason to move in that direction. All the opinion polls prove  that this does not interest the population. In my view, this  idea is being promoted by some determined circles which are  inspired by Russian ultranationalist circles. Their aim is to  undermine the Ukrainian state.    [Mandeville] It is being said that at the forthcoming  presidential election, it will be the man in favor of  rapprochement with Russia who will win in Ukraine?    [Zlenko] We must not make enemies of Russia and Ukraine.  Some people in Moscow, but also in our country, are trying to  set us against each other, but Ukraine has never turned away  from Russia, it is our neighbor, our history, it is a special  partner, the dominant factor in our foreign policy. We must be  close while being independent and equal states. The problem is  that there is an imperialist syndrome in some Russian political  circles, the idea that we will all return to Russia, as before.  No! There is a new situation, there is no longer any big  brother or little brother.    [Mandeville] Do you fear the results of the forthcoming  Russian presidential election, the arrival in power of  extremists like Rutskoy or Zhirinovskiy?    [Zlenko] This danger has been allayed. But the social  problem which was their breeding ground remains. It must be  remembered that the success of the economic reforms will be  decisive.    [Mandeville] What conclusion do you draw from the Conference  on Stability in Europe?    [Zlenko] I welcome this initiative by France. This  conference was welcome, because it answered the questions which  are worrying our continent. It put a finger on the problem of  minorities and borders. It gave a clear warning to those who  still cherish the idea of maintaining a divided Europe or  putting up new walls between nations. The conference showed  that we must think about a strategy for the whole of Europe in  order to prevent the return of history's demons.     "

Cetin said: Relations between Turkey and Kazakhstan have  developed rapidly since its independence. Today, approximately  100 Turkish companies have reached the point where they are  ready to conduct business in Kazakhstan. The investments and  projects of these business ventures exceeds $400 million. Our  exports and foreign trade with Kazakhstan, which started at  zero, have reached significant dimensions. There is a very  close cooperation between us. There are almost 2,000 students  from Kazakhstan studying in Turkey.    Cetin pointed out that a protocol was signed envisaging the  transportation of oil from Kazakhstan over Turkey by way of the  Mediterranean to world markets and added that work on the issue  will be furthered.    Saudabayev, in turn, explained that the very quickly  developing bilateral cooperation between Turkey and Kazakhstan  proves to what extent the two kindred people value each other.

Taking advantage of President Itamar  Franco's absence at the end of the Ibero-American Summit, the  Argentine chief of state devised a broad support base for the  candidacy of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who is leaving the  Mexican presidency next September, to director general of the  World Trade Organization (WTO). President Menem ignored the  candidacy of current Brazilian Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero  formally presented to the organization that will replace GATT.  Menem trampled over the basics of Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], which includes the adoption of common action on subjects  of common interests. He tread on good manners by taking  advantage of the Brazilian delegation's absence to accomplish  his scheme. With this he obtained Latin America's informal  support for the Mexican candidate, but he also harmed relations  between Brazil and Argentina. Brazil's immediate reaction was to  cancel the visit of Argentine Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo  on 27 and 28 June to Brazil: Brazilian authorities will not  have time to receive the Argentine minister.    The mood of the bilateral relations has therefore been  established. What could Brazil expect to save from the remnants  of a relation whose vitality was in the economic field, and  which Buenos Aires insists on damaging in the political field?  The impression is that Menem and his political advisers are not  capable of designing a policy of rapprochement with the United  States without harming relations with Brazil. Given that a  policy of rapprochement with the United States is not  incompatible with a good relationship with Brazil, the hostility  -- invariably unfounded -- with which we are treated is more  shocking.    The Cartagena episode is just one of a series. Before it  took  place, Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion had said  Argentina would not support Brazil's intention to obtain a  permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Minister Cavallo got  sick and tired of telling the Brazilians how to conduct their  economic affairs. When establishing regulations for Mercosur,  the Argentines went back and forth endlessly. A common external  tariff has not been established so far because Buenos Aires  hindered the process and blamed Brazil for structural  distortions that were rather due to the frozen Argentine  exchange rate, an essential part of the Cavallo Plan.    The Argentine Government knew beforehand about Minister  Ricupero's candidacy to the WTO. Argentina maintains close trade  relations with Brazil, a fact that is the embryo for a more  serious economic, social, and political integration. Menem's  underhanded action -- considering the circumstances in which he  performed it -- demonstrate an unsustainable position. The  Brazilian authority who from now on accepts the political and  moral commitments assumed by this Justicialist administration in  relations with Mercosur at face value would be foolish; the  Brazilian authority who considers Argentine policies  foreseeable, a quality that is the basis of trust, would be  irresponsible.    The Argentine Government has made its choice regarding  Brazil. It has exchanged the excellent relations we had for a  move that could end in granting Mexico, therefore NAFTA,  therefore the United States, the general direction of the World  Trade Organization. We have nothing to object to the candidacy  of Salinas or the United States, the largest world power. What  is repugnant to our conscience and goes against our good sense  is the shameless maneuver that disqualifies its author and  places its beneficiary under suspicion.    Everything indicates that President Menem will be reelected  for four more years in office. This obliges Brazilian diplomacy,  as of now, to treat Argentina with the seriousness the situation  demands and with the politeness with which we have not been  treated. In order to prevent the negative trade balance from  affecting the results of the Cavallo Plan and Mercosur, Brazil  has been purchasing from Argentina what it could buy elsewhere  with greater political gains. Mexico could supply us with the  same oil we buy from Argentina. Canada has the wheat we obtain  from Argentina. Those two countries are NAFTA members and if  the example set by the Casa Rosada [Argentine Government House]  is correct, the future is in the north and not in the south.  There is no reason for purchasing goods from Argentina just to  maintain a balance of accounts. That is the exclusive problem of  Argentina. Let us just center on the cost-benefit relation in  our trade and policy and do just what is totally gainful for us.

Speaking on Europe 1, Juppe said France had discussed with  the Chinese authorities ""our conception of human rights"" and  ""how we considered that from this point of view the situation in  China was unsatisfactory.""    Questioned about the arrests of a number of dissidents  during  the Balladur visit, Juppe said that there had been  ""disinformation"" surrounding the affair, noting that a Chinese  minister had denied the arrests while ""the New China News Agency  had confirmed them in a dispatch.""    The French minister said the aim of the trip, ""to renew  political dialogue with China,"" had been achieved.    Paris was willing to cooperate with Taiwan, said Juppe, but  added that China needed telephone lines, nuclear power stations,  high- speed trains and wheat.    ""It is with this in mind that we also renewed dialogue,""  said  Juppe.    Normal relations between Paris and Beijing were restored on  January 12 when Paris pledged not to conclude any new arms  contracts with Taiwan, healing a year-long rift.    Relations had become strained after a contract for the sale  of 60 advanced Mirage 2000-5 bombers to Taiwan, followed up by  the sale of gunboats.     "

The latter  does not have a colonialist past and now that it is entering the  international arena, it is seeking a reliable partner in the  Middle East.    In order to resolve its economic problems, Germany uses its  own distinctive policy which is not necessarily affiliated to  U.S. policies. Germany is Iran's top trading partner and has  assisted in the training of experts in various fields.    However, there are some obstacles that, if eliminated, would  clear the path for better cooperation between the two countries:    1. The balance of trade between the two countries is not  equal, Germany's exports to Iran far exceed Iran's exports to  Germany. In 1993, Iran experienced problems due to a drop in  its foreign exchange earnings. Germany's exports fell to 4  billion marks and Iran's exports were only worth 1.5 billion  marks.    German officials complain of the increase in the volume of  trade between Iran and the United States in their meetings with  the Iranian press. Our response is that we have also complained  about the increase in American exports but one must note that  the balance of trade between the two countries is to Iran's  benefit. This means that the sale of Iranian oil to American  companies is far greater than our imports from American  companies. If the Germans are complaining about this state of  affairs, it would be better if they increased their purchases of  Iranian oil and steered the balance of trade between the two  countries toward a more equitable level.    The Germans contend that the purchase of oil is in the hands  of private companies and that the government has no control and  no policy in this regard. If this is merely a propagandistic  allegation, it is not right to make these remarks regarding such  a serious matter. If this is true, then is it to be believed  that European governments do not have any jurisdiction on such  basic decisions? This matter will be assessed at a later date.    2. The German Government has abandoned some of its valid ,  but uncompleted, contracts, such as the Bushehr nuclear power  plant and its affiliated fertilizer project after 90 percent of  the work was completed. Germany's reasons for such a breach of  contract are not acceptable. Iran is a signatory of the Nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and IAEA [International Atomic  Energy Agency] inspection teams have repeatedly visited Iran and  endorsed Iran's performance in this regard. Meanwhile the  Israeli regime has not signed the NPT and has proclaimed that it  has nuclear weapons but no one dares complain to them. Thus,  Germany's breach of bilateral contracts will remain a dark spot  on Iranian-German relations.    3. Germany's conduct has not been very just or humanitarian  in some cases in the Middle East. For example, during the Iraqi  war against Iran, the Germans supplied chemical weapons to Iraq  and its experts assisted Iraq in extending the range of its  missiles, resulting in greater casualties for the Iranian side.  The Germans did not pay any reparations to Iran, but when  similar missiles were fired upon occupied Palestine during the  Iraqi war against Kuwait, the German foreign minister himself  went to Tel Aviv and paid 200 million marks as reparations.  Such conduct is unacceptable.    In response, the Germans say they were the first European  country to condemn Iraqi aggression against Iran, and this is  true, but it does not compensate for Iran's losses in the war.    4. The Germans display sensitivity regarding terrorist  groups but do not pay much attention to the fact that they are  nurturing an anti-Iranian terrorist group in their midst. In  1986 Mas'ud Rajavi admitted to the killing of 15,000 Iranians in  an interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE. The Germans say that  their criterion is that they should not commit terrorist actions  on German soil. This is while the Monafeqin [pejorative term  for Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO] recruit members from  German soil and carry out terroristic operations in Iran through  the Iraqi government. In addition, Germany is not prepared to  treat all terrorist groups which are active against European  governments in the same manner and refuses to grant them asylum.    As far as the controversy on human rights is concerned,  Europeans take the liberty of interfering in the internal  affairs of other countries except in the case of terrorist  activity, when they say as long as terrorist actions are not  committed on their soil, it does not matter. Everyone knows  that terrorist actions are carried out in that particular  country. These double-sided policies are not acceptable for the  broadening of Iranian-German relations.     "

They said the  blockade is considered a means to intervene in Iraqi internal  affairs and runs contrary to all international charters and  agreements, heavenly laws, and human rights.    In a joint communique, signed for the Ba'th Party by the  director of the Iraq Command's Foreign Relations Bureau and for  the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party by party leader Veslin  Koshev, the two parties call for the lifting of the unjust  blockade, which has been imposed on Iraq for more than three  years, for respecting Iraqi sovereignty and independence, and  for respecting its people's free will.    The communique noted the need to improve the ties of  cooperation between the two parties through the exchange of  delegations, visits, publications, and circulars to serve the  common interests of the two friendly peoples and strengthen ties  between them in all fields.    The communique further urges the need for coordination and  cooperation between the two parties in national, regional, and  international conferences to expose the allegations and claims  of the world media and the tendentious propaganda; to reject all  forms of aggression, hegemony, exploitation, and the double  standards policy in addressing world problems; to serve the  principles of progress, freedom, and social justice; to realize  security and peace among nations; and to ensure respect for  international law.

In an exclusive interview with XINHUA on the eve of Russian  Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China, Davydov  said that since 1992, trade between Russia and China had been  growing rapidly thanks to the economic reforms and encouraging  policies being pursued by both nations.    He said that the volume of two-way trade reached 7.68  billion  U.S. dollars in 1993, a 30.9 percent increase over 1992.    He noted that China had become Russia's second largest  trading partner and that Russia ranked seventh on China's list  of international trading partners.    In the first quarter of this year, however, trade between  the  two nations for various reasons saw a decline, he said.    But the minister went on to say that he was confident that  there were bright prospects for a growth in trade and that the  trade relations in general would continue to improve.    He stressed that the two sides should take steps to solve  the  problems affecting the development of trade between them.    He suggested that Russia and China amend their trade  agreements to suit the different situation and that the central  banks play a greater role in trade between the two nations.     "

0,FT942-2178 ,"FT942-2178 _AN-EFUD5ABZFT 940621   FT  21 JUN 94 / MPs probe Mersey Tall Ships losses      By STEWART DALBY   Merseyside Development Corporation yesterday appeared before the Commons public accounts committee to defend its involvement in the lossmaking 1992 Tall Ships regatta on the Mersey, and the associated operatic concert. Mr Chris Farrow, corporation chief executive, said the event had been a one-off, and the corporation had not known the extent of the losses until the events themselves. He told the committee: 'I know of no other event in the region which has lost this kind of money.' Carroll Communications, the public-relations company set up to mastermind the events, was, he said, 'totally viable. The projections were viable.' It was not until the events themselves that the shortfall in ticket sales because of poor marketing became apparent. Ticket revenue was between Pounds 470,000 and Pounds 500,000, Mr Farrow said. This left a shortfall at the end of the day of Pounds 375,000. Much of this was met by the publicly funded development corporation. He agreed the promotion and hospitality budget at Pounds 202,000 had been heavily overshot. Mr Andrew Turnbull, the permanent under-secretary at the Department of Environment, told the committee that events such as the Tall Ships regatta would receive more clear guidance in future; that there would be more careful monitoring of expenditure, and that prospectuses would be more adequately vetted. The 1992 regatta, watched by more than 1m people, was the culmination of the Tall Ships Race across the Atlantic and back.   Companies:-  Merseyside Development Corp.     Carroll Communications.

That is the mildest way the matter can be  explained. The injustice that has been done to Turkey can be  clearly observed if the developments on the matter are listed in  chronological order as follows:    1. Turkey discussed the withdrawal of the oil in the  pipeline and the prevention of corrosion in the installations  with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Oxman when he visited  Ankara some time ago. Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin  also held talks on the matter when he visited the United States.  Meanwhile, the officials of the two countries discussed the  matter in their bilateral talks. In other words, Turkey  indicated that it does not intend to take any secret action on  the matter.    2. However, the Clinton Administration refrained from  responding to Turkey's appeals each and every time they were  made.    3. The last time the matter was discussed was when Prime  Minister Ciller visited Washington. Considering Washington's  reluctance to express its opinion, Turkey informed the U.S.  Administration again that it will launch a limited operation to  save the pipeline. Turkey was right because the United States  has condoned Jordan's behavior, which conflicts with the  requirements of the embargo on Iraq. King Husayn has been able  to sell anything he wishes to that country. However, Turkey has  been the country that has suffered most from the embargo.    4. It was at about that time that Ambassador Richard Barkley  discussed the matter with Under Secretary of Defense Frank  Wisner and Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles Freeman when  he held talks with them after the downing of two helicopters  over northern Iraq.    5. That was when the United States brought up the question  of the oil pipeline, as if it were the first time the United  States had become aware of that issue. The U.S. officials  insisted that the embargo on Iraq must not be violated.  Ambassador Barkley informed Wisner and Freeman that he would  contact Ankara and brief them on the matter later.    6. In his first message to Washington, Ambassador Barkley  said that Turkey did not plan to violate the embargo. He also  explained that, although the U.S. side was informed, Washington  has not conveyed the proposals it promised to Ankara.    7. However, we have ascertained that the messages Ambassador  Barkley conveyed to Washington later claimed that Turkey had  made an effort to unilaterally violate the embargo on Iraq. His  messages made Washington feel very uneasy.    8. While Ambassador Nuzhet Kandemir prepared to convey  Turkey's official reply to the U.S. Administration in  Washington, Ambassador Barkley called on the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs to complain.    9. The Turkish and U.S. officials discussed the matter for  the last time in New York. Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin  informed Ambassador Albright that Turkey will not use the funds  that will be raised from the sale of the oil in the pipeline.  He gave Jordan as an example. Ambassador Albright informed him  that the U.S. Administration will reply to Turkey in seven days.    10. Meanwhile, the Turkish officials were aware that  Ambassador Barkley conveyed unfavorable reports to Washington  against Turkey. They were also aware of the exaggerated views he  conveyed for the U.S. State Department's Human Rights Report.  Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the way he expressed  himself in reports he sent to Washington on the Kurds in Turkey  prompted the Clinton Administration to place the concept of a  political solution to the Kurdish problem on its agenda.    Turkey made an effort to hold talks with the U.S.  Administration, the White House, and other U.S. establishments  on several problems during the past year. It brought up those  problems even during luncheons. However, Ankara has been  surprised by the way the Clinton Administration has insisted on  not understanding Turkey's position. I wonder whether the  situation would have been different if Ambassador Barkley had  taken the time to consider the matter before he conveyed  messages to Washington? In fact, I believe that things would  have been different.    It is a fact that Ambassador Barkley stands to gain nothing  from the existing tension in relations between Turkey and the  United States. As an ambassador who has disrupted relations  between the two countries, he may find it difficult to secure a  position in the U.S. State Department when he returns to  Washington at the end of his tour in Ankara.    Meanwhile, the tense relations may lead to an ""economic  threat"" against Turkey. I would not like to be the person  blamed for that state of affairs.    That is a friendly warning while there is still time.     "

The ministry had threatened AFP with legal action for not  publishing the government's version of two incidents on  Monday--an attack on a bus carrying Romanian engineers in south  Egypt, and an explosion in a northern town.    The ministry summoned bureau chief David Daure on Tuesday  who  rejected accusations that AFP was giving a lopsided version of  events in its coverage of the Muslim fundamentalist campaign  against the government.    Officials accepted his comments and said they considered the  matter closed.    The bus attack, which caused no injuries, was claimed by the  underground al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah in a statement sent to AFP.    The ministry, in comments carried by AFP, said the attack  was  aimed at the bus company because it had recently laid off staff  and thus had nothing to do with the campaign against foreigners.    In the explosion in the town of Tanta, which wounded seven  people, police originally said it was caused by a bomb, but the  ministry later said it was a leftover wartime shell, which AFP  also reported.    Relations between the government and foreign press have been  strained since fundamentalists launched a campaign two years ago  which has killed 301 people.    The much-publicised campaign has frightened away foreign  tourists, costing the government billions of dollars in lost  revenue.     "

The interview you gave to last Monday's edition of NARODNA  OBRODA seems to have confirmed such rumors.    [Moravcik] This is definitely not the case. We have made a  decision. The parliament has approved the relevant  constitutional law and set the date of the elections and this is  binding for us. Therefore, nothing has happened.    [Pospisilova] It has been claimed that a pretext for  postponing the date of the election from autumn could be the  issue of the entry in the identity card testifying to  citizenship of the Slovak Republic. The fact is that this entry  is posing a problem. Regrettably the relevant authorities have  up to now done nothing to resolve the matter.    [Moravcik] It is really not true that nothing is being done  in this matter. When discussing the bill amending the existing  law on elections we also examined that problem. It can be  resolved technically. This is matter that the finance minister  will have to tackle so that the elections can take place without  a hitch.    [Pospisilova] Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for  a  Democratic Slovakia, said that the National Council was  experiencing a deep political and moral crisis and that he was  not certain whether it would last until the autumn elections.  What do you think? Will it last?    [Moravcik] The question is, who was it who caused this deep  moral crisis? It would be apt and very useful if former Prime  Minister Meciar examined his own conscience. I believe,  however, that what happened in connection with the vote of no  confidence in Vladimir Meciar resulted in the consolidation of  the parliament, making it capable of taking action -- although  problems naturally keep cropping up. We have, however, been  successful in overcoming these problems and have to do  everything possible to ensure that the plan we have set  ourselves concerning legislative tasks facing the government is  implemented. We must indeed be successful in this endeavor.    [Pospisilova] Your government survived the first stern  parliamentary test this week. The opposition failed to secure a  vote of no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac. One  can, however, hear voices that similar motions of no confidence  are being planned for the coming parliamentary meetings.    [Moravcik] This method should not become an accepted thing  in  our parliament. We have to express ourselves very critically on  the course of action chosen by the present opposition when, with  no justification whatsoever, it proposes such motions. On the  one hand we are wasting time, which is very precious. We are  wasting resources since deputies, who on the whole are well  paid, could do a more useful job and not have to listen to  fabricated arguments. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] You are therefore not afraid of this?    [Moravcik] Of course, we have a sufficient amount of  self-confidence because we feel that there is nothing that might  realistically threaten the government position of any member of  the present cabinet. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmoegnerova  and  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus have stressed repeatedly that the  abolition of the so-called old clearing account for payments  between the Czech and Slovak Republics could not come out of  meetings between experts and that a political decision is  needed. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has, however, let it  be known that in this matter he has nothing to discuss with you.  He said moreover that he is not certain whether the Slovak side  had a detailed knowledge of the given problem. What will be  your answer to him, Mr. Prime Minister?    [Moravcik] We have examined the payments agreement between  the Czech and Slovak republics, including the problem of the old  clearing account. We have also consulted foreign experts. It  has been shown that that agreement was a bad one; that it was  rather disadvantageous precisely for Slovakia, especially as far  as the old account was concerned. Since it is disadvantageous  for Slovakia it is on the whole natural that it is in our  interest to have it amended. Therefore, from this viewpoint, the  situation is on the whole unequivocal. I firmly believe that the  representatives of the Czech Republic will be accommodating  toward us in this matter. [passage omitted]    [Pospisilova] Vaclav Klaus wants to discuss with you the  issue concerning the border area at Kasarna. What is the  attitude of the Slovak Government in this case?    [Moravcik] Unchanged, so far. This means we see no reason  why there should be an exchange of territory in that locality.     "

Its report looks at the experience of the dozen European works councils, most of which have been established by French multinationals. It concludes that more will spring up voluntarily even if the European Community directive on making works councils compulsory fails. The British government is strongly opposed to compulsory works councils, but the issue could be pressed by the 11 other EC states through the social policy 'protocol' established at the Maastricht summit. The authors of the report, Mr Michael Gold of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Mr Mark Hall of the Industrial Relations Research Unit at Warwick University, say existing councils share many features. Most meet only once a year to provide group-wide information, discussion of national issues is not allowed, consultation is unusual and 'negotiation entirely non-existent'. The authors say managements find them useful to explain company strategy, especially in relation to restructuring, although some managements fear they might become a platform for Europe-wide collective bargaining. Employee representatives find them helpful for information-gathering and establishing closer links between unions.

Despite the Greek embargo against The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] and Greece's referral to the  European Court of Justice, it is expected that German Minister  of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel will express his satisfaction to  Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos during  the two men's meeting on 14 June. Relations between them have  been characterized by ""special cordiality,"" according to  Telloglou, following the successful negotiations on EU  enlargement last February and the Ioannina meeting that resulted  in a successful compromise on minority blocking. This ""dramatic  change,"" which comes after the German EU representatives stopped  communicating with Greek officials because of Pangalos'  well-known ""importune"" statements, contributed to an  intervention by Bonn in the FYROM and Albanian issues that was  more favorable to Greek interests. According to Telloglou, it  proves that Germany considers its relations with Greece more  important than its relationship with these two Balkan countries.  Kinkel ""contributed to a more realistic"" appraisal of the  problem of the embargo by adopting the view that this issue  should not define the entire Greek relationship with the EU.  Telloglou asserted that Kinkel also perceived that the Greek  Government would not compromise unless FYROM shows flexibility.  Germany's understanding would have been impossible had not  Greece shown the availability and imagination to solve some of  the problems faced by the EU, Telloglou concluded.     "

Alexander Downer, formerly shadow treasurer under the  leadership of John Hewson, on Monday defeated his boss by a vote  of 43 to 36 to become the new leader of the liberals.    At a press conference in Canberra today, the 42-year-old  Downer pledged a fresh start for the oppostion.    ""I pledge myself to do everything I can to restore hope and  a  bright future to Australia,"" he said.    Downer's father was a minister under the late prime minister  Richard Menzies.    TECO Representative Francias Li said both Hewson and Downer  are friendly to the ROC. They both visited Taiwan in March 1991  and were impressed by the progress they saw there, he said.    Li said many of Downer's supporters either have visited  Taiwan or are members of the Australia-Taiwan parliamentary  group in Canberra. The group now has 86 members, next only to  the Australia-U.S. parliamentary group in terms of participation.

This agreement establishes a  series of safeguards for Argentine and Brazilian nuclear  activities. The least that can be expected is that there are  grave enough reasons -- which must be publicly explained -- to  justify an omission that will make Brazil subject to the  affronts normally piled on irresponsible governments. The  committee is not empowered to hold Brazilian foreign policy  hostage without clearly explaining the reasons behind such a  drastic measure. The highest national interest is at stake. The  silent inspiration of the representatives of false nationalism,  which also seek to become mentors of the nation's  representatives, cannot prevail over those interests.    The Quadripartite Agreement achieved in a single stroke an  inspired way of guaranteeing, in the eyes of the international  community, the peaceful purposes of Brazilian and Argentine  nuclear programs. It is a powerful instrument to build trust  between the two signatory countries. It is also worth noting  that Brazil has for some years suffered a variety of pressures  to join the Non- Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. It does not do so  because it believes the NPT is unacceptably discriminatory and  differentiates between those who have and those who do not have  nuclear weapons. In view of the progress in the nuclear  program, the simultaneous increase in international efforts to  achieve nonproliferation, and faced with the inescapable need to  raise the level of relations with Argentina, Brazil chose to  strengthen regional nuclear control instruments as a way to  guarantee the international community of our peaceful use of the  atom, and as a way to obtain the required approval to legitimize  this sensitive area.    The country acted on two fronts: First, the  Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear  Materials (ABACC) was created and the Quadripartite Agreement  was negotiated with Argentina, authorizing the ABACC and the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to supervise and  control nuclear activities in the two countries. Second,  efforts were made to eliminate the obstacles that prevented  Brazil from accepting the Tlatelolco Treaty.    The purpose of this double action was, we repeat, to obtain  the international community's respect and credibility without  accepting the costs of the NPT. As a result, Brazil is possibly  the only country that does not have a nuclear weapon and which  did not sign the NPT. But in order to earn political profit  from this -- that is, credibility and respectability -- it is  necessary for Congress to approve the Quadripartite Agreement.  If that does not happen we will only encourage the  international community's general mistrust without a way to  counteract it.    Contrary to what is feared by narrow-minded and perhaps  well-  intentioned people, the Quadripartite Agreement does not  restrict our national sovereignty. Skillfully drafted, it does  not present obstacles for building a nuclear submarine and it  protects our autonomously obtained industrial and technological  achievements. The supplementary arrangements introduced into the  Agreement -- which originally raised doubts because of the scope  of regulations that could have gone beyond what was established  in the main body of the agreement -- were finally accepted in  the record time of two negotiating sessions, as a demonstration  that the IAEA has great political interest to see this  Quadripartite Agreement entering into effect quickly.    The Brazilian Government thinks likewise. The Senate must  approve the agreement before Brazil can join the Organization to  Ban Nuclear Weapons in Latin America (Opanal), the agency  responsible for the implementation of the Tlatelolco Treaty.  The Opanal meeting scheduled for 7 December was postponed until  19 January at the request of the Brazilian Government. Opanal  directors expect that Brazil, Argentina, and Chile -- countries  that reviewed their positions on the Tlatelolco Treaty -- will  formally join the organization by that date. For Brazil,  joining Opanal now will mean influencing -- as the country with  the region's most complete nuclear program -- the organization's  working agenda that will be elaborated in January. From a  broader point of view, approval of the agreement will be  evidence of the respect Brazil has for joint efforts with the  Argentine and Chilean Foreign Ministries on this extremely  sensitive issue. By not joining, however, we will be ridiculed  for unnecessarily delaying the meeting. Brazil will also pay  the political price of showing, before the international  community, that the government is incapable of approving the  Quadripartite Agreement on time.    Congress has been convened for a special session and could  discuss international agreements and treaties as well as the  specific item on the agenda. There are, therefore, ways for the  Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate plenum to approve the  text of the agreement before 19 January. To fail to do so will  hurt the Brazilian image in the world.     "

They live in solid wooden houses,  have electricity, watch television, and some of their children  play with hand-held electronic games.    ""The Khmers here are somewhat better off than elsewhere,""  said a Thai timber trader. ""Safety is 100 pre cent secure"" in  terms of traveling and communications.    A week ago, it took three hours from Bo Rai district in the  southeastern Thai province of Trat to reach this timber-rich  community in Samlaut. The best route there is maintained by the  Khmer Rouge throughout the year because it is the only one that  is usable during the wet season.    A four-wheel-drive truck is the only vehicle that can make  the journey. Thai timber traders stocked up with rice, dried  and fresh food. Most of it was for improving relations with  guards along the way and ranking Khmers important to the smooth  operation of their business.    Three Thai military checkpoints were passed before Khmer  Rouge outposts were reached. These border guards seemed to  appreciate salted mackerel in particular. War veterans, they  had been taken off the battlefield and posted to these  checkpoints to deal with Thai traders because they had been  maimed by landmines.    Zone 505 is in rich, variegated forest. Several Thai traders  said they were more confident doing business with the Khmer  Rouge than with people they refer to as Khmer Khao (White  Khmers), meaning those loyal to the government in Phnom Penh.    ""They [the Khmer Rouge] do not collect fees along the way  like the Khmer Khao,"" one trader pointed out. ""Safety in terms  of logging and access to sites is more or less reliable    ""If anything, it is fellow Thais who cause problems. The  Khmer Rouge officials keep to their word.""    Zone 505 is home to 20,000 people, the majority of them  women  and children, many very young - the result of a Khmer Rouge  population drive that has seen girls from age of 18 married off  and encouraged to produce, residents said.    But the leadership remains stringent about family life, no  adultery or polygamy is allowed.    According to Lok Nong, who is on the central committee of  Zone 505, with special duties to co-ordinate with Thais and look  after the timber trade, Khmer Rouge administration allows for  some autonomy.    If the zone's forces seize any territory belonging to  government they are entitled to take charge and administer the  benefits of that territory.    ""Zone 505 is reputed to be very experienced in fighting,"" he  said.    The Khmer Rouge retake of Pailin, located north of here,  last  month was largely the work of soldiers from Zone 505.    Khmer Rouge units were closing in on Battambang and would  eventually take the country's second largest provincial capital  if the government obtained no foreign support, he claimed.    ""Thailand does not send arms to Democratic Kampuchea. We  have to be self-sufficient in every respect now,"" Lok said.    At community level, Khmer Rouge self-sufficiency is ensured  by the central committee through a cooperative system. The  committee administers the use of a central pool of tractors,  rollers and other farming equipment, and the distribution of  seeds to each household.    ""Democratic Kampuchea's main sources of income are timber  and  gems,"" Lok said. ""The income is used to improve the welfare of  each zone. We do not let any one individual or even the top  administrator enrich himself alone.""    Logging is carried out through cooperatives composed of no  less than 10 parties. The main rule is to fell trees that are  sufficiently large.    While Zone 505's main income is timber, zone 405 located  further north is engaged in gems. The men of this even more  comfortable Khmer Rouge community are said to be reluctant to go  to the battlefield.    The destination of Thai timber traders is a medium-size saw  mill in the middle of a forest in Samlaut. Khmer Rouge soldiers  off duty from the frontlines guard the stacks of sawn timber on  site.    Some 50 kilometers beyond, in a mountainous and forested  area, a large pile of felled logs -- as many as 10,000 according  to Khmer Rouge reckoning -- is waiting to be hauled across the  border into Thailand.    ""Democratic Kampuchea will look after the timber until  Thailand permits this,"" said a Khmer Rouge soldier.    Zone 505 enjoys relative peace and fairly good means of  communication with surrounding areas. But the area is heavily  mined.    ""We lean on Thais when we are in trouble,"" Lok said.    ""Now we are at peace, we want to encourage Thais to come and  do business with us more than other nationals, who want only to  drain us of our natural resources,"" he said.     "

Money for the maritime processing of this waste and  utilization has not been allocated. Russia has a shortage of  money and some projects, including ecological, are scarcely not  financed. In early March an official representative of the  Finance Ministry said the problem will be solved in the near  future, but there have been no results.    The problem of utilization of water from Russian subs'  nuclear reactors aggravated in mid-October. Some 900 cubic  meters of liquid waste was dumped and some 700 cubic meters more  were waiting for their turn. All this provoked a negative  reaction of the international public, meanwhile the dumping was  coordinated with the International Atomic Energy Agency and the  competent Russian ministries.    Great Britain and France have the right to similar dumping  till 2018, and Japan is also dumping its radioactive waste in  the sea.    The problem of Russian radioactive waste utilization can be  solved only by the construction of special decontaminating  installations. Russia has not received the promised Western  assistance, and a special tanker for waste storage offered by  Japan appeared to be useless.     "

A natural consequence of our  geography, this priority is also linked with historical and  cultural factors and the existence of sizable joint  undertakings. Within the economic-commercial area, relations  with Latin American countries are equally intense. Brazilian  trade with ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]  countries accounts for 25 percent of our foreign trade.    This remarkable increase in the commercial flow toward Latin  America has occurred in the middle of a process marked by the  consolidation of regionalization and globalization of the world  economy and the exhaustion of the import replacement model in  Brazil. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT [General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs] talks has brought prospects for  strengthening the multilateral system of commerce. At a  regional level, the implementation of NAFTA has made it even  more obvious that it is necessary to accelerate the  consolidation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the  implementation of the proposal for a South American Free Trade  Area (SAFTA).    Few times in history have been so favorable for promoting  cooperation with Latin American countries. The general  predomination of democratic governments is the foundation for  political coordination among the countries of the region and for  the emergence of political forums like the Rio Group. This  democratic atmosphere has to a considerable extent contributed  to overcoming old regional distrust and rivalry.    Among the initiatives aimed at strengthening confidence  among  the countries of the region is the understanding between Brazil  and Argentina, which concluded with the signing of the  historical Quadripartite Agreement of Nuclear Safeguards. The  approval of a set of amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and the  Declaration of Mendoza, which was signed before the Treaty for  Proscription of Chemical Weapons, are also part of that context.    Brazil has developed a tradition of confidence that pervades  our relations with all South American countries. The fact that  Brazilian diplomacy has been traditionally based upon the  principles of self determination, non-interference, and respect  for international law, has helped strengthen the reliability of  the country before its neighbors. We have also attained  valuable diplomatic achievements, which are represented by  agreements like the River Plate Basin Treaty, the Amazonas  Cooperation Treaty, the Treaty of Montevideo (ALADI), and the  Treaty of Asuncion (Mercosur).    Among the matters to which Itamaraty is attaching top  priority, I would mention first the negotiations over Mercosur  and the promotion of SAFTA. The liberalization process within  Mercosur is moving forward as scheduled, with strong, positive  impact on commercial exchange between the four partners, which  has practically tripled since the signing of the Treaty of  Asuncion. As of 1 January 1995 a free trade zone will come into  force in the Mercosur zone.    The proposal for the creation of SAFTA, which President  Franco announced at the last presidential meeting of the Rio  Group, has been welcomed, as I could see at the 8th ALADI  Council of Ministers' meeting and, more recently, during a  meeting with the economy and foreign ministers of Mercosur  countries.    At the bilateral level, high-level political contacts have  substantially intensified. President Itamar Franco met abroad  with Presidents Carlos Menem, Luis Alberto Lacalle, Rafael  Caldera, and Cesar Gaviria. He attended the inauguration of  Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Eduardo Frei, making valuable  contacts with those chiefs of state. He met in Brasilia with  the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, and Guyana, and with the  then presidents-elect of Bolivia and Paraguay. In my capacity  as head of Itamaraty, I visited Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia,  and Bolivia.    This intensification of the meetings with top authorities of  neighboring countries has healthily diversified the mechanisms  for consultation and coordination, and the integration programs.  Standing mechanisms for regular consultation have recently been  instituted between Itamaraty and the Argentine Foreign Ministry.  A high-level Binational Commission was also created to  coordinate the work on various cooperation projects with  Venezuela. At a recent meeting in Leticia, Presidents Itamar  Franco and Cesar Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian  Neighborhood Committee. The consideration of border problems in  those forums serves as a safeguard against the undesirable  politicization of matters that are more directly important for  local communities, opening prospects for cooperation whose  potential had not been properly developed.    In this spirit, Itamaraty has extended decisive support for  the initiatives aimed at promoting physical integration and the  integration of the power generation sectors with neighboring  countries, either at a multilateral level, like the  Paraguay-Parana waterway, or at a bilateral level, like the  Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline. This set of initiatives proves  that Latin America is not merely a diplomatic option for Brazil.  It is an area for priority action, to which the Brazilian  Government should devote top attention in permanent contact with  civilian society.     "

The 1,200km pipeline, which would transport gas from Argentina's Neuquen fields to businesses and homes in Santiago and other Chilean cities, has a target completion date of 1997. Chilectra, the project developer and leader of a consortium that has negotiated a gas supply contract with Argentina, named Tenneco as the technical operator of the transmission company. British Gas will take responsibility for the 8,000km distribution network. The British and US companies beat off stiff competition from other international companies, including Enron, Lonestar Gas and Utili-corp of the US, and Transcanada Pipelines and Novacorp International of Canada. The two companies, which would take out an equity stake in the project, will undertake feasibility studies before going ahead with construction in 1994. British Gas's share of the study costs will be less than Dollars 2.25m. Securing financing may be difficult given the estimated six years of negative cash flows involved and the 20-year payback period. The transmission and distribution elements of the contract, not including three thermo-electric generators, are likely to cost between Dollars 950m and Dollars 1.2bn. There is also political risk. Although Chile was awarded an investment grade rating last year, Argentina's economic stability is still to be tested. Relations between the two countries, although much improved, have often been strained - a factor that could interrupt the smooth flow of gas.   Companies:-  British Gas.     Tenneco Gas.

Deputy Secretary General Hsu Hui-you of Taipei's Straits  Exchange Foundations (SEF) and his mainland counterpart, Deputy  Secretary-General Sun Yafu of the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) met to discuss the repatriation  of hijackers, illegal immigrants and resolution of cross-strait  fishing disputes.    Hsu and Sun were the chief negotiators for the Dec. 18-22  cross-strait talks in Taipei which also focused on the three  issues.    Meanwhile, SEF Deputy Secretary-General Shih Chi-ping met  with ARATS Secretaries-General Li Yafu and Zhao Zhenyu to  discuss cross-strait cultural, technical, and economic exchanges.    During a press briefing, SEF Vice Chairman and  Secretary-General Chiao Jen-ho, head of the Taipei delegation,  said he is optimistic about reaching agreement on the hijacking,  illegal immigrant and fishing disputes.    He said that a joint statement at the end of the five-day  talks will be possible if the panel discussions result in  concrete agreements.    In the morning, Chiao visited the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY and the  forbidden city, home of the Ming and Ching dynasty emperors.  Chiao also visited the Beijing branch of Weichuan Co., one of  the leading Taiwan-invested companies in the mainland.

[Gukasov] If Russia had not proclaimed itself the legal heir  of the USSR, would relations with the Baltic countries be so  strained?    [Laar] They undoubtedly would have taken on a completely  different tonality, without the bass notes, in any case. The  difficulty of today's situation consists in that Russia is  actually not the legal heir to the USSR, whose legacy includes  the numerous crimes of the previous regime, but is the heir  mainly when it is advantageous to it, the great empire with all  the claims to a mighty past. It is no accident that recently  Russian politicians have been speaking more and more openly at  the highest levels about restoration of the empire, masking this  objective with the idea of protection of the Russian-speaking  population in the countries of the former USSR. It is precisely  on this soil that there are frequent disagreements between  Estonian and Russian diplomats.    [Gukasov] Why did the collapse of other empires--the  British,  the French--take place in a much more civilized way? In any  case, the colonists were decent people and were in a condition  to determine their own fate for themselves.    [Laar] I would like to believe that, but my specialty is  history, and therefore I can say that the disintegration of any  empire has always been bloody. Our peculiarity lies in the fact  that Bolshevism made everyone equally poor.    [Gukasov] Estonian politicians love to use Finland as an  example. But after World War II, Presidents Paasikivi and  Kekkonen did everything possible to maintain normal relations  mainly with their great neighbor to the east. It was because of  this that Finland achieved economic prosperity and well-being.    [Laar] Undoubtedly, the postwar Finnish leaders were able to  draw the country away from the well-known Czechoslovak scenario  and derive economic advantage for all of their people. It is  useful for us Estonians to study the history of relations  between Finland and its great eastern neighbor because we are  very similar in terms of national character. But we must see  that there are many difficulties in this country's economy and,  incidentally, precisely because of its former orientation toward  the USSR. Orientation toward Russia alone is very dangerous,  especially for small countries. We cannot tie our destiny to  such a large ship, on which anything could happen. All it has to  do is list, and we will sink to the bottom.    [Gukasov] Is it possible to consider nationalism a struggle  for privileges for a particular group of people?    [Laar] We in Estonia have no privileged nationality, because  we are creating a rule-of-law state, where social relations are  built on the basis of citizenship. And this--I want to  emphasize--is in no way linked to nationality. I was surprised  by the statement from Andrey Kozyrev to the effect that the  Baltic states give citizenship according to nationality. I do  not know about anyone else, but the Russian foreign affairs  minister is quite well informed particularly about the Estonian  law on citizenship. And I do not know what kind of country  Estonia would be if all the leading posts were by directive  filled only by Estonians.    [Gukasov] Your attitude toward the Representative Assembly  (PA) of the Russian-speaking population of Estonia.    [Laar] Favorable. Recently the PA has been playing a useful  role in Estonian society. A positive change has been made in the  Russian society of Estonia. We are no longer arguing about  whether they have to learn the Estonian language or not. We are  speaking about how to do this better.    [Gukasov] On 31 August 1994, the Russian Army will leave  Estonia. Will that put an end to all the problems?    [Laar] I hope that this event will take place at the  scheduled time. We demand the withdrawal of the troops at all  forums because this ""sticking point"" in the Baltic region is  only to Russia's disadvantage. That same Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs is constantly irritated: How is it that such  little children create such big problems? Many Western diplomats  have told me that whenever they want to break off a conversation  with their Russian colleagues, all they have to do is mention  Estonia or Latvia. The Russian diplomats immediately fall silent  and leave without concealing their irritation.    Long ago we prepared entire files of documents that would  put  things in motion immediately after the troop withdrawal. A year  ago I sent Mr. Chernomyrdin a draft agreement concerning  transit. And there was no answer. There is no logic in this. If  the military problem is solved, the other spheres will approach  the norm one after another.     "

But during the past few  weeks, there have been increasing signs of a strain in the  Brotherhood's relationship with the government.    The first sign was an anti-government demonstration, in  protest at the death in police custody of a lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Madani, staged by members of the  Brotherhood-controlled Bar Association and which police  dispersed immediately. Thirty-six lawyers were arrested.    A few days later, Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, a prominent  Islamic scholar, was instructed by security authorities not to  deliver a sermon during prayers marking 'Id al-Adha at the  Mustafa Mahmud mosque in Muhandisin. Al-Ghazali was later  received by Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, in what was viewed  as a conciliatory gesture.    Around the same time, 84-year-old Shaykh Hamid Abu-al-Nasr,  the supreme guide of the Brotherhood, was summoned for  questioning by prosecution authorities after leaflets bearing  his name were seized during the 'Id prayers. The ailing Shaykh  did not comply and the order was subsequently cancelled.    On Monday, Al-Alfi announced that ""a group of Brotherhood  members have been arrested for anti-state activity."" The  newspaper AL- SHA'B, mouthpiece of the Islamist-oriented Labour  Party, put their number at eight and said their arrest was ""part  of the escalating government campaign against the Brotherhood.""  The eight, who include Ibrahim Sharaf, the private secretary of  the supreme guide, were remanded in custody for 15 days, the  newspaper said.    Mustafa Mashhur, a deputy of the supreme guide, told  AL-AHRAM  WEEKLY he was surprised by the government's actions because ""we  are exercising all our activities, whether in the People's  Assembly or in professional syndicates or teachers' cubs, within  the framework of the constitution and under the umbrella of the  law."" He said the Brotherhood has not been involved in any act  of violence since it resurfaced during the 1970s. ""We even  condemned such acts,"" he said.    The reason for the clampdown, Mashhur said, could be the  anti- government slogans shouted by lawyers during their  demonstration. But Mashhur denied that those lawyers were  Brotherhood members.    Another reason, Mashhur said, could be the government's  intention to deny the Brotherhood the right to establish a  political party. ""They think that if we have an Islamic party,  the Copts will demand a party of their own and this will lead to  civil strife. But this is not true.""    Despite the latest arrests, the Brotherhood is carrying on  with its normal activities and ""will not be involved in any  escalation, even if the government steps up its measures,""  Mashhur said.    'Isam al-'Aryan, secretary-general of the Doctors Union and  a leading member of the Brotherhood, said he was not worried by  the latest arrests because ""this is a pattern to which previous  governments resorted on previous occasions."" The reason for the  clampdown, he said, could be a government attempt to bar the  Brotherhood from the national dialogue or from parliamentary  elections scheduled for next year.    Muhammad Salim al-'Awwa, a lawyer described as a  representative of the moderate Islamic trend, said he was  surprised by recent events because the Brotherhood has  distributed leaflets for years and they were never confiscated  and the supreme guide was never summoned for questioning. He  described the government's actions as a ""political and religious  mistake"" because the Brotherhood is a ""strong political and  religious supporter of the constitutional system.""    Political analyst Muhammad Sid-Ahmad believes the motive  behind the government clampdown is to exclude the Brotherhood  from the national dialogue. ""There are two reasons for this.  First, the government is not prepared to recognise it to  prevent the emergence of an Islamic party, then a Christian  party etc. The second reason is the government's wish to  maintain the legitimacy of the dialogue"" by excluding illegal  organisations, he said. But Sid-Ahmad believes the Brotherhood  will be indirectly represented at the dialogue via Ibrahim  Shukri, leader of the Labour Party.    Another political analyst, Tagammu [National Progressive  Unionist Grouping] secretary-general Rif'at al-Sa'id, who keeps  a close watch on the Islamist movement, said the government has  tolerated the Brotherhood for years because it considered it  harmless but was waking up to its ""danger"".    ""There is no moderation in the Islamist current. The  Brotherhood is an extremist organisation that calls for the  establishment of an Islamic state. The violent history of the  Brotherhood speaks for itself,"" al-Sa'id added.    The Brotherhood instigated the lawyers' demonstration to  cover up for ""severe financial malpractices"" by the Bar  Association's Council, he continued. The demonstration as well  as televised statements by repentant terrorist 'Adil  'Abd-al-Baqi, implicating the Brotherhood in acts of terrorism,  made the government wake up to the ""danger"" of the Brotherhood,  he commented.    Asked if the Brotherhood was expected to retaliate for the  government clampdown, Al-Sa'id replied negatively. ""On the  contrary, they will kneel down in order to be accepted.""     "

In the structure of export to the USA the main commodity  groups consist of precious metals and articles from these  metals, rare earth and nonferrous metals, chemical goods, oil  products, foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials.    Import is mainly represented by food products (wheat, maize,  barley, butter, soy beans, etc.), machines, equipment and  transport facilities.    Russian-American trade is traditionally characterized by a  considerable deficit of the balance of trade. In 1992, for  instance, import exceeded export 4.2 times. The volume and  structure of Russia's export, especially that of finished  articles, has been adversely affected by the long absence (from  1951 to 1992) of the most-favoured-nation treatment. For a whole  number of goods likely to be exported the duties imposed on us  were two to ten times higher than the level of customs duties  for countries enjoying this treatment. Among other reasons  mention can be made of low competitive capacity, the barriers  kept alive in the USA for the import into the country of  high-technology goods, and antidumping legislation. As a result,  the possibilities of exporting uranium products to the USA were  considerably limited in the past, and an antidumping duty was  imposed on ferrosilicium from Russia. Until recently there has  been a threat of antidumping proceedings being instituted in  relation to the sale of chlorinated potassium, aluminium and  steel.    As in the past, last year goods turnover was mainly  determined by our import of grain. A favourable balance of trade  in the first half-year arose partly in virtue of the fact that  due to the unsettled problem of debt Russia could still not use  credits for the purchase of grain. However, four new agreements  were concluded in June in the framework of the Food for Progress  programme, shipments of which commenced in September. In this  way Russia's import in October exceeded export, the latter  growing at a higher rate than in 1992.    Treaty rights and legal status    The key document is the Agreement on Trade on Trade  Relations  signed between the USSR and the USA in 1990. In relation to  Russia it was put in force on June 17, 1992, during the summit  meeting in Washington.    The document makes provision for measures aimed at  encouraging commercial contacts and boosting the mutual  deliveries of goods and services, and assists in expanding trade  in equipment and technologies. The agreement regulates the  financial aspect of trade between the two countries, the  questions of protecting intellectual property, and formalizes  cooperation in the spheres of statistics and standards.  Provision is made for facilitating the transit of goods across  the territories of our countries. Agreements have been reached  on measures for the eventuality of the ""market being violated""  (damage being inflicted on national industry by import), and on  the settlement of disputes through arbitration.    In June 1992 there was an exchange of notes on giving effect  to the Agreement on Assisting Investments signed on April 3,  1992. It envisages the possibility for American investors to use  the services of the U.S. Government's specialized insurance  agency known at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation  (OPIC).    The Treaty on the Encouragement and Mutual Protection of  Investments (not yet ratified by the Russian side) and the  Treaty on Avoiding Dual Taxation (the exchange of ratification  instruments took place in December 1993) have also been signed  with a view to attracting investments.    Organizational basis    In previous decades the Joint Soviet-American Commission on  Trade (in 1980-1985 its activities were unilaterally frozen by  the USA in connection with the war in Afghanistan) had a  considerable part to play in promoting economic contacts.    In 1992, on the American side's initiative, the US-Russian  Business Council was instituted in Washington as a lobbyist  organization speaking for the interests of the U.S. business  circles. On the part of the CIS there is the Council for Trade  Cooperation Between the Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the CIS  and the USA.    An Intergovernmental Russian-American Committee for the  Development of Business Cooperation was instituted in 1992 for  the purpose of promoting cooperation in the economy at a  governmental level.    Last April, at the summit meeting in Vancouver, it was  decided to set up an Intergovernmental Commission on Economic  and Technological Cooperation. The range of its interests  comprises joint activities in areas such as science, energy,  space, conversion and environmental protection. The commission  has held two sittings: in Washington (September) and in Moscow  (December). It is headed by the Chairman of the RF Government  and the Vice-President of the USA.    Trade and political situation    In the late 1980s, after a partial embargo on the export of  agricultural products to the USSR, the US administration took a  number of positive steps. Since 1987 the United States had been  granting us subsidies for the purchase of wheat.    In April 1992 the US Congress eliminated one of the key  obstacles to Russian-American trade and economic relations--the  Byrd-Stevenson amendments fixing a ceiling of 300 million  dollars on the total volume of credits to Russia on the part of  the US Eximbank and 40 million on credits for energy projects.    As a result of the Agreement on Trade Relations Between the  USSR and the USA being brought into force (June 1992) Russia has  been granted the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade with  the United States. Incidentally, contrary to the provisions of  the Agreement's Article 1 on the unconditional provision of such  treatment, the USA extended it on the basis of an annual  waiver--temporary suspension of the Jackson-Vanik amendment  (this suspension can be unilaterally cancelled at any moment).    The Act on Support for Freedom in Russia and Nascent  Euro-Asian Democracies and Support for Open Markets, better  known as the Freedom Support Act, came into force in October  1992. It envisages the repeal of a number of legislative  restrictions of the Cold War times, but does not affect Section  IV of the 1974 US Trade Act (Jackson-Vanik amendment).    Thanks to the Vancouver accords between the two presidents  two agreements were signed in June of last year on the free  supplies of food products and two intergovernmental credit  agreements under the Food for Progress programme. The total cost  of supplies is 500 million dollars, including 71.5 million on an  unrepayable basis. Another 200 million dollars will be used to  compensate transport expenses. The term of the credit is 15  years. The interest rate is 3 percent in the course of easy-term  seven years and 4 percent in subsequent years.    In July 1993 a framework agreement was signed with the US  Eximbank on the provision of credits and credit guarantees for  the Russian oil and gas industry to the tune of more than two  billion dollars.    Last August President Clinton signed a bill on the budget  and  taxation, which also speaks about the need to extend to Russia  the benefits of the General System of Preferences.    In December 1993, on the administration's initiative, the US  Congress passed a Law on Assisting the Reform in New Democratic  Countries and on Rendering Aid and Support with a View to  Improving Partnership with Russia, Ukraine and Other  Newly-Independent States, whereby more than 70 legislative  restrictions have been lifted. This number does not include the  Jackson-Vanik amendment.    Prospects    The creation of a treaty rights basis, the establishment of  the most-favoured-nation treatment in trade between the two  countries, the extension to Russia of the US General System of  Preferences and, lastly, the new programmes of economic aid  provide real prerequisites for increasing mutual trade.  Cooperation in investments has a special part to play. US firms  already take the lead among Western investors in the creation of  joint ventures in Russia (as many as 1,400 JVs have been set up  with their participation). American investments in our country  total c.400 million dollars. More than 300 firms have opened  their representation missions.    Work is also underway to implement a whole number of  projects  aimed at the creation of companies on US territory with the  participation of Russian capital, including those on the basis  of our advanced technology.

The incident, which occurred on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang  Province on March 31, involved the burning of a pleasure boat  and the robbery and murder of 32 victims. Of the dead, 24 were  tourists from Taiwan.    Wang, chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that the incident should  not be used by a few people with ulterior motives as an excuse  to oppose the mainland, halt exchanges across the Taiwan Straits  and advocate Taiwan ""independence"".    ""Both sides of the Taiwan Straits should view, with a good  sense and in a calm and objective manner, the incident and  various questions arising in the course of handling the  incident, as well as draw a lesson from it,"" he said.    He promised that the mainland will continue to tighten  security administration in an effort to ensure the security of  Taiwan compatriots in their visits to the mainland.    Wang, who is inspecting Zhejiang Province, said that the  incident was an unexpected, unfortunate tragedy in the course of  expanding across-straits exchanges and economic cooperation.    He expressed the hope that ARATS and its Taiwan counterpart,  the Straits Exchange Foundation, will try to increase contacts  and dialogue at high level, eliminate misunderstandings, resolve  differences and promote cooperation.

I spoke on the phone with German Foreign Minister Klaus  Kinkel for half an hour yesterday evening. We discussed the  forthcoming European meetings. There is one in Brussels  tomorrow, and another over the weekend [26-27 March] in Greece.  We want France and Germany to have a common position.

First, in a bilateral  relationship, this does not mean that sometimes you can't have  different opinions. This happens to couples, as we know. We are  absolutely determined to preserve the link between Germany and  France. It is the foundation for construction of the European  Union [EU]. There are no problems, either in France or in  Germany. But sometimes we have different opinions. Second,  elections are being held in Germany. When there are elections,  there can be an internal debate and sometimes it is about the  relations between France and Germany.

Laos said it is a poor landlocked country which has  good brotherly relations with Thailand. The tariff reduction  would help promote Laos' exports through Thailand. Suphachai  said the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy  considered that Thailand should comply with Laos' request.  Thailand has already granted special tariff reductions for  several categories of goods from Laos. The committee had put  the Foreign Trade Department of the Commerce Ministry in charge  of negotiations with Laos. Thailand also wants Laos to reduce  transit fees on trucks from Thailand -- now collected at the  rate of 2,000 U.S. dollars, or about 50,000 baht, per trip.    The deputy prime minister reported that at yesterday's  meeting the Coordinating Committee on Economic Affairs Policy  endorsed the U.S. Government's proposal to set up a joint  advisory committee on economic affairs, with full power in  decision making regarding negotiations on trade and economic  cooperation. Asked about the U.S. Government's decision on  Thailand's status as a country on its Priority Watch List, or  PWL, facing retaliation under the U.S. trade law, the deputy  prime minister said it was very likely that the United States  would remove Thailand from the list, but it is still not known  when. This is because of Thailand's good record in cracking  down on violations of U.S. copyrights, including the pirating of  copyrighted video tapes and discs.     "

[Text] Alexander Shokhin, Minister of the Economy, may  become the most influential and powerful figure at the highest  body of executive authority.    Confidential sources have revealed that the government has  prepared a draft resolution on the merger of the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations (MFER) with the Ministry of the  Economy (ME) of Russia. If this happens, the Ministry of the  Economy, which is already the most powerful government  department in Russia and is not accidentally compared to the  former State Planning Committee, will get the most prized piece  of the Russian economy as its subunit. In this way Alexander  Shokhin will become a figure almost as influential as Viktor  Chernomyrdin -- with all the political, economic and other  consequences arising therefrom.    Several circumstances that have made Viktor Chernomyrdin,  who  maintains good relations with the MFER's present-day head Oleg  Davydov, come to favor this variant. Despite the premier's  sympathies for Davydov, Russia's foreign economic activities  cannot be described as too successful. In January-February of  this year foreign trade turnover declined by 8 percent (12.7  billion dollars) in comparison with the same period in 1993.  Exports, it is true, increased by nearly 3 percent, but this  growth took place against the backdrop of the continued fall of  world prices. Imports dropped by more than 27 percent (3.8  billion dollars). According to eyewitness reports, these facts  are often reported to the premier by vice-premier Alexander  Shokhin, who, as a result of the latest redivision of powers in  the Council of Ministers, supervises this department.  Relationships between Shokhin and Davydov are characterized as  ""very strained.""    Sergei Glazyev, who was forced to resign his post of  Minister  of Foreign Economic Relations last year, and now heads the State  Duma's Committee for Economic Policy, sent Viktor Chernomyrdin  an official document with the results of the parlimentary  hearings, sharply critical of Oleg Davydov's work. It is  characteristic that his committee's recommendations are based on  the postulate that in 1992 the MFER under Glazyev's guidance  developed a plan for foreign economic activities, which is not  being followed now. As claimed by MFER employees, there were no  significant differences between Glazyev and his deputy Davydov  at that time. Today, however, the former minister, on the basis  of parliamentary hearings, has presented a serious bill to his  former subordinate on points dealing with accounting and control  over foreign economic activities which he himself did not manage  to organize during his tenure. Of special interest is that at  the end of the recommendations Glazyev suggests on behalf of his  committee that the government ""examine the possibility of the  MFER's merger with those subunits of the Ministry of the Economy  of Russia which deal with foreign economic activities.""    The premier's decision is unlikely to be seriously affected  by the recommendations of the parliamentary committee. But they  are significant on the political plane: for the first time  Sergei Glazyev, who has until now acted independently,  demonstrates his alliance with Alexander Shokhin, and, moreover,  on a fundamental issue. This may indicate a growth in the  ""shadow"" authority of Shokhin who in the event of the MFER being  stripped of its independence would then become the most powerful  and influential figure at the highest executive body.    If this happens, it will perhaps be possible to consider the  path traversed by Alexander Shokhin during four years from being  the Minister of Labor in Silayev's government, the connections  he acquired and the prestige he earned during this time both at  home and abroad to be the standard even in such a fantastic  country as ours.    Forecast of Foreign Economic Activities Based On The Figures  of the MFER of Russia    Foreign trade in 1994 is expected to equal 70.5 billion  dollars, that is, practically at the level of 1993.    Export. The overall volume of export is predicted  to equal 44 billion dollars (43 billion dollars in 1993).    The export of raw material commodities for state needs in  1994 is envisaged to equal a billion dollars or 25.5 of the  total volume of export of raw material goods, technical  assistance -- 1 billion dollars.    Imports. The total volume of imports in 1994 may  come to 26.5 billion dollars (27 billion dollars in 1993).    The forecast of the import of basic commodities and services  of vital importance for the country's economy and social sphere,  given the funds of the federal budget, is estimated at 4 billion  dollars. Moreover, in 1994, it is likely that goods will be  purchased to fulfil the federal raw material programs and other  state needs.    The import of raw materials and supplies on account of the  state budget is expected to amount to 1.8 billion dollars, plant  and equipment -- 2 billion dollars, building services -- 0.2  billion dollars.

At this  meeting of the heads of the European Union, on which occasion a  new European flag bearing 16 stars was first raised (Norway,  Finland, Sweden, and Austria have signed admission agreements),  Rome has after all made a few steps that will make Italy, at  least in the foreseeable future, more important in this newly  enlarged society than it was during its relentless ""political  purgatory"" within the circle of the former Twelve. The meeting  of ""the Magnificent Seven"" (the most developed industrial  countries in the world) will soon be held in Naples, at which  Russia will be completely swamped by the economic and political  embrace of the West, and Italy at the moment also chairs the  CSCE. Berlusconi will thus not find only his own television  stations crucial this time, as he will be all over the  television screens as a leading global diplomat. In Corfu he  even managed unexpectedly to tip the scales of the diplomatic  trade over the election of the new president of the European  Commission, in which even the Germans -- who only recently took  it rather coldly -- had to give in to the European parliamentary  games over Berlusconi's neofascist allies. Now PANORAMA claims  that the Twelve have agreed to support Italy with its constant  designs on Slovenia, and Italy has again been discovering what  already seemed irretrievably lost: the mentality of the winner,  though the most important players are being kicked out of  diplomacy (Fini) and the soccer field (Pagliuca).    In this political and media atmosphere Foreign Minister  Antonio Martino is visiting Sarajevo, Zagreb, and Belgrade this  Monday and Tuesday [27-28 June]. Rome has suffered quite a lot,  being pushed out of the global remodeling of Bosnia-Herzegovina  with contemptuous dismissal, with even Turkish soldiers accepted  as part of the blue helmets, while Clinton expressly forbade the  Italians to do the same. In the Balkans the Italians have  suffered an unexpectedly large number of victims (European  observers and journalists), but have received hardly any profit  through sales; they are now among the loudest in the  preparations for the reconstruction of Sarajevo, and some claim  that the final plan for the division and rearrangement of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will be sealed at the Naples meeting of the  wealthiest nations. Martino arrives in Belgrade as the number  one CSCE man, who might persuade Milosevic to let European  observers go to Kosovo after all, while he comes to Zagreb as a  neighbor, who will continue to drive Croatia crazy with the  ""hot-cold"" policy whenever he deems it necessary. In parliament  he thus rejected any stories about Italian territorial  aspirations toward Slovenia and Croatia, promising -- as Granic  described to a half-empty parliament -- ""to abide by the  European norms and agreements,"" but it is precisely those  ""European norms"" that could bring more long-term headaches to  Zagreb than the frivolous flirting of certain Italian circles  with [Krajina's] Borislav Mikelic, the expert on all sorts of  salami. Within a strictly diplomatic framework, Rome cannot  harm Croatia, which only aspires to the Council of Europe, as  much as Slovenia, which already hopes that it has squeezed its  foot in the door of the European Union, but Rome can keep lead  both countries by their noses to the applause of the European  lobbies with constant references to the protection of minorities  and free movement of capital, people, and ideas.    Those who support a similar observance of European standards  in Istria constantly challenge Zagreb, while Zagreb can not  silence Istria without alienating Europe, so Croatian diplomacy  in that respect keeps chasing its own tail in ever narrower  circles. Among other things, the Statute of the County of  Istria has just been officially rejected because of some  unwelcome multicultural and multilingual ideas, and at this  moment only political dreamers could visualize that in the  foreseeable future they could muster a majority in the Croatian  parliament to agree to a new natural return of Italian property,  and even vote for a law that would enable Italians -- or any  foreigners -- to buy Croatian real estate. Croatian politics  still adores Europe in principle, but only in the way that it  does not become pregnant [as published], and to what extent this  titillation from the other side of the Adriatic can be  unpleasant was best shown by two heated speeches by Tudjman, in  Podgora and Pazin, which, in some Italian circles, have caused  surprise, shock, mockery, and rejection with barely concealed  abhorrence. Anger and bitterness about ""Cypriotization"" and  UNPROFOR are growing in Croatia, while Italy is enjoying a  summer renaissance, so Mate Granic will, in his talks with  Antonio Martino, have to invest a lot of good will, patience,  and generosity to persuade his guest that it does not always pay  to be pig-headed about everything because of a little political  noise on either side of the Adriatic.

The negotiations were interrupted in the aftermath of the  failed 26 May 1993 coup d'etat by former President Jorge  Serrano, who recognized the Belizean state, a British colony  until 1981, for the first time in Guatemalan history and  established diplomatic relations. President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio upheld the Serrano's decision (1991-93), although many  political sectors and citizens have demanded he change his  position.    Today, Minister Vielman told foreign correspondents the  following: ""As the executive branch, we have no jurisdiction"" in  recognizing Belize as an independent state. She failed to say,  however, whose jurisdiction such a decision would fall under.    She pointed out that the ""Belize Council,"" a new council  comprising lawyers and other experts on the subject, must deal  with this issue. The council, which will serve an advisory  role, will revise the previous legislation and will recommend to  the government what to do next. The Belize Council, whose  appointment will be announced next week, will make  recommendations that will be reviewed by the executive branch  ""in accordance with foreign policies before acting upon them.""    The foreign minister insisted this is a legal conflict, but  said she trusts the territorial dispute will have a negotiated  solution and avoid arbitration within the international courts.

Luik met Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho, with whom he  discussed Estonian-Finnish economic relations and Finnish  President Mauno Koivisto. Luik had a longer meeting with his  Finnish counterpart Heikki Haavisto. Under discussion were  bilateral and international relations, agreements, juridical and  economic issues.

Commenting on the Partnership for Peace Programme Luik said  that the direct importance of the agreement lied in the fact  that ""NATO was not indifferent towards Estonia"". Estonia needs  help in development of defence forces, juridical questions and  formation of the Baltic peacekeeping battalion and in these  areas NATO is ready to support Estonia, he added.    Luik said that Estonia will apply for full membership of  NATO  when ""time was rife"" for it. The three Baltic states will  cooperate on the issue, and will apply for the membership  together, Luik said.    Luik arrived back to Estonia Friday evening.     "

In view of their importance to the people  of the two countries, that is a worrying and regrettable fact.    The immediate cause of the situation is the rupture of the  recent talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Clinton on the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations.  Some argued that the breakdown of the talks was a sign of  ""maturing relations"" between the two countries.    Given the subsequent chorus of criticism of Japan by the  U.S.  Government and Congress, as well as the fact that Japanese  Government officials were upset by that criticism, however, it  is difficult to see the ""mature relations"" between the two  countries that the prime minister talked about.    It is also of concern that arguments hailing Japan's saying  ""No"" to U.S. demands are tinged with nationalism.    Nobody will deny that the relations between Japan and the  United States must mature further. That is all the more reason  why we must have a sense of balance and think of the current  trade frictions in the context of the total Japan-U.S.  relationship. We must be coolheaded and not lose sight of the  mid-and long-term trends.    Both the Japanese and the U.S. Governments consider the  partnership of the two countries on three levels: ""political  and security matters,"" ""economy,"" and ""cooperation in tackling  worldwide problems."" They have also agreed that the economic  link is the weakest among the three. The economic framework  talks were arranged precisely for the purpose of strengthening  such a weak link in bilateral relations.    Many Japanese and American people who had expected the two  leaders to have talks from the broad perspective of turning  point in world history -- even though the talks were part of new  economic consultations -- must have been bewildered that their  talks were like trade negotiations.    Nor can it be overlooked that the present Japan-U.S.  relations reflect the nature of the U.S. administration. The  Clinton administration gives the highest priority to putting the  U.S. domestic economy on track and has no qualms in targeting  American diplomacy at creating jobs in the United States and  promoting its exports. It has also been pointed out that the  American President does not have insightful and influential  advisers who make up for his inexperience in diplomacy.    After the end of the Cold War, the Americans became inward-  looking, and Congress, trade unions, and the industry tend to be  protectionist-minded. Under such circumstances, the President  may have thought he would lose nothing in domestic politics by  adopting a strong attitude against Japan, which racked up a  trade surplus with the United States amounting to nearly $60  billion a year.    On the other hand, Prime Minister Hosokawa did not show any  willingness to rise to the occasion by implementing deregulation  and economic pump-priming measures to meet the wishes of the  people here and abroad. The rupture in the talks, which at  first glance looked as if it were the outcome of hard decisions  made by the two leaders, really resulted from Clinton and  Hosokawa evading the more difficult choice of exercising  leadership from a broad perspective in their respective domestic  politics.    To open the domestic market, put the economy on a road  toward  growth driven by domestic demand, and build a consumer-oriented  nation are policy options that were not adopted to please the  Americans or any other people. Those are choices made to usher  in a brighter future for the Japanese themselves and are aimed  at building the ""nation with substance"" that the prime minister  propounded.    What is important is not to make a fuss over responses to  immediate problems, but to steadfastly take measures that are  meaningful in the medium and long-term.    If we take a little broader view, we find the Americans have  begun to regain confidence in themselves as the economy has  started to recover. At the state level, Japanese investment in  the United States has been favorably evaluated. The Americans'  understanding of the mutual dependence between Japan and the  United States has gradually been gaining ground, though the  trend is slowing.    Immediately before and after the summit talks between the  Japanese and U.S. leaders, there were noticeably levelheaded  arguments in the U.S. media that ""the Japanese had a good case.""  And an opinion poll published by the Prime Minister's Office in  Japan showed that the Japanese who thought that ""the Americans  were also partly right"" in the trade frictions between the two  countries outnumbered those who thought the friction resulted  from the Americans' emotional response.    Signs of ""maturity"" should be sought in such aspects of  Japanese and American opinion.    What is most needed now is a reasonable attitude so that the  mutual mistrust and impatience exhibited by political leaders  and bureaucrats will not widen and create mutual distrust at the  grass- roots level.

Robaina, who met with the Argentine president for almost an  hour at the Olivos presidential residence, said that the meeting  was useful, positive, and friendly.    Argentine Acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who  also  participated in the meeting, told the press that the Cuban  foreign minister's visit is very important, successful, and  significant.    In remarks to reporters in Buenos Aires, Robaina, who on  Wednesday also met with the Senate president and with the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, said that many more things unite  the countries than separate them.    According to what was learned, Menem has proposed the  forthcoming visit to Havana of a delegation of Argentine  businessmen to sound out current conditions for trade and  investments in Cuba.    Robaina, who was declared illustrious visitor by the  Argentine congress, added that he also met with members of the  Argentine stock market, with members of the community of Cuban  residents in Argentina, and with leaders of the leftist  coalition, Grand Front.    Robaina's visit will conclude within the next few hours with  a popular act in Buenos Aires organized by several groups of  friendship and solidarity that demand the end of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba. Robaina will leave for Paraguay on 15  April.     "

SAVAGE, Times Staff Writer      WASHINGTON      The Supreme Court ruled Monday that railroads and airlines may administer drug  tests to employees without first negotiating the issue with their labor unions.    The 7-2 decision is the court's first ruling on drug screening in the private  sector and could affect hundreds of thousands of workers in the two industries.    Although Monday's ruling was based only on interpretation of the federal  Railway Labor Act, and is not likely to affect other workers in the private  sector, it clearly shows that the court majority views mandatory drug testing  as a relatively minor imposition on employees.    The high court said that adding a drug test to a routine urinalysis does not  represent a major change in the union's contract and therefore does not demand  collective bargaining.    The decision allows rail companies to proceed with regular testing of about  275,000 train workers, and it will prevent unions from blocking the proposed  testing of 500,000 employees of the airline industry.    Last year, the Transportation Department ordered the airline companies to  prepare an extensive drug-testing program for pilots, flight attendants,  security personnel and ground crews. By Aug. 18, the companies must submit  their plans to the Federal Aviation Administration, and testing is to begin by  the end of the year, an FAA spokesman said.    In March, the Supreme Court upheld government-imposed drug testing for workers  whose jobs require them to operate dangerous equipment, carry firearms or  combat illegal drugs.    Union attorneys argued that such testing violates the Fourth Amendment's ban on  unreasonable searches by government agents.    In a companion ruling handed down the same day, the justices specifically  upheld a government requirement that train crews be tested for alcohol and  drugs after an accident.    Meanwhile, the National Labor Relations Board reached an opposite conclusion in  a decision announced Monday.    The board, in an interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act, said that  a company may impose drug tests on job applicants, but not on existing workers  without bargaining with the union.    Although the NLRB covers most union workers, employers remain free to challenge  this conclusion in the federal courts and eventually in the Supreme Court.    The high court ruling Monday involved Conrail, the Consolidated Rail Corp.,  which cited a series of train accidents that were blamed on crew members'  impairment by drugs or alcohol when it announced in February, 1987, that it was  adding a mandatory drug test to the employees' annual physical examinations.    The existing contract between Conrail and its unions allowed for physical  exams, but union lawyers said that the inclusion of drug testing was a major  change that could not be implemented without the union's approval.    Conrail disagreed, saying that the new tests were only a minor change under  terms of the Railway Labor Act and could be implemented unilaterally by the  company. After a federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled for the union,  Conrail appealed to the Supreme Court (Conrail vs. Railway Labor Executives,  88-1).    Justice Harry A. Blackmum said that Conrail's action was ""arguably justified by  the terms of the parties' collective-bargaining agreement"" and therefore is not  a major change in the contract itself.    The ruling leaves the unions with the option of filing a grievance against  Conrail and requesting that an arbitrator stop the testing. Had the unions  prevailed Monday, testing would have been stopped until the unions agreed to  it.    ""We're disappointed, but not surprised,"" said Lawrence Mann, a lawyer for the  rail unions. ""The voting lineup was the same as in March.""    Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Thurgood Marshall dissented, as they did in  the March ruling involving railroads.    Union officers opposed the new drug-testing program, Mann said, because ""we  didn't get protections for accuracy and reliability."" Congress is considering  legislation that will require a second test of positive samples, he said.    Conrail operates in the Northeast, but railroads around the nation have adopted  similar drug-testing programs, lawyers said.    In other action Monday, the high court:     -- Rejected the government's appeal to reinstate the mail fraud conviction of  former Maryland Gov. Marvin Mandel (U.S. vs. Mandel, 88-1759). Mandel, who  already has been released from prison, won a lower court ruling overturning his  1977 conviction based on a 1987 Supreme Court decision on mail fraud.  Government lawyers argued that the 1987 ruling should not be used  retroactively.     -- Struck down a Connecticut law requiring that the price of beer sold there  be as low as in any neighboring state. On a 6-3 vote, the justices said that  such a law interferes with interstate commerce (Healey vs. Beer Institute,  88-449).

Caldera assumes the presidency on 2 February.    On his way to Brazil, Lage stopped in Caracas for a few  hours  where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich  and Venezuelan businessmen.    The Cuban leader told reporters that the ties between both  nations are at a good level, and he said he had reasons to hope  that those ties would continue to progress because both nations  are very close.    Lage commented that in general that relations between the  Latin American governments and the people are progressing and  strengthening.    Lage exchanged points of view with Ochoa Antich on the  situation in Cuba and Venezuela. Ochoa Antich visited Havana  four months ago as part of the consulting mechanism that exists  between the foreign ministries of the two nations.    On the approximately $45 million debt that Havana has with  Caracas, Lage reiterated his government's willingness to find a  solution to meet this commitment.    Lage said: Currently our economic conditions are difficult.  It is difficult for us to cancel this debt soon; however,  together we could find -- in a spirit of understanding and  cooperation -- formulas that will allow Cuba to slowly pay off  its debt.    Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo, Venezuelan ambassador to Cuba, and  Norberto Hernandez Curbelo, Cuban ambassador to Venezuela, also  participated in the discussions.     "

The ministry admitted a tendency of dangerous waste imports  but said it prepares measures to prevent the threat.    According to the Greenpeace report, there have been 96  attempts to bring to Russia 34 million tones of waste within six  years. Specialists believe these were mere intentions.    In the words of the ministry, the Russian procedure of  industrial waste imports and exports ``prevents imports of large  batches of dangerous waste to Russia.'' The Russian Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations issues licenses and the Russian state  customs committee controls the waste imports. A license is  issued on coordination with the environment ministry; the latter  provide for a corresponding examination.    The procedure is obligatory for all, and its violation  entails administrative and criminal responsibility.    According to the ministry, territorial environmental bodies  have rejected the overwhelming majority of proposals of Western  firms and their Russian mediators on the basis of expert  conclusions. In 1992-1993 they coordinated licenses on imports  of small batches of industrial waste, as a rule, for research  purposes.    In order to prevent illegal attempts of dangerous waste  imports, the ministry works in close contact with the  law-enforcement and environment bodies of several states.     "

STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      About 25 warehouse workers demonstrated in front of the North Hollywood  residence of Roy Disney Tuesday, demanding that he order one of his subsidiary  companies to negotiate with employees over wages and union representation.    ""We're being ripped off,"" said Susana Menendez, a Show Industries/Music Plus  worker who marched in front of the house on Arcola Avenue.    ""They think because we're Latino that they can do anything to us.""    No one answered the bell at the Disney residence and representatives of Show  Industries could not be reached for for comment.    Warehouse workers at Show Industries/Music plus voted overwhelmingly in  November to have Teamsters Union Local 598 represent them in negotiating a  labor contract, said Carrie Biggs-Adams, a labor union consultant.    But the company appealed the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, an  effort to stall talks over wages and health benefits, demonstrators contended.  Many of the protesters work for the federal minimum wage and the majority of  the 200 warehouse workers are Latino, Biggs-Adams said. Union officials said  Disney is the chairman of the board of Shamrock Holdings, which owns Show  Industries/Music Plus. ""We want him to instruct his subsidiary to sit down and  start bargaining,"" Biggs-Adams said.    As protesters cheered and whistled, Menendez used a baseball bat to burst a  brightly colored Mickey Mouse pinata that dangled from a tree in front of the  Disney residence. Pennies and Mickey Mouse Band-Aids spilled onto the concrete,  ""symbolic of the bad medical care and the low pay,"" Carrie said.

STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      About 25 warehouse workers demonstrated in front of the North Hollywood  residence of Roy Disney Tuesday, demanding that he order one of his subsidiary  companies to negotiate with employees over wages and union representation.    ""We're being ripped off,"" said Susana Menendez, a Show Industries/Music Plus  worker who marched in front of the house on Arcola Avenue.    ""They think because we're Latino that they can do anything to us.""    No one answered the bell at the Disney residence and representatives of Show  Industries could not be reached for for comment.    Warehouse workers at Show Industries/Music plus voted overwhelmingly in  November to have Teamsters Union Local 598 represent them in negotiating a  labor contract, said Carrie Biggs-Adams, a labor union consultant.    But the company appealed the vote to the National Labor Relations Board, an  effort to stall talks over wages and health benefits, demonstrators contended.  Many of the protesters work for the federal minimum wage and the majority of  the 200 warehouse workers are Latino, Biggs-Adams said. Union officials said  Disney is the chairman of the board of Shamrock Holdings, which owns Show  Industries/Music Plus. ""We want him to instruct his subsidiary to sit down and  start bargaining,"" Biggs-Adams said.    As protesters cheered and whistled, Menendez used a baseball bat to burst a  brightly colored Mickey Mouse pinata that dangled from a tree in front of the  Disney residence. Pennies and Mickey Mouse Band-Aids spilled onto the concrete,  ""symbolic of the bad medical care and the low pay,"" Carrie said.

Its mechanics geared in the realm of action and not words,  the new policy does not mean that Iraqi diplomacy has downgraded  its efforts toward the international organization, especially as  Iraqi delegations abroad have adopted quiet diplomacy and on the  spot decisionmaking in bilateral relations. This is done in the  context of a political reality that takes into consideration the  mode of conduct of international relations and American  strategic pressures through the Security Council and its bodies  like the special commission and others. That means that Iraqi  diplomatic activity has to deal with the special circumstances  that have formed and continue to form obstacles and limitations  that affect international bodies, countries, and organizations,  attempting thereby to deliver these countries and organizations  from consequences that might arise against them through American  pressure.    Iraqi diplomatic activity has not been limited to  dispatching  delegations, but has included steps to reinvigorate the foreign  service and to support its embassy employees in European  countries. Diplomatic cadres have begun their travel to those  countries after ministerial orders were issued to transfer them  there.    According to its custom, Baghdad remains the hub of economic  and political activity. No day passes without a delegation, or  perhaps more than one, making the rounds of ministerial  buildings, especially the foreign, petroleum, trade, and  industry ministries. Some employees of these ministries are  attempting to shroud the delegations and their nationalities in  secrecy. However, it is clear that in addition to Asian  countries, most of the European delegations belong to France and  Russia.    No one can positively say that these delegations were unable  to reach agreements or, at least, common understandings to  respond to mutual interests in a manner that is in accordance  with the nature of the international situation that is not  applicable to Iraq alone, after it came to apply to other  countries. It has become a restraint on their freedom to conduct  their trade policies.    In order to overcome American surveillance, some countries  have resorted to sending unofficial delegations headed by a  former minister, or a member of parliament or presidents of  chambers of commerce and industry in their own countries.    These delegations are often amazed by Iraqi negotiators whom  they expect to be ""agreeable"" to enormous concessions which are  usually called political or circumstancial concessions. However,  they are confronted by sound commercial terms, which leave their  adversaries with no option but to offer concessions themselves.    It is clear to the observer that current Iraqi diplomatic  activity is proceeding with studied steps and limited goals. It  has temporarily shelved wishful thinking and has adopted a  realistic policy in practical steps. The February visits point  to this. A delegation to Geneva to take part in a conference on  human rights and disarmamemt was led by the foreign minister,  Muhammed Sa'id al-Sahhaf. Tehran witnessed bilateral meetings  between Iraqi and Iranian delegations. The assistant foreign  minister, Sa'ad Faysal, led the Iraqi delegation. Up to the time  of writing, Assistant Minister Dr. Riyad al-Qaysi is still in  Paris conducting negotiations that, apparently, are not limited  to trade and legal matters only, but cross over to political  matters too. No doubt, they are focused on bilateral relations,  which are witnessing improvements in numerous areas.    Diplomatic activity did not cease with the visits of last  February. The current month of March will witness activities  that are intended to pave the way for the creation of a  non-hostile atmosphere for any new step that aims to break the  severity of the embargo, even partially, during the coming  Security Council deate. It is expected that Deputy Prime  Minister Tariq 'Aziz will arrive in New York to begin a series  of meetings. If no official communique or notice of the visit  and its date are issued by now, then it is expected that the  time for the arrival of Mr. 'Aziz in New York will be the end of  the month.    Observers expect the visit to have tangible positive results  that will be the basis for realistic diplomatic relations that  Iraq will be able to establish in various ways. The most  important first step is the invigoration of bilateral relations  with some European countries and the neighboring countries of  the region. Then there is the positive cooperation with the  organs of the international organization in such a manner as to  frustrate any pretext that might be exploited under diplomatic  cover to extend the duration of the embargo. Then there is  placing the United Nations in such a position as to make it far  from simple for it to bind the articles of the American  political resolution with a legal and legitimate cover.     "

The Catholic Institute for International Relations said in a report* on the regime that the millions of tonnes of subsidised sugar the EU exported each year depressed world prices and deprived producers in developing countries of badly-needed foreign exchange. It urged the EU to phase out price support for beet production that exceeds domestic demand, compensating farmers for loss of revenue through other payments, for example linked to environmentally-friendly farming. The European Commission is due to unveil proposals for regime's reform in the next few weeks. The charity said that the Uruguay Round trade deal driving the reforms would do little to raise world prices and help developing nations. A fall in EU sugar exports of about 250,000 tonnes at most would be 'a drop in the ocean' compared with its exports of 5.7m tonnes last year and would unlikely raise world prices by more than 0.5 per cent. But cuts in EU support prices triggered by the Gatt requirement to reduce subsidised exports would have a disproportionate impact on former colonies which have preferential trade agreements with the EU under the Lome convention. 'For the high-cost ACP producers of the Caribbean, even a small price fall would have serious consequences,' it said. *Sugar: Europe's bittersweet policies.

This statute specifies a set of measures controlling  exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems  (ballistic missiles, space-launch vehicles and research  rockets), remotely piloted vehicles (cruise missiles,  radio-controlled target drones and radio-controlled  reconnaissance aircraft) capable of delivering a payload a  distance of 300 km and more, and equipment, materials, and  technology that could be used in their manufacture and also  special equipment intended for the preparation and launch of the  said missiles and remotely piloted vehicles (hereinafter called  goods and services used for missile manufacture).    2. Exports (transfers, exchanges) from the Russian  Federation  of goods and services used in the manufacture of missiles shall  be controlled in order to counteract the proliferation of  missile equipment and technology that could facilitate the  manufacture or acquisition of missile systems capable of  delivering weapons of mass destruction and also the manufacture  or acquisition of the production capacity for such systems and  encompasses all types of foreign economic activity (other than  imports), including production and ST relations, coastal and  border trade, commodity-exchange transactions, and the  demonstration of exhibits at international exhibitions and fairs.    3. It is not the purpose of the statute to put obstacles in  the way of national space programs or international cooperation  in such programs, except in the instances where their  realization could facilitate the manufacture of systems for the  delivery of weapons of mass destruction.    4. The procedure for control of exports from the Russian  Federation of goods and services used in the manufacture of  missiles specifies:    the preparation and issue of findings concerning the  possibility of exports (transfers, exchanges) of goods and  services applied in the manufacture of missiles enumerated in  the List of Equipment, Materials, and Technology Used in the  Manufacture of Missile Weapons Whose Exports Are Controlled and  Realized by License (hereinafter called the List) approved by  Directive No. 20-rp of the president of the Russian Federation  on 11 January 1993 (in the 19 November 1993 version of Directive  No. 744-rp of the president of the Russian Federation);    the licensing and customs formalization of the exports  (transfers, exchanges) of goods and services applied in missile  manufacture.    5. The List shall consist of two categories (parts).    Category I shall include the complete rocket systems capable  of delivering a payload weighing no less than 500 kg a distance  of 300 km and more and the equipment and technology that are  most significant in the manufacture of missile weapons, exports  of which are, as a rule, banned.    Category II shall include complete rocket systems that are  capable of delivering a payload a distance of 300 km and more,  but which are not part of the systems specified in Category I,  and the material, equipment, and technology used in the  manufacture of missile weapons that are exported by license.    6. Exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems  and goods and services included in categories I and II of the  List and also of all missiles or remotely piloted vehicles shall  be prohibited if there is reason to believe that they are  intended for use as a system for the delivery of weapons of mass  destruction.    In the consideration of the applications specified in Clause  8 of this statute for the issue of findings on the possibility  of exports (transfers, exchanges) of complete rocket systems and  remotely piloted vehicles pertaining to Category II, and also  the equipment, materials, and technology used in the said  systems, account shall be taken of the possibility of a swap of  distance for payload weight, as a result of which they would  pertain to Category I.    In the specific instances where equipment pertaining to  Category I could in accordance with note 2 of the List be  specified for export (transfer, exchange) in the procedure  established for materials, equipment, and technology pertaining  to Category II, the exporter must comply with the conditions  specified in Clause 7 of this statute.    Exports of specially designed production capacity intended  for the development and production of complete rocket systems  and the equipment (products) contained in Category I of the List  shall be prohibited, except in the instances allowed in  accordance with the international missile technology control  regime.    7.

In response to an April 7 letter from the Taiwan-based  Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), ARATS said that Taiwan  Affairs Office of China's State Council had already made clear  its stand on the matter and on the handling of the boat fire  tragedy.    The boat disaster claimed 32 lives, including 24 Taiwanese  tourists, on Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province on March 31.    ARATS said in its letter of reply that Taiwan compatriots  coming to the Mainland to visit relatives, travel, for  investment or other activities, have their personal safety and  property protected by the law.    The Mainland departments concerned are doing all they can to  find out the cause of the incident, according to the letter.    It urged SEF to handle the matter in a rational and  cool-minded manner, so as to avoid a setback in relations  between the two associations and the two sides of the straits.    It said that there had been several incidents involving the  loss of lives and property of Mainland compatriots and Taiwan  compatriots contemporaneous with past contacts between Taiwan  and the Mainland. ARATS has been following the matter closely  and is prepared for talks on the matter after necessary  preparations.    ARATS said it was willing to listen to the opinions of SEF  and will forward them to the Mainland departments concerned.     "

But Turkish invasions were always timed to coincide with our  instability, whether in the government, economy, or when our  territorial integrity was at risk. This time, however, the  avalanche from across the sea came not to finish us off but to  support us. Obviously, in their own interest.    According to UNIAN (Ukrainian Information Agency),  agreements  signed during the visit covered cooperation in international  cartage and tourism, while soon to be signed accords will  encompass mutual investments, aviation, and oil deliveries. The  Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has indicated that Turkey  has plans to enter the Ukrainian market on a larger scale,  particularly in the area of foodstuffs, textiles, clothing,  cellulose and paper products, and leather goods. In turn, Turkey  is interested in acquiring Ukrainian metallurgical products, as  well as airplanes, railways cars, ships, and buses.    However, statistics show that Ukrainian-Turkish  rapprochement  needs to overcome some economic realities. Turkey had been the  biggest consumer of Ukrainian products in the Black Sea-Middle  East region at the time of Ukrainian declaration of  independence, but the volume of goods purchased from Ukraine  fell from US$323 million in 1992 to US$185 million in 1993.  Concomitantly, Turkish exports to Ukraine fell to US$18.5  million in 1993, while Iranian exports came to US$490 million.  Finally, Ukrainian corporations find it advantageous to register  in Greek-held part of Cyprus or in Lebanon where the tax climate  is more favorable than in Turkey.    The brightest spot in Ukrainian-Turkish relationship  pertains  to the Black Sea Economic Community (BSEC) initiative, although  the Russian and Greek delegations are attempting to create  roadblocks. Nevertheless, as soon as the new parliament replaces  Ivan Plyushch as the speaker, which seems certain, then a  pro-Russian head of the Ukrainian delegation may be appointed to  the BSEC Interparliamentary Assembly and even this bright spot  may dim perceptibly.    Crimea is an area of shared concerns between Ukraine and  Turkey. Kravchuk has already received assurances of support for  forceful action from Europe if necessary. At least that was the  impression gained from the visit of the British Defense Minister  Douglas Herd [sic], and the outcome of the Paris conference on  peace in Europe held a week ago. President Demirel's and prime  minister Chiler's concerns for the Tartars are driven by the  fact that if they fail to act militant muslims, whose power has  been growing in Turkey, may take the initiative.    The Turkish president insisted on maximum concessions from  Kravchuk for the Ukrainian followers of Allah. Demirel spoke for  30 minutes with Mustafa Jemilev, the speaker of the Crimean  Tartar Mejlis. The Tartar leader secured verbal assurances from  the Turkish leader and the latter from the Ukrainian president.  Turkey has proposed a tried-and-true educational approach that  has worked in Central Asia and Azerbaijan. This includes  creation in Crimea a network of schools with English and Turkish  as the languages of instruction--not just for Tartars but for  everyone--and increasing the number of Tartars studying at  Turkish colleges and universities from 30 to 300. Access to  Turkey for Tartars will also be eased. In addition, Demirel  promised to assume part of the costs of Tartar relocation to  Crimea. Naturally, Turkey is interested in using Crimea as a  loyal outpost in Eastern Europe. For Kiev, this is an attractive  alternative to a Russian enclave. Unlike Russia, Turkey has no  pretensions on the Ukrainian fleet and has no insane ideas to  make Crimea one of its own provinces.    Both presidents agreed that every attempt should be made to  avoid forceful actions in Crimea, whether in the form of an  energy embargo, a demand for three billion dollar debt  settlement as proposed by Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, or the use of air  power. Nevertheless, Demirel clearly indicated Turkey's  readiness to become an ally in protecting Ukrainian national  interests. On the other hand, the Turkish president understands  that Ukraine has no choice but to accept Turkish support on  Turkish conditions. This applies particularly to the Tartar  question and Turkish exports.    Other ramifications are that Ukraine may become involved in  Turkish problems. Turkey has been hit hard by the sanctions  against Iraq since Turkey is the primary re-exported of Iraqi  oil. These sanction were extended by Security Council in the  April-May session. The recent Turkish proposal for a pipeline  from Turkey through Ukraine into Europe has to seen in the Iraqi  context.    Then there is the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Turkey  values Ukraine's opposition to various ""peacekeeping forces"" in  the CIS and to growing Russian influence in the Transcaucasus.  Finally, there is need for a joint position on the conflict in  Yugoslavia, again involving sanctions. Ukraine wants Danube to  be opened up fully to navigation and Ankara favors strict  isolation of Serbia. Demirel feels that if he agrees to joint  control of Crimea with Kravchuk, common interests will force  Ukraine to dance to the Turkish tune.     "

There,  Berisha attended the natives' ritual and honored the tomb of  Princess Masuri.    After this visit, the president left Langkawi and started  for  Brunei on an official visit. As soon as he arrived, Berisha was  received by the sultan of Brunei, His Majesty Sir Hassanal  Bolkiah at an audience at the King's Palace. After a short  meeting with the delegation members, President Berisha and his  majesty held close talks for 30 minutes. The meeting discussed  the relations between both countries, their expansion, the  support that Brunei may give to Albania to set up the  infrastructure, and projects aimed at this goal. His majesty,  the sultan of Brunei assessed Albania's achievements highly,  assessed its stabilizing role and its realistic contribution to  the situation in the region, and guaranteed the president his  support.    This evening, the Brunei foreign minister will host a dinner  to honor President Berisha, to which he has invited the highest  personalities of the political life in Brunei as well  representatives of the diplomatic corps accredited here.

Deposed monarchs the world over will be watching with interest the surprise visit to Greece by former King Constantine and his family. The king, who lost his throne in 1967, has stooped to employing a big international public relations company to publicise the symbolism of his return. Judging by the good turn-out for the recent funeral of King Baudouin of the Belgians, the royalty business is doing rather well at the moment and if an ex-king is to make a come-back now is as good a time as any. Burson-Marsteller, which employs some of the world's top spin doctors, has been primed to supply media-friendly answers to the most obvious questions about the ex-king's return to Greece. Hence, the only official significance of the timing of the visit is that it coincides with some of the king's children finishing university and other teaching jobs. As to who is paying for the expedition, all B-M is prepared to disclose is that the royal family are on board a motorboat chartered from a Greek company through a British brokerage firm and are guests of the Prince of Hanover. No mention of the wealthy Greek shipping families who frequent the king's off-shore court in London's Hampstead and would dearly love a return of their monarch. Nor for that matter is there any mention that Constantine is returning to Greece when the government is looking particularly wobbly. If B-M does a good job for Constantine there could be plenty more out-of-work monarchs knocking on its door.   Companies:-  Burson-Marsteller.   Countries:-  GRZ  Greece, EC.

0,FT934-16329 ,"FT934-16329 _AN-DJGCLAA9FT 931007   FT  07 OCT 93 / Australia seeks a bargain at work: Nikki Tait on planned labour reforms expected to provoke an outcry      By NIKKI TAIT   AUSTRALIA'S Labor government, re-elected last March, may think it has problems with a stalled budget, but its parliamentary battles could just be starting. For next on the agenda is labour market reform legislation, and a deal negotiated this week between the government of prime minister Paul Keating and the nation's trade unions seems certain to provoke maximum outcry. Full details of the industrial relations reform package have not been made public yet. The government-union agreement - reached late on Tuesday - still requires formal ratification by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which it will probably get tomorrow. On the government's side, Mr Laurie Brereton, the industrial relations minister, has yet to sell the proposals to his own Labor party caucus. But assuming no big obstacles emerge in either case, the substance of the package is fairly clear - so much so that employers' organisations are already limbering up for the fight. 'This is 95 per cent an ACTU agenda, 5 per cent a government agenda and zero per cent an employer agenda,' said the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday. The package will almost certainly contain three elements. The first will centre on an extension of 'devolved' wage bargaining at workplace level. Australian wages have long been set by a complex structure of federal and state commissions, paying little attention to individual employers' circumstances. But, as the country's protectionist tariff barriers have come down and a more 'deregulated' economy has been encouraged, this system has looked increasingly untenable. Over the past few years, therefore, Australia has been edging towards workplace-based bargaining. But the changes have been slow in coming. At present, there are only about 1,150 'enterprise' agreements, covering about 11 per cent of the workforce. At first the government hoped to boost the use of enterprise bargaining by making it an option for the 70 per cent of private sector workers who do not belong to unions. At present, only unions may make certified enterprise agreements. But elements within Australia's union movement - still strong but suffering from declining membership - fought a rearguard action. For months, negotiations between the ACTU and the government stalled. What emerged this week was a compromise. Non-union workers would be able to make enterprise deals through the use of flexibility clauses incorporated into centralised wage awards. But unions would be able to object to such deals through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the federal arbitration body. Employers' representatives maintain that such a set-up would be unworkable. Although unions would have no power of veto over non-union agreements, the ACCI argues that their ability to obstruct and question deals, through the AIRC, would be enough to deter employers. It is, claims Bryan Noakes, ACCI executive director in Melbourne, an 'effective veto'. The second element likely to be in the reform package would be just as contentious. The government is likely to propose significant changes to sanctions against workers who take industrial action. For a start, the right to strike would be enshrined in law and employers would lose the right to dismiss employees who engaged in industrial action. Employers who were victims of secondary action could have to wait for three days - and would need permission from the AIRC - before seeking legal redress. Most of this would be welcome to a union movement that knows it will not have a Labor government in power for ever and is keen to get protections written into law. The third element likely to be in the package is beefing up the protection of minimum entitlements, including wages, equal pay, parental leave and termination conditions, for all workers, and giving the AIRC an enhanced role in the process. A new federal court - the Industrial Relations Court of Australia - could also be created to take over the industrial relations jurisdiction. These measures would be aimed in part at increasing the federal 'safety net' should individual states choose to pursue more radical labour market policies. Last year, for example, a new conservative government in Victoria introduced industrial relations changes that reduced workers' entitlements and provoked a rash of labour protests. Although the government holds sway in the House of Representatives, it needs the support of minority parties - the Green Party and the Democrats - to get legislation through the Senate. The two Green senators are an unknown quantity but the Democrats have already raised some concerns. They have said they need to see more detail on enterprise bargaining before making a decision. 'We are going to be looking at chapter and verse of how the non-union arrangements are arrived at and none of that detail has yet been spelled out. I think it will take another month to make this legislation fit to hit the floor,' their industrial relations spokesman said yesterday.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.

In a deal signed in Washington yesterday, the US agreed to lift trade sanctions it imposed last year to punish China for the missile technology exports. In exchange, China promised to stop all exports of missiles that can carry a payload of more than 500kg further than 300km. Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the deal was a 'global and verifiable ban' on all Chinese exports of missiles classified as Category One under the Missile Technology Control Regime, which sets the 500kg and 300km limits. The US originally imposed sanctions on China a year ago after complaining that China had violated the MTCR by selling Pakistan technology for M-11 missiles. China has always insisted that it did not violate the MTCR, and Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister, repeated that position yesterday. 'China does not engage in proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including missiles outside the MTCR regime,' he said. Some of the discussion hinged on whether the M-11, whose official range is slightly less than 300km, was covered by the MTCR. US officials said its capability placed it within MTCR guidelines, and see the missile as a proliferation threat because of its potential to carry nuclear warheads. The US sanctions prohibited the granting of export licences to sell China advanced electronics, space and aircraft systems worth an estimated Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m a year. Relations between China and the US have improved since President Bill Clinton in May abandoned efforts to link China's trading privileges to human rights.

The Clinton administration, by formally announcing its adherence to this interpretation, renounced efforts to develop, test or deploy sea-based, air-based, space-based or mobile land-based ABM systems. The treaty was designed to prevent nuclear escalation by denying the US or the Soviet Union the temptation to launch a first strike in the belief that it could survive retaliation. President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s had sought to argue that the ABM treaty did not prohibit development of space-based defences, a key component of Mr Reagan's 'Star Wars' strategic defence initiative. Mr Thomas Graham, acting director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, announced the position in a letter to Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who welcomed the return to the traditional interpretation. 'This wise decision closes, on a high note, a sad chapter in US arms control treaty relationships and in the relationship between the US Senate and the executive branch,' said Mr Pell. He added that strict adherence to the treaty would help persuade Ukraine to eliminate its nuclear weapons, and to ensure Russian ratification of the Start II missile reduction treaty. The Clinton administration has already renamed the SDI programme the ballistic missile defence organisation. Funding has remained relatively high but has been shifted away from programmes designed to defend against strategic nuclear missiles, and towards tactical defences.

[Words indistinct] out a ""primary framework"" for resolving  the three issues at hand, said negotiators from the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF) and Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the two non-official organizations  authorized by Taipei and the mainland to handle cross-strait  exchanges.    The three issues are the repatriation of mainland hijackers,  the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and  cross-strait fishing disputes. SEF Vice Chairman Chiao Jen-ho  and ARATS vice chairman Tang Shubei at the end of their Beijing  talks in February claimed to have reached a ""consensus"" on the  issues and hoped that draft agreements would be signed at the  current round of talks.    According to Taipei negotiators, Beijing is reluctant to pay  the costs of repatriating the illegal mainland immigrants and  recompensing Taipei for their stay in Taiwan -- a cost the  Taiwan side has estimated to be NT$1 [new Taiwan dollars]  billion (about U.S.$38 million).    In addition, the mainland has disagreed with Taiwan's  suggested wording of the draft agreement on the repatriation of  hijackers: ""Neither side has to return a hijacker who is a  citizen of that country."" Since last April, 11 mainland  passenger planes have been hijacked to Taiwan.    In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] said the  mainland side was to blame for the lack of progress during  Friday's talks. ""The mainland side is even tougher than  before,"" MAC spokesman Kao Kung- lien said.     "

Baker III insisted Wednesday that the Bush  Administration must be free to attack Iraq without getting specific approval  from Capitol Hill, although he promised to consult frequently with  congressional leaders over U.S. policy in the Persian Gulf.    ""Our chances of settling (the gulf crisis) without resort to the use of force  will be much improved if the opposition knows that we have got (military power)  there and that we would not be reluctant to use it,"" Baker told the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee.    But most members of the committee, long one of the most dovish in Congress,  made it clear that they oppose the use of military power except in response to  new aggression from Iraq.    Going far beyond the requirements of the Vietnam-era War Powers Resolution,  several lawmakers said the Administration should not consider offensive action  without asking Congress for a formal declaration of war.    Committee members also expressed alarm at the prospect that President Bush  might initiate combat during the 10-week congressional recess expected to begin  later this month.    ""I, for one, am not giving advance approval for any unilateral U.S. military  action,"" said Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell (D-R.I.).    In an interview released Wednesday, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de  Cuellar also discussed the military option. The German weekly magazine Stern  quoted him as saying that if U.N.-imposed economic sanctions against Iraq do  not work, military action ""would be perfectly legitimate"" -- should the U.N.  Security Council so decide.    Baker told the Senate committee that the Administration is prepared to keep  congressional leaders informed probably in secret. But he said it would be a  big mistake to stage the sort of full-scale debate that would be required  before Congress could be expected to authorize military action. That sort of  discussion would tip off Iraqi President Saddam Hussein about U.S. operational  plans, he added.    ""You are not going to surprise Saddam Hussein; you are going to surprise the  American people,"" Sen. Terry Sanford (D-N.C.) said. ""I understand about  operational security.

Baker responded: ""If we have a big, long debate up here about whether -- we're  going to have to talk about where and if and what with and who with.""    He also said the Administration objects to creating a special congressional  committee to oversee the Administration's gulf policy during the recess on  Capitol Hill.    ""It's pretty hard for me to say that the President would not, under any  circumstances, take any action or do anything that he, as commander in chief,  felt was necessary to protect American citizens, for instance, without first  having some sort of consultation procedure or process formally in place,"" Baker  said.    ""It's hard for you to give us a blank check,"" he said. ""We know that. But we  can't give you one either.""    At the same time, Baker said the Administration may soon return to the U.N.  Security Council to seek authorization for the use of force. But he said that  such a move would involve stand-by approval only -- in effect, the sort of  blank check he conceded that the Administration cannot get from Congress.    ""We would be looking for authority to move in the future, if necessary,"" he  said.    However, he said, Washington would resist any effort to put under U.N. command  the multinational force in the gulf. He said that, although 25 nations have  committed units to the force, the U.S. contingent is by far the largest.    ""We are very concerned about putting the lives of our American men and women  over there in the hands of someone other than an American military commander,""  Baker said.    On related topics:    Baker acknowledged that the run-up in the price of oil since the start of the  crisis has resulted in windfall profits to Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf  oil producers far in excess of the amount that they have agreed to contribute  to the U.S.-sponsored coalition against Iraq. But he said he will seek  additional ""burden-sharing"" payments if the crisis continues into 1991.    He said that if Hussein withdraws peacefully from Kuwait and thus keeps his  formidable army intact, the Administration will ask the U.N.

He thanked the Polish  president for such a prompt recognition of the sovereignty of  the republics of the former Soviet Union.    The Moldovan minister assured Lech Walesa that Moldova would  not depart from the road of reforms which would be continued  irrespective of the election results.    The foreign ministers of Poland and Moldova, Andrzej  Olechowski and Ion Botnaru, respectively, presented to the  president plans of future cooperation between the two countries.

The coalition of the opposition Liberal and National parties yesterday unveiled a blueprint of a radical industrial relations policy which, if implemented, would give employees and employers the right to negotiate directly with each other, with or without union involvement. All conditions will be up for negotiation, except for four minimum guarantees: minimum hourly rates for adult and youth workers, four weeks' annual leave, two weeks non-cumulative sick leave and 12 months unpaid maternity leave. Under the existing centralised wage-fixing system, about 80 per cent of the Australian work force, whether union members or not, are covered by minimum employment standards agreed by the unions, the employers and the government through the Industrial Relations Commission. The ruling Labor Party considers industrial relations policy as another major battleground for federal elections set for the middle of next year. The opposition's intention to introduce a goods and services tax has already provided fodder for initial campaigning. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, branded the opposition a 'prices up and wages down' party. 'First they want to tax everything you can shoot with a 15 per cent goods and services tax, and now they want to cut your pay,' he said. Reaction by unions and business was predictable. Unions said the policy would leave workers with only two choices: take the employers' conditions or take the sack. Business tentatively welcomed the policy as a significant step towards a more sensible wages system.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma  Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen, by I.  Rotar; place and date not given: ""Become Our Satellites or  Perish]""    [Text]    That is the view held by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the  State Duma Comittee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen.    Revelations    [Zatulin] I am an admirer of the empire if it is understood  as imperial peace. I am not a proponent of ultranationalist  empires and regard that concept as a means for the maintenance  of peace. There is such a concept as sphere of influence, sphere  of vital interest, regardless of whether you are a democrat or  not. A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere  of influence of a big power. A vivid example of that is the  economic blossoming of postwar Japan when it was under the aegis  of the U.S.A. The policy in the CIS is the domestic policy of  Russia whether that offends anyone or not. We must win our  special role in the near abroad.    [Rotar] Do you recognize the territorial integrity of  countries of the near abroad?    [Zatulin] It is impossible to be pulling chestnuts out of  the  fire for others and recognize the territorial integrity of  states which never existed within those borders. With all due  respect for those states, many of them are destined to become  our satellites or perish and I recognize their territorial  integrity right up to that degree.    [Rotar] What meaning do you attach to the concept of a  satellite?    [Zatulin] Countries of the near abroad must conclude special  agreements establishing their special relations with Russia.  That is neither relations within the framework of the USSR nor  is it simply membership in the CIS the effectiveness of which is  under question. Our special relations must deal primarily with  the economy and the problem of national minorities living in  those states. Russia must assume the protection of Russians  living in the near abroad. If the national minorities live in  compact groups, they must be granted autonomy--the state must  become a federation. The special status of regions populated by  national minorities must be backed up with guarantees from  Moscow.    [Rotar] Could you indicate specifically which of the  countries in the near abroad should have autonomies?    [Zatulin] Georgia--Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moldova--the  Dniester Region and Gagaus. Kazakhstan--northern part of the  republic. Ukraine--eastern regions and Crimea.    [Rotar] How do you view the political situation in Georgia?    [Zatulin] The viewpoint that everyone, except the Georgians,  is responsible for its troubles is still prevalent in Georgia.  Recently, for instance, we had a meeting with a Georgian  parliamentary delegation and one of its members consistently  stressed that Russia must grant every concession since Georgia  made a sacrifice by joining the CIS. This is some kind of a  hypertrophied concept of reality. Let us begin with the fact  that Russia helped the current leader of Georgia win in the most  acute domestic confrontation with the, by the way, legal,  president Eduard Gamsakhurdia. That gave Shevardnadze a great  advantage (I am not even going to mention that Russia saved him  from death in Abkhazia). Russia confirmed the territorial  integrity of Georgia whereas in reality it does not exist,  helped the republic economically, and in return received only  the entry of that state into the CIS which thus far is a rather  amorphous formation.    [Rotar] In your opinion what future awaits Ukraine?    [Zatulin] This is a complicated question. I believe that  here  there are fewer chances than in Moldova and Georgia that  objective realities will be recognized. One political wing  (mainly those who came from Western Ukraine) is adamantly  dreaming of participation in all foreign political blocs hostile  to Russia and visualizes the only possibility for existence of  an independent Ukrainian state to be with the support of the  enemies of Russia. But I am still hoping that the resolution of  the problem will be the same as in Moldova and Georgia: alliance  with Russia and a special status reinforced with guarantees by  Moscow for eastern regions and Crimea. This is the only  relatively peaceful outcome. The other variant means the  disintegration of Ukraine.    [Rotar] Today Russian soldiers are dying in Tajikistan. One  of the more widespread explanations of the reason for  nonwithdrawal of the Russian army from that country consists is  that Russia has no funds for the maintenance of a new border  region. But even today Moscow is compelled to invest significant  sums in that country. Tajikistan may turn into a bottomless pit  for Russian money.    [Zatulin] Any expenditure is justified to preserve that  outpost.    [Rotar] Do you have disagreements with the Russian MID  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]?    [Zatulin] After December, you understand what I am referring  to, the Russian MID sharply changed its positions and our  official positions are practically the same. It is true, I do  lack confidence that declarations of the Russian MID will be  implemented in practice.     "

Prime Minister Paul Keating is due to announce a new ministerial line-up later today. This is in response the recent departures of Ms Ros Kelly, the former minister for sport, environment and territories, and Mr Alan Griffiths, the previous industry minister. Some elements of their portfolios have already been re-allocated on a permanent basis, but a number of ministerial responsibilities have been 'warehoused' (put on hold). This is partly in expectation of the arrival of the former Western Australian premier, Ms Carmen Lawrence, in Canberra. She won a federal seat in a recent by-election and entered parliament this week. Ms Lawrence had been widely-tipped to take over the environment portfolio, although talk of her receiving Senator Richardson's health responsibilities had also been mooted before the latest resignation rumours surfaced. Relations between Mr Keating and Senator Richardson have been strained lately, following a public dispute over whether the Medicare levy should be raised significantly to fund new programmes. If Senator Richardson does depart, he will be the fourth senior government minister to step down in as many months. Mr John Dawkins, the former treasurer, left politics altogether just before Christmas. Mr Griffiths resigned in January, amid allegations that party funds had been used in the 'Above the Line' sandwich shop, a private business venture. Ms Ros Kelly departed after it was claimed a sports grant programme favoured marginal Labor electorates. Both Ms Kelly and Mr Griffiths maintained that they had done nothing wrong.

Relations between China and Mongolia are on the surface  good,  following a visit to Mongolia in April by Chinese Premier Li  Peng to sign a new Sino-Mongolian friendship pact.    But the document warns that China should move to head off  the  development of a Pan-Mongolian ideology because it could  threaten China's territorial integrity.    The document was published in October by a public research  institute specializing in Northeast Asian affairs in China's  Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region.    Mongolia is home to some 2.1 million Mongols, but the  autonomous region has 4.8 million, while a further 300,000 are  in Russia.    The document cites as symptomatic of the problem the first  world conference of Mongolian peoples, held in the Mongolian  capital of Ulaanbaatar in September last year.    It says the conference strengthened Pan-Mongolianism and  says  that ""this fundamental problem which is related to the  partitioning of China cannot be ignored.""    Noting that organizers of the conference visited the U.S.  prior to the forum, the document said ""the U.S. is extending  its evil influence into the Mongolian plateau and is trying in  the background to stab China with a sword it calls democracy.""    The document also says Mongolian unification has supporters  in Japan.    It suggests that China should prepare for a lengthy struggle  and warns of the growth of ethnic movements in the former Soviet  Union.     "

He said emphatically, among other things, that ""although  Europe will be integrated, the United States will still  strengthen its relationship with Europe. For this reason, the  United States hopes to see an even more powerful Europe. A  powerful Europe is the prerequisite for promoting this  integration, so the United States will give positive support to  it. Given the reduction of U.S. forces in Europe, the United  States will still take the security in Europe very seriously.""    In fact, there is nothing new in these remarks. The United  States always pays serious attention to Europe. Even though  there are signs that the goal of U.S. economic development has  been ""shifted from Europe to Asia"" owing to the economic  slowdown in Europe and the United States itself, yet this does  not mean that it has ceased to attach importance to Europe.  Now, Clinton sang the old tune at the French National Assembly  again, which reflects that the relationship of allies between  Europe and the United States has not come to an end. Instead,  taking the 50th anniversary of the D-Day as a juncture, it will  begin all over again from a new starting point.    Looking Forward to the Future in Europe    Viewing the changes in Europe since the D-Day half a century  ago, people have all sorts of feelings well up in their minds.  However, it is more necessary for them to look into the future  with regard to how Europe and the United States will maintain  peace and development in Europe.    The landing on the Normandy coast in 1944 was the largest  campaign in the European history. Paris was liberated in August  that year. Seeing that not much could be done to save the  situation, Hitler committed suicide and was burnt to death in  May the next year, and then Nazi-Germany surrendered  unconditionally. At this time, the two arch-criminals who  started the war in Europe -- Mussolini (who was hanged in public  with his corpse was lashed afterward) and Hitler had come to an  ignominious end and had left their bad names that will stink  through the ages.    After the end of World War II, Western Europe was in a state  of serious devastation and numerous tasks remained to be  undertaken. The U.S. Marshall aid plan made considerable  contributions to the rejuvenation in Europe. The Coal and Steel  Union, which was the predecessor of the Common Market, was set  up in Western Europe, and was the embryonic form of an economic  integration. Under NATO's protection over the past 50 years,  Europe has advanced from a community to a political union of  today, and will ultimately move toward an integrated Europe.    It Is Difficult To Resolve the Yugoslav Issue    After the end of the Cold War in which the East and the West  confronted each other, Europe eventually headed for  reconciliation. However, new problems have cropped up again, the  most thorny one being the national dispute in the former  Yugoslavia which has bedeviled the European countries, and  which, so far, has shown no signs of a solution. This problem  also exposed the insufficient strength in Europe and tested its  inferior ability for coordination. Now there is another problem  of sending U.S. troops to Bosnia, which has exposed U.S.  intentions of establishing its own European defense beyond the  pale of NATO, and has aroused inharmonious arguments between  Europe and the United States. If the situation worsens, the two  sides will lose their mutual trust.    The Balkan region is also in a state of unrest, as Greece  and  the Republic of Macedonia, a territory of the former Yugoslavia,  are at odds with swords drawn and bows bent, and Albania and  Italy are on bad terms over disputes about illegal emigrants.  All this shows that Europe lacks strength to cope with their  internal conflicts and difficulties.    In addition, people are greatly worried about how the large  number of heavy nuclear warheads will be handled if the  turbulent situation in Ukraine worsens. What is more, Europe  has not pulled out of its economic recession at present, and the  unemployment rate remains at 13 percent, with the total number  of unemployed people (excluding those in Eastern European  Russia) reaching 30 million. Against this background, although  the United States and Europe can still be allies, yet they are  confronted with more complicated political and economic problems  than before. This is a new reality that the United States and  Europe must face.     "

The bank's board is poised to exempt itself from an air travel policy designed to curb first-class bookings, which it adopted last year, bank officials say. The board also recently backed a proposal to spend Dollars 4.7m (Pounds 3m) on a special air-conditioning system that would let directors smoke in their offices once the bank had introduced a smoke-free policy. With the World Bank's headquarters reconstruction project already Dollars 43m over budget, those close to the board say the special air-conditioner is unlikely to win approval, but the travel exemption, due to be considered next month, could. Such action could cause a fiscal backlash in the US Congress, where members are questioning spending by the World Bank and other institutions. Senator Jesse Helms, ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is delaying Senate confirmation of US alternate governors of the World Bank and four other development banks, while waiting for an air travel report from the US Treasury. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has requested reports on travel policies from the US executive directors at the institutions. The Treasury's report, expected shortly, is likely to reveal some stark contrasts among the various development banks, Clinton administration officials say. A House of Representatives sub-committee has already trimmed by Dollars 200m the administration's request for funding the US share of a capital replenishment for the World Bank's concessional loan arm. The sub-committee sent a stronger signal over its displeasure with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for lavish spending.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

This is the  first visit to Malaysia by the Vietnamese highest leader.  Following is our radio opinion on the visit and relations  between Vietnam and Malaysia.    Last year, Party Leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and  Thailand. This year, he is preparing to visit Malaysia.  Vietnamese State President Le Duc Anh will visit Indonesia  early next month.    In the last two years, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited  most countries in the region. Vietnam does respect its  relations with other regional countries, especially with the  ASEAN member countries. Furthermore, all countries in Southeast  Asia have acknowledged the cooperation for mutual benefit with  Vietnam. The British Broadcasting Corporation radio on March 17  quoted Mr. Chew Tai Soo, the Singaporean ambassador to the  United Nations, as saying that Vietnam was on the threshold of  ASEAN. Vietnam should join ASEAN and the visit to Malaysia by  party leader Do Muoi will contribute to promoting this process.    The visit will also strengthen relations between Vietnam and  Malaysia, which have achieved progress after the visit to  Malaysia by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in 1992. Two-way trade  turnover has reached $100 million. Malaysia has invested in 16  projects in Vietnam worth $95 million. Malaysian Prime Minister  Mahathir Mohamed himself has a deep sentiment towards Vietnam  and respects bilateral relations between Vietnam and Malaysia.    The visit to Malaysia by our party leader will contribute to  implementing the desire of leaders and peoples of the two  countries to consolidate and develop friendship and cooperation.     "

Huang, at a Legislative Yuan briefing session, reported that  although the protection law, made public at the end of last year  by Mainland China's State Council, seems to have upgraded the  status of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland, it does not  include concrete measures to protect Taiwan investors' business  interests and personal rights.    The newly issued investment protection law still considers  Taiwan investors ""special local investors"" subject to Mainland  China's relevant laws and regulations, Huang said.    Huang appealed to local industries to act with utmost  caution  in the face of any possible policy changes that might cause  great losses to them, given that Mainland China is undergoing an  economic transformation from a planned economy to a  market-oriented one.    Mainland China so far lacks a comprehensive law regulating  Taiwan industries' investment and normal business practices  there, let alone protecting their property rights and lives,  Huang said. In other countries, he added, foreign investors are  usually given special protection.    Taiwan investors can be fully protected in Mainland China  only when a formal and wide-ranging investment guarantee  agreement is worked out by Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation  [SEF] and Beijing's Association of Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS], he said.    The SEF and ARATS are the semi-official agents representing  Taiwan and Mainland China in cross-strait affairs in the absence  of formal contacts between Taipei and Beijing.     "

The appeal came in a 21-page memorandum from Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, and the Security Council. Pretoria asked for a UN representative to visit the country urgently to mediate between the government and ANC. Relations between the two sides have fallen to new lows after the Ciskei shooting. Mr Botha warned the government was ready to 'take steps of a coercive nature' to handle violence. UN monitors, deployed as a result of the July visit of UN envoy Cyrus Vance, are to arrive within days. As Mr Botha released the memorandum to the press, the ANC's top policy-making body, the National Working Committee, met for a second day to determine its response to the Ciskei shooting, for which it holds Pretoria responsible. The committee is understood to be split between militants who believe all negotiations with the government should be abandoned, and moderates who argue that negotiation is South Africa's only chance. Winnie Mandela, estranged wife of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, has resigned her top posts in the movement because of 'a vicious and malicious' campaign against her, Reuter reports from Johannesburg. In a statement issued late on Wednesday night, Mrs Mandela said she had resigned from the ANC's policy-making national executive committee and its women's league.

The analysis conducted by the Institute for International  Relations -- which will form the basis for the government's  security policy concept -- absolutely discounts the possibility  of the republic becoming a neutral country or of it relying  solely on its own forces and resources for its defense. The  experts also reject involvement in a defensive system made up  only of Central European states.    The advantage of joining just the WEU is, according to  diplomats, the possibility of reacting to situations that  concern only Europe. Despite this, they give priority to  incorporation into NATO, because it -- as opposed to the WEU --  offers a defense system with a functioning military structure.    According to the experts, neutrality is no longer  significant. ""Following the cessation of the bipolar world,  there is no one here to be neutral against,"" said one of the  military officials. Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec has  previously rejected neutrality. He described it as a dangerous  snare. Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has said the same thing. He  rejected neutrality as a hollow concept belonging to the realm  of third ways leading nowhere.    It is apparent from the aforementioned document -- for which  various institutions are now drafting comments -- that the  republic does not consider anyone to be an enemy a priori and  that it has no territorial or other political claims against any  state.

Knowledgeable sources in Tehran have asserted to AL-WASAT  that the Iraqi official was surprised by Iran's hard-line  approach toward attempts at normalization between Tehran and  Baghdad, unlike the previous rounds of talks held late last year  in Karachi, New York, and Baghdad.    The sources said Iran rejected a proposal by al-Faysal to  resume trade trips along the joint border ""because Iran does not  want to violate the international trade embargo"" against Iraq.    The sources added that ""trade borders, which had been open  on  humanitarian grounds and within the framework of the  international resolutions regarding the economic embargo, were  shut off completely by a direct decision issued by Ayatollah  'Ali Khamene'i, the spiritual guide of the revolution.""  Khamene'i stressed that the border shall remain closed to trade  until further notice in the wake of the killing of several  Iranian border guards during trade operations last year.    The sources said Khamene'i made this decision after  receiving  information and warnings that the U.S. Administration is about  to take ""tangible"" measures against Iran on charges of violating  the international economic embargo against Iraq.    The sources further said that the Iraqi official suggested  ""sacrificing"" the leaders of the opposition organization of  Mojahedin-e Khalq if Iran agrees to resume trade operations.  Iranian officials, who were interested several months ago in  bringing the leaders of Mojahedin-e Khalq under control,  rejected the tempting Iraqi offer because they believe the U.S.  Administration is looking for ""excuses to harass Iran"".

But the outlook for the Edinburgh meeting was simultaneously clouded by an admission from Downing Street that the prime minister has been unable so far to agree a time for pre-summit talks with French President Francois Mitterrand. Relations between the two leaders have been frosty since Mr Mitterrand criticised last month Britain's handling of its EC presidency. British officials sought to play down the significance of the apparent snub by Paris, insisting that official contacts between the two sides had established a large measure of agreement over the most prominent summit issues. As Mr Major returned from a three-day tour of European capitals, Downing Street said its latest proposals were designed to meet Denmark's demands for a dilution of its treaty commitments on defence, citizenship, interior and justice issues and monetary union. But the presidency compromise - framed in terms of a legal declaration  - would respect also the insistence of other European governments that there should be no re-opening of the treaty. Speaking on Mr Major's return from talks with Mr Poul Schluter in Copenhagen, the Danish prime minister, British officials said that the British presidency was hopeful rather than optimistic of an overall deal at the summit. They warned that the North-South division within the Community over future financing remained as wide as ever, with Spain in particular threatening to block progress on other issues if its demands for more 'cohesion' funds were blocked. Mr Major will resume his tour of capitals at the weekend.  The Financial Times   London Page 10  "

""It is a must to strictly enforce rules for air  security--from ticket sales, passenger and luggage check-in,  boarding, on-board inspection--to deal with air piracy,"" said  Chen Guangyi, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China  (CAAC).    CAAC will resolutely probe hijacking cases, punish those  responsible and take swift counter-measures. Chen told a  conference in Fuzhou, provincial capital of Fujian.    The city sits directly across the straits from Taiwan, where  many hijackers have attempted to force planes to land.    Chen also expressed hope that Taiwan authorities would  co-operate with the mainland to crack down on air piracy.    ""We are awaiting a treaty between the mainland's Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and the Taiwan's Straits  Exchanges Foundation on repatriation of hijackers"" he said.    ""Once both sides can join hands in the war against air  piracy  and force hijackers back to where they flew from, we can root  out these crimes for the safety of the travelling public.""    CAAC's anti-hijacking campaign had a direct impact last year  when officials issued a series of rules on tightening air  defence, expanded air security employment and installed more  safety check devices.    Security departments foiled six hijacking attempts, detected  45 suspects with concealed firearms or knives, and confiscated  contraband and other dangerous articles.    In a letter to the meeting, Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua  cautioned  that air security should do its utmost to prevent hijackings.     "

[Gligorov] We achieved our independence by peaceful and  legitimate means: by the referendum, a new constitution, and  democratic elections. This independence has fulfilled the  national dreams of entire generations. Our people fought for  this for 150 years. But we live in a region where there is a  war going on that led to UN sanctions against Serbia and  Montenegro, and we have had an embargo imposed on us by Greece.  These two things make it difficult for the Macedonian economy  to develop. Our major connecting routes for people, goods, and  capital have been interrupted. Our future lies in association  with the European Union.    [Vujovic] Balkans experts fear that the conflict might  spread to Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  -- FYROM].    [Gligorov] As long as there is a war in our region, there is  obviously some threat. The Kosovo problem is also a danger to  us. That is why we have called upon the United Nations to send  us observers for preventive reasons. It has since emerged just  how correct this measure was. But I would also like to point  out that we are conducting a clear-cut policy: good relations  with all our neighbors. Thanks to this policy we have hardly  any problems with Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia. We even  have very good economic and cultural relations with Bulgaria and  Albania. We used to have very good economic relations with the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which we are trying to maintain  under the embargo today. Everything will certainly be back to  normal once the war has ended and the sanctions have been lifted.    [Vujovic] Recent signals coming from Serbia are not all that  encouraging. President Slobodan Milosevic's policy is very  pro-Greek. Many Serbian politicians consider Macedonia to be  part of Serbia. Is that a real danger or are these just verbal  threats?    [Gligorov] Yes, there are such threats. The independent  state of Macedonia is a reality in spite of the Greek embargo.  I am sure that a Balkans war would break out if Serbia or  another neighbor tried to enforce their claims. And a Balkans  war was always the beginning of a world conflict. That is why  it is also in our neighbors' interests to renounce such historic  burdens.    [Vujovic] Greek-Macedonian relations are the biggest problem  today.    [Gligorov] There is no objective reason why there should be  conflicts between Greeks and Macedonians. There are no  territorial claims. Cooperation is in both countries' interest.  None of the things going on between Greece and Macedonia are in  the interests of our states. It is all just a matter of  emotions, which unfortunately play a great role in the Balkans.    [Vujovic] There have been speculations lately about  Macedonia wanting to change its flag and coat of arms. Is that  right?    [Gligorov] That is just gossip. But we are determined to  discuss all the questions with Greece and to find solutions that  are acceptable to both sides. We will talk this over in the  next few days.    [Vujovic] Many observers believe that the United States is  using Macedonia as a base in that part of the Balkans. What is  the role that the United States plays in Macedonia?    [Gligorov] There are no U.S. bases here; these are mere  speculations. We asked the United Nations to send peacekeeping  troops to Macedonia for preventive reasons. That was a good  move. Even UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali has called  Macedonia a good example, a model that the United Nations should  use in the future. Preventive measures always achieve much  better results than war does. At the beginning there were only  Scandinavian UN troops stationed in Macedonia, but, today, about  half the contingent are U.S. troops, the other half are  Scandinavians. That is it, the Americans are here only as part  of the UN peacekeeping contingent, not as U.S. Army.    [Vujovic] The Macedonian Parliament has given the go-ahead  for NATO membership. Why?    [Gligorov] It is not easy for a small country to survive  today without being part of a collective security system. The  United Nations is certainly the most important organization.  But it does not have a military structure of its own, its  possibilities are limited. NATO is the only collective security  system that is still in existence. The Partnership for Peace  offer is a real possibility for all those seeking protection  today. Our parliament's resolution is to be seen as a statement  of general orientation. Joining the Partnership for Peace would  be a first step for us that could be realized as soon as we are  a member of the CSCE.    [Vujovic] Is Greece the only country preventing Macedonia  from joining the CSCE?    [Gligorov] Yes, it is.    [Vujovic] What is your view of Austria-Macedonia relations?    [Gligorov] We have a tradition of good relations and good  economic cooperation with Austria. Austria supported our UN  membership. But Austria is still cautious in establishing full  diplomatic relations; we are still waiting for an Austrian  ambassador to come to Macedonia.     "

In a statement to AL-THAWRAH, he said that the embargo is an  expression of a tendency by the superpowers not to respect the  will of peoples and nations seeking to achieve progress. He  added that this embargo is beginning to show its negative  effects on Iraq and Cuba.    Assessing Cuban-Iraqi relations, Rodriguez said: Relations  between our two friendly countries, Cuba and Iraq, are  deep-rooted and have been continuously developing in various  fields. We believe that continuing the policy of reinforcing  relations and improving cooperation between our peoples will  serve the interests and objectives of both countries.

He claimed that a  ""malaise"" has troubled the relationship for several years ever  since German unification and Bonn's formulation of new ambitions  and cited former Foreign Minister Roland Dumas as saying that  ""it is a euphemism to say today that things are not going well  between the two countries."" This ""malaise"" and the disagreement  between the two countries stemming from the Bundesbank's  interest rate policy has given rise to a ""vaguely poisonous""  climate. As an example of the difficulties in the bilateral  relationship, Dauvergne cited Germany's ambition to have more  deputies in the European Parliament to account for its greater  population after unification. While the initiative was not  ""shocking,"" he questioned the way in which Bonn ""literally  imposed"" East German observers on the Parliament immediately  after unification. He also cited another German ambition, now  openly advocated by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of obtaining  a permament seat on the UN Security Council. Dauvergne  maintained that such moves demonstrate that the Germans now feel  ""more muscular"" and ""speak louder"" in an international context.    Dauvergne remarked that Paris has reacted negatively to the  change in Germany's foreign policy style but is at a loss as to  how to respond to Bonn's ambition to take a more assertive role  in international affairs. He maintained Bonn is assuming the  leadership in Europe because Paris has remained silent.  According to Dauvergne, since the difficult Maastricht  referendum, the French, across the political spectrum, seem to  be ""on the defensive"" and incapable of playing their traditional  role of ""inventors"" of Europe.    While expressing skepticism about Germany's intentions,  Dauvergne recommended taking steps to escape the encroaching  ""malaise"" in Franco-German relations. He commented favorably on  Dumas' call for a ""new bilateral start at all levels.""  Dauvergne said that such a process could begin at the  Franco-German summit at the end of May, although it does not  appear to be on the agenda. According to German Foreign  Minister Kinkel, the summit will discuss enlargement of the EU  to include East European states. According to Dauvergne, while  the Germans insist they have no intention of ""killing Europe,""  it remains to be seen whether their behavior may not lead to  this very result.    EU Expansion Potentially `Disastrous'    In an interview with Dauvergne, the chairman of the Senate  Committee on Economic Affairs, Jean Francois-Poncet, expressed  the opinion that expansion of the EU without first undertaking  institutional reorganization might have ""disastrous""  consequences for Europe. Francois-Poncet maintained that the EU  will be a 16-member organization functioning with a system  designed for six, with few chances of meeting future challenges.  Asked the reason for the ""formidable pressure"" applied by  Germany on behalf of adding members, he said it should not be  concluded that Germany has suddenly become anti-European but  that, after unification, Bonn thinks that the EU no longer  matches Europe's political and economic configuration. He also  argued that Germans feel strongly that with the addition of  Greece, Portugal, and Spain, the EU became ""very Mediterranean,""  a consequence that the French had underestimated. To avoid  ""increasing paralysis,"" he expressed the hope that a ""hard  nucleus"" of member countries will emerge within the EU, a  subject that should be debated during the 1996 EU conference  aimed at reviewing the European institutional system.    Francois-Poncet also commented on relations between France  and Germany. He suggested that following the German  parliamentary elections and the French presidential elections a  Franco-German seminar be held to prepare for the 1996 EU  conference and to begin planning for a revision of the  Franco-German treaty.    Eurodeputy Criticizes German `Arrogance'    A commentary by Catherine Pegard criticized Germany's  lobbying effort in the European Parliament on behalf of EU  membership for the Scandinavian countries and Austria. Claiming  that the German efforts were ""unprecedented,"" she wrote that the  ""entire panoply of persuasion"" was used, from telephone calls to  financial ""blackmail."" Certain deputies such as centrist  Francois Froment-Meurice--""not a foe of enlargement""--were  ""frankly surprised."" According to Pegard, Froment-Meurice said  he had a bad reaction ""when pressure reaches this level of  arrogance"" and warned that ""our German friends--indeed, our  German brothers--should not forge that arrogance may sometimes  be their worst enemy.""    EU Structural Problems Viewed    A commentary by Alain Duhamel criticized the proposal to add  four new members to the EU at a time when, he maintained, the  Franco-German duo seems to be ""short of ideas"" and ""rather  devoid of energy."" He warned that an increase in the number of  member countries should not result in ""diminished collective  energy."" Complaining that EU executive power is becoming  increasingly ""anemic,"" he claimed that the rotating six-month  presidency of the European Council is devalued by imbalances  that increase with every enlargement of EU membership. He  insisted that these structural obstacles should be removed  before the arrival of four new members. The 1996 conference  that will attempt to tackle these issues will be four years too  late, Duhamel maintained, adding that by then the EU's best  defenders ""will be writing their memoirs and growing the roses  of retirement.""

Uzbekistan devotes considerable attention to the problems of  developing diverse ties with Japan, which is considered to be  one of the most highly developed countries in the world. Japan  in turn considers our republic to be a state with which mutually  advantageous cooperation would be worthwhile. The history of  cultural ties between our peoples extends far into the past, but  diplomatic relations were not established between Japan and  independent Uzbekistan until early 1993. An embassy of this  country is now operating in Tashkent. On the eve of Islam  Karimov's visit to Tokyo, this UzA correspondent asked a number  of questions of Ukeru Magosaki, the Japanese ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Republic of Uzbekistan.    [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, 7 June will be exactly a year from  the time that you presented your credentials to the president of  our republic. What work has been done since then to develop  cooperation between our countries?    [Magosaki] What I find most gratifying is that talks are  proceeding successfully in a diversity directions. I'm referring  to visits by more than 20 delegations to Uzbekistan consisting  of specialists from different sectors of the Japanese economy,  and at long last, the official visit to be made to our country  by President Islam Karimov. Japan is preparing to receive him at  the highest level. Your methods of managing the economy are  highly valued by the Japanese. In particular, one of your  principles of establishing a market economy is that economic  reforms are initiated and implemented by the state. We ourselves  passed through this phase some time ago as well. We know from  our own experience that it is impossible to achieve positive  changes in the economy in the first stage without a plan and  without unified leadership.    [Mirzo] Please tell us briefly about the political changes  in  your country.    [Magosaki] Until recently there were two major parties of a  capitalist and a socialist orientation in Japan, which waged a  struggle for power. The end of the cold war had a positive  effect upon Japan's foreign and domestic policy. The struggle  between the two parties faded into the past. Our country is now  adhering to a new direction in domestic policy, one based on a  multiparty system. From this day forward the government is to be  headed by a unified coalition bringing together all parties in  the country. Of course, change in the composition of this  coalition is a fully natural phenomenon in the transitional  period. You are aware that Tsutomu Hata was recently elected  prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosakawa, who recently  retired. New ministers have been appointed. My hope is that the  newly formed government will work productively in behalf of  progress in our country, and to raise the welfare of our people.    [Mirzo] What is the new government's attitude toward states  of Central Asia, and particular toward development of relations  with Uzbekistan?    [Magosaki] Japan is perpetually concerned with problems of  mutual relations with Central Asian states. Our prime minister  understands well the significance of Central Asian states  because, among other things, he had worked previously in the  office of foreign affairs minister. The fact that our new  government made its first official invitation to the president  of Uzbekistan, Mr. Islam Karimov, is clear evidence of this.    [Mirzo] What can you say about the forthcoming visit by the  head of Uzbekistan to Japan?    [Magosaki] The visit to Japan by the leader of your republic  will doubtlessly open up new possibilities for industrialists,  bankers, and businessmen of our country. We anticipate signing  of intergovernment documents in a number of areas of bilateral  cooperation. During his visit President Islam Karimov will  conduct talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and he will be  received by Emperor Akihito. In Japan, Mr. Islam Karimov is  known not only as the president of the Uzbek Republic but also  as one of the region's major political figures. We are very  interested in the opinion of your country's president regarding  the current situation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan's mutual  relations with Russia, the situation in Tajikistan and  Afghanistan, and Islamic fundamentalism. Consequently the  Japanese are impatiently waiting to meet Islam Karimov as an  authoritative and experience politician capable of objectively  assessing the situation.    [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, our compatriots have a rather full  understanding of your country and its people. But what do  Japanese know about Uzbekistan, about Uzbeks?    [Magosaki] As you yourself said, our diplomatic relations  were established around a year ago. However, the knots of  cooperation between Japan and your country were tied back in the  7th and 8th centuries. Friendly ties between our peoples were  established in that distant past through the Great Silk Route.  It is no surprise that during his trip to Japan Islam Karimov  will visit our emperor's personal museum, which contains unique  articles associated with the Great Silk Route, and ancient  relics left to us by your ancestors. Uzbeks are known in Japan  as an ancient people whose roots extend deep into the past, as a  people with a great future.     "

My own employment experience bears testament to the unimaginative rigidity of many employers and the frustrations faced by many professional women with a mind to combining career and motherhood. With an Oxford university degree and 12 years' experience in PR behind me, I tried to persuade my corporate employer to let me return to work on a flexible basis after the birth of my first chIld. I offered to take a 50 per cent pay cut to carry on doing the same amount of work, if they would let me return on a three day a week basis. I even guaranteed to put in extra time at short notice whenever required. My employer remained locked in an established policy of only accepting post-natal women back to work on a full time basis. With regret, I left the company. Before long I had set up my own business, with control over my working arrangements, and was reaping the rewards of a considerably higher income. I determined never to lose a valuable employee through inflexibility. I have a good team of female PR executives, and will soon welcome back my deputy director to a two, then three day week following the birth of her first child.

The trial will focus on whether Mr Bakhtiar, the last prime minister of the late Shah of Iran, was killed on the orders of Tehran's Islamic government. Three Iranians, including a relative of Mr Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, the country's president, will answer charges for the 1991 assassination. Six others will be charged in absentia. The Iranian government has denied any involvement in the killing, which was one of dozens of assassinations of opponents of the Tehran regime over the past decade. But Mr Jean-Louis Bruguiere, a senior investigating judge, claims that Iran's secret services were involved in the crime. The French government has implemented tight security at the Palais de Justice, where the trial will take place. The case, to be heard by seven magistrates, is expected to last about a month. Relations between France and Iran have been damaged by Tehran's support for Moslem fundamentalists seeking the overthrow of the military-backed regime in Algeria, a former French colony, and by a French crackdown on Islamic fundamentalism. Following the assassination of five French nationals in Algeria in August, the French interior ministry introduced sweeping stop-and-search operations and interned 26 suspected Moslem militants. Last week the government said it would enforce a ban on wearing Islamic headscarves in secular state schools. Twenty-five students have been expelled from French schools for wearing headscarves. Mr Francois Bayrou, the education minister, said he had ordered schools to bar 'ostentatious religious symbols' and said there were few alternatives to expulsion when persuasion failed. The move has brought an angry reaction from Iran and from other Islamic countries.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.     IRZ  Iran, Middle East.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

He also stressed that  because of security considerations, Taiwan will continue to  employ the principle of handling separately the hijackers and  the airplane concerned, and the repatriation of the hijacked  airplane.    Wu Po-hsiung said that the repeated hijackings of Communist  China's civilian passenger planes to Taiwan has exposed  Communist China's serious gaps in its security checks. He added  that the fundamental way to solve the problem of hijackings lies  in Communist China's strengthening its interior security  measures.    Meanwhile, Kao Kung-lian, vice chairman of the Mainland  Affairs Council and its spokesman, said that because of the  repeated occurrences of the hijacking of mainland airliners to  Taiwan, he hoped that the mainland authorities will show  sincerity, hold follow-up working-level talks as soon as  possible, and sign an agreement on the repatriation of hijackers  as quickly as possible so that mainland hijackers can be  repatriated according to the stipulations of the agreement.    Yesterday, the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], in  addition  to employing its channels for contacts with the mainland's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits [ARATS] and  informing its counterpart about information concerning the  hijacking, also called on the mainland authorities to adopt  positive measures to effectively put a stop to hijackings. It  also expressed the hope that the SEF-ARATS talks will quickly  reach an agreement on the agenda concerning the repatriation of  hijackers at the fourth working-level consultations meeting to  be held in Beijing at the end of March.

[Begin Gutierrez recording] Our Constitution is called the  political constitution of Colombia and, given that we are  dealing with a constitutional problem, it is obviously a  political problem. However, we are not talking about politicking  or lowly actions that are sometimes given prominence. [end  recording]    He added that members of the State Council do not work for  drug traffickers, adding the important thing is that the country  should be told the truth about what the U.S. troops came to do  with their weapons in Colombia.    [Begin Gutierrez recording] They are not military advisers  who came to teach us how to operate the radar or sophisticated  modern airplanes. No, they are armed personnel who came to stay  in the country. [end recording]    The State Council president insisted this is not simple  patriotism. What happens is that there is a Constitution, and  we must advocate adherence to this Constitution. Hence, it is  necessary to state and discuss the issue. They have issued the  report and the Chamber of Representatives' Investigation and  Accusation Committee must now continue the process.    Moreover, Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta today  asked  the State Council and President Gaviria to handle carefully the  debate surrounding the U.S. troops' presence in Colombia.    [Begin Arrieta recording] This is unfortunate, and I hereby  issue an appeal. I urge them to please stop referring to each  other in the terms in which they have been doing, and I ask them  to treat each other with due respect. I believe they are  engaged in a pointless argument; I think this debate has not  been given the appropriate level required by juridical  controversies between two institutions that are so important.  [end recording]    The conflict has arisen after various months of  misinformation about the U.S. troops' presence in the country.  This was confirmed by a high-ranking government source.  President Gaviria personally admitted today the information on  Juanchaco was poorly handled. Narino Palace sources said the  government refrained from assigning importance to the issue  since its inception, when the media learned about the U.S.  troops' presence on the Pacific coast. The military forces  thought it was a political issue which they did not have to  handle. The same source said the Defense Ministry answered the  media's questions by reflex.    [Begin Admiral Hernando Garcia recording] The only murky  thing here is the climate because it rains every day. [laughter  in background] The rest is absolutely clear. You may wonder  why there are so many machines. It is simple: The Americans are  very cautious and they bring... [pauses] If a bulldozer breaks  down they have another one to use because they have the means to  do so. [end recording]    On that occasion, the government claims, things were not  clearly explained, but it was not a matter of withholding  information -- it only involved a small school, a health center,  and the construction of a highway. The same source said the  government had no intention of misconstruing things -- it simply  grabbed the first thing at hand. The president initially tried  to present it as a humanitarian action.    [Begin Gaviria recording] There are U.S. troops in Colombia.  They are engaged in civilian actions and are fulfilling advisory  duties. [end recording]    The president personally revealed the truth barely three  days  ago. It actually involved a joint military engineering corps  exercise. The important thing was not the school; it was  training for the Colombian public forces. The president thought  the issue would quickly be forgotten. However, the topic has  been in the news for a month; the truth has been withheld from  the country for five months.    The controversy caused by the U.S. troops' presence,  following the State Council's decision, has provoked a veritable  flood of fax messages. Some of the opinions are thus summarized:    Liberal Party Senator Rafael Amador said the government  cannot argue now that the foreign troops' presence is a result  of technical cooperation plans, when the treaties and agreements  on which it is based are strictly military.    Liberal Party Senator Humberto Pelaez deplored the fact that  the government ignored the Senate's second committee, which is  in charge of procedures for authorizing the arrival of foreign  troops in the country based on international treaties like the  TIAR [Inter- American Reciprocal Assistance Treaty].    Colombian communists demand the defense minister's  resignation, the replacement of high-ranking military officers  with men of patriotic spirit, and the U.S. troops' immediate  departure from the national territory.    Congressman Heverth Bustamante of the 19 April Movement said  these violations of the political charter and sovereignty should  be carefully investigated.    Ramiro Velasquez, a conservative and vice chairman of the  Chamber of Deputies Foreign Relations Committee, said Gaviria  betrayed the homeland and failed in his duty -- with the Liberal  Party's support.    Former President Alfonso Lopez, member of the International  Relations Advisory Board, said the State Council's statement  failed to take into consideration certain aspects of  international law, like the multilateral treaties which bind  Colombia regarding the interpretation of what constitutes  foreign troops and warships.

Volodymyr Horbulin, director general of the National Space  Agency of Ukraine [NKAU], believes, however, that the talks  between NKAU and NASA will not concern cooperation in the  production of rockets. The reason behind this is Ukraine's  refusal to join the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Volodymyr  Horbulin noted that Ukraine, which has unique rocket-building  technologies, having refused to sign the NPT, has wasted one  year, during which Russia has managed to establish comprehensive  cooperation in the space industry with the United States.    NKAU and the Ministry of External Economic Relations are  currently making considerable efforts to encourage Ukraine's  joining the NPT.    During upcoming talks with NASA, NKAU will discuss the  possibility of cooperation in conducting remote-controlled  probes of earth from space and developing satellite  telecommunication systems. The Ukrainian side is going to offer  NASA a radar to study the ocean's surface, developed by the  Pivdenne design bureau, and technology for electric welding and  construction assembling in space, developed by the Paton  Institute.    With the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine's space industry has  suffered considerable losses such as, for example, the fact that  the Pivdenne design bureau has lost 3,000 employees over the  last two years. Volodymyr Horbulin refused to reveal how many  people are currently employed by the Pivdenne design bureau,  stating only that the number of people who have left the bureau  ""is huge."" The director general of NKAU, however, emphasized  that all the specialists who left the bureau are still working  in Ukraine.     "

He  said they are ""narcotized,"" adding that Bolivian and U.S.  antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results.    The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and  alternative development programs. He admitted that ""they have  had no visible effects"" in either the United States or Bolivia.    Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is  ""controversial"" and has caused confrontations in the search for  consensus.    He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia  has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S.  market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers ""have had no  guarantees on the sale of their products to that country.""    The minister said the peasants have found no market for  their  products and, because of the economic nature of this problem,  they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort.    Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained  between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations  was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit  established.    He said: ""This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very  great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the  cultivated areas."" He added: ""This caused a debate on the  benefits of the policy and on its success or failure.""    In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the  traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical  significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which  is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements.    This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized  Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and  exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression  of traffickers with alternative development.

In order to commemorate the publication of this  important document, I interviewed Tang Shubei, executive vice  chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS].    Strategic Decision Made at Turning Point of History    Tang Shubei first pointed out that the ""Message to Taiwan  Compatriots"" was produced at an important turning point in  Chinese history. The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee, which was convened at the end of 1978,  established the strategic goal centering on economic  construction, and the mainland has since entered a new period of  large-scale modernization construction. At the same time as  China further developed ties with various countries in the  world, China established diplomatic relations in the late 1970's  with the United States and realized the normalization of  relations; thus, China's international status was elevated  unprecedentedly. At the same time, Chinese people on both sides  of the Strait, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, and compatriots  and overseas Chinese all hoped to see the two sides of the  Strait cooperate hand in hand to invigorate the Chinese nation  together. It was precisely against such a background that the  CPC adjusted its Taiwan policy and, through the publication of  the ""Message to Taiwan Compatriots,"" solemnly announced to the  world that the past policy of ""liberating Taiwan"" had been  changed to solving the Taiwan question through peaceful measures  in order to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland.    Tang Shubei said that history in the past 15 years has  proved  that the principle of the peaceful reunification of the  motherland adopted by the Chinese Government is a strategic  decision, not an expedient measure. This principle has been  continuously perfected and developed in the past 15 years.    On 30 September 1981, NPC Chairman Ye Jianying made a speech  (generally called Ye's nine-point speech) to further explain the  principle and policy of solving the Taiwan question; he said  that ""after the reunification of the country, Taiwan will become  a special administrative region, and will enjoy a high degree  autonomy."" He also suggested that the CPC and the Kuomintang  hold talks on an equal footing.    On 22 February 1984, Deng Xiaoping proposed the concept of  ""one country, two systems,"" advocating that on the major premise  of realizing the reunification of the country, the mainstay of  the country would practice a socialist system and Taiwan a  capitalist system.    On 12 October 1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary  Jiang Zemin pointed out: ""We will unswervingly and actively  promote the reunification of the motherland based on the  principle of `peaceful reunification and one country, two  systems.'""    The ""Three Links"" and ""Four Exchanges"" Are in Accordance  With the Minds of the People on Both Sides of the Strait    Tang Shubei thinks that the basic significance of the  ""Message to Taiwan Compatriots"" is ""pinning hope"" on two areas,  that is, ""pinning hope on the Taiwan authorities and pinning  hope on the Taiwan people."" The ""three links"" raised by the  message, that is, direct mail links, shipping and air links, and  commercial links, as well as the ""four exchanges,"" that is,  exchanges of personnel for the main purpose of visiting  relatives and places of interest, cultural exchanges, arts  exchanges, and sports exchanges fully reflect the urgent wishes  of the people on both sides of the Strait who have been  separated for several decades and conforms to the minds of  people on both sides of the Strait.    Tang Shubei said that after the issuance of the Message, the  mainland side actively adopted positive measures, such as  stopping shelling, abolishing the Fuzhou Military Region, and  removing a large number of troops from the Fujian coast,  markedly easing the atmosphere of military confrontation across  the Strait. However, the Taiwan authorities did not respond to  suggestions such as the ""three links"" and ""four exchanges""  raised by the message; on the contrary, they raised the ""three  no's"" policy, that is, ""no contacts, no negotiations, and no  compromise,"" as a means of resistance.    However, the wishes of the people are irresistible, and the  historical trend cannot be blocked. The Taiwan authorities  began to adopt some measures to adjust the way it handled  relations between the two sides of the Strait in August 1987,  and they announced the lifting of the ban on Taiwan compatriots  returning to the mainland to visit relatives, thus, they  eventually responded to some of the calls in the ""Message to  Taiwan Compatriots"" issued by the mainland.    Tang Shubei said that the adjustment of mainland policy by  the Taiwan authorities had some positive meaning, for it is  conducive to easing relations between the two sides of the  Strait. It was precisely after the Taiwan authorities partly  lifted the ban on Taiwan compatriots visiting relatives on the  mainland that interactions between people on both sides of the  Strait and exchanges in the civilian domain consistently  developed and ceaselessly grew. At present, the call for  expanding exchanges across the Strait in the ""Message to Taiwan  Compatriots"" has already become a reality in the benevolent  interactions between the two sides of the strait, as well as  real actions by people on both sides of the strait.    Tang Shubei summed up the process of the development of  interactions between people on both sides of the Strait, as well  as exchanges in the civil domain, as follows: This developed  from Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland to visit  relatives and for tourism, from tourism and visiting relatives  to indirect trade and investment, from completely spontaneous,  scattered, and civilian actions, to the establishment of  empowered civilian groups on both sides of the strait -- the  Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] and the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- to discuss problems  arising from cross-strait exchanges in the civilian domain, and  these two groups have found some methods to solve these problems.    Tang Shubei stressed that these were historic changes which  took place in the direction pointed out by the ""Message to  Taiwan Compatriots,"" whereas the strengths behind these changes  were the people on both sides of the strait who promoted and  brought about changes with the publication and under the  guidance of the ""Message to Taiwan Compatriots."" Reflecting on  these historic changes, we have gained important enlightenment,  that is, people on both sides of the Strait should continue to  play a promoting role and should urge the relevant quarters on  the two sides of the Strait to continuously adjust their  policies to further provide conditions for the development of  civilian exchanges across the strait so as to conform to the  situation of the prosperous development of civilian exchanges  between both sides of the Strait.    The Greatest Revelation From the Wang-Koo Talks    The Wang-Koo talks were an important and notable event in  the  course of the development of relations between the sides of the  Taiwan Strait over the past four decades or more. As ARATS'  executive vice chairman, Tong Shubei has participated in the  entire course of the talks, from paving the way for the talks,  to holding preparatory negotiations, to holding official talks.  He maintains that the fact that the Wang-Koo talks were  proposed and held and that agreements were reached is a vivid  reflection of an inexorable trend in the vigorous development of  exchanges between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait  since the message to Taiwan compatriots was published,  especially since 1987.    Tong Shubei said: Of the four agreements reached at the  Wang-Koo talks, two are being implemented well, namely that on  the use and enquiry of notary certificates and the other on  enquiries into and compensation for registered mail. The other  two agreements, namely the agreement on common agreements and  regular contacts between the two organizations and the agreement  on the institution of talks, although being implemented, the two  sides have differences of understanding and implementation and  need further negotiations.    Tong Shubei stressed: The greatest significance of the  Wang-Koo talks and its greatest revelation to mankind is that  under the one- China principle, the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait have sat down to talk (despite the fact that they  understand the meaning of ""one China"" differently). By doing  so, it is possible to find ways to resolve differences.    Tong Shubei recalled the warm welcome accorded to them by  overseas Chinese in the United States and Canada when Wang  Daohan and he visited there not long after the Wang-Koo talks.  He said that overseas Chinese and people of Chinese descent  earnestly hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait sit down  and talk and find ways of to resolve differences. Regarding  this, Tong Shubei said that it was now possible to find ways to  resolve differences over ordinary matters when the two sides sat  down and talked, it is possible, I believe, for the two sides to  ultimately find ways of resolving political problems as long as  they do so in good faith. For various reasons, it takes time, of  course, to resolve political differences between the two sides,  and we should both be patient.    Deepest Feelings About the ARATS' Work    It is two years now since ARATS was set up in mid-December  1991, and Tong Shubei has been its executive vice chairman ever  since. His name is well known by people on the island and by all  overseas people who are concerned about the development of  cross-strait relations. Asked what his deepest feelings or  experiences about his work in ARATS was, Tong Shubei answered  after thinking a little: I assumed diplomatic posts for a long  time and had contacts with some Taiwan compatriots and some  understanding of Taiwan. Since assuming the post of executive  vice chairman of ARATS, some previous work experience has been  useful and some has not. In the past two years, I have  continuously deepened my understanding of the various aspects of  Taiwan and have, given the present pattern of cross-strait  relations, always explored how to do well in empowering  nongovernmental bodies, strengthening cooperation with the SEF,  jointly promoting contacts between the people of the two sides  and various nongovernmental exchanges, and safeguarding the  legitimate rights and interests of the two sides.    Tong Shubei said: The deepest work experience over the past  two years has been that cooperation between the ARATS and the  SEF is premised on the current political differences and  unconformity between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which  is a fact, and that the foundation for cooperation is the  existence of the people's aspirations, which demand the  strengthening of contacts and exchanges. At present, there are  differences and unconformity between the two sides over such  issues as the nature of politics, laws, common rights, and  jurisdiction. Despite these kind of differences, ARATS and the  SEF are to cooperate and make efforts to resolve problems  arising from contacts and exchanges between their people.    Moreover, Tong Shubei pointed out that when they avoided  such  issues as politics, laws, common rights, and jurisdiction, which  will be difficult to reach agreement on for some time, in the  course of negotiations over ordinary matters, ARATS and the SEF  had succeeded in their cooperation. He illustrated this by  saying that the two sides had reached agreement on the use of  notary certificates and on enquiries into and compensation for  registered mail when they avoided the above questions.    Prospects for Cooperation With the SEF    Asked about the prospects for cooperation between the ARATS  and the SEF in 1994, Tong Shubei said that the two organizations  would probably continue to have difficulties in cooperation next  year. If the two sides could avoid political differences, then  next year could be very promising. We have note speeches made  recently by some responsible persons in the SEF and the  ""Mainland Work Committee"" and that some of their views conform  with ours. If the two sides avoid political differences, then  the agreements reached at the Wang-Koo talks can be implemented  very well and the two organizations will probably make great  strides in their cooperation. If so, it will surely be very good  for contacts between the people of the two sides and for various  nongovernmental exchanges. In short, hope and difficulties  coexist. I personally hope that the scope of cooperation  between ARATS and the SEF will be further expanded. If invited  to Taiwan, I will frankly and sincerely express my views to my  Taiwan friends. I am, of course, also willing to listen to  their views so that we can find more common points.     "

He attended  commemoration activities for the 50th anniversary of the Allied  landings in Normandy and also exchanged opinions with the  leaders of the three countries in order to improve the  partnership with the European allies.    On 7 June, Clinton gave a speech to the French National  Assembly, and this attracted extensive attention from the mass  media. The speech mainly expressed the following three points:  First, post-Cold War Europe is facing some serious challenges,  mainly from ethnic and religious contradictions and the  consequent conflicts and civil wars inside the former Soviet  Union and the East European countries. Second, the United  States ""supports a strong Europe,"" and, at the same time, will  not rescind its military commitment to Europe. Third, a strong  Europe should be built with all the countries of East and West  Europe tied by security, economic, and democratic bonds.    Clinton expressed support for a powerful Europe, but this in  fact indicates that the United States hopes Western Europe will  take on greater responsibilities for resolving the many  difficult problems of post-Cold War Europe. Therefore, Clinton  gave up, to a certain degree, his predecessors' attitude of  having reservations about European integration, especially in  the aspect of European defense. This is a major change. After  the end of the Cold War, the United States became the sole  superpower in the world, but its strength is declining and it  lacks the ability to continue to act as the ""world's policeman""  to extinguish the flames of war in various hot spots. The  Clinton administration has thus adopted a policy of no direct  interference in local conflicts that do not directly endanger  the ""fundamental interests"" of the United States. In such  circumstances, the United States has decided to let Europe  shoulder greater security responsibilities. That is, Europe  will be encouraged to expand and strengthen its own  organizations and institutions in order to restrain and  eliminate local conflicts.    Supporting a powerful Europe is something the United States  can do at present to reduce its responsibilities without running  any risks. This is because a lot of uncertainties remain in the  outlook for the East European countries and about their  participation in the European Union. A European defense system  remains in an ""embryonic"" state, and it will take time for it to  develop. Therefore, a so-called ""strong Europe"" will not  challenge the leading position of the United States in the  alliance for the time being, and the United States could also  strengthen itself while Europe undergoes the prolonged  adjustment process from turbulence to stability. On the other  hand, this will be a giant challenge for Western Europe, as it  will have to make greater efforts to solve issues which concern  the destiny of Europe.    To encourage Europe take on greater responsibilities, a  major  step taken by the United States was to improve relations with  France. France is a very influential member of the European  Union. Clinton chose to give the speech in France because he  wanted to make a good impression on France and thus ease the  tense relationship between the two countries in the past few  years caused by the GATT negotiations and the Bosnia crisis. At  present, France is trying hard to add a ""social chapter"" to the  world trade talks in order to restrict imports from developing  countries and to protect French products. Therefore, it needs  U.S. support. Clinton and Balladur reached a consensus in their  talks and agreed that the two countries should set up an expert  team to work out a draft for discussion at the G-7 summit in  Naples. Clinton also showed flexibility on handling the  Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. He needs France's understanding and  tolerance toward the U.S. policy of ""not sending ground troops.""  So Clinton praised France's ""great contribution"" to the  settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis and consented to a  ""European peace plan.""    Reaction to Clinton's European trip and his speech to the  French National Assembly varied in the three West European  countries. Clinton's praise of the European Union, especially  Franco-German cooperation, delighted Mitterrand, the founder of  the European Union, but left Britain feeling deflated because  the ""Anglo-American special relationship"" was played down.  Public opinion in Italy, however, held that Clinton's visit  showed mistrust of the new government.    Finally, it should be pointed out that during his trip to  Europe, Clinton did not forget to call for strengthening the  internal unity of the Atlantic alliance. He tried to use the  Normandy commemoration activities to review the historical  experience of ""being comrades-in-arms fighting a bloody battle  against common enemies"" 50 years ago in order to strengthen  NATO's internal cooperation with the United States as the core.  However, the cohesive force between the two sides of the  Atlantic Ocean is getting weaker, and Clinton's call did not  gain an explicit response. In his talks with Clinton,  Mitterrand said that France would be a faithful partner, but  also an ""unruly partner."" He also explicitly indicated that  France would not return to NATO's integrated military structure.    Clinton's trip to the three West European countries shows  that Europe remains the focus of U.S. global strategy, but it  also indicates that European-U.S. relations will encounter more  difficult problems in the course of readjustments while Western  Europe takes up greater security responsibilities.

His  opinion reflects debates going on in several U.S. circles  concerning foreign aid to various countries. Because of  pressure, the volume of foreign aid is being reduced annually,  because U.S. taxpayers believe the aid serves no purpose now  that the Cold War is over.    The United States can choose any policy it wants. Any  attempts to influence it will not work because they care about  the interests of the U.S. citizen. However, why did the  announcement that aid to Egypt will stop in three years at most  coincide with U.S. attempts to block Egyptian exports to U.S.  markets? Egypt is capable of continuing its economic reform  measures without U.S. aid. If we shed some light on this issue,  we find that the United States, its employees, and companies  have greatly benefited from this aid and even shared some of it.    How can we prepare ourselves for the end of this aid? We  can, if we mobilize our enormous capabilities in various areas,  improve our products, encourage Egyptians to invest their money  and work harder, and grant preferential treatment by the state  to Egyptian investors, citizens, and businessmen.    No country in the world can exist without cooperating with  other countries, but this cooperation must be governed by rules  and conditions, so that no party may benefit at the expense of  another and no party may impose arbitrary terms or restrictions,  and this is what we should expect from now on. Aid does not  build a homeland, and Egypt is rich in resources and people.     "

These are traditional  relations that recently suffered a certain cooling off, which  must be overcome.    From the Greek side it was pointed out that the parliament  will soon ratify our country's provisional agreement with the  European Union. The delay is not a premeditated act, but a  result of the Greek elections. Evert proposed an interesting  idea on preparing a treaty on the inviolability of borders that  should be signed by all Balkan states. President Zhelev  assessed the proposal as an interesting idea that merits serious  attention. However, he pointed out that it could only be useful  if all Balkan states without exception participate in the  proposed treaty. Bulgaria and Greece could work actively in  this respect, because they are two countries that have proved  that they have no territorial claims vis-a-vis their neighbors,  and conduct their policy in accordance with the Helsinki Act.  Such a Balkan treaty could conform to Balladur's plan on  European security. [end recording]    Evert came to Bulgaria to conduct consultations with  Bulgarian politicians regarding his proposal.

As has been the case more than once, FCS personnel were the  last to learn about this -- and from INTERFAX reports. The FCS  Public Relations Center, therefore, finds it hard to comment on  this event. Observers give as the reason for so sudden a step  the recent release of the ""Lefortovo inmates."" Onlookers refer  to the existence of a certain document forwarded to the heads of  power agencies by presidential structures which indicated  bluntly that no release of the opposition leaders was  admissible. Golushko has been ""punished"" for everybody.  Officials in the presidential staff state in this connection  that the president had long been dissatisfied with incoming  information.    Another possible version of Golushko's dismissal is ""the  Ames  affair,"" because some reports speak about the presence in the  FCS of foreign agents of a similar level. It seems to us,  however, that the more probable cause for the dismissal is its  ""having been planned."" It was obvious to virtually all experts  that this person was temporary, and the president availed  himself of all the sensational events of recent days as a  pretext.    Current first deputy Sergey Stepashin is being named as the  more probable candidate for Federal Counterintelligence Service  director. It is possible, however, that an outsider will be  appointed to this post. I have in mind former KGB generals who  are not on the FCS staff but who are in the civil service and  who have to do with the top echelons of power. The appointment  of a civilian to this position is seen as unlikely.     "

0,FT944-6337 ,"FT944-6337 _AN-EK3EKACGFT 941130   FT  30 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Green groups merge      By FRANCES WILLIAMS and DEBORAH HARGREAVES   International business is hoping to bolster its influence on environmental policymaking with a merger between the two most active industrial lobbying groups - the Geneva-based Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD) and the World Industry Council for the Environment (Wice) in Paris, reports Frances Williams. The new World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to be based in Geneva from January 1, aims to mobilise business behind 'sustainable development' and promote high company standards of environmental management. Rodney Chase, a managing director of British Petroleum and chairman-to-be of the WBCSD, says the new grouping will give industry a more effective voice on these issues in the future. 'Going green' could create more than 700,000 jobs in the UK over the next 10 to 15 years rather than destroying businesses and costing jobs as is generally believed, writes Deborah Hargreaves. According to a report published last week by pressure group Friends of the Earth, adoption of environmental protection measures could save the government Pounds 3bn a year in unemployment benefit. 'One of the main reasons why government and industry won't go forward with environmental protection policy is because they believe it will cost money and jobs. We want to tackle those misconceptions and show that sustainable development can bring real economic benefits,' says Charles Secrett, executive director of FoE. Secrett says the report's findings were based on experience in other countries with a realistic, pragmatic approach. For example, the report suggests that if Pounds 500m were channelled into rail investment instead of road building, the net creation in jobs would range from 3,000 to 8,150. This is based on research in Germany which shows that for every DM100m spent on public transport instead of roads 1 1/2 to two times more jobs are created.

Volodymyr Horbulin, director general of the National Space  Agency of Ukraine [NKAU], believes, however, that the talks  between NKAU and NASA will not concern cooperation in the  production of rockets. The reason behind this is Ukraine's  refusal to join the Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Volodymyr  Horbulin noted that Ukraine, which has unique rocket-building  technologies, having refused to sign the NPT, has wasted one  year, during which Russia has managed to establish comprehensive  cooperation in the space industry with the United States.    NKAU and the Ministry of External Economic Relations are  currently making considerable efforts to encourage Ukraine's  joining the NPT.    During upcoming talks with NASA, NKAU will discuss the  possibility of cooperation in conducting remote-controlled  probes of earth from space and developing satellite  telecommunication systems. The Ukrainian side is going to offer  NASA a radar to study the ocean's surface, developed by the  Pivdenne design bureau, and technology for electric welding and  construction assembling in space, developed by the Paton  Institute.    With the collapse of the USSR, Ukraine's space industry has  suffered considerable losses such as, for example, the fact that  the Pivdenne design bureau has lost 3,000 employees over the  last two years. Volodymyr Horbulin refused to reveal how many  people are currently employed by the Pivdenne design bureau,  stating only that the number of people who have left the bureau  ""is huge."" The director general of NKAU, however, emphasized  that all the specialists who left the bureau are still working  in Ukraine.     "

It falls short of even the mediocre, with little attempt to relate the proposals put before the electorate to macroeconomic goals, especially economic growth and the reduction of unemployment. Yet Brittan himself is not above criticism on the score of shallow thinking. Why is it that economists of his persuasion straying into labour market analysis refuse to reconstruct themselves on the basis of the evidence? His 'consenting adults' model is catchy but pure fiction. Low-paid workers generally remain in their condition because labour markets are segmented. They have no realistic possibility of improving their pay and conditions given limited employment alternatives and the overwhelming bargaining advantage of their employers. To perceive this as a voluntary bargain between even approximate equals is a nonsense. Intervention to redress this imbalance can be via government or collective bargaining. Neither of these is perfect, but while they may lead to some negative consequences for employment, research also suggests some positive benefits for productivity. A particular example of this is the minimum wage which has been well researched in the UK both in its wages council and single national minimum forms. For its social as well as its economic implications it is important to address with some seriousness the scandal of widespread and endemic low pay and poverty in employment.

Members of the Foreign Relations Council  held an urgent meeting with President Guillermo Endara to take a  stand on the report issued by Robert Gelbard, assistant  secretary of state for inter-American affairs, which describes  our country as an important money laundering center. After a  meeting that lasted two and a half hours, the Panamanian  Government officially rejected the high-ranking U.S. official's  report that Panama's efforts to combat money laundering have  been small.    [Begin Foreign Minister Jose Mulino recording] We will also  request a meeting at the highest level of the U.S. Government to  discuss the drug issue. This issue must be broached, not only  in regard to Panama, but also with respect to the United States,  which is the country that consumes this product the most. [end  recording]    He added that the Panamanian Government does not intend to  argue the issue but wants to begin a constructive dialogue to  correct possible errors in the management of the money  laundering problem.    [Begin Mulino recording] Those issues do not stay at a  bilateral level. It is offensive and denigrating for our  country to be identified as one of the world's principal money  laundering centers. [end recording]    The foreign minister announced that he will send Panama's  official statement on the matter to U.S. officials early next  week. In his opinion, the report tarnishes the country's image  among nations.     "

These refugees would remain in the  camps while the presidents of Mexico and Guatemala determine the  best path to follow, according to Defense Minister Mario Rene  Enriquez Morales.    The minister recalled that for 12 years, Mexico has given  shelter to many Guatemalan refugees. He also noted that some of  these are ""guerrillas"" who have crossed into Mexican territory  and have been received as refugees. As evidence of this, he  continued, URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] rebels  are living in Mexico and have established organs of influence,  such as the news agencies CERIGUA and ENFOPRENSA.    Nevertheless, the military leader said: ""I hope the  situation the Mexican brothers are going through changes when  the rebels understand the damage they are inflicting upon the  population. In turn, they will have to take measures aimed at  dialogue and reconciliation to spare residents more death and  suffering.""    Defense Minister Confirms URNG Support    Defense Minister Enriquez Morales stated yesterday that  reports about the military logistical participation of the URNG  within the Zapatista National liberation Army (EZLN) have been  confirmed, as stated by Mexican authorities.    Mexico's Attorney General's Office told the media covering  the events that URNG combatants are participating in the attacks  on the town of San Cristobal de las Casas, because one of them  was captured. The defense minister said that this confirms our  feeling.    There is no official information on URNG involvement;  however, the possibility that the URNG may be furnishing weapons  and supplies to destabilize Mexico, as they cannot do in their  own country, has not been ruled out, Enriquez concluded.

""It is shocking for the US  government to show contempt for the norms governing  international relations and blatantly undermine the sovereignty  of China and try to split China,"" foreign ministry spokesman Wu  Jianmin told a weekly press briefing.    Provisions contained in the Foreign Relations Authorisation  Act adopted by the U.S. Congress on April 28 instruct the  director of the US Informations Agency ""to seek to establish an  office"" in the Tibetan capital Lhasa.    The office would promote the discussion of human rights,  promote U.S. private sector involvement in educational and  cultural activities, advise Washington on Tibetan popular  opinion and disseminate information on the United States.    ""What the US government is going to do in this connection  must have prior consent on the part of the Chinese Government,""  Wu said, adding: ""We will definitely not agree.""    Wu slammed the act for ""even going so far as to name Tibet  as  a country"" and demanded that Washington strictly abide by the  principle that Tibet is an integral part of China.    While President Bill Clinton has agreed in principle with  the  sentiments contained in the relevant provisions, he has  expressed reservations that their formulation may infringe on  the president's prerogative in negotiations with foreign  governments.    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific  Affairs said Wednesday that Washington was keen to see more  progress from Beijing on the question of Tibet, most notably on  U.S. calls for a meeting between Tibet's exiled leader, the  Dalai Lama, and Chinese officials.

On April 19 the American Trade-Industrial Chamber made  up of about 180 companies functioning in Russia recommended to  its members to suspend allocation of credits to Russian legal  entities due to an incorrect interpretation of the country's  legislation on the part of several tax bodies of the Russian  Federation.    The explanation of the Russian Finance Ministry says that in  accordance with Russian tax law value added tax and a special  tax are imposed on funds received from other enterprises and  organizations. Exceptions are made for funds transferred to  authorized funds of enterprises by their sponsors and funds  intended for joint activity. VAT and special tax are not  imposed on operations connected with issuance and transfer of  loans and operations related to the circulation of securities  (shares, bonds, certificates, promissory notes, and others.)    Foreign investments channelled to Russia for the creation of  joint ventures and payment for securities of Russian enterprises  procured by foreign individuals and legal entities are not  liable for VAT or the special tax, indicates the Finance  Ministry. Loans and credits granted by foreign banks and credit  offices are also exempt. In addition, taxes are not imposed on  funds which foreign states grant to enterprises and  organizations free of charge in the form of a grant for specific  projects.    The Finance Ministry also drew attention to the presidential  decree dated December 22, 1993 ""On Changes in Taxation and in  Mutual Relations between Budgets of Different Levels.""  According to this document, VAT and special tax are not imposed  on goods and technical equipment imported to Russia in the  framework of free technical aid which foreign states render in  accordance with inter-governmental agreements.

Europe is back.    The 1980s, with the dawning of the era of the Pacific Rim, was a decade in  which most of the economic attention -- and conflict -- between the United  States and its trading partners centered on Japan and the growing export  prowess of such Asian nations as South Korea and Taiwan.    No longer. At least for now, Washington's trade problems with Japan and the  rest of Asia are receding into the background. And tensions between Washington  and some of its European allies are rising.    A newly ebullient Western Europe is emerging from the pessimism that gripped it  in the early 1980s. Its own impending economic integration in 1992 and Eastern  Europe's plunge toward free markets are bound to make the United States and  Europe ever more interdependent and prone to economic and trade fights.    ""With the collapse of the Berlin Wall, the sheer magnitude of the issues facing  the United States in Europe are going to dominate the Administration's  attention,"" says David Hale, an economic historian who heads Kemper Financial's  economic research unit in Chicago. ""At the same time, people have simply gotten  tired of re-running the U.S.-Japan conflict over and over again.""    The quarrels between Washington and Europe will range from such small issues as  steel quotas and growth hormones in cattle feed to far more fundamental  disputes over farm subsidies, transatlantic investment and how best to absorb  the crumbling Soviet Bloc into the world economy.    ""In terms of both policy challenges and business opportunities, most of the  action in the 1990s will be in Europe,"" says Michael Aho, director of the  international trade project at the Council of Foreign Relations in New York.  ""We still have problems with Japan, but many of them are decades old.  Meanwhile, the European Community is changing the rules of the game.""    The seven-nation economic summit here provides telling evidence of just such a  shift in focus. While U.S. officials had nothing but praise for Japan, the Bush  Administration wasn't so kind or gentle with respect to Europe.    As the summit opened Monday, both Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter and  U.S. chief trade negotiator Carla A. Hills trained their big guns on the  12-nation European Community's longstanding intransigence in the ongoing  negotiations over its massive farm subsidies.    ""Our concern with . . . the European Community thus far is that they simply  have not been engaged,"" Yeutter said. ""We cannot negotiate with ourselves.""    Going further, Yeutter directly challenged Europe's claim that its small  farmers deserve special consideration.    ""The fact is the community is not competitive in agriculture and that's why it  does not prefer free trade. The community, of course, is strongly in favor of  additional trade liberalization in areas where it is competitive,"" Yeutter  said. ""It's nice to be able to have your cake and eat it, too, if you can --  but that's really not the way the world works.""    When Hills weighed in, she was just as blunt. The dispute over agricultural  trade, she said, pits the EC against ""all exporting nations, of which the  United States happens to be one. Could the United States be . . . more  flexible, less stubborn, and succeed? The answer is no. Were we to not get  fundamental reform . . . we would have 40 nations get up and leave these  negotiations.""    Meanwhile, even though public attention is still riveted on the potential  economic threat from Asia, the decades-long trade dispute between Washington  and Tokyo has moved to the back burner.    ""People may be far more concerned about Japan than the Europeans,"" said Alan  Stoga, economic analyst at Kissinger Associates in New York, ""but as far as the  Bush Administration is concerned, the big strategic issues are in Europe.""    Last month's broad Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement, which  covered such wide-ranging issues as expanding public investment in Japan and  shrinking the U.S. budget deficit, ""concludes an era in U.S.-Japanese  relations,"" said a senior Administration official. ""It marks a real turning  point in our relationship.""    Not everyone is convinced that troubles in Asia are over.    ""The fundamental causes of trade friction between (Japan and the United States)  have not been addressed,"" argues Clyde Prestowitz, a former U.S. trade official  who now heads the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington. The SII agreement,  he adds, creates ""a false impression of solving problems when we should be  preparing to manage continued bilateral tensions.""    Indeed, there's little doubt that the United States has not seen the last of  its trade conflicts with Japan, which continues to maintain deeply entrenched  business practices that serve to keep out foreign goods. ""If the trade deficit  with Japan starts widening again,"" said Stoga, ""the issue will return with a  vengeance.""    Nonetheless, not only Washington but the whole world is clearly obsessed with  the historic developments in Europe.    ""Europe is at the dawn of a new era,"" trumpeted the seven summit nations in  their political declaration Tuesday.

Iran's charge d'affaires  Gholam Reza Ansari was summoned to see Foreign Office [FO]  Minister Douglas Hogg following reports that Tehran's spies have  been secretly helping the terrorists.    After the 10-minute showdown at the Foreign Office, a FO  spokesman said: ""We are convinced that there have been contacts  between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We take the gravest  view of any contact which might assist or encourage terrorism.  Mr. Hogg summoned the Iranian charge to convey our concern and  to request an assurance at senior level that contact would be  immediately and conclusively severed.""    Britain believes contacts have been going on for some time  and it is clear measures will be taken against Tehran if today's  warning has no effect. Relations between the two countries are  already sour following the late Ayatollah Khomeyni's death order  on author Salman Rushdie over his controversial book, The  Satanic Verses. Britain and Iran do not have full diplomatic  relations, with only an Iranian charge d'affaires in London,  instead of an ambassador. But Britain is unlikely to break off  all diplomatic relations with such an important Middle East  country and will be reluctant to impose sanctions.    The Iranian embassy refused to comment on today's events.    The Government is believed to be concerned that Iran was  planning to supply money and arms to the IRA.    Later, Mr. Ansari told ITN's Lunchtime News that his meeting  with Mr Hogg was very friendly. ""I was informed about their  concern. I am sure it is not right, but I will be in contact  with my country -- definitely it is not right.""     "

The most important of them was the  Agreement on Promotion and Mutual Protection of Investments.  The drafting of the document demanded maximum efforts on the  part of the two sides and lasted for almost a year.  Representatives of more than 30 ministries and departments  participated in debates over this key document, all the  preliminary drafts were discussed at the sessions of the Supreme  Soviet and Council of Ministers committees.    [Grigorovich] Could you brief us on the legal basis of this  document? Have there been any problems in drafting it?    [Radkevich] The document creates a legal basis for the  involvement and efficient use in Belarus of the vast potential  of U.S. investments. Regardless of the firm and often  uncompromising stance of the U.S. side, we managed to alter the  text of the agreement adjusting it to the real state of affairs  in the economy and to Belarusian laws.    By the way, before signing the agreement with Belarus, the  United States signed bilateral agreements on promotion and  mutual protection of investments with Russia, Armenia,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Moldova.    [Grigorovich] As is known, according to the Belarusian-U.S.  agreement on trade relations signed in February 1993, the sides  granted each other the status of most favored nation. What  effect did it have on our relations?    [Radkevich] This in particular means that Belarusian  enterprises and companies do not have to pay higher customs duty  for exporting their products to the United States. In addition,  our products enjoy all the privileges granted to other states.    Belarus would receive other privileges had it joined the  U.S.  General System of Preferences, temporarily exempting certain  categories of products from customs duty. Prime Minister V.  Kebich once sent a letter to the United States regarding this  issue. Unfortunately, for some reason, President Clinton made no  declaration concerning Belarusian admission to this system.  Yet, we are continuing to work in that direction.    [Grigorovich] What is your opinion about other agreements  and accords discussed and signed during Clinton's talks with the  Belarusian leadership?    [Radkevich] I want to underline that during the talks the  U.S. side promised to increase financial aid to Belarus within  the framework of the Nunn-Lugar Law to $100 million, although  the agreement signed by the Belarusian defense minister and the  U.S. secretary of defense stipulated $63. 56 million. This  project envisions realigning military technologies and potential  to civilian tracks and establishing an exports control system.  The latter is to prevent the proliferation of mass annihilation  armaments from Belarus to other states and to restore the  environment at former strategic missile facilities. Belarus is  to provide material and technical assistance and services  necessary to establish a communications hot-line with the  Republic. A further increase in assistance will depend on the  progress of economic reform in Belarus, including privatization  and denationalization.    I would like to point out that Belarus will not receive  these  financial means in ""monetary"" form -- they will be apparatuses  for discovering nuclear substances and narcotics, communication  equipment for customs checkpoints, and the like.    [Grigorovich] Will any joint structures and organs be formed  to step up our economic relations?    [Radkevich] Belarus and the United States have agreed to  form a bilateral committee for promoting business. Its efforts  will be directed at revealing and resolving problems hampering  business activities. The committee will be headed by U.S.  Department of Commerce Adviser Jan Kalicki and S. Atroshchenko,  deputy chairman of the State Committee for Foreign Economic  Relations.    A U.S. business center will be opened in Minsk. The project  has been approved by the United States Agency for International  Development. The opening of the center is scheduled for the  first half of 1994. The U.S. Congress has already earmarked $7  million for establishing business centers in Russia and other  CIS states. The share for Belarus is $1 million.    [Grigorovich] On the eve of President Clinton's visit to  Minsk, the Belarusian Ministry of Finance reportedly signed a  general accord with the U.S. Exports and Imports Bank on  stimulating projects.    [Radkevich] The signing of this agreement was preceded by  strenuous work. We are very grateful to the U.S. Embassy in  Minsk for the assistance they rendered.    All in all, our Republic may receive some $1 billion from  the  credit line opened by the Eximbank for Belarus. Only those  projects will be subsidized whose priority meaning for the  national economy will be confirmed by the Belarusian Ministry of  Finance and the National Bank.    [Grigorovich] How do you assess the general state of  Belarusian-U.S. relations?    [Radkevich] Relations between our states have been  constantly expanding and developing. Preliminary data  demonstrate that the aggregate products turnover between Belarus  and the United States reached $126 million in 1993. The U.S.  credit line has been fully utilized, which gives grounds to hope  that it will be expanded in the future. U.S. business circles  have been manifesting a growing interest in our Republic. As of  today, U.S. companies have invested in 123 Belarusian  enterprises; 18 firms have opened their branches in Belarus.    Belarus feels the U.S. support on the international arena,  especially in such influential economic organizations as the  International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the  IMF, which allocated $226.3 million to Belarus in 1993.

The Foreign Office in London yesterday made public its decision to expel Mr Vahid Belourchi, a first secretary at the Iranian embassy, for allegedly distributing forged documents about British policy in Bosnia. Iran had been told of the British decision last week, when it was agreed that no publicity would be given to the expulsion in the hope of avoiding further repercussions. However, Tehran said yesterday it was retaliating by expelling Mr Hamish Cowell, the deputy head of the British mission in Tehran. No further official explanation was offered by the Iranian government, but Iranian newspapers linked the expulsion to 'extensive British propaganda against Iran, designed to please the US'. The latest downward turn in relations between the two countries began in April when Britain accused Iran of establishing links with the IRA, and of planning to provide weapons and training for Irish republican extremists. Iran denied that any contacts had taken place and suggested instead that a listening device had been found implanted in the wall of its refurbished embassy in London. The Foreign Office said the Iranian diplomat had been asked to leave 'because members of the Iranian embassy had been involved in attempting to distribute forged documents purporting to show that Britain's policy in Bosnia was directed against the Moslems'. Iran has become frustrated at its inability to aid Moslems in Bosnia and the refusal by western powers to accept the deployment of Iranian peace-keeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. The regime in Tehran also believes that Britain is playing a key supporting role in the US policy of denying Iran access to international financial markets at a time of growing economic difficulties in the Islamic republic.

He  said they are ""narcotized,"" adding that Bolivian and U.S.  antidrug efforts have not yielded the expected results.    The minister examined the interdiction, prevention, and  alternative development programs. He admitted that ""they have  had no visible effects,"" either in the United States or in  Bolivia.    Replying to questions from reporters, he said the subject is  ""controversial"" and has caused confrontations in the search for  consensus.    He said the reduction of illegal coca plantations in Bolivia  has not been reflected in the volume of drugs entering the U.S.  market. In addition, Bolivian peasant producers ""have had no  guarantees on the sale of their products to that country.""    The minister said the peasants have found no market for  their  products and, because of the economic nature of this problem,  they do not support the bilateral antidrug effort.    Among the achievements he mentioned were those attained  between 1987 and 1992, when the area of illegal coca plantations  was reduced by 47 percent, that is, by almost half of the limit  established.    He said: ""This shows the Bolivian Government has made a very  great effort to reduce the offer of cocaine by reducing the  cultivated areas."" He added: ""This caused a debate on the  benefits of the policy and on its success or failure.""    In Bolivia there is a clear difference between the  traditional use of coca, its cultural value and its historical  significance, and its use for the production of narcotics, which  is regulated by Bolivian-U.S. agreements.    This situation has, to a considerable extent, narcotized  Bolivian-U.S. relations, for which reason agreements and  exchange notes were signed each year, combining the repression  of traffickers with alternative development.

A joint communique released at the end of a three-day visit to Vietnam by China's President Jiang Zemin said the two governments agreed to 'refrain from all acts that make things more complicated or broaden conflicts'. The dispute over the South China Sea is especially sensitive, because each country is seeking to exploit oil and gas reserves believed to lie under the sea bed. Both countries have awarded oil exploration contracts to US oil companies in disputed waters. Mr Qian Qichen, Chinese foreign minister, said in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi the two sides could shelve disputes and start 'joint development' if problems could not be resolved in talks immediately. Joint development of possible oil and gas fields in disputed maritime areas is a proven method of overcoming conflicts between two countries, but might not succeed in all areas of the sea because there are four other claimants to some or all of the islands: Taiwan, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei. Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have improved in the past few years. But Vietnamese officials say China has recently encroached on their territory near the border, refused to open a railway link to allow normal trade across the land frontier, and let Chinese traders smuggle cheap Chinese goods into Vietnam. Mr Jiang's visit, the first by a Chinese president, may not have brought much in the way of concrete achievements, but suggests the two governments want to set aside their differences and concentrate on the similar challenges each faces: keeping their one-party communist political systems intact while liberalising the economy.

A ""dialogue"" is underway between advisers to the two  leaders,  the French president told AFP, aimed at mending fences between  the two normally close allies.    In a move highly unusual between friendly states, German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Thursday summoned French  ambassador Francois Scheer to explain remarks he allegedly made  about the German attitude toward the European Union. Scheer had  spoken earlier to German journalists on condition of anonymity.    Relations between the two countries also became strained  after Kohl was omitted from celebrations for the 50th  anniversary of the Allied landing in Normandy, taking place on  June 6.    Mitterrand moved to play down the row, saying he had  discussed ""these issues by telephone with the Chancellor last  week,"" adding: ""Our advisers have met. The dialogue is  continuing.""    He said he would meet Kinkel next Thursday ""as has been  scheduled for a long time.""    Mitterrand said Kohl had ""not asked me"" for an invitation to  the D-Day memorial ceremonies, adding: ""I'm considering with the  prime minister (Edouard Balladur) what is the best way to...  celebrate the 50th anniversary as it should be and mark that,  after the period we're commemorating, has come historically  unprecedented cooperation."" [sentence as received]    Recalling that cooperation between the two countries had led  to the creation of a French-German military corps, ""a European  corps,"" Mitterrand said: ""We remain in this spirit.""    The French president said he and Kohl had done ""lots of work  together in the best spirit and we shall continue to do so in  the interest of both our countries and Europe.""     "

Why have you not agreed to the UN  proposal for the sale of oil worth $1.6 billion?    ['Aziz] UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 do not  allow Iraq to meet its basic needs because they call for the  allocation of a significant amount of the profit from the sale  of its oil for the UN personnel's expenses and for compensation  to the countries that incurred losses as a result of the war.  The two resolutions were drawn up in order to place Iraq under  UN control. The objective is to interfere in Iraq's internal  affairs. We definitely cannot agree to all that. The two  superpowers do not wish to alleviate the Iraqi people's pain.    [Batur] Would Iraq's compliance with the UN resolutions not  provide for the relaxation of the embargo to a certain degree?    ['Aziz] No, it would not. Had conditions not been imposed, a  way could have been found to move away from the embargo.  However, their objective is to create instability in Iraq.    [Batur] Turkey still fears that the Kurds may be forced to  emigrate once again if the security umbrella over them is lifted.    ['Aziz] I have been informed of that viewpoint several  times.  We are prepared to give any kind of guarantee that a new wave of  emigration will not take place. The Iraqi Administration stands  to gain nothing by resorting to military measures to resolve the  Kurdish problem. That problem cannot be resolved through  military measures. We have had incidents for the past 25 years.  A political solution is necessary. That is the guarantee we  can give.    [Batur] Karkuk is a key problem between the Kurds and  Baghdad. Do you plan to give a share of Karkuk to the Kurds when  the talks are resumed?    ['Aziz] No, we do not. Talks cannot be held on Karkuk.    [Batur] What would you do if the Hammer Force's mandate is  broadened to include Karkuk?    ['Aziz] We shall resist such a move.    [Batur] Will that be in the form of military resistance?    ['Aziz] We shall resist in every way.    [Batur] The strength of Iraq's military forces is a matter  of  concern. Baghdad made certain statements in the past, the  nature of which was to threaten Turkey.    ['Aziz] The target of those statements was the leaders who  sided with the allies at the time.    [Batur] You mean former President Turgut Ozal?    ['Aziz] I do not wish to criticize a person who has passed  away. However, that was the situation at the time. Had we  taken a negative approach to Turkey, would we have agreed to  joint projects with it? Nevertheless, the question of water  supply is an important matter. It must be resolved in  accordance with the two countries' interests.    [Batur] You have claimed that Turkey has been used by the  United States.    ['Aziz] I believe that Turkey has made a historic mistake by  joining the alliance against Iraq. Turkey is an Islamic  country. Do not forget that it is one of Iraq's neighbors.  Neighbors must respect each other's independence. Turkey has  now begun to pay the price of its move to join the alliance  against Iraq.    [Batur] What is the political cost?    ['Aziz] Was it right on Turkey's part to join an alliance  against one of its neighbors? You may not have approved of what  we had done. However, you should have said so. Why did you  join the military operations launched by the United States,  Britain, and other Western countries? The objective of the  military operations was not to force Iraq to withdraw from  Kuwait; it was to destroy Iraq. Did you stand to gain anything  from that?    [Batur] What do you expect from Turkey?    ['Aziz] We wish to maintain our favorable and mutually  beneficial relations. Turkey continues to observe the UN  embargo. That conflicts with its own interests. Turkey has  suffered significantly as a result of this. It has the right to  act and adopt decisions in accordance with its interests.    [Batur] Are you saying that Turkey can ignore the embargo by  itself?    ['Aziz] The UN Charter allows countries that suffer to act  individually to safeguard their rights. We are your friends and  neighbors. The past must not be allowed to affect our  relations. Iraq remains on its feet and it will continue to  exist. So, the Turkish Government should move to reestablish  its relations with Iraq as soon as possible.    [Batur] Claims have been put forward that Baghdad supports  the Kurdish Workers Party and its leader, Abdullah Ocalan.    ['Aziz] No, it does not.    [Batur] Abdullah Ocalan has reportedly visited Baghdad.    ['Aziz] That, too, is untrue. We do not stand to gain  anything by destabilizing Turkey. We are not involved in plots.  Plots are being made against Iraq, but we do not act in a  similar way.    [Batur] Who is making plots against Iraq?    ['Aziz] Those who directly or indirectly support the  abnormal  and false situation in northern Iraq. We are suffering from  that situation. Nevertheless, we have the experience we need,  so we do not maintain a two-faced policy.    [Batur] Does Turkey maintain a two-faced policy toward Iraq?    ['Aziz] Yes, some of the officials in Turkey do.     "

According to the  sources of a CESKY DENIK reporter, the 1994 BIS budget was set  at 1.2 billion korunas [Kc].    The planned staff of the secret service is approximately  1,300 employees, but it has not been at full capacity for some  time now. Approximately 800 employees work in BIS. A rough  approximation gives us Kc1.5 million per one BIS employee. This  amount includes the cost of social and health insurance,  investments, wages, and so forth.    The Interior Ministry budget was approved this year in the  total amount of Kc17.7 billion. After expenditures related to  the Interior Ministry's Civilian Administrative Department, Fire  Brigade Main Administration, and investment expenditures of the  ministry are deducted, there are Kc16.2 billion left for the  entire Security Department. This amount covers the needs of the  police and other security divisions--the Foreign Relations and  Information Office (intelligence), for instance. The employee  total of all security divisions, including police, comes to  approximately 56,000. A rough calculation gives approximately  Kc289,000 per policeman and year. This budget also includes  social and health insurance premiums, subsidies for subsidized  organizations and civic associations, operational costs  (maintenance, repairs, rent, power, etc.). A rough comparison  shows that the Security Information Service has approximately  five times greater funds (per worker) at its disposal than  security divisions under the Interior Ministry umbrella.

Speaking at a gathering of U.S. businessmen hosted by the  U.S.- China Business Council here, Zou said that over the 15  years since China and the United States established diplomatic  relations, despite ups and downs, difficulties and disputes, the  overall relations between the two countries have moved forward  with exchanges and cooperation in various fields on constant  increase. The world has undergone some major and profound  changes in the past few years, but the importance of Sino-U.S.  relations remains unchanged. They have extensive shared  interests and common responsibility in many areas such as  safeguarding world peace and stability, ensuring a secure and  prosperous Asia-Pacific region, promoting global economic  prosperity and bringing about a better environment.    One outstanding feature of the post-Cold War world, he said,  is that all countries have given their top priority to economic  development. Asia-Pacific region, by maintaining the best  growth records for years running, has caught attention in the  world. On the other hand, he added, international economic  competition, as seen in fierce rivalry for market shares, has  become increasingly heated. New opportunities and new  challenges keep presenting themselves one after another.    Under such circumstances, he stressed, it behooves both  China  and the United States to seize the opportune moment by pushing  vigorously for exchanges and cooperation in the fields of  economy, trade, science and technology. ""This is not only in  the fundamental interest of the two peoples, but also  contributes to peace, stability, prosperity and progress of the  world at a large,"" he noted.    Speaking of bilateral trade, mutual investment, and economic  and technological cooperation, Zou said, in 1993, Sino-U.S.  trade volume reached 27.65 billion U.S. dollars according to  Chinese customs statistics, which was an increase of more than  ten times over 1979, with China's imports from the United States  up by 20.1 percent over the previous year. The United States  has retained its place as China's third largest trade partner.  In terms of investment volume, the United States still leads  other overseas investors. By the end of last year, the  contractual value of U.S. investment in China had totalled 11  billion U.S. dollars, and the number of U.S. funded projects  surpassed more than 8,000. More than half of American  investment in China was made by large companies and their  projects are large in scale, high in technological standards and  quite profitable.    Facts have shown, Zou said, that it is entirely possible for  countries of different social systems and ideologies to actively  develop economic and technological cooperation to the benefit of  both sides.    Zou maintained that the differences between China and the  United States in the economic and trade fields are being ironed  out gradually with the signing of a number of memorandums of  understanding in 1992.    ""What I want to emphasize is that the Chinese Government  will, as always, honor its commitment in accordance with the  requirements of the three memorandums of understanding. We hope  that the U.S. Government will also strictly honor its  commitment. In our view, all the problems between us can be  resolved by way of negotiation and consultation as long as the  two sides abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit.""    He promised that China's sustained and rapid economic growth  and its ambitious development program will surely bring about  more opportunities for the American business community. For  example, every year China imports from the United States large  quantities of wheat, aircraft, computers, chemical fertilizer,  cotton, paper, pulp, machinery, electronic equipment and  equipment for chemical and petroleum industries. It is expected  that from now to the year 2000, China will import one trillion  U.S. dollars worth of commodities from the international market.  ""We hope that American businessmen will take up a larger share  of that import,"" Zou said.    However, he reminded the audience that competition among the  world's major powers in the Chinese market is very intense.  Advanced technology and equipment and fine service alone are not  enough. ""They must be accompanied by a long-term, stable and  harmonious environment for cooperation in the economic and trade  field,"" he said.    ""Frankly speaking,"" he pointed out, ""American business  people  are not as advantageously placed as their counterparts in Europe  and Japan. It is very clear that the annual dispute over the  MFN status causes serious damage to the development of economic  and trade ties between our two countries.""    Then he stressed that the mutual granting of MFN status is  the foundation stone for Sino-American economic and trade  relations. If this is undermined, it will do serious damage to  the economies and trade of the two countries and to the  interests of their consumers.""    He deemed it the duty of the Chinese and U.S. governments to  encourage and support business people of the two countries to  conduct mutually beneficial cooperation, thus creating favorable  conditions for closer bilateral relations.    He stated that the Chinese Government always attaches  importance to the relations with the United States and has made  tremendous and effective efforts to improve and develop them.

Kinkel's handshake with Juppe, Balladur, and Mitterrand had  been planned for a long time. However, the criticism of the  French ambassador, who indicated that Paris did not know how to  treat the new Germany, and that the new Germany was striking a  false note, has presented the situation in bright light.    The crisis has been averted, but distrust remains. It cannot  be dispelled even by the most excellent speech. France's  foreign-policy oligarchy is asking itself what secret plans  Germany has for Europe. With the European Union [EU], Paris  wants to protect French interests and tie Bonn firmly to the  central countries of the West. When Kohl and Kinkel are now --  in the Elysee's view -- obsessed with pushing EU enlargement  toward the north and East, this would hit French foreign policy  in a weak spot. Is even this chancellor -- who is actually a  European -- intending to free himself from the chains that  Germany has put on itself, free himself from the firm links to  the West -- this is the question French diplomats are asking,  sometimes in a low voice, sometimes very loudly.    A flat no is not an answer. It takes time for a new,  weatherproof relationship to establish. In the second half of  1994 Bonn will assume the EU presidency, Paris in the first half  year of 1995. The challenges for Europe remain -- in the East  and in the Mediterranean, even though this is where Europe has  failed. This forces the two partners to come up with joint  concepts unless the two successive presidencies are intended to  inaugurate a lost year.     "

This question is becoming particularly significant at a time  when a dialogue with Ankara is being manipulated and U.S.  Presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz has begun a new round of  contacts in Athens and Skopje.    According to reliable information ELEVTHEROTIPIA received  from official lips, the current U.S. position is as follows:    1. Relations with Turkey. It is necessary to break the ice.  Although ""Attila's"" [the Turkish troops in Cyprus] presence in  Cyprus is a fact, the two countries can begin meetings and reach  agreements on secondary issues (tourism for example). This will  make bilateral relations easier and will benefit both countries.  It will also remove a factor of tension in the Balkans.  (Regarding the Cyprus issue, the United States admits that in  the past few years it has more or less ""forgotten"" it and it is  not among the top issues of concern).    2. The Skopje Issue. The problem focuses on the name issue.  The United States considers all the rest--symbols,  constitution--as subsidiary. It stresses emphatically that both  sides must show flexibility [previous word in English]; but  because Greece is the strongest, richest, and most stable  country in the Balkans, it should be the one ""to make the first  step.""    In addition to the above ""advice,"" the United States  stresses  that in no case should Greece consider it an alternative to  relations with the European Union [EU]. It stresses: ""We are  friends with Greece and all of the EU member states.""    The United States implies that it does not make concessions  to any country, especially Greece.    This ""advice"" was expressed after--and obviously  during--U.S.  President Bill Clinton's meeting with Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou in Washington.     "

[Nagy] For Slovakia, its relationships with the Czech  Republic and Hungary are most important in the Central European  region, at present. The latter is so in spite of the fact that  it is not as we would like it to be, Eduard Kukan, Slovak  foreign minister, told a Hungarian radio correspondent today.  Then he continued as follows:    [Kukan, in Slovak, fading into Nagy's report in Hungarian]  The outside world views this region in which we live, Central  Europe, through the prism of Slovak-Hungarian relations. It is  in the interest of the international organizations--and the  minister was convinced of this as UN ambassador--to stabilize  this relationship, so that the number of sources of tension in  the world does not increase, so that this region does not  constitute a serious problem for the international organizations.    The current Slovak Government observed with pleasure that  its  first statements, by which it would like primarily to encourage  the Hungarian side to start a dialogue, were received favorably  by its Hungarian counterparts, the foreign minister said.    To my question of whether the start of a dialogue could take  place in April, Kukan replied that no decision had been reached  on this yet, but a relationship ought to be developed between  the two neighboring countries, regardless of the governments  that happen to be in power. The Hungarian elections are the  country's internal affair, and the people have the right to  decide what kind of government they want.    The Slovak Government, regardless of what Hungary's new  leadership will be like, would like to shape the two countries'  relationship so that this leads to a solution of the existing  questions, Kukan told the correspondent of Hungarian radio.

Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of a coalition of right-wing  opposition parties in the Lithuanian Seimas, who recently  appears to be learning to find a common language with the  centrists on matters of ensuring the republic's security, said  that he welcomes the authorities' steps, particularly the  initiative to hold the consultations. Mr. Landsbergis believes  that ""recent statements by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, the goings-on in Belarus and its statements addressed  to Lithuania give ample reasons to talk about a threat to its  territorial integrity.""    Vytautas Landsbergis, as usual, did not forget to reproach  the Lithuanian authorities for continuing talks with Russia on  military transits through Lithuanian territory to Kaliningrad  Oblast, which may drag the republic into CIS military  cooperation. ""Military transport movements to Russia's Baltic  enclave,"" he concluded, ""are permissible only on the basis of  one-time, not long-term, agreements.""    Meanwhile, President Brazauskas said on the eve of the North  Atlantic bloc experts' arrival that Lithuania was ready to  switch to NATO weapons standards. Until recently, the  Lithuanian Republic (unlike Estonia, which has already switched  to NATO standards, and Latvia, which has only made statements to  that effect) has stated its commitment to weapons standards  adopted in Russia upon buying a significant share of military  property from the outgoing Russian Army. Now, however, Mr.  Brazauskas said, as it signed the ""Partnership for Peace""  program, Lithuania would have to switch to weapons in service in  NATO countries. Funds required for so costly an operation have  evidently not yet been found, hence for the time being the  government will use the money earmarked for culture, education,  and health.     "

This favorable development  should be extended this year. The Baltic States, harmonizing  their joint actions and the existing bilateral possibilities  will seek coordination in their foreign policy, and in  particular in strengthening of ties with the European political,  economic, security structures. The Presidents will also  initiate close cooperation among the embassies and other  diplomatic missions of the three States as well as support joint  representation in some States. Our three States strive for  closer cooperation with the Nordic States and the formula ""5+3""  fully meets the interests of the Baltic States.

We express our readiness to intensify the dialogue  in all fields and on all levels with a view to facilitating the  integration of the Visegrad and the Baltic States into European  political, economic and security structures. An important step  in this direction will be the conclusion of a free trade  agreement between the Baltic and Visegrad countries.

This will be the first high-level contact between Havana and  the government of Phnom Penh which was elected last year under  UN auspices.    The Cuban minister will meet with his Cambodian counterpart,  Norodom Sirivuth, who will welcome him officially at the capital  city airport of Pochentong. Sirivuth is the younger brother of  King Norodom Sihanouk.    Sirivuth will attend to the visiting delegation in his  capacity as acting head of government in the absence of Prime  Ministers Norodom Ranarith and Hun Sen, who are abroad.    Robaina will also be greeted during a special audience with  Chea Sim, the acting head of state and president of the National  Assembly, who has for the past months represented Sihanouk, who  is receiving medical treatment in China.    Before heading for Phnom Penh, the head of Cuban diplomacy  visited Indonesia, where he started his tour, Laos, and Myanmar  [Burma], and he made a stopover in Thailand's capital, Bangkok.    His next destinations are India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.    Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has found new  possibilities for exchanges and communication with the countries  that he visited. He added that the hosts voiced their interest  and desire to negotiate with Havana in the areas of health,  biotechnology, and sports, among others.    In his opinion, Cuba must study the economic explosion  experienced by this region and determine what is most applicable  to its own situation.    The most important aspect of this tour, Robaina pointed out,  is the degree of understanding and the opportunities we have  found to explain the true reality of the Cuban project.     "

[Kruglov] Let us clarify: On the basis of our investigatory  materials.    [Kaverin] What steps will be taken against Zhirinovskiy upon  his return from abroad?    [Kruglov] First, the Russian general prosecutor should  determine who will investigate the criminal case. Once he makes  up his mind on that, the division that will be tasked with the  investigation will resolve all the matters -- of course,  according to the law. The mechanism of such an investigation is  well known: Subpoenas, interrogations. The investigation will  be carried out in full as any investigation of an ordinary  criminal case.    [Kaverin] How will the investigation square with the  immunity Zhirinovskiy enjoys as a deputy?    [Kruglov] According to the new Russian Federation  Constitution, the status of a Russian Federation State Duma  deputy is not an obstacle to bringing a lawsuit and  investigating the case. The Constitution stipulates completely  clearly and unequivocally that State Duma approval is required  for arresting a deputy, searching his or her place, or detaining  him or her. Let me repeat: Arrest, search, and detention. That  is to say, a criminal lawsuit against a deputy may be brought  and the case may be investigated according to general rules, and  only later, depending on the results of the investigation -- if  reasons for a search, detention, or arrest emerge -- will the  general prosecutor make a petition to the State Duma requesting  that this or that deputy be stripped of his immunity on the  basis of the presented investigation results. Let me recall  that in accordance with the constitution in force at the time,  the Supreme Soviet had to be petitioned so as to bring a  criminal lawsuit itself against the deputy.    [Kaverin] Still, Viktor Alekseyevich, let us try to simulate  the situation: What if, say, Zhirinovskiy does not show up  under the subpoena. What will he be threatened with in this  event?    [Kruglov] Let us begin by stating that he is obliged to show  up in the first place. Because until charges are brought  against him he is technically considered a witness. And he will  be subpoenaed for questioning precisely in that capacity. If he  still does not come, the investigator will have to react.    [Kaverin] How? What measures are provided for in the law  for this situation?    [Kruglov] An ordinary citizen risks being forcibly brought  before the court if he does not have good reasons for his  failure to appear. This is enforced by the militia. But this  action has an element of enforcement to it, so it can  effectively be interpreted as a detention -- one of the three  (!) instances where deputies enjoy immunity.    [Kaverin] Then what we have is a closed circle: in order to  arrest or detain a guilty deputy one needs weighty reasons and  the State Duma's ""OK."" But in order to give this ""OK"" the Duma  needs facts that the investigation is unable to obtain from the  deputy...    [Kruglov] This is correct, to a certain extent. But you  should take into account that any criminal case is based not  only on testimony of the person under investigation. There  should be some other ideas, materials, documents, witnesses'  testimonies, evidence produced by expert appraisals. In short,  we need an objective record. This is why even though a deputy  may evade giving testimony as a witness, this does not mean that  a sufficient amount of evidence would not be collected to press  charges against him. I would like to repeat that all said above  is only theoretical in nature, but specifically these questions  concerning the suspect will be decided upon by an investigator.  The investigator who, under the law, inquires into the case and  makes all decisions independently.    [Kaverin] What is your opinion -- how long will the  investigation last?    [Kruglov] I do not know, this is a complex matter. It  depends on a huge number of circumstances.     "

He's on the third day of a week-long visit to the  country, and after the talks the South African Foreign Affairs  Minister Pik Botha stressed that the country must not become a  new headache for the rest of Africa.    [Begin recording] [Botha] I would urge all South Africans to  take note of the importance that Mr. Salim is attaching to this  country. He has come here. He's a man with great problems  himself that he must face in Africa, and he's come here with a  top delegation because of his interest in us, because of the  contribution that he wants to make to resolve our internal  problems amongst the parties. And it is against this background  that we have had a thorough exchange of the problems facing us,  and I can say that I'm impressed with his objective and clinical  analysis of the situation as he sees it.    [Salim] We think that it is very important for the leaders  of  South Africa and for the people of South Africa to look and  prepare beyond the coming elections. We want to see a strong  South Africa. We want to see South Africa as being one of the  key parts in the resolution of African problems -- not to be a  focus of Africa's attention in resolving South African problems.  We have had very, very useful, very extensive discussions with  the minister. We have known each other for a long time. Those  were difficult days, but it's such refreshing and such rewarding  to come and discuss in an atmosphere of understanding, of  concord, of almost identity of use on some or almost all the  major issues that face our continent, and also that face South  Africa.

""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" which grossed $37 million over the  four-day Memorial Day holiday, enjoyed the biggest opening weekend ever,  according to John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., which compiles  box office figures. The previous record-holder for an opening weekend was  ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" the second film in the trilogy, with  nearly $34 million in ticket sales. Despite Paramount's claims of breaking  records, the film's business was substantially boosted by the increase in  ticket prices, not because more people bought tickets. Since ""Temple of Doom""  opened in 1984, for example, ticket prices have increased by 22%, according to  figures provided by Motion Picture Assn. of America. Since 1981, when the first  installment of the trilogy opened, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" prices have  increased 48%.

The ministers had a closed door meeting. But sources in the  Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS that during the talks  attention was focussed on questions concerning political, trade  and economic cooperation between the two countries. According  to the Russian side, the questions do not conform to the  interests of the two states [as received]. Problems of military  and technical cooperation were also touched upon during the  negotiations.    Soskovets called on the Syrian side to ""constructive  cooperation"", and also expressed readiness to ""adopt specific  decisions"" during his three-day visit. In this context, he  offered to form three working groups. The first one to deal  with questions concerning mutual obligations, the second to  resolve econimic problems, and the third to deal with problems  of arms and special technologies. The first two groups from the  Russian side will be led by Minister for Foreign Economic  Relations Oleg Davydov, and the third by Chairman of the Russian  Committee for Defence Industry Viktor Glukhikh and the Russian  Defence Industry Committee Chairman Viktor Samoylov.    At the end of the talks Russian State Industry Committee  Chairman Igor Suchkov told ITAR-TASS that the delicate question  of Syria's debts was also touched upon during the talks. Till  date it amounts to about 10 billion U.S. dollars. In this  connection, he expressed assumption that if the Russian side  ""returns at least 20 per cent of the debts in the form of goods  and simply in cash, then it will be equivalent to those expenses  which we have borne.""    The second round of the Russian-Syrian talks will be held on  Tuesday.     "

This statement was made  by an Army source, who, with reference to his position, does not  wish to be named.    He said that, according to the customs and commercial  documents, Tamara should have been exported to Oman. However,  it was not transported to the Arab sultanate but was exported  from the Czech Republic to the United States via a Polish port,  said the source.    The U.S. Department of Defense was interested in Tamara.  According to the experts, the Czech radar system can reveal even  the ""invisible"" Stealth aircraft, whose development cost the  Pentagon billions of dollars. The U.S. Department of Defense,  therefore, decided to have a look at Tamara.    However, Czechoslovakia would obviously not have sold Tamara  to the Americans because U.S. research would have diminished the  customers' interest in this product.    Jaromir Novotny, director of the Defense Ministry's Foreign  Relations Department, has confirmed that the Americans now own  Tamara.    The Trade and Industry Ministry has confirmed that, in 1991,  a license was granted to Tesla Pardubice, the manufacturer of  Tamara, to export the radar system to Oman. It is apparent from  the documentation available that the Omani Defense Ministry had  pledged to be its end user.    Germany is the only Western country to have this  state-of-the-art radar system in its arsenal; it acquired it  after the dissolution of the GDR National People's Army.  Communist Czechoslovakia had sold Tamara and its predecessor,  Ramona, only to the Soviet Union and Syria.    Josef Opocensky, the director of the Tesla Pardubice state  enterprise, does not know anything about Tamara being exported  to the United States and insists that it was sold to Oman.     "

The board of directors  invited Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to speak. The  meeting proceeded in the traditional American style: The  negotiating table doubled as a dinner table. True, after Mr.  Shokhin's 40-minute speech there were so many questions about  Russian investment legislation that the deputy prime minister  did [not] have a chance to ""lunch.""    The American Chamber of Commerce, which has been operating  in  Moscow only since January, has begun to work with a knowledge of  its task. Which is not surprising: Its board of directors  includes representatives of the largest companies--from  Coca-Cola to Caterpillar, from Johnson  Johnson to General  Electric, from Philip Morris to Chase Manhattan. And the  communication with Mr. Shokhin shifted from problems of Russian  reforms and civil accord (he noted, in particular, that  parliament's readiness to reach agreement with the government  should be revealed as early as Friday--during the discussion of  the draft budget)--to questions related to business in Russia.  Here too, as the deputy prime minister noted, on the one hand,  Russia cannot use the old Soviet laws, and on the  other--business conditions cannot be changed frequently. In this  connection he recalled Boris Yeltsin's September edict which  introduced a three-year moratorium on changing legislation  regarding foreign firms operating in Russia. Other laws will  also have to wait their turn--in a couple of days the civil code  (""the most productive economic document"") will be submitted to  the State Duma, and the government's immediate plans include  laws on the banking system and foreign investments. From the  podium of the American Chamber of Commerce the deputy prime  minister presented an initiative to introduce one more  moratorium. This time regarding state structures that handle  foreign investments and redistribution of duties among them: ""Or  else we will all be 'improving' the structures but the investor,  in confusion, will not even know with whom he is dealing.""    The questions from the businessmen showed one thing:  Americans, even those who have firmly set their feet on Russian  soil along with their capital, cannot understand precisely what  it is here that does not coincide with their native laws. For  example, why their commercial banks and insurance companies are  not given freedom in Russia. Mr. Shokhin had to explain that one  strong insurance firm from the United States is capable of  crowding out practically all similar Russian ones in a year. And  in response to the obvious desire to feel at home in Russia  (from the standpoint of laws) the businessmen had to hear many  reproaches against their own authorities as well. The laws of  the United States, according to Mr. Shokhin's estimate, contain  up to 260 discriminatory restrictions against Russia. Bill  Clinton promised to abolish them back in Vancouver. In Russia  they expected that this would be done by a single act  (""restrictions regarding the USSR do not apply to Russia""), but  ""in Congress they decided to study each case individually.""  One-third of them have been abolished, but the congressmen will  have to work another couple of years on the rest of them. So  Russian exporters to the United States will not soon feel that  they are equal either.    [First box, page 3]    Some Information from U.S. Investment Legislation    --The United States does not require special permission or  preliminary registration of investment operations. The national  conditions envisioned for U.S. firms, as a rule, apply to joint  companies.    --Federal laws prohibit foreign investors from owning or  holding a controlling block of shares in corporations in the  spheres of television and radio broadcasting, telegraph, and  satellite communications systems, construction and operation of  nuclear power plants and pipelines, extraction of mineral  resources, and coastal or maritime shipping. Aid to foreign  investors at the federal level is most frequently granted in the  form of guaranteed loans.    --Supervision of the activity of foreign firms is provided  by  the Interdepartmental Committee on Foreign Investments  (consultative agency) which is answerable to Congress.  Monitoring of portfolio investments is the responsibility of the  Department of Finance.    --At the level of the states and local agencies the finance  department coordinates the activity of foreign capital and  leaves monitoring up to the states. A number of states have  programs for attracting investments and more than 20 have  missions in Europe. [end box]    [Second box, page 3]    American Investments in Russia    There are 953 Russian-American joint ventures registered in  Russia and the proportion of American capital in them is 46.3  percent. Including in the sphere of new technologies and the  petroleum and gas complex--44 joint ventures. Moreover, 327  enterprises with a total authorized capital of $2.3 billion  belong completely to U.S. investors.    Some joint projects:    --The Kirov plant, Uralmash, and the ZIL Joint-Stock Company  are working with Caterpillar on the creation of a  machine-building product (electric generators for drills,  internal combustion engines, trucks, and prime movers)    --With IBM and American Airlines they are developing a  system  for control of airline shipments (it is to replace the currently  existing Sirena)    --The Mosmed Joint-Stock Company and Baxter--a joint venture  for producing surgical instruments    --The AKRIKhIN Joint-Stock Company (Russia) and  Bristol-Myers--production of cardiovascular medical preparations    --The Novomoskovsk Household Chemical Plant and Proctor    Gamble--production of household chemicals and detergents.

At a news  conference he held at the airport before leaving Tunisia, he  said that President Zine El Abidine had a unique personality and  that his analyses were very clear. He also stressed the need to  intensify exchanges between the two countries, indicating that  the current export of Tunisian phosphate symbolized the new  relations that the two countries intended to establish. In the  same context, he said that he hoped President Ben Ali would pay  a visit to Argentina, adding that such a visit would offer new  opportunities to deepen bilateral relations on the one hand and  to deepen Argentina's relations with the Arab world on the other  hand.    The Argentine minister also talked about the importance of  strengthening bilateral relations as a necessary phase for the  building of relations between regional groupings, such as the  Arab Maghreb Union and the Organization of Cooperation and Trade  for Latin American countries [as heard]. He then touched on the  subject of South-South cooperation, saying that he had discussed  this matter with President Ben Ali and that strengthening  bilateral relations between developing countries was the only  way to improve the level of cooperation between the countries of  the southern hemisphere. Finally, he announced that the  Argentine economy minister would visit Tunisia next April and  said he hoped this visit would open important prospects for a  fruitful exchange between businessmen in the two countries.    The Argentine minister handed President Ben Ali a written  message from President Carlos Menem yesterday. The minister  also told President Ben Ali that his country was looking forward  to his forthcoming visit, saying he hoped that it would take  place as soon as possible because it would contribute to the  intensification of the good relations of cooperation between the  two countries.

The council was established six months ago to address  environmental issues and is chaired by former Prime Minister  Anan Panyarachun.    The five projects are: pesticide-free agricultural villages,  renovation of Khlong Lot, study of lignite and its impact on the  environment, environmental conservation circle (ECC), and green  labelling.    The council's objectives are: to provide reliable  information and guidance to distinguish genuine  environment-friendly products; to encourage the production of  green products using clean technologies; to promote energy  conservation and recycling; to promote the establishment of a  third-party labeller who can offer an unbiased opinion to back  up marketing claims, to establish more demanding standards for  companies to make environmentally sound products; and to promote  environmental awareness among manufacturers and consumers.    Chaiyot Bunyakitdi, director of the Thailand Environment  Institute's business and environment programme, said the green  labelling project will be significant in helping identify  projects that have proven to be less destructive to the  environment. To date, 19 member firms have agreed to  participate in the labelling project.    Environment-friendly products have achieved international  popularity among environment-conscious consumers.    Mr Chaiyot said the council will vigorously promote this  project and hopes to establish guidelines to assist firms in  their marketing claims, often not entirely accurate, of products  less damaging to the environment.    The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development  (TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by  Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green  labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the  Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial  Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection,  Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press  Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand,  Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25  representatives from TBCSD.

Iran's charge d'affaires, Gholamreza Ansari, was told of the  decision on Thursday [26 May] when he was summoned to see the  Foreign Office Minister of State, Douglas Hogg.    Foreign Office officials refused to comment yesterday on the  meeting except to insist it was not linked to the fatwa calling  for the killing of Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic  Verses -- the main irritant in Anglo-lranian relations.    Iran's embassy also refused to comment.    The expulsion follows recent British charges that Iranian  intelligence has been in clandestine contact with the IRA. This  was denied by Tehran, which then made the charge --  conspicuously not denied -- that Britain's M16 had planted a bug  in the London embassy.    Unusual secrecy surrounded the expulsion decision, and it  was  not clear whether it was related to the IRA row or to other  bilateral strains. Suggestions of a Bosnian link were played  down. Mr Ansari was told there was irrefutable evidence of  wrongdoing.    Britain wants to keep the expulsion quiet to preclude  Iranian  tit-for-tat expulsions. Both countries are limited, by mutual  agreement, to 15 diplomats in each other's capital.    Reticence about the decision stems from concern that  publicity given to the IRA allegations last month was  counterproductive, provoking anti-British hostility in Iran,  including calls for a boycott of British trade or even the  severing of links.    Relations between the two countries have been stormy since  Iran's Islamic revolution in l979. Ties were severed in 1989  over the Rushdie affair but restored in 1990.     "

The statement severely  denounces the British side for crudely interfering in China's  internal affairs. The following is the full text of the  spokesman's statement:    Since the beginning of last year, the British Parliament's  House of Commons External Affairs Committee has held several  hearings on the so-called China issue. On 13 April the  committee published a report: ""British-Sino Relations Before and  After 1997."" The report openly advocated [gu chui 7849 0706]  the adoption of a policy of further confrontation against China  on the Hong Kong issue and preposterously commented on China's  domestic affairs, thus crudely interfering in China's internal  affairs. In this regard we express our strong indignation and  regret.    On the Hong Kong issue, the report actually admitted that  the  British side, proceeding from its erroneous appraisal of the  prospects for the development of the situation in China, indeed  changed its policy toward Hong Kong, supported Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten's erroneous way of doing things on the  Hong Kong issue, continued to pursue confrontation against  China, and even agitated for [gu dong 7849 0520] ""international  support"" on the Hong Kong issue. We are shocked by the British  Parliament's House of Commons External Affairs Committee's  actually issuing such a document and adopting such a position on  the Hong Kong issue at a time when the truth of the controversy  between China and Britain over the question of the political  system in Hong Kong is being understood by more and more people  and when the British side indicated time and again its desire to  cooperate with China in other spheres.    The report preposterously claimed that by 1997 China may not  necessarily change the framework for the three-level political  system established according to the Hong Kong governor's ""three  violations"" program. The Chinese Government has stated many  times that in order to safeguard the dignity of the Sino-British  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, the Legislative Council and  regional organizations established according to the Hong Kong  governor's program can exist only until 30 June 1997. After  that, the first government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region [SAR], its Legislative Council, and  regional organizations must be established according to the  Basic Law. We resolutely support this solemn position of the  Chinese Government.    The report went so far as to attack Article 18 and Article  158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR of the People's  Republic of China, claiming that these articles are ""a serious  potential threat to the autonomy of the Hong Kong SAR and to the  implementation of the joint declaration.""    In accordance with the provisions of Article 18 of the  Basic Law, the NPC Standing Committee has the power to decide,  when necessary, to place Hong Kong SAR in a state of emergency.  Article 158 of the Basic Law stipulates that the power of  interpretation of this law shall be vested in the NPC Standing  Committee. These provisions are concrete expressions that the  Chinese Government resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong  Kong beginning on 1 July 1997. The report's attack on these  provisions is utterly unjustifiable; it only reveals British  true motive to attempt to extend its control over and influence  on Hong Kong.    The report takes great pains to advocate promotion of  democracy and safeguard of human rights in Hong Kong. This only  makes people see through more clearly British hypocrisy and  ulterior motives on the Hong Kong issue. The Chinese Government  has pointed out on numerous occasions that the essence of  controversy over Hong Kong's political structure is not a  question of, indeed, whether to develop democracy or not; rather  it is a question of whether to observe international commitment  and whether to bring about the convergence with the Basic Law  and achieve Hong Kong's stable transition. Facts speak louder  than words. It was the Chinese Government which, in accordance  with the policy of ""one country, two systems,"" at the earliest  proposed practicing ""a high degree of autonomy"" in Hong Kong and  ""Hong Kong be governed by the Hong Kong people themselves."" The  Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR also has adequate, specific  provisions on the development of democracy and the rights and  freedom to be enjoyed by the Hong Kong people after Hong Kong's  return to the embrace of the motherland. Under the British rule  of more than 100 years, when did Hong Kong enjoy democracy and  human rights? Even today, Britain still uses ""Letters Patent,""  ""Royal Instructions,"" and similar statutes of colonial rule to  govern Hong Kong. What qualifications does it have to talk  glibly about Hong Kong's democracy and human rights? Now that  only a few years before its withdrawal from Hong Kong, Britain  hypocritically and hurriedly talks volubly about what it calls  democracy and human rights. Its true motives are like ""Sima  Zhao's ill intent known to all"" [the villain's design is  obvious]. It merely tries to divide Hong Kong people and create  chaos there.    The British House of Commons External Affairs Committee's  report proposes the establishment of so-called human rights  commission and human rights monitoring organization in Hong  Kong. The goal is nothing other than to place new obstacles to  Hong Kong's smooth transition. The British should understand  that as in the case of the political framework, any decision  unilaterally made by the British side during the transitional  period on major matters spanning beyond 1997 will not be  recognized by the Chinese side.    The report also brazenly attempted to meddle and interfere  in  China's internal affairs by openly advocating Tibet's self-  determination. As is known to all, Tibet has been an  inalienable part of the Chinese territory since ancient times.  Before 1959, a feudal serf system was practiced there, which  went even further than the system practiced in the Middle Ages  in Europe in terms of darkness and cruelty. It is safe to say  that old Tibet was one of the regions in the world where human  rights were infringed upon most seriously. After abolishing the  feudal serf system, Tibet has taken the broad road of national  unity and economic development, with people living and working  in peace and contentment. This is a change of epoch-making  significance in safeguarding human rights and promoting social  progress.    The writer of the report dislikes such change but extols  those serf owners who trampled on human rights as ""defenders of  human rights."" This greatly ridicules human rights. In fact,  they did that in order to sabotage the unification and national  unity of China. May we offer a piece of advice to the writer of  the report -- that it would be better to take a prudent attitude  on the issue of Tibet because of Britain's historical role in  the past. We want to sternly point out that all attempts to  interfere in China's internal affairs by using the so-called  Tibet issue will be resolutely opposed by the entire Chinese  people, including the compatriots of Tibetan nationality, and  that their attempts can never succeed.    The External Affairs Committee of the British House of  Commons has also suggested that the British parliament should  make contacts with Taiwan's ""Legislative Yuan"" and has asked the  British Government to relax its restrictions toward Taiwan. It  should be pointed out that there is only one China in the world,  that Taiwan is a part of China, and that the People's Republic  of China is the sole legitimate government representing the  whole China. This has long been publicly recognized by the  international society. The absurd remarks made by the Foreign  Affairs Committee of the British House of Commons related to the  Taiwan issue runs counter to the principle for the establishment  of diplomatic relations between China and the United Kingdom.  The real intention of the committee is to create ""two Chinas""  or ""one China, one Taiwan."" This will be resolutely opposed by  the entire Chinese people, including people in Taiwan.    The report of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the British  House of Commons also publicized ""the Chinese threat"" with an  ulterior motive in order to sow dissension between China and her  neighboring countries. All people know that China has always  followed an independent, peaceful foreign policy. China is a  positive factor in safeguarding peace and stability in the  world. Those who fabricate ""the Chinese threat"" are totally  groundless and their efforts will be futile.    The External Affairs Committee of the Chinese NPC has  attached great importance to maintaining and developing friendly  relations and cooperation with the Foreign Affairs Committee of  the British parliament. The Chinese side has never done  anything which would harm the United Kingdom, the British  parliament, or relations between the two countries. However,  recently some people of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  British House of Commons have repeatedly done things which will  harm relations between the two countries, while they have also  stressed the need to maintain and develop Sino-British  relations. People cannot but ask: What is their intention?  Where do they want to lead relations between the two countries?  We can say with certainty that the viewpoints and suggestions  which are hostile to China put forward in the report are not  only extremely harmful to Sino-British relations but will also  bring harm to the long-term interests of the United Kingdom. We  believe that those things will be disliked [bu yuan kan dao di  0008 1959 4170 0451 4104] by those who truly show concern for  and protect the traditional friendly relations between China and  the United Kingdom.

SZDSZ leader Gabor Kuncze and Istvan  Szentivanyi, deputy chairman of the Foreign Relations Commission  of Hungary's parliament and a member of SZDSZ, answered the  questions asked by the journalists.    Our correspondent Letitia Militaru inquired about the  SZDSZ's  chances in the 8 May elections.    [Begin recording] [Militaru, in Romanian with simultaneous  Hungarian translation] What are SZDSZ's chances in the 8 May  elections?    [Kuncze, in Hungarian with simultaneous Romanian  translation]  Naturally I cannot discuss this issue in an unbiased way, but I  think our chances are very good. According to public opinion  polls, the SZDSZ is the second-strongest party and its  popularity is growing continuously. If we add up the two  liberal-oriented parties in Hungary, the liberal bloc could have  a great weight.    [Militaru] How does your party view the Romanian-Hungarian  relations?    [Kuncze] In the eyes of SZDSZ, Hungarian-Romanian ties have  a strategic importance. It is a strategic one owing to the fact  that we are neighbors, owing to the Hungarian ethnic minority  living here, and owing to our economic interests. The  efficiency of Hungarian diplomacy could be measured by the way  in which it will manage to achieve progress in this issue.    [Militaru] What does the Hungarian ethnic minority living in  Romania mean to the SZDSZ?    [Kuncze] I think it is important to state that we cannot  restrict our bilateral relations merely to our ties with that  minority, which should be just a part of our bilateral  relations. Culturally speaking, the Hungarian ethnic minority  belongs to the Hungarian nation. Hungary's Constitution  stipulates that every Hungarian government has to consider  itself responsible for the Hungarians living outside the  country's borders and to protect their interests. As far as I  know, Romania's Constitution, in Paragraph 2 of its Article 7,  contains similar stipulations.     "

They are to improve internal structure, particularly the chain of command and control, and to improve management. Central to this task is ensuring the London-based Kuwait Investment Office is firmly subordinated to the KIA's central authority and never again allowed to arrogate to itself the power to embark on uncontrolled financial adventures. The KIO's general manager since February last year, Mr Yousef al-Awadi, needed only one month to supervise the merger of KIO into KIA. This was completed last March. The second priority is to establish a mature relationship with a revived and forceful national assembly (parliament). This will entail KIA's (and the government's) acceptance of a degree of sustained public accountability and parliamentary scrutiny. If good intentions prevail, the new-look KIA will reassure Kuwaitis that their national wealth is in safe hands. Overall strategy is being fine-tuned by the 'Strategy and Planning Task Force', an internal committee due to complete its work later this month. Relations with the National Assembly should improve over time. The authority of the national assembly to scrutinise the KIA - and the government's policies that dictate the KIA's investment decisions - was further strengthened by its unanimous rejection last month of the controversial ministers' trial law. This imposed restrictions on ministers being brought to trial. The immediate issue was whether Sheikh Ali al-Khalifah al-Sabah, the former oil and finance minster, should stand trial following allegations of embezzlement from the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company. The trial opened on February 5, and Sheikh Ali was among those charged. The principle was as important as the immediate issue. Mr Ismail al-Shatti, an Islamic conservative who is head of the national assembly's finance committee, described it as a 'revolutionary law in Kuwait's financial life'.

On Saturday [19  March] in Berlin FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP], stressed the ""friendly  special relationship"" between Germany and France. French  President Francois Mitterrand told the AGENCE FRANCE PRESS (AFP)  news agency: ""We have cooperated with the chancellor in the  best spirit and we shall continue to do so in the interest of  both our countries and Europe.""    In Berlin Kinkel said that this ""extremely important""  special  relationship is and remains ""Europe's central axis."" The past  has proven that in Europe much is possible if Germany and France  cooperate, but only little if this relationship is disturbed.    ""France can rely absolutely on Germany,"" Kinkel stressed.  Solo actions are pointless, the Germans have to remember that.  Germany does not want any prerogatives. Only together can the  tasks that Europe is facing in the future be mastered. Kinkel  noted that he was saying this in Berlin because in this city  France defended the freedom of Germany and of the world for  years. The FRG foreign minister announced a ""long-planned visit  to France.""    At the land party congress of the Thuringian FDP, Kinkel  said  concerning the alleged statements by French Ambassador Francois  Scheer about Kinkel's role in the negotiations for membership in  the European Union with Scandinavian countries and Austria: If  an ambassador says incorrect things, it must be possible to  refute this quite clearly. He has advocated expansion to the  north just as expansion to the south.    Kinkel also commented on the Bundeswehr. It must get out of  the parties' quarrel and needs quiet for planning, financing,  and organization. The FDP wants to prepare the Bundeswehr for  peacekeeping and peacemaking tasks. This costs money.

According to the PLO, this diplomatic initiative cannot but  concern negotiations taking place on the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  Giuseppe De Carli reports:    [De Carli] The PLO is asking the Vatican to set up a  permanent bilateral commission to define relations between the  Holy See and the Palestinian people, between the Catholic and  Islamic communities in the Holy Land. The PLO delegation, led  by Muhammad Zuhdi [Muhammad Zuhayr al-Nashashibi], Yasir  'Arafat's diplomatic adviser, was received this morning by  Monsignor Jean-Louis Tauran, the Holy See's foreign minister,  and Claudio Maria Celli, his deputy.    The Palestinians are also asking for an agreement similar to  the 30 December 1993 agreement that ratified the formalization  of relations between the Holy See and Israel and their mutual  diplomatic recognition. There has still been no official PLO  reaction to this agreement, but it has been judged premature and  inopportune by some Palestinians in the occupied territories.  However, it is noted that the Palestinian delegation has not  come to Rome to protest, but to build a fuller relationship with  the Vatican. At the center of the talks are ways to apply the  agreement on Gaza and Jericho and, above all, the matter of the  holy city of Jerusalem. The PLO delegation welcomed the request  the pope made, during his address to the diplomatic corps, for a  special statute for Jerusalem, a spiritual reference point for  the believers of the three great monotheistic religions.    A communique from the Vatican press office, released just a  few minutes ago, said the meeting heralds the beginning of a  more official dialogue between the Holy See and Palestinian  representatives.

The Thailand Business Council for Sustainable Development  (TBCSD) has proposed establishing a committee, to be chaired by  Permanent Secretary for Industry Siwawong Changkhasiri, on green  labelling guidelines and comprising representatives from the  Federation of Thai Industries, Board of Trade, Thai Industrial  Standards Institute, Office of Consumer Protection,  Environmental Engineering Association of Thailand, Press  Association, Public Relations Confederation of Thailand,  Marketing Association of Thailand and no more than 25  representatives from TBCSD.

Sandoval said the U.S. decision ""is incoherent,  and lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is  the responsibility of producers as well as consumers.""    Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru  ""the mafias could transport drugs without fear of being  intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug  enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992.""    Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American  Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said  that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided ""unilaterally,  and without consultation.""    Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the  flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the  withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to  control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border.    Velarde said: ""This will greatly hurt drug enforcement,  because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to  detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent  of which are used to carry cocaine.""    The suspension of aid was recommended by the State  Department  with the argument that shooting down civilian airplanes  suspected of carrying drugs ""is a violation of international  law.""    The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are  equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air  Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes,  which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to  land, were shot down.    Velarde said that Peru will continue ""with its own means""  the  drug enforcement effort, but he indicated that the detection of  airplanes carrying drugs ""will be slower, difficult, and  expensive"" without the U.S. aid.

A post-Cold War era, in which a  multi-polar trend is an important mark, has begun. How to regard  the effect of the post-Cold War era on India's foreign policy,  what opportunities and challenges the post-Cold War era offers  for India's China policy, and what the trend of development of  India's relations with China will be are all questions meriting  diligent study.    I    With the end of the Cold War, very many changes have  occurred  in many factors affecting India's foreign policy, particularly  its China policy.    (1) No Revival of the Special Relationship Between  India and the USSR (Russia). For a long time, India used  the strategic confrontation between the United States and the  USSR, as well as the serious antagonisms between the USSR and  China to build a special relationship with the USSR that  encompassed the political, economic, military, and security  areas. Following dissolution of the USSR, a great easing in  relations between Russia and the United States, and maintenance  of normal relations between Russia and China, bilateral  political relations between India and Russia began to cool,  economic and trade relations declined severely, and the buying  and selling of arms virtually halted for a period. During a  visit to India in January 1993, Boris Yeltsin said openly, ""Past  relations between the USSR and India had a marked coloration of  joint opposition to the United States and China. Today, all that  has passed."" India, 70 percent of whose conventional weapons  came from the former USSR, is now urgently waiting for Russia  and other Commonwealth of Independent States countries to supply  spare parts. However, how to pay the hard currency that Russia  wants is an extraordinarily difficult problem for India, which  is extremely short of foreign exchange. On the issue of Russia's  selling low-temperature rocket launchers to India, for a time,  Russia suspended contracts for selling and transferring  technology to India in response to U.S. pressure. Later on,  though it decided to sell the rocket launchers, Russia did not  honor its contract for the transfer of technology, thereby  arousing intense Indian dissatisfaction. This fully shows a  decline in India's stature on Russia's diplomatic chessboard.  India has no choice but to re-evaluate its strategy toward other  countries, and readjust its outmoded foreign policy, including  improvement of relations with China.    (2) India Both Improves Relations With the United  States and Also Must Counter American Pressures. With the  end of the Cold War, India decided to improve its relations with  the United States because of its own strategic interest. India  figured that vigorous strengthening of India-U.S. relations  could effectively contain its adversary, Pakistan; reduce its  own defense pressures; win American investment and assistance;  and improve its own international standing. To this end, India  took some strong actions and made some gestures for drawing  close to the United States. In the economic field, for example,  it steadily reduced policy restraints, widened the degree of  economic liberalization, made efforts to open markets, and  improved the investment climate. In the military field, it also  began to build a cooperative relationship with the United  States. However, because of different Indian and American  strategic interests, conflicts and frictions continued between  both sides on many important issues. With the end of the Cold  War, the United States became the world's only super power.  Impelled by its ""strategy of expansion, and relying on its  powerful position, it flagrantly meddled in the affairs of other  countries, frequently applying embargoes in an effort to forces  the countries concerned to act according to its will."" Out of  concern for its own strategic interests, the United States  pressured India on the prevention of nuclear and missile  proliferation issues, and on the human rights and intellectual  property issues. Under these circumstances, India's improvement  and strengthening of relations with China could improve its  position for dealing with the United States, giving it more  diplomatic leeway.    (3) Changes in the Non-Aligned Movement Position and  India's Role. India has always made the nonaligned movement an  important mainstay of its diplomatic activity, in negotiating  between the United States and the USSR, and in maneuvering among  political groupings to achieve the goal of using contradictions  for its own benefit, and gaining advantages from both sides.  From the time of its birth in 1961 until the present day, the  nonaligned movement has developed into a quite influential  international political force of more than 100 nations. India  was one of the non-aligned movement's founding nations. Its  distinctive position and its important role in the movement has  received wide attention from international society.  Consequently, India has benefitted greatly. However, the  non-aligned movement was a product of the United States-USSR  confrontation era. After the post-Cold War era, its premises  changed enormously. Fairly early on, the non-aligned movement  paid attention largely to economic development issues, but in  recent years, Indonesia has consistently chaired it, so  conditions for India to gain diplomatic advantage through the  non-aligned movement have changed. In addition, during the  post-Cold War era, the stature and role of the United Nations  has risen. China is a permanent member of the Security Council,  has very good relations with numerous non-aligned nations, is a  non-aligned movement observer, and has very great power to  influence numerous major international issues such as the new  international political and economic order, and United Nations  Security Council reform. Under these circumstances, improvement  of relations with China, expansion of bilateral cooperation on  international issues, and gaining China's support for India's  becoming a permanent member of the Security Council to increase  its international standing are the main considerations in  China's further improvement and strengthening of relations with  China.    (4) Increasing Competition in Overall National  Strength. Following the end of the Cold War, India made  vigorous development of its economy the main goal of its  national strategy. It is already profoundly aware of the  following as a result of the Cold War and its aftermath: a  nation's existence and development, and its standing and role in  the world are determined largely by its overall national  strength. Moreover, the most important factor in overall  national strength is economic strength. Only when a country has  great economic strength in being can it occupy a fairly leading  position in the contest for overall national strength, and only  then can it have a stronger position and gain the right to speak  out on international affairs. This being the case, India's task  is how better to remain on top of changes in the situation,  create a peaceful and stable surrounding environment, do all  possible to promote economic growth, and raise the standard of  living of its people. In order to do this, India has given  improvement of India-China relations a fairly high priority on  its diplomatic agenda. It desires to use improved India-China  relations to ease the tense situation on the India-China border  in order to cut back on military outlays for defense in its  north. In addition, economically, it has further opened the door  for trade and technical cooperation with China. Borrowing from  China's experience and lessons in reform and opening to the  outside world enables India smooth performance of the economic  reform now underway in India.    II    Favorable conditions and a reliable basis exist for the  improvement and strengthening of relations between India and  China.    (1) The Position of Both Parties Is Close on Quite a  Few Regional and International Issues, and the Common Ground Is  Increasing. Both India and China hope that the south Asia  region will become increasingly peaceful, stable, and  prosperous. They hope that the nations concerned will resolve  problems existing in bilateral relationships through discussion  and negotiations. They hope that south Asia regional cooperative  alliances will develop further, and that substantive  breakthroughs will be scored in promoting regional economic  progress and raising the people's standard of living.    India and China speak a common language on many issues  including the building of new international political and  economic order following the Cold War, north-south relations,  human rights, and environmental protection. Both India and China  oppose hegemony, oppose power politics, and oppose domination of  the world and issuance of orders to other countries by a single  or a small number of nations. Both India and China believe that  the five principles of peaceful co-existence are the standard  for handling relations between one nation and another, and  should be used as a foundation for building a new post-Cold War  international order. On the human rights issue, both sides  believe that the right to develop is an important aspect of  human rights, and that human rights are a matter legally within  the purview of a nation's sovereignty. Both sides oppose a small  number of western nations use of human rights as a pretext for  meddling in internal affairs, and they do not approve of certain  western nations use of economic assistance as a means of  exerting pressure on developing nations. Both parties have  reached agreement in discussions on human rights issues in the  forums concerned, and they have several times foiled the  intentions of certain western countries to use human rights to  meddle in the internal affairs of other countries.    (2) Steady Advances Have Been Made on Bilateral  Relations Thanks to the Joint Efforts of the Governments of Both  Nations. Politically, following the visits of Rajiv Ghandi  to China and Premier Li Peng's visit to India, in September 1993  Indian Premier Rao made a successful visit to China. This was an  important chapter in the history of relations between the two  nations that is bound to produce a profound and far reaching  effect on exchanges and cooperation in the political, economic,  cultural, and other fields. During Rao's visit to China, India  and China formally signed Agreement on Maintenance of  Peace and Tranquility in the India-China Border Actual Control  Line Area, together with three other documents, namely:  Cooperative Agreement Between the Indian Ministry of News  Broadcasting and the Chinese Ministry of Radio, Cinema, and  Television, Agreement Between the Governments of India and China  on Environmental Cooperation,and Protocol Between the  Governments of India and China on Widening Border Trade on Both  Sides of Shibuqila [phonetic] Pass.    The Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility  in the India-China Border Actual Control Line Area provides  that India-China border problems shall be discussed and resolved  through peaceful and friendly means, neither side using weapons  or threatening the use of weapons against each other. Until such  time as both nations resolve border problems, both sides shall  strictly respect and observe the actual line of control between  both parties. Both sides shall maintain its military forces at  the minimum level in the actual control line areas to improve  chances for the steady development of neighborly and friendly  relations between the two nations. This agreement is bound to  improve further the political atmosphere for India-China  relations and create favorable conditions for ultimate  resolution of border problems. Actually, both nations are taking  actions in the border area to build confidence. Although some  issues require further discussion, a very good beginning has  certainly been made. That the Indian and Chinese armies have  begun to build a relationship with each other has attracted  attention. This is greatly beneficial for improving bilateral  understanding and increasing mutual confidence. Not long ago,  diplomatic and military expert teams from both sides held  discussion on both nation's reducing the size of military forces  garrisoning the border, and demarcating a control line in  contested areas in which certain progress was made. Both sides  expressed a desire to adopt a constructive attitude about the  handling of border problems.    Economically, India is a large nation with a  population of nearly 900 million, which is in the process of  pursuing a new economic policy in an effort to change quickly  its impoverished and backward circumstances. Improvement of  economic and trade relations with China is a universal desire of  Indian industrialists and businessmen. Some advances have been  made in economic relations between India and China in recent  years, but far from the amount befitting the economic size and  potential of the two nations. In 1993, bilateral trade between  the two nations increased to $675 million. This is a heartening  advance, but still far from enough. A very great potential  remains.    In addition, border peoples on both sides of the India-China  border yearn for further development of border trade. Although  some progress has been made on bilateral border trade, it still  does not meet needs. Foreseeably, with further improvement of  relations between the two nations, China and India will open up  more trade channels in a steady expansion of the amount of  border trade.    In the realm of scientific and technical  cooperation, India's peaceful uses of atomic energy  technology, agricultural technology, genetic engineering, and  computer technology -- particularly software development  technology and marine development technology -- have attracted  the interest of China. China's small blast furnace technology,  small hydropower technology, and space technology have  benefitted India. By making use of the strengths of each other  to remedy weaknesses, and by cooperating with each other in  these regards, both sides can speed up development of their own  economy, reduce technological dependence on other nations, and  help make relations between both nations more mature and solid.  Currently, the two nations have begin technical cooperation in  the fields of agriculture, biological engineering, and  metallurgy.    III    It cannot be denied that further development of India-China  relations requires further efforts to overcome some obstacles  and difficulties.    India still harbors some apprehensions about China. The  first  apprehension is that China's might and its rise as a political  force may damage India's national security. Retired Indian  General Sharma said that despite the steady increase in  diplomatic and cultural exchanges between India and China, one  certainly could not belittle the ""latent threat"" from China.  India still feels that a nuclear-armed China poses a serious  challenge to its security. Actually, China's national strategy  rests on the five principles of peaceful co-existence that China  and India jointly espouse, and on the development of friendly  relations with all nations. India is a developing country, and  it is also a neighbor. More than that, it is a nation with whom  China emphasizes the development of friendly relations. Comrade  Deng Xiaoping said long ago: ""A Chinese threat to India does not  exist, nor does an Indian threat to China exist. We hope the we  will develop, and we hope that you will develop too."" Both  China's and India's increase in strength will make a greater  contribution to Asia and world peace and stability. China is a  nuclear nation, but when China exploded its first atom bomb, it  clearly promised never to be first to use nuclear weapons, and  never to use or threaten use of nuclear weapons against a  non-nuclear nation and non-nuclear territory. China lives up to  its promises to the letter, and it has always striven to for a  complete elimination of nuclear weapons in order to prevent  nuclear proliferation.    Another Indian apprehension about China is the fear that  development of relations between China an Pakistan may impair  India-China relations. The truth is that because of the long,  effective cooperation between China and Pakistan on political,  economic, and international issues, friendly relations have  steadily developed between the two nations. China has great  regard for Pakistan as a friend deserving of trust, while, at  the same time, China also highly regards its relationship with  India. China hopes that Sino-Indian, Sino-Pakistani, and  Indian-Pakistani relations will develop simultaneously in a  benign cycle. China earnestly hopes that India and Pakistan will  negotiate and parlay to reach a satisfactory solution to the  problems existing in their bilateral relations, will change the  low-intensity warfare that exists in the Kashmir region, and  will gradually ease tensions. Not only is this in the interests  of both India and Pakistan, but also in the interest of peace  and stability in Asia.    At the same time, some problems may impair India-China  relations. Examples include China's concern about the activities  to split up the motherland that some Tibetans conduct in India.  China endorses the enduring and consistent position that the  Indian government has announced, namely that Tibet is an  autonomous region of China, and that it will not permit the  Dalai Lama clique to conduct activities in India in opposition  to the Chinese rule. In reality, however, there are some  people in Indian society who support actions by the Dalai Lama  clique to split the motherland. They seek to make Tibet a buffer  zone between India and China. This can only serve to arouse  vigilance on the part of China.    To summarize the foregoing, despite the existence of some  problems between India and China, both sides must further  increase understanding and confidence, and satisfactorily handle  and solve them. However, a further expansion of economic, trade,  scientific and technical, and cultural relations, a great easing  of the confrontation in the military area, further abatement in  the border situation, and increased international cooperation  between India and China may be foreseen. Greater cooperation  between India and China is consistent with the post-Cold War  historical tide, and it is consistent with the common interests  of the people of both nations. Both India and China are large  countries whose total population is close to 2.2 billion. They  deserve to play a greater role on the world stage. Prospects are  extremely broad for an increase in mutual cooperation between  the two countries in building their own country and establishing  a new international order.     "
0,FT943-10560 ,"FT943-10560 _AN-EHDDVAC2FT 940804   FT  04 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tender process does not lead to best solutions      From Ms PAULINE GRANT   Sir, I wonder if organisations which invite consultants to tender for business are aware of an increasingly counter-productive trend. Tendering is becoming more widespread, particularly in the public sector under pressure to demonstrate that it is able to manage costs in a business-like fashion. Indeed, increasingly we are being asked not just to tender for work, but to spend a great deal of time compiling information in order to be placed on the list of those who might later be invited to tender. The words 'market testing' might thrill civil servants, but they send a chill of horror through the hearts of a great many small consultancy outfits. There is a strong feeling that responding to tenders in the 'softer' areas such as management development is in effect giving away free consultancy. This is very different from tendering to more technical specifications where it is entirely appropriate to compare costs of using one provider rather than another. Cost comparison is rarely the best means of evaluating tenders in non-technical areas. Tendering takes time, and time is what consultants sell. Time not only to put the response together, but to hold discussions with the inviting organisation so that it is offered what is believed to be the best solution. However, this is not charged to the inviting organisation - even travel expenses have to be absorbed - and therefore becomes a hidden cost to other organisations with which they work. This is grossly unfair. If those who can provide the best solutions are being deterred from offering them, something is going badly wrong. The original intention is not being achieved and some more creative thinking is required to provide an effective alternative that will encourage providers to encourage rather than put them off.

New Delhi and Washington  appear to be heading for yet another round of acrimonious  exchange with the Clinton administration's reported move to  deliver 71 F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan.    It is as yet unclear whether the administration is  considering an unconditional delivery of the planes or whether,  it plans to obtain specific, nuclear non-proliferation-related  assurances from Islamabad prior to any delivery.    The possibility of a qualitative shift in the weapons  balance  in South Asia came into sharp focus when the South Dakota  Republican Senator, Mr. Larry Pressler, disclosed that the US  defence department was keen on completing the sale deed of the  combat aircrafts to Pakistan.    Further corroboration of the F-16 transfer was provided on  the very next day by Ms. Robin Raphel, the assistant secretary  of state for South Asia.    During a testimony to the house foreign affairs  sub-committee  on Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Raphel said that the aircrafts in  question had already been sold to Pakistan; it was now just a  matter of delivery.    She said that certain aspects of amendment which applied to  the transfer of the fighter planes, could still be used as a  ""leverage"" to persuade Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme.    This unfolding episode forcefully reinforces yet again, the  perception of an unabated deterioration in Indo-US relations.    This was reflected in a March 9 New Delhi-datelined dispatch  in THE NEW YORK TIMES. The report, ""US Remarks Over Kashmir  Anger Indians"" said that for now, the Indian government's  unhappiness with the Clinton administration ""seem minimal,  although the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has shelved  plans to visit Washington soon.""    Speaking to THE TIMES OF INDIA, Dr. Sumit Ganguly, a  researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Centre observed that the  Indo-US relations under the Clinton administration had suffered  enormously ""because of a number of careless, thoughtless, and  tactless statements"" and gestures by administration officials.    These included some routine letters from the White House  over  which there was no supervision and ""a couple of singularly  tactless statements"" by Ms. Raphel.    In contrast to popular perception in India, Washington was  not obsessed with Kashmir, Dr. Ganguly noted, pointing out that  the secretary of state, Mr. Warren Christopher, did not even  mention Kashmir in any of his prepared testimonies.    The administration was concerned about nuclear  non-proliferation, but without devoting the same intensity of  attention to India-Pakistan, as to Iran, Iraq and North Korea.    Fourteen months into the Clinton regime, the damage to  Indo-US relations appears unabated with the White House  continuing to issue auto-signed letters to reply to anti-Indian  Congressmen who repeatedly refer to the Indian state of Punjab,  as ""Punjab, Khalistan.""    American scholars and administration officials, however,  have  termed the Indian protests as an ""over-reaction"" to minor issues  and gestures by politicians towards their constituents.    Some analysts, however, point to the Clinton  administration's  bankruptcy on foreign policy issues, with recent US diplomatic  conflicts even with such allies as Japan, France and Britain.    By the same token, these analysts say that if India wants to  be taken seriously by the US in its foreign policy  considerations, tangible actions showing displeasure with the US  would have to be seriously considered.    ""The US will not take India's position on Kashmir seriously  unless New Delhi demonstrates that it means business and that it  is prepared to put an end to international terrorism by  undertaking a hot pursuit of terrorists directly into Pakistan,""  a Washington-based Indian-American analyst said.    He added that such a legitimate move aimed at eliminating  terrorist training camps in Pakistan ""would ring the right  belles at the situation room in the White House.""    The Clinton administration's latest act of insensitivity  towards India, is the administration's reported attempt to  proceed with the sale of F-16 combat aircrafts to Pakistan. It  is not difficult to visualise the enormous damage that such a  decision would do, if carried through without meaningful and  verifiable nuclear-related assurances from Islamabad.    Mr. Selig Harrison, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie  Endowment was aghast when informed of the F-16 delivery  proposal. The US policy of delivery arms to Pakistan seemed to  resemble the motions of a revolving door, he said, with  successive administrations, appeasing Islamabad with military  aid, only to withdraw it later.    The decision to deliver F-16s to Pakistan ""couldn't have  come  at a worst time in Indo-US relations,"" said Mr. Harrison in an  interview with THE TIMES OF INDIA.    He pointed out that the rhetorical exchange between New  Delhi  and Washington had ""already given the impression of a US tilt  towards Pakistan.""    Mr. Michael Krepon, another analyst at the Henry L. Stimson  Centre said it was probable that the US would demand specific  nuclear-related steps from Pakistan before delivering the F-16s.    ""My reading is that there is some sentiment to waive  Pressler  but only if Pakistan takes verifiable and concrete steps that  are in support of US non-proliferation policies,"" Mr. Krepon  told THE TIMES OF INDIA.    ""This administration came in on a platform that focussed far  more upon American domestic revival further than any grand  promises of dramatic changes in foreign policy,"" Dr. Ganguly  said.    ""Foreign policy has not been the principle concern of this  administration when it came and it has not been since the past  year in office.""    The priorities were unlikely to change significantly, Dr.  Ganguly said, as President Clinton remained focussed on the  domestic economy and other national issues such as health care  reforms, job retraining and social welfare.

It was the first hijacking of a mainland passenger plane to  Taiwan in 1994 and the 11th since last April.    Lin, 26, wearing the uniform of a People's Liberation Army  soldier, forced the Boeing 737 to Taiwan with a knife and a  glass filled with tissue paper which lin claimed was an  explosive, airport police reported.    The hijacking was reported at around 10:30 a.m. [0130 GMT]  after a Southwest China Airlines 737 flying from Chengdu in  Sichuan Province veered off course over Fuzhou and approached  Taiwan.    The flight, with 122 passengers and eight crew members on  board, landed in Taiwan at 10:43 a.m. and was expected to fly  back to the mainland via Hong Kong after refueling, the police  said.    Lin, his wife, mother and two children were arrested for  their involvement in the hijacking and were sent to the office  of the Taoyuan prosecutor for questioning.    The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday that  Taiwan  will continue to abide by the provisions of the Hague  Convention, which requires separate treatment for hijacked  aircraft and hijackers.    Despite several rounds of negotiations between SEF and its  mainland counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS), the two sides failed to reach any agreement on  ways to avoid the repeated hijackings.    Friday's hijacking underlined air security problems on the  Chinese Mainland. A Wednesday report by the International  Airline Passengers Association called air travel in the  mainland, ""an ongoing disaster,"" and urged visitors to the  mainland to avoid air travel.

It was the first hijacking of a mainland passenger plane to  Taiwan in 1994 and the 11th since last April.    Lin, 26, wearing the uniform of a People's Liberation Army  soldier, forced the Boeing 737 to Taiwan with a knife and a  glass filled with tissue paper which lin claimed was an  explosive, airport police reported.    The hijacking was reported at around 10:30 a.m. [0130 GMT]  after a Southwest China Airlines 737 flying from Chengdu in  Sichuan Province veered off course over Fuzhou and approached  Taiwan.    The flight, with 122 passengers and eight crew members on  board, landed in Taiwan at 10:43 a.m. and was expected to fly  back to the mainland via Hong Kong after refueling, the police  said.    Lin, his wife, mother and two children were arrested for  their involvement in the hijacking and were sent to the office  of the Taoyuan prosecutor for questioning.    The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) said Friday that  Taiwan  will continue to abide by the provisions of the Hague  Convention, which requires separate treatment for hijacked  aircraft and hijackers.    Despite several rounds of negotiations between SEF and its  mainland counterpart Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS), the two sides failed to reach any agreement on  ways to avoid the repeated hijackings.    Friday's hijacking underlined air security problems on the  Chinese Mainland. A Wednesday report by the International  Airline Passengers Association called air travel in the  mainland, ""an ongoing disaster,"" and urged visitors to the  mainland to avoid air travel.    Last year, ten mainland passenger airplanes were hijacked to  Taiwan. The hijackings occurred on a number of different flight  paths and took place in the months of April, June, August,  September, October, November and December.     "

[Kovac] I believe that what both sides consider the most  important is that we should put an end to mutual accusations and  mistrust between the Slovak Republic and the Hungarian Republic  as soon as possible. This is the basic condition for our being  able to develop cultural and economic relations at the level of  the various organizations, institutions, and citizens as well.  So, the elimination of mistrust is at the top of the list, and  every step promoting this is given priority. I believe that the  signing of the basic treaty that lays down good-neighborly  relations is included in this. The principle of the  inviolability of the borders has to be laid down just as that of  the political solution of issues affecting the national  minorities. If we manage to achieve this, then afterward what  we must strive for is to remove gradually from people's  consciousness the suspicion and mistrust inherited from the past.    Once the basic conditions have been created for shaping a  new  type of relations, enormous possibilities will open up before  us--first and foremost in cross-border cooperation, which is by  no means at the level made desirable by the economic, cultural,  and technical endowments and requirements of the region's  inhabitants.    [Nagy] During their visit to Bratislava last week, Gabor  Kuncze [head of the parliamentary group of opposition Alliance  of Free Democrats] and, before that, Gyula Horn [chairman of the  opposition Hungarian Socialist Party], also, spoke  optimistically about the future development of Slovak-Hungarian  relations. Jozef Moravcik, the Slovak head of government, also  sees a chance for improvement. Do you share this opinion?    [Kovac] Yes, I support this opinion. And I trust that, in  the election campaigns, the so-called Slovak and Hungarian cards  will become superfluous--in other words, that it will not be  possible to play these against each other. On the contrary, it  will become apparent that the most rational way to resolve  issues is to approach them in a sober, objective manner, without  suspicion, be it a question of Gabcikovo, water distribution,  the legal status of national minorities, or anything else--in  other words, that everything can be resolved if it is not  unnecessarily overpoliticized.    Incidentally, I consider this to be a sickness that has  raised its head not just in our country but elsewhere, too. It  is obviously connected with the fact that real democracy in our  region is still only in the developmental phase, the political  situation has not yet settled down, and an unnecessarily large  number of issues are brought onto the political level as if they  were trying to forge capital for themselves from this.    But I also see signs of the opposite of this: the effort to  try to remove obstacles from the path of our relations. I  consider looking to the future the important thing, and to make  people aware that European integration is an attractive  objective for which it is worth working with joint forces so as  to achieve it more quickly.    [Nagy] Mr. President, if I am not mistaken, you managed to  find the common note a long time ago with Hungarian President  Arpad Goncz. You mentioned that, in the course of your earlier  meetings, too, you had managed to get attuned.    [Kovac] Yes, that is so. This has shown that the presidents  of republics, who are infrequently dragged into daily  politicizing, look at events from above. Their hands are not  tied, and they can express an opinion without prejudice, without  ulterior motives, about certain issues. This is what we need:  that this approach should pass down from the president's level  to the executive power level. I do not doubt that this will  happen because, also in Hungary and here, too, we have already  taken steps in a direction serving the aim of depoliticizing.  Once people's everyday interests come to the forefront, that  will bring with it the necessity of sober solutions.    [Nagy] In your view, what role can the minorities play in  the  shaping of bilateral relations? I am thinking, in our case, of  the Slovaks living in Hungary and of the Hungarians living in  Slovakia.    [Kovac] In general terms, it can be said--and this relates  to  both the Hungarian and the Slovak situation--that it is in the  interest of every country to create for its minorities  conditions in which they can feel at home, so that they will  strive, in their own interest, to integrate and become fully  valuable members of the given society, while being able to  retain their particular characteristics, their language, their  culture, their traditions, while being given the possibility to  study in their mother tongue. However, it is a general interest  that the use of the mother tongue should not impede the minority  in becoming integrated in society and the individual in getting  on. We must change this outlook, which still lives on, that a  minority means nothing but trouble for a country. We must  reinforce the view that it can also mean richness. So far, we  have done little to achieve this, but perhaps not only in  relation to Hungary and Slovakia. Elsewhere, too, what people  see is the disadvantages of the minorities issue rather than the  richness the minorities represent for a country from the  viewpoint of culture, of the multicolored mix of languages.    We have not sufficiently weighed the possibility of making  use of this opportunity provided by the minorities for the  purpose of getting closer to our neighbors, in our case toward  the south, making our relations closer with Hungary.

This week the former unity was no longer  there. The government decree ""On Coordination Organs on  Currency-Financial Questions,"" in spite of its conciliatory  name, by eliminating the currency-economics commission, could  aggravate the age-old interdepartmental dispute about access to  the distribution of Western credit. At the meeting of the  government commission on operational issues, the latest version  of the new import tariff was approved, and in parallel the GTK  [State Customs Committee] with its instruction, ""On Exemption  From Payment of Customs Duties of the Russian Fund for Disabled  Veterans of the War in Afghanistan,"" is legalizing the almost  forgotten but still no less attractive practice of granting  customs benefits just like that--for an organization. As a  result, there are gaps in the system of regulation, of which  participants in foreign economic activity could very well take  advantage.    The Ministry of Finance Has Its Own Credit, and the Ministry  of Foreign Economic Relations Has Its Own    The restructuring of the government apparatus, which was  brought about by the reduction by half of the number of deputy  prime ministers, was reflected particularly in the elimination  of the currency-economic commission, ""because the tasks assigned  to it had been performed."" This wording, unfortunately, does not  mean that there is no centralized currency left at all. It comes  from two main sources: exports credited to state quotas and  foreign credits. The former is under the jurisdiction of the  Ministry of Finance, as the holder of budget funds. It has the  firm intention of taking control of and distributing Western  credit granted to Russia. But in practice, although the  conclusion of the Ministry of Finance will be taken into account  in each specific case, the old method is most likely to be used:  the submission of the question at the level of some collegial  government organ. And it will have to weigh the claims of the  departments, that is, at least a deputy prime minister will have  to head this commission. Of the available deputy prime  ministers, only Oleg Soskovets is suitable for playing this  role, and he is already in charge of a commission on operational  issues, which will actually expand its authority.    For now the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations [MFER],  under whose wing the Russian Export-Import Bank (Roseksimbank)  is being created, will provide an example of independent  extension of lines of credit. While Roseksimbank must initially  grant ruble credit to producers of export products, in the  future it will not be prohibited from drawing to itself some of  the credit of ""related"" Western banks, in whose distribution the  MFER will not have the last word. The credit priorities of the  MFER have already been determined: joint-stock companies and  state enterprises under its jurisdiction.    The New Import Tariff Has Not Even Been Adopted, but Ways  Around It Have Already Been Devised    At the meeting of the commission on operational questions,  which in principle approved the new import tariff to take effect  on 15 March, it was stated that the average level of customs  rates ranges from 7.5 to 18 percent. On the whole, the rates are  simply being increased. But, according to the assessment of the  deputy minister of economics, Sergey Vasilyev, the lobbies of  the Russian automotive and aircraft builders are committing  ""highway robbery"" with their high offensive import duties. Thus,  to the traditional commodity groups that enjoy increased customs  protection--alcohol and liquor products, motor vehicles,  electric household appliances, equipment for petroleum and gas  extraction (such is the condition for receiving the associated  credit from the American Export-Import Bank)--they may also add  aircraft (recently Russian airline companies have preferred  Boeing), products of the textile industry, and foodstuffs. The  struggle of the branch representatives is not over, and the  question of the customs tariff is to be considered again at a  meeting of the government next Thursday. Moreover, the influence  of branch lobbies is apparently becoming a permanent thing: At  the meeting it was suggested that they create a Tariff-Customs  Council, which would be authorized to work out operational  changes in the rates of customs tariffs (the government would  still make the final decision). But customs duties are not the  only thing affecting the dynamic of imports. In January, when  exchange rates were favorable for imports, new excise taxes led  to an absolute reduction of imports as compared to January of  last year. It cannot be ruled out that on 15 March the  inevitable (although, possibly, partial) successes of the  supporters of raising rates of the import tariff for certain  branches of industry will be accompanied by a marked decline of  the ruble, which will make import activity a losing proposition.  But not for everyone.    The GTK has returned the benefits to disabled Afghanistan  veterans, the same ones that were taken away last July in  compliance with the law on the customs tariff. This time the  basis for the decision of the GTK was the president's edict, ""On  Measures for State Support for the Activity of All-Russian  Public Associations of Disabled Persons."" Yet under that same  law (Article 34) the newly granted benefits ""may not be of an  individual nature."" The benefits were localized by concrete  contracts. It is an important precedent, however: A breach has  been made in customs barriers that worsen conditions mainly for  import activity, which in principle may be utilized by more than  disabled Afghanistan veterans. The technology is well known:  variations on the theme of sale of contracts and supplements to  them as futures. But the main thing is that the Afghanistan  veterans have laid a path that can now be widened, and importers  and exporters have been given a point for application of their  efforts.     "

The meeting was attended by Juan Salazar, Finance Ministry  international policy adviser and future Foreign Ministry  economic affairs director; Alejandro Jara, bilateral affairs  director for the International Economic Relations Directorate;  and Fishing Corporation and Sofofa representatives.    Sofofa Secretary General Jaime Pozo said the Mexican  charges,  which resulted in temporary sanctions against Chile while an  investigation is conducted, are quite groundless:    [Begin Pozo recording, in progress] ...punctual. One must  adjust to the international market prices currently set by Peru,  which is exporting at significantly low prices. Chilean  industry cannot just fail to comply with previously made  contracts. Mexico also is buying in the international market  because Chilean fishmeal is of very good quality and, in this  sense, it is very competitive precisely because of its quality.  [end recording]    The Chilean business sector has asked the government's  support in confronting charges that, according to the Mexican  law system, Chile exports below cost. Salazar explained that  the government is concerned about this issue and will raise the  subject before the administrative council of the Chilean-Mexican  Free Trade Accord.    Moreover, Alejandro Jara said Chile is not causing Mexican  producers any harm:    [Begin Jara recording, in progress] ...we are very worried.  Mexican businessmen cannot categorically say that Chilean  fishmeal exports are the direct and main cause of the harm  suffered by the Mexican industry, which has experienced a  significant reduction in its sales in addition to having to go  by the international fishmeal price, which also affects Chile  because they have been relatively low or, at, least lower than  when the investigation was carried out. [end recording]    Jara said these measures are unjustified and must be  reversed  as soon as possible.     "

That is why such a plan is not encouraging, he said. If it  is realized, the position of Serbs will become unfavourable,  Bogdanovic told the local radio station in Jagodina, central  Serbia.    ""Taking into consideration the United States support,  Moslems  might get even greater appetites for new territorial  concessions, and Croatia might try to realize through war that  which the West has allegedly promised it -- a quick solution to  the problem of the Croatian territory under Serb control,"" he  warned.    ""This would lead to a new aggravation of the conflict, which  we are absolutely against,"" Bogdanovic underscored. The people  and the leaderships of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the  Republic of Serb Krajina ""certainly cannot accept that,""  Bogdanovic said.    The Republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in 1991  in parts of the territory of Croatia where they are the majority  population in answer to Croatia's forcible secession from the  former Yugoslav Federation. In early 1992, Krajina was  proclaimed a United Nations Protected Area.    ""It is our stand that weapons should be laid down wherever  there is bloodshed, and that a solution which is just and equal  for all and not detrimental to any of the warring sides should  be embraced,"" Bogdanovic said.    Tri-partite talks between Croatia, Bosnian Croats and  Bosnian  Moslems, with the mediation of the United States, on a joint  Croat-Moslem state in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in Washington on  Saturday. Under the Washington plan, Moslems and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would form a joint state entity. Such a  community would then enter into a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia, to which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  already agreed in principle on Thursday.     "

It warns that Britain is in danger of squandering improvements in productivity and quality by not paying enough attention to product development. Computervision, the manufacturing design company that conducted the survey of companies with more than 300 employees, said that most manufacturers identified research and development as a cost rather than an investment. A third of those questioned said that cutting costs was the most important issue facing their business. Only 6 per cent saw customers' needs as the most important issue. Many manufacturers also had poor relations with the City. More than 40 per cent of listed companies and 84 per cent of unlisted companies questioned had no regular contact with the City. Mr Garreth Evans, Computervision's managing director, said: 'Manufacturing needs to improve relations with the City, move customer needs up the agenda and raise its sights from an obsession with cost-cutting if it is to become world-class.' Lack of investment was the biggest obstacle facing UK manufacturers, he said. 'Firms see themselves as vulnerable on research and development and the use of advanced manufacturing technology relative to Germany's performance.' British manufacturers, however, had made substantial improvements in productivity and quality. More than 75 per cent of companies identified product quality as an investment priority. Almost 70 per cent of companies were working towards or had achieved the 'total quality' management objectives established by the British Standards Institution. Relations with employees also had improved with 91 per cent of companies meeting the workforce regularly, mostly through Japanese-style team briefings. Almost 75 per cent of manufacturers declared themselves fully prepared for the single European market, with 89 per cent of companies already selling or planning to sell goods in other EC markets. 1993 Manufacturing Attitudes Survey, Computervision, Argent Court, Sir William Lyons Road, Coventry, CV4 7EZ.

Sandoval said that the U.S. decision ""is incoherent, and  lacks logic, as everyone recognizes that drug enforcement is the  responsibility of producers as well as consumers.""    Sandoval said that without U.S. logistical support in Peru  ""the mafias could transport the drugs without fear of being  intercepted by the Peruvian Air Force, which joined the drug  enforcement effort with recognized success in 1992.""    Arnaldo Velarde, Peruvian delegate before the Inter-American  Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse (CICAD), said  that the interruption of the U.S. aid was decided ""unilaterally,  and without consultation.""    Velarde also confirmed that Washington has suspended the  flights of its AWAC and Orion airplanes, and has ordered the  withdrawal of the radar operating in Yurimaguas that is used to  control flights at the Peruvian and Colombian border.    Velarde said: ""This will greatly hurt drug enforcement,  because the Peruvian Air Force lacks the necessary means to  detect the airplanes flying on the Colombian border, 99 percent  of which are used to carry cocaine.""    The suspension of the aid was recommended by the State  Department with the argument that shooting down civilian  airplanes suspected of carrying drugs ""is a violation of  international law.""    The flights of the AWAC and Orion airplanes, which are  equipped with high technology radars, allowed the Peruvian Air  Force to detect and intercept the drug trafficking airplanes,  which in some cases, when they refused to obey the orders to  land, were shot down.    Velarde said that Peru will continue the drug enforcement  effort ""with its own means,"" but he indicated that the detection  of airplanes carrying drugs ""will be slower, difficult, and  expensive"" without the U.S. aid.

The machine  will be equipped so as to be able to carry, in addition to the  crew and the inspection team, representatives of the country  being inspected.    ""The convention makes possible the control of whether some  country builds new military facilities or concentrates its units  near a neighbor's border. Such extensive measures or movement  of troops cannot be concealed from modern instruments,"" one of  the representatives of the Defense Ministry Foreign Relations  Section said.    According to the convention, the inspection teams must  report  their flights in advance, and they may enter the airspace of any  country only once a year.    Bilateral treaties permitting reconnaissance flights over  the  territory of another state have existed so far between Germany  and the United States, for instance, and between Romania and  Hungary.    Of the other international conventions that are to reinforce  mutual trust among European countries, the Czech Republic joined  the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe earlier, and  signed the Vienna Documents on limiting convention arms.  According to these treaties, the Czech Army should destroy  another 417 tanks, 43 armed combat vehicles, 52 artillery  pieces, and 38 fighter aircraft by 15 November.     "

In fact, the Court acknowledged the substantial governmental interest in establishing such programs in order to maintain and expand the markets for agricultural commodities. The Court's complaint lay with the unique design of the former almond advertising and promotion program, with the lack of record proof that it directly advanced the stated interests, and with the fact that the former creditable advertising requirements seemed more extensive than necessary to achieve the approved goals.        The New Credit-Back Advertising and Promotion Program        An interim final rule published in the     Federal Register     on August 17, 1993, [57 FR 43500] represents the most recent and extensive revision to the Order's advertising and promotion program. Due to changes in the size and structure of the California almond industry during the 1980's and 1990's, as well as the fact that more handlers were beginning to sell almonds for use as ingredients in manufactured products rather than for direct consumption, there was a general perception within the industry that a new and innovative program needed to be implemented which would be even more effective than the former program in promoting the sale of California almonds.    This prompted the Board and its Public Relations and Advertising Committee to seek to create a new and widely accepted advertising and promotion program designed to aid the further development of the almond industry. On April 20, 1993, by a vote of 91, the Board recommended the new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program. The sole Board member opposing the new program was generally opposed to the entire concept of creditable advertising and promotion. This Board member asserted that all handlers should be required to fund a generic promotion program equally and that any brand advertising done on their own should be carried out at their own expense without any type of Board oversight.    The new Credit-Back advertising and promotion program recognizes new marketing techniques which have been developed by the industry over the years, and is intended to work with and complement a strong generic advertising and promotion program which will be undertaken by the Board. The premise of the new program is that individual handlers will be most effective in promoting their own portion of the almond crop while the Board will be the most effective vehicle through which to enhance total demand for almonds through a generic advertising and promotion program. Some of the significant features of the new program are as follows.    Under the new program, as modified in this final rule, handlers conducting their own advertising and promotional activities will receive credit against their Credit-Back assessment up to the amount of the Credit-Back assessment installment due if they conduct and document their advertising and promotional activities at least two weeks prior to assessment billings. If handlers do not conduct any advertising and promotional activities prior to assessment billings, they will be required to submit their advertising and promotional assessment when billed. If handlers conduct advertising and promotional activities after assessment billings and file appropriate documentation, they will be eligible for a refund or Credit-Back. Handlers will be billed in four equal installments during the crop year. Handlers are not obligated to take part in the new program. Each handler must make an individual decision whether or not to participate in the new program.    The new Credit-Back program substantially expands the list of advertising and promotional activities which will be eligible for credit under the regulations. The range of activities eligible for credit cover virtually every sales assistance, promotional, publicity and advertising area which a brand or individual company could use to aid in product sales, with the exception of price reductions. In all, there are now fourteen advertising, promotion and public relations categories of activities which will be eligible for credit. These include marketing research, paid media advertising directed to end-users, trade or industrial users, in-store demonstrations, trade fairs, seminars and exhibits, couponing, sponsorships, printing costs, trade and consumer product publicity, direct mailings, sales and marketing presentation kits, and 50/50 advertising with retailers. Each of these activities are widely used and accepted forms of marketing advertising and promotion.    Another aspect of the new program is the elimination of the 33% discount which was formerly allowed to handlers who paid their assessments directly to the Board by a specified date. Under the former creditable advertising and promotion program, handlers who paid their assessments to the Board by a specific date received a 150% credit against the advertising and promotional portion of their assessments. These payments were then used by the Board for generic advertising and promotion. In effect, this allowed handlers a 33% discount on a portion of their assessments. The purpose of the discount at the time was to encourage smaller handlers which did not have individual advertising and promotional programs to contribute to the Board's generic advertising and promotion program. Many members of the industry believed, however, that handlers who received the benefit of the discount did not always pass it on to growers and thus achieved a competitive advantage over handlers who engaged in individual advertising and promotional programs.    Another feature of the new program is an appeals process whereby handlers have the option of anonymity in the event a claim for a promotional activity is denied. Handlers may request that the Public Relations and Advertising Committee review Board staff decisions concerning denied claims. If not satisfied with that committee's decision, handlers may request that the Board review the issue. Handlers have the option of anonymity when their appeal is brought before the Board. Finally, handlers may request that the Department review the Board's decisions. The Department may review all decisions at any point during the appeals process.    The new Credit-Back program also offers handlers more flexibility in getting credit against their assessments for their own advertising and promotional activities compared with the former creditable advertising and promotion program.

Government Information Office director-general Jason Hu  urged  mainland authorities to face the accident ""honestly"" and  ""responsibly.""    The charred corpses of 24 Taiwan tourists, two mainland  Chinese guides and six crewmen were found piled in one room of a  tourist boat on March 31. The boat was on a cruise of Thousand  Island Lake in Zhejiang Province when the still unexplained  deaths occurred.    News of the accident was not released until two days after  the event occurred, and all Taiwan reporters were barred from  examining the boat or any of the 32 corpses after the boat was  removed to a shipyard in Chunan, Zhejiang.    Zhejiang security officials also destroyed film of the site  taken by a TV reporter from Taipei's China Television Co.    The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taipei's non-official  conduit for mainland-Taiwan relations, Monday urged mainland  authorities to reconsider a Sunday decision to bar SEF officials  from even visiting the site.    SEF counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in a fax Sunday to the SEF, made only  perfunctory reference to the incident and did not detail reasons  for the fire and death of the tourists.    The deaths are widely believed to be the result of foul  play,  possibly the work of thieves who took advantage of lax police  presence on the lake.    Meanwhile, about 50 family members of the victims arrived  Monday in Chunan to help police identify the corpses.    Angered with the mainland's handling of the case, the family  members have demanded the mainland authorities make public the  true cause of the accident, allow SEF personnel to the site, and  respect the relatives' wishes regarding the handling and  transport of victims to Taiwan.

0,FT944-170 ,"FT944-170 _AN-FAAACAAFFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Campaign for clarity aims to end Eurospeak      By ALICE RAWSTHORN and DAVID GARDNER   In Brussels it is widely recognised that directives - or EU laws - are written in a prose so execrable that it violates all the languages of the Union. But from tomorrow Eurocrats in their multilingual drafting committees should watch out. The Plain English Campaign, the linguistic pressure group which is the self-appointed scourge of verbose British bureaucrats, is waging war on Euro-obscurity. The campaign is launching a lobby to ensure that all information released to the public by the European Commission is easy to understand. Though it has clashed with the Commission over incidents of verbosity, this will be its first all-out assault on catastrophes of comprehension. No longer should Article 8a of the Maastricht treaty, 'comitology', 'false 'B' points', or the ubiquitous Euro-grunt of 'Erf, erf' be daily currency in Brussels, though making headway might be difficult. The last, a violation of (French and English) language, could inadvertently help the campaign. 'Erf, erf' means 'Off, off' - as in 'off the record', and is designed to obscure the source of information. Ms Chrissie Maher, head of the Campaign, said the EU had been singled out for attack because many of its laws were 'so badly worded that no one knows what they mean'. The chief catalyst was the Maastricht treaty, which Ms Maher called 'so impenetrable that, if it wasn't so serious, it would have been a joke'. She wrote a letter of complaint to Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing president of the Commission, which she sent together with 'the biggest Brussels sprout I could find'. Ms Maher received 'a very nice letter back' pointing out that Mr Delors had not written the treaty himself. She was unimpressed. One of the main targets of the campaign will be arcane new words - such as 'extensification' and the now-infamous 'subsidiarity'. Ms Maher sees them as 'a form of corruption that Euro MPs pick up over there and think it's clever to use here'.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

According to Dultzin, included among the areas in which  Mexico is willing to make midterm and long-term adjustments is  maritime transportation. He also noted that, in general, all  environmental agreements are being carried out.    Modifications will have to be made in 38 economic areas,  including capital goods, services, environment, foreign  investments, multinational corporations, consumer protection  programs, agriculture, nuclear energy, and tourism. Other areas  that will need to undergo adjustment include financial markets,  fiscal issues, trade, employment and social issues, insurance,  scientific and technological policies, computer technology, data  processing and communications policies, development assistance,  and others.    Dultzin also mentioned areas such as education, in addition  to specific naval construction and steel agreements.    Although adopted agreements affect all of these areas, the  energy sector will not be affected because ""we decided not to  participate in this area, and also, we did not participate in  developmental assistance or in independent agreements on  exports.""    Other agreements are aimed at creating a more prosperous,  stable Mexican economy that will raise the people's standard of  living and increase employment, and all of these agreements ""are  designed to improve the Mexican economy.""    Daniel Dultzin explained that the adjustments really have  nothing to do with trade: ""There is a Trade Committee that  thoroughly reviews international trade policies. If the OECD's  mission is to safeguard a multilateral trade system, they can  rely on the Uruguay Round of the GATT negotiations. This,  however, has nothing to do with the required adjustments on  issues such as trade deregulation or the granting of preferences.    ""We are not about to lose our status as a developing  country;  our admittance into the OECD does not connote this. This is  something completely different; we are not going to lose this  status.""    The SRE [Foreign Relations Secretariat] official explained:  ""We have lost our concessional credits [creditos concesionales]  because our per capita income has surpassed the fixed $2,300  amount, and also because of the overall income level. In terms  of increases in our level of income, we will be losing some of  the advantages that come with being a poor country, or one in  development."" At any rate, this will not take place just  because we are an OECD member.    On the contrary, the Basel Agreements between all of the  central banks imply government credits are rated as zero risk  for all OECD members. They fell from 100 to zero, but for the  commercial banks they will fall to 20. In other words, it is  expected that there will be an impact on the cost of what is  paid in premium for the credits Mexico acquires.    [Aranda] What can we expect from our admittance to the OECD?    [Dultzin] What we can expect is, first of all, to be  completely involved in all discussions of the more than 200  working groups and committees. Mexican officials will be  receiveing training in every area of government. The OECD  covers all areas of government except security, sports, and  culture.    In addition there will be ""improved training and increased  coordination of programs in the interior, and, therefore, we  will be better informed, which in turn will allow us to better  apply new policies.""    ""We are gradually committing ourselves to offer  nondiscriminatory, fair treatment as long as economic conditions  in Mexico and the legal structure allow this. However, we also  expect to guarantee these liberties to all Mexicans living in  other countries. It is vital that the Mexican economy is  capable of globalizing. Of course, all of this depends on what  we might do.""    [Aranda] Up until 31 December, there was a certain  perception  of Mexico abroad. Considering Colosio's murder, what support  can the OECD provide Mexico?    [Dultzin] All of the governments are well aware of the  problems we have had. They have decided not to modify the  discussions or the manner in which these are being carried out.  Our internal problems are our problems, and it is up to us to  resolve them. They have accepted us as a mature [maduro]  country confronting problems related to growing up. Maybe it is  a transition in our development process. We are being accepted  as a mature country by other mature countries.    ""It will be up to us to resolve our problems as best we can.  However, the other nations are there, not so much to tell us  what to do, but to offer support and guidance, as well as to  help as much as possible because many of them have similar  problems.""    [Aranda] The member-states have a democratic culture. Was  there any problem when you adopted the decision concerning  Mexico's admission?    [Dultzin] There are principles; these include a basic  philosophy, market economies, and economies that date back  hundreds of years. The relationship between states and markets  is very old. Democracy and respect for human rights are very old  principles and, obviously, they are essential to those countries  and to us, too. Within the OECD, there are various cases in  which various countries have faced very difficult political  situations.    ""Mexico's pledge basically deals with human rights,  democracy, and a market economy that improves the people's  overall lifestyle and will become increasingly prosperous.  These are the principles we share. They do not touch on  political issues; they deal with other topics -- in depth and  vigorously.    Daniel Dultzin Dublin said Mexico's pledge is to strive for  a  better trained work force; a better adaptation of the labor  market to the need for more industrial services, greater  competitiveness, and productivity; and to include the working  class in the overall marketplace with a better lifestyle and  training.    [Aranda] The country faces uncertain times. What does the  admission to the OECD represent?    [Dultzin] Admission was scheduled for 24 March; the date was  established so the OECD Council could adopt a decision. It  adopted the decision despite all of the events that have  recently occurred in Mexico. The council was fully aware that  its decision was coming within a new context, but it  nevertheless adopted the decision as scheduled. The  confirmation and acceptance were planned for 14 April.    ""It is an element of all of these countries' great  confidence  in Mexico, in its institutions, in the maturity of its society,  and in Mexican society's ability to face these problems and  overcome them. This can result in specific and mutual benefits,  and the OECD countries will be more aware of the problems that  afflict developing nations such as ours.""    The director general of multilateral negotiations in the SRE  says OECD countries know what conditions prevail in Mexico:  ""They know perfectly well how revenues are distributed and that  we are 5 percent above the median for the population with the  highest income -- a level in which Mexico is above the median  for industrialized countries. Some 20 percent of the low-income  population is way below the median for industrialized countries.  The general trend is for greater overall productivity and a  better distribution of wages.""    Moveover, ""very specialized work is being carried out on  regional development and rural development, which will give us  the experience to attack the poverty problem.""    [Aranda] What topics interest Mexico the most as an OECD  member?    [Dultzin] There is one critical issue. In order to ensure  that economic development will be sustainable in the long run in  Mexico, higher growth levels must be compatible with reduced  inflation, price stability, and a sustainable external deficit.    ""Also, everything dealing with the development of small and  medium-sized enterprises, their problems, and international  production tasks."" [sentence as published] In addition, Mexico  is interested in ""doing everything possible to incorporate an  underground economy, and this must be increasingly strengthened  through production chains, large companies, and large  distribution chains or their international counterparts, because  this will help us a great deal.""    The official emphasizes it is essential for Mexico to have  much more access to international markets. ""If this does not  happen, we will be inhibited in our development; we will not be  able to develop the Mexican economy's potential, which could be  around 5, 6, or 7 percent, and we will not be able to achieve an  in-depth solution to the problem of increasing our participation  in international markets with Mexican assets, services, and  experience. Mexican products are competitive, and they have a  market.    ""It is an enormous challenge, but there are many topics  within the OECD that can help promote Mexico.""    [Aranda] What other topics are important for Mexico?    [Dultzin] The basic problems that afflict large cities --  pollution, development, and urban planning -- as well as similar  problems dealing with regional development, more successful  agricultural policies, and assistance for the peasants. We can  find many areas in which we can improve our economy.    [Arenda] We have joined the APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation] organization, NAFTA, and the OECD. What next?    [Dultzin] Our admission does not guarantee we will fare  better. Mexico has maturity, knowledge, and experience that are  of interest to industrialized countries, as well as to East  European countries, where Mexico's experience may be of great  interest -- both our achievements and our backwardness, and what  we do with them -- and we can benefit from this. Mexico has  made a name for itself in the world community because it has  something to say, and it is capable of absorbing the experience  of others for its own benefit.     "

Alarcon, who is heading a Cuban delegation that began a  visit  to Belgium on Sunday, met this afternoon with the Foreign  Economic Affairs Commission of the European Parliament headed by  Belgian Liberal Deputy Willy de Clerq.    During the meeting, De Clerq expressed the European  Parliament's interest in increasing contacts with Cuba. He  noted that he was one of the supporters of a resolution that  rejected the U.S. blockade, which was approved at the European  Parliament plenary meeting in Strasbourg last September.    During an extensive, lengthy debate on various topics, the  visitor stressed the need to expand cooperation and trade  relations between Cuba and the EU and between Havana and the  member-states of that supranational organization.    Alarcon also met with Egon Klepsch, chairman of the European  Parliament, who expressed interest in the current situation in  Cuba, especially the economic reforms now taking place.    At both meetings he underscored the importance that any  economic measure to be adopted in the current circumstances in  Cuba should have the broadest consensus of the people, who have  been the basic historic backbone of the Cuban project.    Among other activities, the Cuban leader attended a dinner  with Belgian businessmen in which the new product line of Cohiba  1492 was presented by the Sutter Co. -- the Havana cigar  distributor in the Benelux nations.    Ramon Pez Ferro, secretary of the Foreign Relations Standing  Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to Belgium and the EU,  participated in today's meeting.    Alarcon will stay in Belgium until 30 January. During his  stay, he will meet with representatives of the Belgian  Government, the parliament, and European political groups and  friendship with Cuba associations.     "

As ARATS is not authorized to handle  the question of compensating the victims of the Qiandao Lake  incident, he said, Taiwan's travel agency and the victims'  relatives should consult with the mainland insurance company and  travel agency on the matter.

The police's dilatory and incompetent investigation into the theft, and series of unexplained murders of Saudi diplomats and a businessman in Bangkok, annoyed the Saudis so much they came close to severing diplomatic relations. They stopped issuing work permits to Thai nationals which cost Thailand up to Dollars 1bn a year in lost remittances; 250,000 Thais were working in Saudi Arabia in 1989, only some 30,000 work there now. 'I have been waiting for four years and nothing has happened. But I believe General Pratin (Santiprapop, the current police chief) is an honest man and he wants to make everything clear to the world,' said Mr Mohammed Said Khoja, Saudi Arabia's charge d'affaires, yesterday: A police lieutenant general, who headed the original investigation into the theft, and seven others, were charged with embezzlement last year. The scandal dates back to 1989 when a Thai cleaner stole 90kg of jewellery - including a family heirloom: a diamond the size of a pigeon's egg - from the palace of Prince Faisal Abdul Aziz al Saud in Riyadh. The thief, Kriangkrai Techamong, was arrested with exemplary speed after his return and many of the jewels recovered. However, Saudi pleasure quickly faded when it was discovered that most of the gems returned were fakes. Relations between the two countries plummeted when gunmen shot dead four Saudi diplomats in broad daylight between 1989 and 1990 in the streets of Bangkok. The Thai police's lacklustre investigations threw up a bizarre parade of murder suspects, including religious zealots, drug dealers, business rivals, Pakistani gangsters and international terrorists. Saudi unhappiness reached its acme when it was revealed that a prominent Saudi businessman, Mohammed al-Ruwaily, who disappeared around the time of the murders, had probably been abducted and killed by a group of Thai policemen.

With the  establishment of this new organization, if contingencies occur  in the future, more transparent methods can be adopted to handle  them.    Reports have indicated that, when talking about the Qiandao  Hu incident a few days ago, the high-level central leadership  hoped to draw a lesson from handling the Qiandao Hu case. They  pointed out that the relevant situation should be promptly  reported to the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation and that  media reports should be provided with more transparency and  efficiency. The locality itself lacked experience in handling  such incidents, and the Qiandao Hu case was handled  inappropriately. In dealing with the case, no consideration was  given to its particular nature. Therefore, there is a need to  establish a new procedure for promptly reporting contingencies  to the higher authorities and immediately releasing information  abroad, allowing reporters to provide ongoing coverage to  increase the transparency of the procedures for handling these  contingencies.    High levels of the central leadership invited the relevant  experts to assess the negative impact of the Qiandao Hu incident  on relations between the two sides. The relevant experts said  that the incident will have a short-term negative impact on the  two sides' relations, but it will not affect the two sides'  relations too much in the long run, because Taiwan's economic  development requires assistance from the mainland, and Taiwan  businessmen will not easily give up the opportunity to invest on  the mainland.    The relevant experts said that the Qiandao Hu incident has  had such great repercussions in Taiwan due to the involvement of  the Taiwan authorities and the Taiwan independence forces.     "

The draft was prepared by Zaveryukha's department with  the participation of representatives from the Foreign Economic  Relations Ministry, the Russian State Fishing Committee, the  Central Bank, the Fuel and Energy Ministry, and was then  approved by the Economy Ministry practically without comment.  The sole department that strongly criticized this ""lobby  allowance"" was the Finance Ministry. This must be why two days  before the session Zaveryukha sent a letter to the presidium  accusing the Finance Ministry of sabotaging the program for  revitalizing the agricultural sector, and yesterday he stated:  ""Russia must feed its peasants.""    In addition to the measures of state support for the  agro-industrial complex (an investment credit of 1.3 trillion  rubles and 2.8 trillion rubles of centralized capital inputs for  the first quarter of 1994), it was proposed to preserve  subsidies for centralized food imports and establish subsidy  coefficients for imported technological equipment. Furthermore  it is envisioned to compensate 30 percent of expenditures for  fertilizer purchases and to impose restrictive custom duties on  the import of ""white sugar, wool, flax and hemp fibers, and  industrially harvested fur and pelt materials.""    According to Economy Ministry estimates, 24 additional  measures to support the agricultural sector will call for an  additional 14 trillion rubles of budget funds. The aggregate  cost of the program for the state budget, however, will amount  to 34 trillion rubles ($22 billion at the current exchange rate)  which exceeds the volume of agricultural imports 10 fold. ""It  must be remembered that in Russian agriculture, the sowing  season is immediately followed by harvesting,"" Sergey Vasilyev,  head of the Working Center for Economic Reforms, which has not  yet been dissolved, said at a press conference yesterday.

The Hong Kong Political Adviser's office summoned a representative of the New China News Agency, China's de facto embassy in the British colony, to express 'grave concern over an incursion which took place in Hong Kong waters and the dangerous behaviour of the Chinese officers involved.' The GIS said police received a report that a fishing vessel inside Hong Kong waters had been boarded by a number of armed Chinese officers after it had been stopped by a Chinese security forces vessel. When Hong Kong police boarded the fishing boat they were surprised by three Chinese police officers who threatened them and confiscated film when they tried to photograph the incident. The stand-off, near Waglan Island in southeast Hong Kong, lasted nearly two hours. It ended when the Chinese officers returned to their speedboat and left for Chinese waters. No shots were fired and there were no injuries. Earlier, government-run RTHK radio said armed Chinese security men boarded a Hong Kong police launch and confiscated a film the police were making of a speedboat towing another vessel. The waters around the British colony have this year become increasingly dangerous for shipping after 13 armed incursions and at least 14 raids on ships bound for Vietnam. Nearly all the incidents involved Chinese gunboats. Relations between Hong Kong and China, traditionally wary, have further soured over financing plans for a new airport in the colony and the issue of greater democracy for Hong Kong ahead of its 1997 return to Chinese sovereignty. Governor Chris Patten has abandoned the diplomatic approach of his predecessors and openly attacked China's foot-dragging on the airport. He has not commented on the incursions which officials said were apparently not officially sanctioned.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The minister told the press before his meeting with visiting  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the Russian Far  East city of Vladivostok that both Russia and the United States  have no other choice but to enter into relations of partnership.  However, such a relationship does not mean that one party  should restrain its actions while the other enjoys much freedom.    He also rejected the idea that the U.S. is the senior  partner  while Russia is junior.    Russia-U.S. relations fell back in the past two months due  to  their different positions on the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict and  the espionage issue.    The meeting between the two ministers is expected to focus  on  ""mending bilateral relations"" and on the situation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Middle East issue.    Kozyrev said this meeting will provide a change for the two  countries to establish their relations of strategic partnership  on a mature basis.    He suggested that in establishing relations of partnership,  Russia should not follow every step of the West and Russians  should not have the idea that partnership means no conflict or  problem between the two countries.    He noted that every pragmatic politician must understand two  basic facts. Firstly, Russian is a big nation. Therefore, it  should not be treated as a small brother but as an equal  partner. Secondly, relations of partnership should not sacrifice  Russia's policies of national interest.    The Russian foreign minister criticized the ""wild fantasy""  by  some people of regarding the United States as ""the sole leader  of the present world.""    He said in the present world the U.S is not able to solve  every problem by its own. Russia, though is facing many  difficulties, is still a big power in that it has nuclear  weapons as well as a strong military force, he added.     "

This is  the location of the Trade and Economic Department of the Embassy  of the Republic of Poland in Ukraine. It is headed by Commercial  Attache Michal Uzemblo. Our BIZNES correspondent met with Mr.  Uzemblo and asked him to describe the state and prospects of the  development of Polish-Ukrainian trade and economic  relations.    [Kvitko] Mr. Uzemblo, it is far from your first year in  Ukraine, and you are well acquainted with our economic  situation. Tell us, please, are there practicable prerequisites  for an increase in mutually profitable cooperation between our  countries?    [Uzemblo] Ukraine has been an independent state only for  three years. It is natural, therefore, that you have had this  whole time to surmount the well-known difficulties of the  formation of statehood. In addition, Ukraine inherited from the  former USSR quite a complex and unregulated economy, and the  economic relations that had operated for years both with  countries of the former USSR and with the participants in the  disintegrated Council for Economic Mutual Assistance (CEMA), one  of the biggest partners among which was Poland, were disrupted.  The command levers of the control of cooperation, which had  frequently flouted considerations of elementary advantage,  ceased to operate, and commodity turnover between our countries  declined.    Account also has to be taken of the fact that by the time  Ukraine had acquired its sovereignty, Poland had already  implemented a number of economic reforms en route to the market.  This meant that trading as before was no longer possible. You  yourself will realize that perfectly understandable  considerations of advantage, without which a real market is  inconceivable, came into play. The decline in commodity turnover  was perfectly natural, therefore. A payments crisis, when  Ukrainian enterprises were unable to pay for supplies from  Poland in hard currency and your national currency rapidly  declined in value, was superimposed in addition. The situation  was rescued neither by commodity-exchange transactions nor  so-called barter....    Nonetheless, I would like to mention that at the interstate  level Poland was one of the first to sign with Ukraine, in May  1992, a treaty on good-neighborliness, friendly relations, and  cooperation, which laid the legal foundations for a  qualitatively new system of relations between our states within  the framework of the process of transformations in Central and  East Europe.    Today economic relations between Ukraine and Poland are  regulated, aside from the said treaty, by:    1) the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation of 4  October 1991.    2) The Convention on the Avoidance of Dual Taxation and the  Prevention of Income and Property Tax Evasion of 12 January 1993.    3) The Agreement on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of  Investments of 12 January 1993.    4) The Agreement on Interregional Cooperation.    An Intergovernmental Commission on Trade and Economic  Cooperation, whose activity is contributing to the further  development of bilateral economic relations, was formed on the  basis of the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation and the  protocol of 12 January 1993.    [Kvitko] And how productive has the commission's  contribution  to bilateral cooperation been?    [Uzemblo] You know that we do not have the right to dictate  to our entrepreneurs with whom they should conclude deals. But  at the government level the parties have agreed for the  establishment of efficient mutually profitable cooperation to  promote a resumption of relations between enterprises and to  support their development at small and medium-sized business  level, to contribute to the creation of joint ventures, and to  establish a system of mutual notification of the parties of  legislative instruments in force in their countries that  regulate financial, legal, customs, and economic matters.    The commission has been quite productive, I believe.  According to Polish customs data, commodity turnover increased  from $337 million in 1992 to $386.8 million in 1993. In  addition, the practice of joint entrepreneurial activity is  characterized by the fact that Poland is in first place in terms  of the number of joint ventures on the territory of Ukraine.  Their number has risen to 580. The exports of these ventures  constitute $22,980,900, and imports, $18,092,100. According to  figures of the Ministry of Statistics of Ukraine,  Polish-Ukrainian joint ventures constitute 17.8 percent of the  total number of those operating in the country.    [Kvitko] Nonetheless, use is, most likely, being made of far  from all possibilities for the development and expansion of  cooperation. And the reason is by no means a lack of interest in  Ukraine among our Polish partners. What can you say in this  connection?    [Uzemblo] Polish business has a tremendous interest in  Ukraine. Proof of this is not only the first place in terms of  the number of joint ventures but also the fact that  approximately 50 of our firms have opened and registered their  offices in Ukraine. In addition, Polish entrepreneurs are  readily participating in many exhibitions which are being held  in Ukraine and actively inviting their Ukrainian partners to  exhibitions and fairs in Poland....    But the fact that there has yet to be in Ukraine the total  liberalization of foreign economic activity, economic and  financial stabilization has not been achieved, and your national  unit of currency has not become even internally convertible is a  reality also.    Given the least signs of stabilization in Ukraine, the  Polish  entrepreneur would respond appropriately. And our Ukrainian  partners are well enough aware of our possibilities. This  includes agricultural production and also machinery and  equipment for food and light industry, wood processing and  furniture production, medical equipment, the manufacture of  medicines and veterinary preparations, and much else. What I  have listed, I believe, is merely a small particle of the  possible interaction of our enterprises and entrepreneurs....     "

Guliyev, chairman of the National  Assembly of Azerbaijan, by Anatoliy Blyudin, under the rubric  ""Visits""; place and date not given: ""Rasul Guliyev: We Will Not  Yield a Single Square Meter of Land""]    [Text] Rasul Guliyev, in Soviet times a prominent  functionary of the oil industry of Azerbaijan, and currently the  chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and, they say,  the second most important person next to Aliyev in Baku, will be  arriving in Moscow today on an official working visit.    Rasul Guliyev has given an interview to NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA.    [Blyudin] Rasul Bayramovich, what is your attitude toward  the  present-day problems of the CIS? In general, do you believe in  the viability of this union?    [Guliyev] This is not the first case in history of an empire  falling apart. The same thing happened in Italy, England, and  other countries. Indeed, this process is proceeding very  painfully here, and there are many reasons for this: Some of the  new states are still young, and do not have adequate experience  in statehood. Strong mutual mistrust is the second factor. Let  us not dwell on explaining the reasons for this mistrust; let us  acknowledge that it exists. Well, the third factor--it seems to  me that there are still many people who would like to return to  the past--a single Union, centralization, etc., once again. A  general economic crisis is, to my mind, the main reason for  difficulties in the CIS. In the Union, the economy was  completely subordinated to political interests. Important  economic decisions were made not only without any serious  scientific analysis but also contrary to common sense. We are  now having to pay for this.    We must reconcile ourselves to this because there is no  other  way to a better life. History indicates that time passes, wounds  caused by the disintegration of empires heal, and life returns  to normal. Look at India, it now has normal economic relations  with England. The old enmity has been forgotten. We should now  have courage to admit that we will be drawing closer to one  another for a long time to come and with difficulty and, well,  also to believe that this will happen anyway.    [Blyudin] Numerous facts have been reported in our newspaper  which testify to the anti-Russian sentiment in Baku: Russians  are being evicted from their apartments, they are leaving the  republic. What is your attitude toward this?    [Guliyev] Yes, the Russian-speaking population emigrated  from  Azerbaijan during the reign of the People's Front. However, the  situation has changed since Geydar Aliyev was elected president.  We see that people are already coming back.    There are about 200,000 Russians in our country; some of  them  have lived here for more than 200 years. Our parliament will  pass laws that will securely protect their interests. Nobody  asks you in America what your ethnic background is; everybody is  American there. We should build approximately the same relations  in Azerbaijan. The idea of mononationalist politics is a dead  end. We want the Russian-speaking population to feel that  Azerbaijan is their motherland.    I am convinced that the parliament will pass the necessary  legislative acts as soon as the first half of the year.    [Blyudin] What role do you assign to Russia in stopping the  Armenian-Azerbaijan war?    [Guliyev] Of course, we believe that the Russian state will  assist in solving all the problems that have accumulated in our  region in recent years. I am convinced that Russia has such an  opportunity; both its political and economic resources are  sufficiently powerful. International organizations could take  part in these issues, shall we say, arithmetically, to the tune  of 20 percent.    We understand that complex and contradictory processes are  underway within Russia. However, we see that the above  notwithstanding, the real political forces are striving to solve  the problems peacefully. Nonetheless, political stabilization is  underway in Russia, and I attach great hopes to the growth of  the role of Russia in the peacemaking process along with this.    [Blyudin] What are the objectives of your visit to Moscow?    [Guliyev] First of all, I would like to become better  acquainted with my colleagues in Russia and share our views on  our common problems, learn where we are close to each other and  what we differ on: We must simply know each other before  anything is resolved. I would very much like a regular  businesslike relationship to develop between our parliaments.    Strong economic relations have historically evolved between  us. This is why borders between Russia and Azerbaijan should not  exist as far as investment and the economy are concerned.  Naturally, the laws our parliaments pass should promote rather  than hamper the processes of integration.    Russia is our big neighbor; we want to open all borders for  the economies. There will be no barriers to Russian investment,  but Russia should not throw up barriers to Azerbaijani  investments, either. We are in favor of civilized relations.    I worked for 12 years as the director of an oil refinery. At  that time we reported to a Union ministry; I know many Russian  oilmen well and have many friends in Russia. I come to Moscow  with great hopes because I believe in the power of common sense;  I believe that if there is enough will, a compromise may be  reached on any difficult issue.    Naturally, discussing the issue of stopping the war is also  an objective of my visit. Neither the Azeri nor the Armenian  people need this war. People are dying on both sides. I think  that everybody has ascertained this: We will not yield a single  square meter of our land. This should be understandable. If they  try to compel us to make a certain decision by forcible methods,  this means that we will fight. However, I would like to say  again that the war is not needed. Political decisions are needed.     "

Diplomatic delegation heads, military attaches, and other  officials of the diplomatic corps accredited in the country were  accompanied by Deputy Foreign Relations Minister Nicolas  Rodriguez, who has firsthand knowledge of the school which  trains officers for Cuba's Navy, merchant marine, and fishing  boats.    Following their welcome in the form of a brief military  parade, the diplomats took a two and one-half hour tour to  observe the details of projects required of the hundreds of  specialists who graduate from the academy. The projects are  related to the country's defense and other activities linked to  national economic development    The academy, located in Bauta Municipality, Havana Province,  educates military science graduates; experts on mines,  torpedoes, complex artillery missile systems, radio  communications, and power installations; navigation officers;  and naval science graduates.    Hundreds of youths are tested annually before registration  at  the academy, which graduated 200 students during the last school  year and which organizes the country's maritime manning tables,  among other duties.    In keeping with the Cuban Foreign Ministry's policy of  promoting contact between accredited diplomats and the many  domestic sectors, the foreign officials visited classrooms,  talked with recruits and officers, and had access to modern  weapons displays.    The domestic and foreign reporters accompanying the  diplomats  also witnessed peculiar events, such as the curiosity exhibited  by Joseph Gerard Sullivan, chief of the U.S. Interests section  in Cuba, about sophisticated equipment used to camouflage  submarine units.    At the end of the tour, the visitors were able to closely  observe the NIG 14 antisubmarine helicopter and the installation  of a powerful land-sea rocket launcher, which, in addition to  being part of the academy students' curriculum, are defense  instruments used by the Cuban naval forces.

Mr. de Klerk was speaking in Pretoria after meeting with  visiting Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring.    [Begin De Klerk recording] It's great to be good friends  again with Ireland. We, during our discussion, focused firstly  on the process in South Africa, on the prospects of a free and  fair election, the problem of violence -- what is being done  about it, what can be done; on the negotiation process which has  not been completed. As you know, some significant parties are  not on board and we're trying to get them on board. Our meeting  with Mr. Nelson Mandela will also focus on the state of  negotiations. We also focused on the European Union's  relationship to a new South Africa, the role it could play in  ensuring that this first chapter of the new South Africa will be  a very successful one; focused on how we could expand and the  necessity for expansion of bilateral relationships in the sphere  of trade and industry. I welcome the establishment of a  cooperative organization between the private sector of Ireland  and the private sector of South Africa. We welcome the  establishment of full diplomatic relations.    By and large, may I say that we hope that also this visit  will contribute towards good cooperation between us in South  Africa, those in charge of the election -- the Independent  Electoral Commission, the government and other parties, and the  teams of international observers that we expect here to be  vastly expanded as we come nearer to the election. We welcome  the international observation which will take place. It is  important that international community should satisfy  themselves, and it is also important that their presence can  make a contribution to ensure that there won't be intimidation  because that poses the biggest threat to the coming elections.

During  a meeting between Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi  and Foreign Ministry State Secretary Dieter Kastrup, the  discussion focused on the establishment of an institute to  promote the German language in Tehran, the reestablishment of a  German archaeological institute, and the opening of a German  school in the Iranian capital for children from German-Iranian  families.    According to the Iranian minister, the language institute  could perhaps be considered as a first step toward the reopening  of the Goethe-Institute. Today, Friday, Va'ezi will also be  received by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Agreement was reached on having the German-Iranian Cultural  Commission, which met in December 1991 for the last time,  convene again. According to the Foreign Ministry, this was  primarily the wish of the Iranians. Va'ezi's statement that the  commission members are to meet this year have not been confirmed  in Bonn. The Foreign Ministry wants to think about a date only  if there is ""movement"" in Tehran, which means, for instance,  that children from mixed marriages get access to the German  school. Va'ezi said after the talks that his government is  willing to make this concession.    Agreement was reached on holding a joint seminar on human  rights issues in Tehran in April. In particular lawyers,  judges, and ""practical workers"" are to participate in it. Over  the next few weeks experts are to negotiate on the German  language institute and the archaeological institute.    According to the Foreign Ministry, State Secretary Kastrup  broached the persecution of British writer Salman Rushdie by a  death sentence in connection with Tehran's desire for closer  ties with the European Union.    As long as this sentence is upheld, there cannot be any  normal relations. According to the Foreign Ministry, Kastrup  rejected Va'ezi's claim that the matter is exclusively the  business of Iran and Great Britain by pointing out that this is  something that concerns the entire European Union.

Mr.  Kranidhiotis also answered a series of questions from the  foreign European Parliament deputies. This was the first  official briefing of the European Parliament on the Greek  presidency's program.    In his address, Mr. Kranidhiotis presented the general  guidelines of the program on joint foreign policy and security  of the European Union [EU]. Concerning the Community's  expansion, Mr. Kranidhiotis stressed that the Greek presidency  will pursue the conclusion of negotiations with Austria, Sweden,  Finland, and Norway by 1 March, while also promoting the  accession of Cyprus and Malta. Referring to the Cyprus issue, he  noted the important decision by the Council on the appointment  of an observer, who will be briefing the Council on the  development of the intercommunal talks in New York. He also  informed the Commission members that a meeting on the EU-Cyprus  association will be held in Brussels in May. Mr. Kranidhiotis  then referred to the EU's joint action in foreign policy issues  and pointed out that the presidency will primarily deal with  former Yugoslavia and the effective promotion of humanitarian  aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He then answered questions from  foreign Eurodeputies on the situation in Bosnia, the Palestinian  issue, and Skopje.    Responding to a question on Skopje from a Dutch deputy, who  alleged that Greece has proceeded with a de facto closure of its  borders with that republic, Mr. Kranidhitios categorically  denied this allegation, stressing that most of Skopeje's imports  come through Greece, including 80-85 percent of its oil.  Concluding this issue, Mr. Kranidhiotis reiterated the  well-known Greek positions on Skopje and stressed that, in  addition to the well-known issue of the name, we expect from  Skopje a series of moves such as the abolition of the Greek  emblems and the amendment of the preamble to the constitution,  which implies clear irredentist and expansionist intentions.

At the opening ceremonies of the Sino-U.S. talks on trade  and  investment projects held today, this female Chinese minister  stressed that China hopes to resolve the MFN status  unconditionally. The MFN status is a pure trade issue; it is  unwise to link it to the ""human rights"" issue, nor does it  comply with strategic thinking.    The Chinese Government trade and economic relations  delegation headed by Wu Yi arrived in Los Angeles on 8 April and  will leave for Washington D.C. tomorrow to attend the Eighth  Session of the Sino- U.S. Joint Committee for Commerce and  Trade. During the four-day stay in Los Angeles, Wu Yi has  answered questions on the MFN status on several occasions put by  figures from various circles.    She said that the MFN status is the kernel clause in the  Sino- U.S. Agreement on Trade Relations signed in 1979. It is  not a favor bestowed by one country on another but an  arrangement of mutual benefit on an equal footing.    She believed that, should the United States cancel the MFN  status, China would suffer certain losses; however, the United  States would likewise suffer and its losses would be bigger than  those of China. The United States would lose the huge Chinese  market whereas more products, technology, and funds from other  countries would find their way into the Chinese market.    Today, Wu Yi repeatedly called on the United States to adopt  a practical attitude, weigh the pros and cons, and remove  manmade obstacles to enable Sino-U.S. ties in trade and economic  relations to develop healthily.

Relations between the two countries now stand at their lowest  ebb following Britain's protest to Iran for allegedly supplying  the Provisional IRA with cash or arms.    Tehran formally denied that and hit back today with new  allegations claiming that Britain was sheltering terrorist  organisations working against the Iranian Government. The  Tehran Times said that Britain had no right to question Iran's  adherence to international conventions against aiding  terrorists. ""Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead  ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian  groups they harbour in the West,"" the newspaper said.    But a Foreign Office spokesman said: ""The Government denies  any contact of any kind with the Mojahedin-e Khalq group.  Opposition groups from any country are free to operate in the  United Kingdom within the law. If they break the law they will  be prosecuted. If the Iranian have evidence of illegal activity  they should let us have sight of it.""    Earlier this week, Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas  Hogg summoned the Iran charge d'affaires Gholam Reza Ansari to  give him a dressing down about Iran's alleged involvmenet with  the Provisional IRA. Afterwards, Iran flatly denied this  allegation, although Britain remains convinced that there were  such links.    The paper says that the British protest about the IRA was ""a  smokescreen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian  terrorists are providing material and personnel to the  Iraq-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic  republic.""    Britain's relations with Iran have been in a state of  turbulence ever since the late Ayatollah Khomeyni passed  sentence of death (a ""fatwa"") on author Salman Rushdie in 1989  for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses. This was  a call to Muslims the world over to kill him. The sentence has  never been lifted and Rushdie has been forced into hiding ever  since.     "

There is no doubt of this, and the hearing  once again confirmed this. Inasmuch as the Georgian side is not  in control of the situation on a significant part of the  territory of the former GSSR, we are unable to count on  Georgia's fulfillment of all of its treaty obligations. It was  noted on several occasions that unless the problems of Georgia's  internal structure are settled, and unless there are guarantees  of full and honorable resolution of the Abkhazian and South  Ossetian problems, which generated bloody conflicts involving  many of our fellow countrymen in the recent past, some articles  of the treaty (chiefly articles 3 and 4) will, in the event of  its ratification, impose a unilateral obligation on Russia to  arm the Georgian side, support its attempts to regain control  over lost regions, and cut off attempts to assist them (the  regions.--NG) from Russian territory in the event of escalation  of the military conflict. We must note that by accepting  obligations before Georgia in the Caucasus that would be  difficult to fulfill even for Russia, we lose the trust of the  other parties to the conflict, and do damage to our intermediary  peacekeeping mission.    ...We reject the capability of the Georgian side to  guarantee  strict fulfillment of the provisions of the treaty regarding  nontransfer of armament and military equipment and technology to  third parties.    ...The members of the committee support the oral statement  by  RF President B. N. Yeltsin regarding postponement of submission  of the treaty, signed on 3 February 1994, for ratification to  the Federal Assembly until the conflicts in Abkhazia and South  Ossetia are settled. What we cannot understand in any way is  this: For what purpose is Russia, as represented by its supreme  official, to sign the new treaty, which the president does not  intend to submit for ratification, before such a settlement is  reached, before Russian demarcation forces are introduced on the  line of confrontation along the Ingura River, and before the  earlier treaty between Russian and Georgia dated 9 October 1993  is submitted for ratification?    ...2. What raises certain concerns in the Committee for CIS  Affairs is not the fact itself that besides the treaty an entire  list of Russian-Georgian agreements have been signed, including  many that are useful and necessary, but that they are not being  examined as supplements to and a consequence of the Treaty on  Friendship, Good-Neighbor Relations and Cooperation that was  concurrently signed and is now subject to ratification. As an  example these agreements also include ones like the ""Agreement  on the Status and Conditions of Operation of Russian Border  Troops Located in the Georgian Republic,"" which foresees  transfer of real and movable military property, assistance in  personnel training and so on. Members of the committee did not  receive an answer in the course of the hearings to the question  as to why Article 33 of this agreement, in contrast to the  analogous article of the concurrently signed treaty, foresees  its enactment ""from the day of exchange of written certificates  of fulfillment of internal government procedures by the Parties  necessary for its enactment,"" rather than making a direct  reference to the need for its ratification.    ...All the committee has in this regard is the ""Protocol on  the Meeting of Delegations of the RF and the Georgian Republic,""  signed on 3 February of this year by P. Grachev and O.  Patsatsiya. The protocol, which requires no ratification,  documents only the principle of creating Russian military bases  in the Georgian Republic. It is known from statements made at  the hearings by the RF minister of defense and representatives  of the Defense Ministry that the reference is to the bases in  Vaziani, Akhalkalaki and Batumi, with the latter to have  branches in Gudauty and Sukhumi. The Abkhazian Supreme Council  has already declared that it does not recognize any agreements  of which it is not a participant in regard to territory under  its control (that is, Gudauty and Sukhumi).    ...3. Examining the general problems of the Russian-Georgian  agreements, the Committee for CIS Affairs notes that  speculations regarding a unilateral advantage for Russia in the  signed Russian-Georgian treaty acts do not withstand criticism.  The economic assistance provided to the government of the  Georgian Republic, which is increasing the amount of Russia's  internal government debt, cannot as yet be estimated in absolute  figures because we do not have data by which to appraise the  value of buildings and structures being transferred to the  Georgian Republic, the prices of the military equipment, arms  and technology, the cost of leasing military facilities on  Georgian territory and so on. Implementation of the agreements  will mean reduction of Russian military presence in Georgia. No  matter how some superficial conclusions in the press may try to  make us believe the reverse, replacement of Russian divisions in  Akhalkalaki and Batumi by regiments can in no way be said to be  an expansion of military presence. As for growth of our military  influence as a result of equipment deliveries and personnel  training, the history of Russia and the USSR contains many cases  in which equipment and personnel that we trained were used  against us (German armament in the 1920s-1930s, assistance to  the People's Republic of China after the Second World War, and  so on.

By ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI, Zbigniew Brzezinski was President Jimmy Carter's  national security adviser. This is adapted from his testimony Wednesday before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.      Given the possibility that the United States might be plunged by a presidential  decision into a war with Iraq, I urge (the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)  to examine carefully and press the Administration for answers regarding the  following three clusters of critically important issues:    1) What are the political limits and the likely geopolitical dynamics of war,  once the President decides to initiate it?    For example, one has to be concerned that the use of air power in order to  mitigate casualties for U.S. ground forces will require the killing not only of  the hostages but also of thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands or even more --  of Iraqi civilians, who are not to be held responsible for Saddam Hussein's  flagrant misconduct. I wonder if this is politically viable, in terms of the  longer-range relationship of America with the Muslim world. And is it morally  admissible?    It is also not clear to me how the Administration envisages the termination of  the war. Are we counting on a total surrender or a negotiated outcome after a  spasm of violence? If a complete military victory becomes necessary, are we  prepared to occupy all of Iraq? Are we logistically prepared for a war that is  not promptly resolved by air power, and are we psychologically prepared for  heavy American casualties?    Once war begins, Iran and Syria may not remain passive and the war could  spread. One has to anticipate the possibility that Iraq will seek to draw  Israel into the war. Does the Administration have a contingency plan in the  event that Jordan becomes a battlefield? What might be the U.S. reaction if  some Israeli leaders seek to take advantage of an expanded war to effect the  expulsion of all Palestinians from their homes on the West Bank? The gulf  crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict could thus become linked, our efforts to  the contrary notwithstanding.    I believe the Administration is paying insufficient attention to these inherent  uncertainties of war. The war could prove more destructive, more bloody, and  more difficult to terminate than Administration spokesmen and sundry private  advocates of war seem to think. An American military invasion of Iraq would be  likely to set off a chain reaction that could bog America down in a variety of  prolonged security operations, in a setting of intensified political  instability.    2) What are the likely broader after-effects of the war?    The Administration is yet to move beyond vague generalities regarding its  concept of the postwar Middle East. Yet considerable anxiety is justified that  the United States might not be able to extricate itself from the Middle Eastern  caldron, especially if in the meantime the Arab masses have become radicalized  and hostile to the Arab regimes that endorsed the U.S. military action.    With the United States embroiled in the Middle Eastern mess for years to come,  Europe and Japan -- free to promote their own agendas -- would pursue  enhancement of their economic power.    It is probable that fundamentalist Iran would become the dominant power in the  Persian Gulf, and that terrorist Syria would inherit the mantle of leadership  among the Arabs. It is also possible that the destruction of Iraq by America  and the resulting radicalization of the Arabs might leave Israel, armed as it  already is with nuclear weapons, more tempted to use its military force to  impose its will in this volatile region.    None of the above possible developments would be in the American interest. Yet  I do not sense that sufficient strategic planning has been devoted by the  Administration to an analysis of the wider shock effects of a war that is bound  to be exploited by other parties for their own selfish ends.    3) Finally, what is being done to ensure that the war's burdens and sacrifices  are more fairly distributed among its potential beneficiaries or participants?    One cannot help but be struck by the relatively limited contributions of our  allies. Some states with forces in Saudi Arabia have indicated that they will  not participate in offensive operations. The American public certainly is not  satisfied with the financial support extended by Germany and Japan. Is the  Adminisitration satisfied? What additional financial contribution can be  expected from the Saudis and the Kuwaitis? It is noteworthy that Saudi Arabia  has already benefited very substantially from the oil crisis, and that the emir  of Kuwait and his family are in the forefront of those arguing for Americans to  initiate military action. Are we thus -- despite all of our rhetoric about ""the  new international order"" -- not running the risk of becoming the mercenaries in  this war, applauded and financed by others to do the fighting and the dying for  them?

By ZBIGNIEW BRZEZINSKI, Zbigniew Brzezinski was President Jimmy Carter's  national security adviser. This is adapted from his testimony Wednesday before  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.      Given the possibility that the United States might be plunged by a presidential  decision into a war with Iraq, I urge (the Senate Foreign Relations Committee)  to examine carefully and press the Administration for answers regarding the  following three clusters of critically important issues:    1) What are the political limits and the likely geopolitical dynamics of war,  once the President decides to initiate it?    For example, one has to be concerned that the use of air power in order to  mitigate casualties for U.S. ground forces will require the killing not only of  the hostages but also of thousands -- perhaps tens of thousands or even more --  of Iraqi civilians, who are not to be held responsible for Saddam Hussein's  flagrant misconduct. I wonder if this is politically viable, in terms of the  longer-range relationship of America with the Muslim world. And is it morally  admissible?    It is also not clear to me how the Administration envisages the termination of  the war. Are we counting on a total surrender or a negotiated outcome after a  spasm of violence? If a complete military victory becomes necessary, are we  prepared to occupy all of Iraq? Are we logistically prepared for a war that is  not promptly resolved by air power, and are we psychologically prepared for  heavy American casualties?    Once war begins, Iran and Syria may not remain passive and the war could  spread. One has to anticipate the possibility that Iraq will seek to draw  Israel into the war. Does the Administration have a contingency plan in the  event that Jordan becomes a battlefield? What might be the U.S. reaction if  some Israeli leaders seek to take advantage of an expanded war to effect the  expulsion of all Palestinians from their homes on the West Bank? The gulf  crisis and the Arab-Israeli conflict could thus become linked, our efforts to  the contrary notwithstanding.    I believe the Administration is paying insufficient attention to these inherent  uncertainties of war. The war could prove more destructive, more bloody, and  more difficult to terminate than Administration spokesmen and sundry private  advocates of war seem to think. An American military invasion of Iraq would be  likely to set off a chain reaction that could bog America down in a variety of  prolonged security operations, in a setting of intensified political  instability.    2) What are the likely broader after-effects of the war?    The Administration is yet to move beyond vague generalities regarding its  concept of the postwar Middle East. Yet considerable anxiety is justified that  the United States might not be able to extricate itself from the Middle Eastern  caldron, especially if in the meantime the Arab masses have become radicalized  and hostile to the Arab regimes that endorsed the U.S. military action.    With the United States embroiled in the Middle Eastern mess for years to come,  Europe and Japan -- free to promote their own agendas -- would pursue  enhancement of their economic power.    It is probable that fundamentalist Iran would become the dominant power in the  Persian Gulf, and that terrorist Syria would inherit the mantle of leadership  among the Arabs. It is also possible that the destruction of Iraq by America  and the resulting radicalization of the Arabs might leave Israel, armed as it  already is with nuclear weapons, more tempted to use its military force to  impose its will in this volatile region.    None of the above possible developments would be in the American interest. Yet  I do not sense that sufficient strategic planning has been devoted by the  Administration to an analysis of the wider shock effects of a war that is bound  to be exploited by other parties for their own selfish ends.    3) Finally, what is being done to ensure that the war's burdens and sacrifices  are more fairly distributed among its potential beneficiaries or participants?    One cannot help but be struck by the relatively limited contributions of our  allies. Some states with forces in Saudi Arabia have indicated that they will  not participate in offensive operations. The American public certainly is not  satisfied with the financial support extended by Germany and Japan. Is the  Adminisitration satisfied? What additional financial contribution can be  expected from the Saudis and the Kuwaitis? It is noteworthy that Saudi Arabia  has already benefited very substantially from the oil crisis, and that the emir  of Kuwait and his family are in the forefront of those arguing for Americans to  initiate military action. Are we thus -- despite all of our rhetoric about ""the  new international order"" -- not running the risk of becoming the mercenaries in  this war, applauded and financed by others to do the fighting and the dying for  them?    I believe that it is already evident that the principle sacrifices of war --  both financial and in blood -- will have to be borne by America, and to a  massively disproportionate degree. Such evident unfairness will inevitably have  a very adverse impact on American attitudes toward its allies, with deleterious  consequences for American public support for the so-called international order.    Therefore, in my view, neither an American war to liberate Kuwait nor a  preventive war to destroy Iraq's power is urgently required, be it in terms of  the American national interest or of the imperatives of world order. President  Bush's initial commitment to punish Iraq and to deter it remains the wisest  course, and one that this nation can resolutely and in unity sustain over the  long haul.

Kozlovskiy said some of the executives in Defense Ministry  companies had indeed committed offenses, but that all of them  had been ""punished.""    He said Lukashenko's accusations were groundless because,  ""following the logic of Lukashenko, formerly manager of a state  farm and nowadays chairman of the Commission for Fighting  Corruption, he himself could have been dismissed from his rural  managerial post immediately after an anonymous report came in  that a pailful of formula feed had been stolen from one of his  pigsties.""    ""The defense minister cannot be responsible for the behavior  of each soldier and officer of the Belarussian army, which is  nearly 100,000 strong, any more than a factory manager can bear  personal responsibility for the personal integrity of each of  his workers, of whom there may be many thousands,"" Kozlovskiy  said, describing Lukashenko's accusations as ""an attempt to draw  the army into political intrigues and destabilize the situation  in the Republic during the presidential election campaign.""    Asked whether the Defense Ministry needed to have its own  businesses, Kozlovskiy said the funds the Armed Forces were  receiving from the state were ""clearly insufficient."" ""In order  to keep the army from being ruined and strangled financially we  are forced to use, for example, the potential of transport  aircraft for the commercial transportation of cargo,"" he said.    Meanwhile, the prime minister's spokesman Vladimir Zametalin  told INTERFAX another five members of government accused by  Lukashenko of various offenses were going to bring defamation of  character suits. They are Deputy Premiers Nikolay Kostikov and  Stanislav Bril, Foreign Minister Petr Kravchenko, Minister of  Foreign Economic Relations Vladimir Radkevich, and National Bank  Chairman Stanislav Bogdankevich.

The decision was taken when the collapse of the Soviet Union  freed resources tied up since the Cold War began. Although  Russia still takes up a large chunk of MI6 resources, the  intelligence spotlight has increasingly shone on Iran.    The high quality of evidence behind the British warning  indicates intense intelligence activity over a long period.  Names, dates, places of meetings, details of financial and arms  proposals -- including ground-to-air missiles -- were all  collated before the British Government decided to act.    Relations between the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence (MOI)  and Sinn Fein and the Provisional IRA have been under intense  intelligence scrutiny, as have the Iranian front men heading the  operation.    Plans to arm and finance the IRA have been personally  supervised by Amir Eravani -- known in the West as Amir Hussein  Taghavi -- who is MOI chief for Western Europe and America.    The co-ordinator of links with the IRA is said to be an  Iranian diplomat based in The Hague. Other agents enjoy  diplomatic cover in European capitals including Bonn and Paris.    Although there is no evidence of arms having been sent to  the  IRA, it is likely that some financial aid has been given. The  MOI is believed to provide similar aid to other groups such as  the Basque ETA and Japan's Red Army Faction.    Britain's warning has worsened relations with Iran which  have  been at a low level since the late Ayatollah Khomeini called for  the death of Salman Rushdie in 1989. He claimed Rushdie's novel,  The Satanic Verses, blasphemed Islam.    The Tehran Times, the influential Tehran  English-language daily, yesterday accused London of sheltering  ""anti-Iranian terrorists."" [passage omitted]     "
0,FT944-11242 ,"FT944-11242 _AN-EKGC8AFFFT 941107   FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (3): Relations with US improve - Diplomacy has been a key factor this year      By TONY WALKER   When Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, addressed the US Council on foreign relations in New York recently, he spoke with more self-assurance about diplomatic achievements than might have been possible earlier in the year. Mr Qian also pursued a theme that is fast becoming a staple of public utterances by Chinese leaders on a range of subjects from Gatt membership to regional security. It is that China, because of its growing economic weight, expects to play a much expanded role in a complex and unstable world. 'People with vision have come to realise that the world needs China for peace, stability and prosperity just as China needs the world,' he said. As 1994 draws to a close, there is no doubt this has been a successful year for Chinese diplomacy with Beijing further distancing itself from the bloody events of 1989 in which the military turned its guns on student pro-democracy protesters. The US agreement in mid-year to sever the link between renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation status and human rights issues represented a significant breakthrough. Relations with the US have improved markedly as a consequence, although irritations continue over issues ranging from Washington's decision to upgrade ties with Taiwan to terms for China's re-entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Among tangible signs of improvement was the joint Sino-US statement in October on 'Missile Proliferation' in which the two sides agreed to work together to halt proliferation of missiles. They also resolved to co-operate in efforts to achieve an end to the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons. In return for China's agreement to support a global ban on exports of missiles under the terms of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), the US lifted sanctions on the export of high technology items. Since the disastrous visit to Beijing early this year of Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State, marked by an unseemly wrangle over human rights, a steady stream of senior Americans has passed through the Chinese capital; among them, Mr Ron Brown, the Commerce Secretary and Mr William Perry, the Defence Secretary. The latter was the first visit to China of a US Defence Secretary since 1989 and yielded agreement on enhanced military consultations, and co-operation in such fields as defence conversion. The two sides did not address the issue of the continued US embargo on military aid to China imposed after June, 1989. The growing frequency of Sino-US exchanges indicates that the two are bent on building a more constructive relationship in both the commercial and political and security spheres. This is consistent with the Clinton administration's desire to re-focus its China policy in ways that make it less susceptible to human rights pressures. China would also be well satisfied with broader foreign policy developments. The defusing, for the time being, of the North Korean nuclear crisis represented a success for Chinese diplomacy which had striven behind the scenes to avoid a sanctions process and, worse, the crisis spiralling out of control. In a way, the North Korea issue provided a textbook case of Beijing's cautious foreign policy approach. China prefers quiet diplomacy to confrontation on most issues with the notable exception of questions involving Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet and human rights. This much reflects the low-key non-ideological personal style of Foreign Minister Qian as it does Beijing's desire to be regarded as a good neighbour in its own region and a constructive player globally. China, for the moment, appears sensitive to regional concerns about its growing economic strength, although Beijing's uncompromising pursuit of its claim to disputed islands and surrounding waters in the South China Sea risks confrontation, principally with Vietnam, see report, this page. The Spratlys issue is one of the irritants most often cited as an argument for the further development of a regional security consensus, but here again Beijing is cautious. While officials see merit in dialogue they are sceptical of grander schemes such as Europe's CSCE framework. This caution extends to Beijing's approach to the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (APEC). While China sees merit in APEC, it is not ready, at this stage, to embrace the grouping wholeheartedly as much more than a consultative forum. Among China's concerns is that APEC itself might develop into a trading bloc in competition with other groupings, including the European Community. China, whose trading ambitions are almost boundless, is understandably against the idea of the world being divided into competing economic spheres. Apart from the US, China has also witnessed in the past months an improvement in its relations with key European powers, including Germany and France. The visit to France by President Jiang Zemin in September followed a period of coolness over French arms sales to Taiwan, but the issue was defused earlier this year when France agreed to place a moratorium on new weapons business. China's relations with the Russian Federation have also been improving, culminating with the visit to Moscow in the autumn by Mr Jiang. This resulted in a series of framework economic agreements designed to propel the relationship into the next century. The two sides also agreed to stop targeting each other with nuclear weapons and to further reduce the deployment of troops on their lengthy common boundary. The one really jarring element of China's international relationships, apart from ongoing human rights pressures, remains the row over Hong Kong governor Chris Patten's attempts to broaden democracy, and the effect this is having on Sino-British ties. At this stage, there seems little prospect of an end to the friction and its negative impact on relations between Beijing and London. The 1,000 or so days between now and 1997 promise a bumpy ride.

[sentence as received] He made the remark in a  meeting with Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Euro-American  Affairs Mahmud Va'ezi who is currently in Germany.    Stressing that Bonn attaches great importance to Iran and  Iranians, Kinkel added that Germany would never treat Iran under  the influence of external pressures. He described as ""good""  Tehran-Bonn relations, and said now that the world is  increasingly becoming interested in the Islamic world Bonn is  decisive to take a brighter outlook towards the issue but  assured it would not impose its ideas on the Islamic states.

He also called for further help of Germany  for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the Bosnian  Muslims.    Touching on the issues of weapons of mass destruction and  regional and global terrorism, Va'ezi announced Iran's readiness  for any cooperation with Germany and Europe to bring stability  and security to Central Asia, Caucasia and Persian Gulf regions.  He welcomed Bonn's more active role in this connection.    Welcoming Iran's readiness to have cooperation on human  rights issue and campaign against terrorism and weapons of mass  destruction, Kinkel expressed pleasure over the meeting of the  third Iran-Germany seminar on human rights, to be held in Tehran  next april.    In another development, Va'ezi held talks with his German  counterpart Dieter Kastropp who said that exchange of visits  between officials of the two countries was an effective factor  to preserve and continue bilateral relations. Va'ezi said that  further Tehran-Bonn cooperation would be to the benefit of  international interests and would guarantee establishment of  regional peace and stability.    Kastropp called for further cooperation in the field of  cultural relations through signing agreements in the area.     "

The conference will begin tomorrow and last until  Sunday in the Convention Palace in Havana.    The group traveled by charter flight directly from Miami and  immediately went to the Comodoro Hotel, on Havana's west coast,  where they will be lodged and where the accreditation offices  are.    Organizing commission sources told PRENSA LATINA that the  recent arrivals will join the approximately 100 people already  registered to take part in the meeting.    Even though the official list of participants has not yet  been published, the sources said it includes former politicians,  businessmen, journalists, intellectuals, and leaders of Cuban  organizations who live in more than 40 countries.    The invitations were individually addressed and were  distributed by local authorities, who took into account the  views of the country's social and mass organizations, according  to official reports.    The conference was summoned by Foreign Relations Minister  Roberto Robaina on 14 February. One of its purposes is to  ""examine measures for normalization of emigrant links with the  Cuban nation, Cuban institutions, and Cuban families.""    The conference is an opportunity for Cubans living abroad to  present, in good faith, their legitimate wishes and concerns,  Robaina said. Nevertheless, he said there would be no  ""possibility for political manipulations or opportunities for  those who wish to intervene in affairs that are the sole concern  of those who live, work, and struggle in the fatherland.""    Unofficial reports state the meeting will be inaugurated  tomorrow with a special intervention by Robaina himself. Other  important officials, including Ricardo Alarcon, parliament  president; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of State;  and Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and Artists,  will brief participants on topics crucial to life in Cuba. The  closing ceremony is expected on Sunday afternoon, when the  conference results will be made public.     "

People associated with different organizations and various  political persuasions will attend, said Rene Mujica, an adviser  to Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina.    During an interview on Radio Rebelde, Mujica explained that  approximately 200 persons will receive personal invitations and  that representatives of anti-Cuban terrorist groups -- which are  mainly based in the United States -- will be excluded.    This meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April, was announced by  Foreign Minister Robaina on 14 February.    Robaina explained that one of the conference's goals is ""to  examine measures that could be adopted to normalize the  immigrants' ties to their homeland.""    Mujica says this is not seen as a short-term issue, since  most of the immigrants' ties with their homeland have developed  within the framework of 35 years of [word indistinct] by the  United States against the Cuban revolution.    Considering these antecedents, one can understand that the  goal of normalizing the immigrants' relations with their  homeland will not be easy, Mujica said.    However, he added, we believe this is a legitimate objective  that benefits all parties involved and injures no one, and it  can be achieved if both we and the immigrants have the will to  work towards its realization.    The official did not rule out finding a way to achieve this  goal with former counterrevolutionaries who have changed their  attitude, but he made clear that this objective can never be  achieved with those who persist with an antinational attitude.  There is no place here for the counterrevolution, Mujica  stressed.    It was recalled that the first meeting between local  authorities and immigrants took place in late 1978, but  afterward, the aggressive policy toward Cuba of the Ronald  Reagan and George Bush administrations deftly constrained the  development of these ties.

But another survey published today reports that there will be fewer jobs for school-leavers this year than in 1991, with 11 per cent of organisations surveyed planning no recruitment of school-leavers. The Manpower survey found that 19 per cent of employers were planning to create jobs, with only 13 per cent forecasting job cuts. Manufacturing continues to predict a gradual improvement in job prospects, with builders in the private sector now more likely to be recruiting than cutting jobs. Clothing and textiles, retailing, and transport and distribution are the most optimistic sectors. The most pessimistic are energy and water, local government and banking. London is the only region where a net 3 per cent of employers surveyed still predict further job cuts. Scotland is the most buoyant, with a net 20 per cent expecting to recruit, followed by East Anglia and the East Midlands. The school-leaver survey of 186 employers by Industrial Relations Services found that, of those companies which were still recruiting school-leavers, one in three intended to recruit fewer this year. The starting salaries for school-leavers are expected to average Pounds 5,854. Pay rates have risen about 4.7 per cent in the past year. More than half of the jobs now include training leading to a qualification, but school-leavers in jobs with high-quality training receive only 6 per cent less pay than those in jobs where training is not provided. Apprentices typically receive 50 per cent of the adult rate, with those in clerical jobs receiving 75 per cent. The Young Ones: a survey of school-leavers' pay.

Fear of redundancy and unemployment rose sharply over the past few weeks to 53 per cent of those in full-time or part-time work after falling to 43 per cent in September, the survey indicates. Anxiety about prospects has grown most among women, part-time workers and the young. Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group that commissioned the series of monthly surveys, said: 'Confidence is key to the strength of any economic recovery. 'Fear of job loss has grown dramatically, and those interviewed do not believe that unemployment has peaked and that confidence in the pace of recovery remains fragile.' According to the series of surveys, which started in April, fear over the possibility of redundancy had a first peak in July when 51 per cent of those in work said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned'. In August 47 per cent were of the same opinion and in September the figure was 43 per cent. This decline was in spite of the possibility of job losses in the public sector because of an announcement by the government that any pay increases must be funded by increased productivity. October's level of anxiety among part-time workers contrasts with six months ago. In April only a third of part-time workers expressed concern over redundancy, but last month the figure was 45 per cent. Mr Bob Worcester, MORI chairman, said people 'read that businessmen are more bullish but then they look around among their friends and nothing has changed. In addition, the government has talked on so many occasions about green shoots that they have become cynical.' MORI interviewed 930 adults aged 18 and over who work full-time or part-time.

Issues concerning security  and the devaluation were the focus of his discussions with  French authorities.    The Congo has asked for French assistance in reorganizing  its  security services, the weaknesses of which were exposed by the  recent unrest in Brazzaville. When questioned about the  devaluation, the Congolese president warned against the risk of  repeating the maneuver due to negative reactions on the part of  the countries concerned.    ""The devaluation is just a monetary adjustment. If the  economies of African states are in poor shape because negative  policies were pursued, it is clear that those same policies will  produce the same results as before,"" President Lissouba stated.    The devaluation should not be perceived as France abandoning  the franc zone countries, according to President Lissouba, who  advocates subregional and regional cooperation and the joint  development of scientific and technological potential.    Speaking on his country's economic situation, President  Lissouba announced that an agreement would be signed with the  IMF in the ""coming days,"" stressing that ""things are well under  way."" Furthermore, President Lissouba confirmed that his country  would reduce the number of civil service employees by 8,000,  this on instructions from the IMF. According to President  Lissouba, the Congo has the world's highest number of civil  servants per capita. He stated that this is because the civil  service is the country's sole industry. However, the Congolese  head of state gave assurances that the affected workers will be  redeployed elsewhere, ""as quickly as possible.""     "

Kravchuk opens the meeting with a brief speech, thanking the  correspondents for attending. Kravchuk then answers a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA question about a possible joint ownership of  Crimea by Russia and Ukraine. Kravchuk replies:    ""This idea should be put forward by the party that wants it.  If, for instance, the Crimea wants it, then it is not for us to  tell the Crimea, look, we are going to own you on a joint basis.  But there have been no such statements or intentions on the  part of past or present Crimean leaders. The Crimean leaders  have only expressed one opinion to date: First, they want to be  granted a statehood as a transitional stage and then, to become  part of Russia. This is a program, a goal of the party that is  currently in the majority in the parliament. The Crimean  president has the same program. All this time, especially  lately, they have been distancing themselves from Ukraine in all  possible ways except in the economic sphere, because they are  fully aware Crimea is 93 percent dependent on Ukraine.""    He says the idea of a joint Russian-Ukrainian ownership of  Crimea would be difficult to put into practice:    ""If the question of equal cultural, political, religious,  ethnic, and other conditions for Russians and Ukrainians in the  Crimea is raised, you will see at once that this problem cannot  be resolved. This joint ownership will mean that 95 percent will  be de facto owned by Russia and 5 percent, de jure, by Ukraine.""    Asked what way out he could propose, he said: ""There is only  one way out -- that the Crimean authorities should act in  conformity with the Constitution, that's all.""    At 1034 GMT a LITERATURNAYA GAZETA correspondent asks  Kravchuk if it could be guaranteed that he will refrain from the  use of force in settling the Crimean issue. Kravchuk answers:    ""I can tell you with full certainty that under no  circumstances will the leadership of Ukraine and I as its  president use forcible methods in resolving the Crimean issue.  I have said this at a Supreme Council session for all our  people to hear, because we realize that however much this might  hurt everyone, it would mean first and foremost a tragedy to us,  and it is our people who would suffer most. I have accordingly  called on the Crimean leadership to follow the same principle.""  He says the Moldova-Dniester region situation should not be  allowed to evolve between Ukraine and Crimea and warned against  any provocations, be it by Russian or Ukrainian forces, with  regard to the Crimea.    Halfway through the program a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  correspondent asks whether Russia and Ukraine would be able to  reach an agreement on the Black Sea Fleet. Kravchuk says:    ""Today the only issue is where the fleet will be stationed.  The infrastructure, all land-based economy of the Navy and so  on come later. What is the Russian stance today? That Ukraine  must have one base in the Crimea, in Donuzlav. Everything else  in the Crimea should belong to the Russian Black Sea Fleet --  not only Sevastopol. Sevastopol alone is 150 km. So, my  question is: Is it that Sevastopol is the base of the Russian  Navy or is it that the Russian Navy's base is in Sevastopol?  This is not just an editorial change. If it is Sevastopol,  this means 150 km. If the Russian Navy also takes hold of  Feodosia, Kerch, they even have Yalta on the list -- one does  not know why, it is not a military facility...(pauses) I will  then ask a practical question I keep raising with the  authorities, including Russian authorities. It so happens that  85 percent of all the infrastructure of the Black Sea Fleet of  the former Soviet Union -- I quote the figure from memory, so I  may be wrong -- is concentrated in Sevastopol. All or most  officers and junior ranks of the fleet live in Sevastopol. So,  today Ukraine receives its 174 ships, let us say, and they tell  us: move 160 km away from Sevastopol. We need -- just for these  ships -- 2,500 officers and junior ranks. They live in  Sevastopol, however. Are they prepared to move?""    He goes on to say that he understands Russia's interests in  the Black Sea:    ""Russia is interested in having its Navy in the Black Sea.  It does not have any other options right now. It is the south  frontier, interests must be protected and so on. I understand  it, we are not children here. Russia uses other bases on the  basis of a contract with Ukraine, through agreements. That's  it. But one should accept that these are Ukraine's bases.""    He concludes by saying that the agreement should be reached  following international principals:    ""There should be a lease agreement for Russia's main base in  Sevastopol. This is a norm -- that is what other countries do,  so we have not invented anything here. All other bases, which  are there -- the Russian Navy needs them -- all these bases  should be used by Russia through separate agreements.""    As he closes his meeting with the Russian correspondents,  Kravchuk asks the journalists to help build relations between  Russia and Ukraine with long-term prospects in mind.    ""We are living for today. Sometimes our relations are  determined by mercenary considerations, by feelings such as we  shall show them, we shall cut them off, we are not going to pay,  they are bad because they want to be independent. This is not  like us. For 340 years, we have not fought against one another.  And today, when the question is asked if there will be war  between Russia and Ukraine, I answer without hesitation: no,  there won't be. This is like the Lord's Prayer to me. No, I  say, this is simply inadmissible. If we fail to realize now  that we have reached the point where our future, our children  and grandchildren might be at risk -- that will be the most  frightening thing imaginable.""     "

This is the explanation that the Ministry gave for  reinforcing security around diplomatic missions in this capital  in the wake of the incident provoked by the forceful entrance of  a group of persons into the residence of the Belgian ambassador.    In statements for domestic and foreign media, Ministry  spokesman Miguel Alfonso said that Cuba and Belgium continue to  reject the permanence of such persons in the building and are  holding talks to enforce commonly accepted principles.    As part of such contacts, the Belgian Embassy handed to  Cuban  authorities an official list of the residence's occupants, 121  men, women, and children.    The Cuban Government recognizes the inviolability of the  Belgian facilities and will abstain from taking any measure that  could affect it although the occupants entered through violence,  Alfonso pointed out.    They also agreed on the impossibility of accepting the use  of  force to avoid established regular procedures to leave the  country, a position that Cuba has already reaffirmed.    The Foreign Ministry offered medical services to the  Belgians, even to the occupants, as well as food, which is  already being supplied with the help of other European embassies.    Alfonso noted that reprisals would not be taken against  those  who leave the residency nor would any obstacle be placed in  their efforts to depart Cuba through the normal procedures.  Nevertheless, if any of them have cases pending in Cuban  courts, this would be taken into account.    When referring to other illegalities detected, he pointed  out  the distribution of political statements to the international  media, after their elaboration inside the building, even though  only authorized personnel can enter and exit the site.    To conclude, Alfonso said that no dramatic developments are  foreseen in the Belgium residency situation in the coming hours.     "

Now, however, he is speaking  about foreign policy questions:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You said that  your first visit will take you to Bonn. Will the second one be  to Brussels? A year ago you were not the first to raise the  question of Hungary's NATO membership.    [Horn] Yes, but now, when referring to Brussels, I was  thinking not of NATO but the European Union [EU]. It is very  important -- and I supported the present government's intentions  on this -- that Hungary's association treaty with the EU should  really be amended. It must be improved, it must be improved in  our favor. The way in which Brussels relates to Hungary and the  other states in the east central Europe region is very important  because I believe that the time for deeds has arrived. So there  should not be just piles and piles of statements by the Twelve  about the region; they should give more than they have been  giving so far to help this region.    [Correspondent] We would like to improve relations with  neighboring countries, but in past years we have seen that on  the other side there is insufficient will to receive these  attempts. How will the new government resolve this?    [Horn] Look, there are surely Funars [prominent Romanian  nationalist mayor of Cluj-Napoca] elsewhere too, not only in  Romania. [passage omitted] However, this must not be our point  of departure. I believe that Hungary has no enemies either  along its border or further away. On the contrary, it has  partners, and if we can strengthen the partnership relationship,  if we can build up their trust in our intentions -- and we have  already said that we would like to bring about a historical  reconciliation with our neighbors and a lot should be done to  this end -- I am sure that they will receive our moves  favorably.

Deputy Head of the Russian Foreign Economic Relations  Department for Multilateral Cooperation Maksim Medvedkov told  Interfax that to adopt the package, approved by all other EU  members on May 16, would make the prospect of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between the Russian Federation and  the European Union being initialled and then signed in June or  July a reality.    The Shokhin-Brittan agreements concerned ways to settle the  two most burning issues in Russian economic relations with the  EU: the conditions for the activity of foreign banks in Russia  and trade regulations for substances used in the nuclear  industry, particularly uranium, which has become a true  stumbling block.    Medvedkov said that France was afraid that Russian uranium  exports would deliver a blow to its own nuclear fuel exports to  EU countries. He said he doubted that France had any other  reason to veto the Shokhin-Brittan deal or the signing of the  partnership and cooperation agreement itself.    He said France was simply making the latest in a series of  attempts to tailor the regulations governing uranium sales to  its own requirements but without providing so much as a hint of  an argument in defense of its position.    ""France's fears are economically groundless and are more  abstract in character,"" Medvedkov commented. Paris was  concerned, for example, that Russia would try to inundate Europe  with its uranium at some future date and alter the existing  market. ""That assumption too is unfounded, since EU restrictions  on the export of fissile substances exist, and there are other  Euroatom rules which are binding for Russia,"" he said.    Russia and France will discuss this complex issue and other  difficulties associated with the signing of the Agreement on  Partnership and Cooperation between Russia and the EU during the  current visit by French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe to Moscow.

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Suarez said the proposal,  which will be analyzed today during a hearing at the U.S.  Senate, reacts to the impact caused by the converse project  defended by a group of representatives led by Charles Rangel.    Rangel spoke out in favor of repealing the so-called  Torricelli Law, as well as lifting the economic and trade  blockade imposed by Washington on the Caribbean island.    Menendez, with his antihistorical proposal, wants to  strengthen a policy in Congress that is clearly receiving  growing rejection. In the United States, this policy has  triggered demonstrations of civil disobedience like that by the  Pastors for Peace, the CEA director noted.    To conclude, Menendez said the proposal deserves the name of  Residual Project of the Cold War [Proyecto Remanente de la  Guerra Fria] as it opposes even the interests of U.S.  businessmen who want to improve relations between both nations.    Meanwhile, Lazaro Barredo, vice president of the  International Relations Commission at the National Assembly of  the People's Government, said Menendez' proposal is an  expression of how, in U.S. power circles, there are those who  shy away from the necessary and civilized negotiating table.    Barredo explained that what the representative of Cuban  origin proposed definitely is no different than the amendment  previously presented by Robert Torricelli, while he agreed with  Suarez that it is in response to Rangel's proposal.    Rangel's proposal had strong repercussions in the political,  economic, and academic sectors as it advocates true and  effective solutions to the Cuban-U.S. conflict, Barredo  indicated.    Barredo, who is also a Cuban reporter, recalled that  Menendez, together with Ileana Ros Leithenen and Lincoln Diaz  Balart, both of whom are also of Cuban origin, became a trio  that far from representing their constituency, have undertaken a  policy aimed at favoring only their personal interests.

Nigeria,  which asserted yesterday that there was an unusual movement of  Cameroonian troops at the border, said it was determined to  defend its territorial integrity. A communique from the  government emphasized that the flexibility of Nigeria's policy  must not be taken as an inability to defend its territorial  integrity. This statement has not left the Cameroonian  authorities indifferent. During a press conference held  yesterday in Addis Ababa following discussions with the OAU body  in charge of preventing conflicts, Cameroonian External  Relations Minister Leopold Ferdinand Oyono said that war can  break out at any time.    This topic was at the center of discussions yesterday in  Paris between Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, Cameroonian minister  of state in charge of communications, and French President  Francois Mitterrand. After the audience, Mr. Kouomegni briefed  Mamadi Youssoufou on his visit to France.    [Begin recording] [Kouomegni] We have delivered to the  French  authorities a message from the Cameroonian head of state. We  discussed with them the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroon.  We also discussed the situation on the ground and efforts being  made on the diplomatic front and together we examined the  prospects.    [Youssoufou] Can you give us an idea about President  Francois  Mitterrand's position on this border conflict between your  country and Nigeria?    [Kouomegni] France's position is simple. France is firmly on  the side of Cameroon to ensure that the border demarcation  between Nigeria and Cameroon is respected. France, we are told,  is strict on ensuring respect for international law throughout  the world.    [Youssoufou] Does this means that you are maintaining your  decision to bring the case before the UN Security Council?    [Kouomegni] The case is not only before the UN Security  Council, but also before the OAU and the International Court of  Justice. We are not dropping any of these proceedings. All the  same, we are open to any other initiatives, either bilateral or  multilateral. The most important thing for Cameroon is that  both of these methods should create the hope for a real  solution. [end recording]     "

Now Thu Hang will bring you our  comment on the purpose of the visit:    This is the first visit to Vietnam by an ASEAN general  secretary, and highlight coordinations between Vietnam and ASEAN  are entering a new stage for cooperation and mutual development.  Vietnam's participation in the Bali Treaty and in the foreign  ministerial conference of ASEAN member countries last year has  created conditions for Vietnam to join in regional political and  economic cooperation. As well as ASEAN countries' investment in  Vietnam is also greatly increasing. [sentence as heard]  Singapore has 49 projects in Vietnam with a total capital of  more than U.S.$366 million; Thailand, with 43 projects worth  nearly U.S.$150 million; Indonesia, 13 projects with the total  capital of U.S.$175 million; Malaysia, 20 projects worth  U.S.$163 million; the Philippines, nine projects with the total  capital of U.S.$47 million; and Brunei which has invested about  U.S.$1.5 million. In comparison with the three previous years,  the investment from these countries increased 10 times. Over 40  agreements on economic and trading cooperations, payments,  credits, aviation, and navigation have been signed between  Vietnam and members of the ASEAN. In addition, dozens of joint  ventures between Vietnam and ASEAN countries are underway in  Vietnam.    Political relations between Vietnam and ASEAN member  countries have also improved. Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet has visited all six of the ASEAN member countries.  Recently, Vietnamese party leader Do Muoi visited Singapore and  Thailand, and state and government leaders of six ASEAN  countries also came to Vietnam. Singaporean Prime Minister Goh  Chok Tong pledged to do his utmost to help Vietnam in the  latter's process of economic renovation. Thai Prime Minister  Chuan Likphai stressed that Vietnam's quick development will  help to promote development throughout the region.

If, for any reason, the  influence of the United States abated, the entire Europe would  be, according to them, in a security vacuum, and only the  Western European Union led by Germany could assume the  initiative. Diplomats and military experts believe, however,  that this organization is not a sufficient counter force to the  military power of Russia.    Moreover, the German concept of European security might lead  to the transformation of the region of Central and Eastern  Europe to the sphere of economic, cultural, and eventually also  political influence of the FRG.    Nevertheless, the experts, who prepared the documentation  for  the government analysis of the security situation, expect that  the security of Europe will continue to be guaranteed, above  all, by the North Atlantic Alliance. The security system in  Europe will be, according to them, with the highest probability  connected with the U.S. concept of the European and world  security.    The analysis allows for only a marginal probability that the  world could again become bipolar. This could occur only if the  democratic development in Russia slowed down or turned around  and, at the same time, NATO could not be transformed. ""The  security of Central European countries would thus become for the  North Atlantic Alliance, from the point of its own security  interest, irrelevant,"" the experts claim. The possibility that  the development in Europe could be significantly affected by the  power aspirations of Russia is, according to them, not likely.    Another of the not very likely alternatives mentioned in the  analysis could occur if the great powers -- the United States,  Germany, Great Britain, and Russia -- agreed on a system of  balance of power and interests on the European continent. Under  these circumstances, the small countries would be eliminated  from the decision-making process, and their future would depend  on the situation worldwide.     "

Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that as prison officers hold the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract is outside employment law. If the court endorses this view the union will be prevented from taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management. A ballot of the union's members approved action short of an all-out strike over the government's market testing programme, which will extend private management. The union is also protesting over the transfer of work to support staff, as well as prison violence and overcrowding. Industrial action started last week. There has been little disruption of the service so far but the union plans to refuse to accept most new admissions to prisons on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000 prisoners having to be held in police cells as an emergency measure. Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, said the action could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice system and law and order'. The home secretary will seek the injunction this afternoon unless the union executive calls off the proposed disruption by midday. This appears unlikely, however. Mr Lewis said prison officers shared some rights of detention with police officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice, this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by the act, and the union did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment, Mr Lewis said. The union's leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr John Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Fear of redundancy appears to have increased sharply over the past few weeks, despite five successive monthly falls in unemployment and government claims that economic recovery is under way. In May, 43 per cent of those questioned by MORI said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned' about the possibility of being made redundant or becoming unemployed over the next 12 months. By July this had risen to 51 per cent. Those most anxious are males (55 per cent), full-time workers (53 per cent) and those living in the south (53 per cent). By social group, skilled manual workers feel the least secure, with 58 per cent worried about their future. Evidence of the public's deepening gloom about jobs is in sharp contrast to official pronouncement about a recovery. According to government figures published in mid-July, the number of people without jobs and claiming benefit fell by a seasonally-adjusted 7,600 in June to 2.91m. The unemployment figure was the lowest for eight months and coincided with the news that job vacancies notified to Jobcentres had climbed to their highest level for 2 1/2 years. The figures also showed overtime in May at its highest for nearly 12 months. The MORI survey, which has been tracking concern about unemployment since April, was commissioned by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions research group. Mr David Martin, the group's editorial director, said: 'Business confidence is the key to Britain's sustained economic recovery. The latest IRS/MORI index shows that there is a significant and growing proportion of the workforce that does not have confidence in the future.' MORI interviewed 855 people aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work, in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on July 22-26. Data were weighted to match the profile of the population. Details, Page 7 Strategy on jobs, Page 7 Consensus call, Page 14   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT922-745 ,"FT922-745 _AN-CFZBBABFFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / Anglo signs break through labour code      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation, South Africa's largest company, has signed a ground-breaking labour relations agreement with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM). The code of conduct accord is one of the most significant developments in South African labour relations since the legalisation of black trade unions in 1979. The code, the first of its kind in the industry, is aimed at eliminating violence in the mines and the violation of a wide range of labour and civil rights. It applies to all the gold and coal mines managed by Anglo. At a signing ceremony this week, Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general secretary of the NUM, which has more than 300,000 members, said the agreements were of 'major historical significance'. The code, and the accompanying agreement on dismissal and disputes procedures, arose out of the bitter 1987 miners' strike and took four years to negotiate. Relations at the mines between unions and management, and between workers themselves, have often been fraught and violent. In November last year, 86 people died at Anglo's President Steyn gold mine near Welkom in clashes during a national stayaway to protest against VAT. The code seeks to balance the rights and responsibilities of managers, union leaders and union members in a way which acknowledges fundamental liberties and avoids violence and intimidation. Important labour rights are recognised, such as the right to freedom of association, peaceful picketing and full disclosure of relevant information and there is a commitment to job and skills development to correct past imbalances. Sensitive matters such as wearing political insignia and singing and dancing at mass meetings are also dealt with. These rights are balanced by limitations which essentially protect the right of management to manage, and individual workers to dissent from union activities without fear of violence. Mr Bobby Godsell, the industrial relations director at Anglo, said that at a time when national political negotiations were deadlocked it was instructive that two parties deeply divided, with a history of violent conflict and vastly different ideological beliefs, had negotiated such an important agreement.

[Papandreou] Look, this is our national position. These are  two countries that must surely join the EU. We want to settle  the issue of beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession,  something that will certainly be raised in Corfu.    [Correspondent] What are the prospects and the climate?    [Papandreou] The climate is not very positive, because  accession is linked to the solution of the political problem in  Cyprus -- that is, to speak bluntly, with the occupation of  northern Cyprus by Turkish troops. This is presented as an  obstacle to Cyprus' accession. Turkey is utilizing it, and even  threatening that if something like this happens then northern  Cyprus will merge with Turkey.    [Correspondent] Would you comment on UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali's report on the Cyprus issue? What are the  current prospects for our national issue?    [Papandreou] I can honestly say that this is the first time  I  have been happy with a statement by the UN secretary general. He  actually lays the blame where it belongs, on Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas and Turkey. It is the first time that  something like this has been stated so clearly. This means we  are at a turning point. Right now we are in a deadlock, and we  must wait to see what the next step will be.    [Correspondent] It appears that there is a second report by  the UN secretary general on the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. Is the Greek Government  officially aware of it?    [Papandreou] I know about the basic points of Butrus-Ghali's  report. I have not seen the text. What is important is that  the tripartite dialogue continue, in the sense that there are  two bilateral talks -- with international mediator Cyrus Vance  and U.S. presidential envoy Matthew Nimetz -- not direct talks  with Skopje. I hope and pray that we will have some sort of a  solution before long.    [Correspondent] Nimetz is expected in Athens next week, amid  rumors about a double or triple name.    [Papandreou] Various scenarios.    [Correspondent] Right. Do you believe that the road to a  permanent settlement of this national issue will be open after  the European Parliament elections, or will we have to wait for  the Skopjean elections in November?    [Papandreou] I have hopes that the issue will be concluded.  About the scenario where there would be two names, I want to  remind you that we have two basic positions: First, that we  will not recognize any state if it includes the term Macedonia  or any of its derivatives in its name; second, that we will lift  the embargo the minute Skopje removes the star of Veryina from  its flag and changes the articles of its Constitution that  affect our country's territorial integrity. These are our two  conditions and we will not deviate from them.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, Hellenism feels that it  is being attacked from everywhere. There are sources of tension  and provocations from Albania, Skopje, and Turkey. Do you  believe that these are isolated incidents unlinked to one  another? What is your evaluation?    [Papandreou] I cannot speak about an organized plan by these  three. I cannot say that Turkey, Albania, and Skopje  systematically cause problems for our country according to a  plan. They do create problems though; and they have a climate  of cooperation and mutual understanding, and there is a  possibility that something like this will happen. What is  happening in Albania may be explained better within the  framework of Ankara's policy. I do not rule it out. I must say  that before the wall of the Cold War fell, we did not have such  problems. We are one of the few European countries that the  fall of that wall treated unjustly. We are the only ones who  did not benefit.    Our position on Albania is known. We follow an open door  policy. We want peace, but on condition that Greek Albanians  have all the rights that citizens enjoy anywhere else in the  world today: human rights, the freedoms of religion, education,  language, and culture. Albanian President Sali Berisha is  clearly provoking Greece, a power that is much stronger than  Albania. We have said that we are observing the situation. We  have both diplomatic and political means that could make any  decision of ours be felt heavily in Albania. Let us hope that  things will cool off. It appears that for the time being they  are.    [Correspondent] There is a climate of fabricated tension,  particularly on Turkey's part. For example, Turkey is accusing  us of training Kurdish guerrillas. There is some information  that the United States is pressing for the Greek-Turkish  dialogue to resume. What should our country's position toward  Ankara be?    [Papandreou] First of all, I must stress that a big issue  for  Greece is relations with Turkey. Skopje is also important, but  it is another type of issue. Skopje does not threaten us  militarily. The same is true for Albania. Turkey is a great  military power, so we must be careful.    What does starting a dialogue with Turkey mean? If this  dialogue focuses on cooperation on some points--positive  actions--then we must examine it. There are possibilities.  However, when Turkey speaks about a dialogue, it means a  dialogue that would resolve the so-called Greek-Turkish  differences, in the Aegean for example. Let us not speak about  Cyprus, which is a tremendous issue. What the Turks refer to as  differences that must be resolved through a dialogue are things  against our national sovereignty. So, when someone says that we  must talk, I tell him to write down the issues. If the issues  concern Turkish ambitions, why should I sit down and discuss  them? If someone comes and tells you that your property is his,  would you sit down to discuss with him whether it is his or how  much of it is his? This is the Aegean problem. [passage omitted]     "

Some personages within  Britain's industrial, commercial, and political circles have  even publicly demanded that the ""Hong Kong governor be replaced""  and maintain that only by doing so will Britain's and Hong  Kong's long-term interests be safeguarded.    On 7 February, given deteriorating Anglo-Chinese relations,  the ""Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48"" announced its decision to  cancel a scheduled visit to China by a heavyweight British trade  delegation led by British Trade and Industry Secretary Michael  Heseltine this coming fall in a bid to avoid embarrassment. It  was reported that the ""Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48"" had  originally decided to send a total of 24 economic and trade  delegations to China this year with the aforementioned  high-level delegation comprising the chief executives of some  100 major British firms being the most important. The delegation  was originally scheduled to visit China in late September of  this year to promote the sale of UK-made technology and  equipment to China and was scheduled to visit Beijing, Shanghai,  the Three Gorges of the Chang Jiang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Guangzhou,  and Shenzhen, as well as some other places in China. As Hong  Kong Governor Chris Patten has submitted the first part and  plans to submit the second and last part of his political reform  package to the Legislative Council in early March [as received]  and have them ratified for official enforcement this coming  July, the Chinese side is expected to react strongly to the  governor's decision. Thus, it would be inappropriate for  British business leaders to visit China under such an  ""atmosphere.""    Not long before, Bailiren [4101 4409 0088], president of the  ""Anglo-Chinese Trade Group 48,"" had publicly accused John  Major's government of ignoring the views and jeopardizing the  interests of the UK business community, saying that the way in  which the government had handled the Hong Kong question had  undermined Anglo- Chinese trade relations, that the government  had failed to see the adverse effects of Chris Patten's  political reform package, and that it is not worthwhile for the  government to risk everything on Chris Patten's political reform  package. He also made it clear that the UK business community  would not give its support to Chris Patten, stating: ""We want  to see him removed from office; the sooner, the better.""    In the meantime, many of Britain's industrial associations  and chambers of commerce have also started demanding that John  Major's government take measures to remove the obstacles  hampering Anglo- Chinese relations and to explore ways to enter  the China market. At an annual meeting of the Birmingham  Chamber of Commerce held on 28 January, 1994, Mr. Carter,  chairman of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, told British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, one of his distinguished guests  at the occasion, that diplomats should make redoubled efforts to  promote foreign trade and support businessmen in expanding  exports to China. As the British Government's position on the  question of Hong Kong has already undermined Anglo-Chinese  relations, he added, some of the Anglo-Chinese economic  cooperation projects previously agreed upon by the two sides  were now in danger of being frozen or scrapped. Moreover, he  said, the UK business community will inevitably lose business  opportunities in China. Mr. Carter stressed that China is now  the biggest market in the world. [sentence as received] It  would be terribly wrong for Britain to shoot itself in the foot  and undercut its own competitiveness at this moment. Therefore,  he noted, the British Government should reexamine its policies.    At a large exhibition, entitled ""Hong Kong's Achievements,""  which was held two months ago, John Major was asked by more than  300 influential businessmen from all over the world how he  would, in his capacity as prime minister, try to protect the  interests of the British business community in Hong Kong and  China, as well as in Asia as a whole.    What merits attention is that China has repeatedly expressed  welcome to British businessmen and has invited them to invest in  and discuss trade. In fact, the total volume of Sino-British  trade reached $3.59 billion in 1993, up 86 percent over the  previous year, only slightly lower than the increases registered  in Sino-German trade and in the volume of trade between China  and some West European countries. Nonetheless, since Britain  has adopted an unfriendly and noncooperative attitude toward  China on the question of Hong Kong, Sino-British economic and  trade relations are bound to be adversely affected in the long  run. Beijing officials have already stated that the Chinese  side is unwilling to see this and should not be held responsible  for such a scenario.    UK officials and the business community concede that China  has thus far shown no signs of discriminating against the UK  business community. However, any country or region will try to  select firms from a friendly country as its business partners so  long as it can offer prices which are not higher and possesses  technology which is not inferior to those offered by firms from  other countries in the bidding process. Some UK newspapers,  including ""THE OBSERVER,"" ""THE DAILY TELEGRAPH,"" and ""THE SUN,""  have published commentaries, saying that Britain has  underestimated the indignation of China's local governments on  the question of Hong Kong, and the majority of China's imports,  worth about $700 billion in all, will be purchased by local  governments over the next seven years. Should Britain try to  encroach upon Chinese sovereignty and violate agreements reached  with China in the past on the question of Hong Kong, they asked,  how could Britain expect the Chinese to be friendly to it? They  argued that as Germany has entered the China market and France  has stopped arms sales to Taiwan in an attempt to restore  friendly relations with China and increase exports to China,  there is no reason for Britain not to do the same.

One piece of evidence of  this is the signing in Baku the other day by Latvian Vice  Premier Ojars Kehris and Azerbaijan Vice Premier Samed Sadykhov  of an agreement on trade and economic relations between the two  countries. In addition, Mr. Kehris signed with Azerbaijan  Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov a protocol on the establishment  of diplomatic links.    The Latvian vice premier announced after the ceremony that  under the agreement on economic and trade cooperation,  Azerbaijan would deliver to Latvia mainly fuel and petroleum  products, and would receive vehicles, in particular locomotives,  rail cars, and instruments.    In the meantime, Azerbaijan's leadership has begun  behind-the-scenes discussions about a coming reshuffle. It is  not ruled out that Lala Gadzhiyeva, Azerbaijan's secretary of  state, will be appointed the republic's ambassador to the United  Nations in the near future.    Lala Gadzhiyeva, doctor of medicine, took the office of  secretary of state last summer after Geydar Aliyev came to  power. Before that she lived and worked in Moscow, engaged in  political activities, and was one of the authors of the scenario  of Geydar Aliyev's return to power. She is still regarded as  the current Azerbaijan president's right-hand person. The  reason for such an influential figure quitting the political  center stage were Lala Gadzhiyeva's bad relations with Prime  Minister Surat Guseynov. Using all his influence, the latter  demanded that Aliyev remove Gadzhiyeva from the office of  secretary of state. Mrs. Gadzhiyeva tendered her resignation on  16 December but the president would not endorse it before he  could find her a suitable position.    The vacated position is contested by Foreign Minister Gasan  Gasanov and Arifa Ragimzade, state counselor for  administrative-territorial administration. Your SEGODNYA  correspondent has learned from a completely trustworthy source  that this position will most probably be filled by Gasan  Gasanov, who was prime minister under Ayaz Mutalibov and who  even at that time did not hide his sympathy for Geydar Aliyev.

The Cuban Chamber of Commerce members studied their 1994  projections at the annual general assembly meeting held at the  Havana Convention Center today.    The members, which include firms from all sectors of the  national economy, are involved in exporting their products and  expanding the island's trade horizon within the framework of  new, commercial laws which allows and promotes the participation  of foreign firms in the country's economic activities.    A report, which was distributed at the general assembly,  noted that the need to provide more information has prompted the  creation and implementation of a business support service, which  gives advice on issues related to business organization,  legislation, and techniques in other countries.    A member of a firm, who requested that his name not be  revealed, told PRENSA LATINA that the commercial activities in  1993 yielded positive financial results. He also emphasized the  growing number of requests to operate joint companies by many  foreign firms from all over the world.    The report highlighted the importance of strengthening ties  with Caribbean countries, keeping in mind the ties established  by Havana with the capital cities of those countries.    In this sense, Milda Picos Rivers, director of the  Cubaexport  firm, stated there are more exchanges between the five eastern  provinces of Cuba with Caribbean countries.    Picos reported that this firm promotes exports to Trinidad  and Tobago, Guadalupe, Martinique, and other neighboring  islands, of, among other products, citrus, fish and seafood,  mineral water, construction material, and salt.    In this framework, there is also noteworthy interest in the  tourist industry in which Santiago de Cuba, the third largest  city in the country, will host at least three important events  next summer: Carifiesta, Expocaribe, and the sixth Cuban Nurses  Congress.    The assembly of associate members was headed by Chamber of  Commerce President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, and was attended  by high-level Cuban foreign commerce and finance officials.     "

Relations between the two countries were soured again last May when Britain decided to extend territorial waters to 200 miles around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, neighbours of the Falklands, and to introduce a fishing licence system there to halt overfishing by third countries. Argentina claims sovereignty over the two islands, as well as the Falklands, where Britain has operated similar restrictions since 1987. Last year Argentina introduced a cut-price licensing system for vessels operating in its waters which has poached many of the Falklands' best customers. Mrs Shephard said yesterday, on the eve of a week-long trade promotion trip to three south American countries, that there had been discussions on the issue of fishing limits at European Community level, with Spain particularly interested in fishing for squid and hake in the South Atlantic. 'We need agreement between the respective authorities to conserve fish for the mutual benefit of all parties,' she said. 'Fish stocks there are fragile and limited.' She will also urge Argentina to lift its ban on imports of British cattle for breeding purposes. Argentina is one of the 17 countries that still ban cattle imports because of the 'mad cow disease' outbreak in the 1980s. Mrs Shephard said the Paris-based Office International des Epizooties, the international animal health organisation, had agreed there was no longer any problem with British cattle exports. Her visit to Argentina, accompanied by a team of British businessmen and agricultural experts, follows separate trips by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, earlier this year. Her first stop today will be Paraguay, where she expects to meet Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy, the first freely elected civilian president. She will then visit Uruguay and lastly Argentina. The objectives of the trip are to promote British food and drink, as well as agricultural expertise and machinery.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation  Wu  Yi and Indian Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherjee put their  signatures on the two documents on behalf of their respective  governments.    Both sides agreed to further develop and diversify bilateral  trade between China and India on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit, according to the protocol which is valid for one  year from today.    The two countries also agreed that they will encourage  direct  trade and promote the exchange of delegations in specific areas  and encourage their respective trade organizations and traders  to explore the possibilities of promoting bilateral trade  through various forms of trade and cooperation.    According to the protocol, China expects to import India's  mineral ores, iron and steel, agricultural products, chemicals,  engineering products and jewels and processed diamonds while  India would import from China silk yarn, agricultural and native  products, light industrial products, metals and minerals,  chemicals and petroleum products, pearls, engineering products,  pharmaceuticals and newsprint.    At the meeting, both sides reviewed the developments in the  fields of economic relations and trade, scientific and  technological cooperation in 1993 and noted that there existed  great potential for mutual cooperation in these fields.    India and China agreed to provide necessary facilities  including expeditious grant of entry visa to businessmen of the  two countries.    It was also agreed that problems arising from bilateral  trade  and economic cooperation should be settled through friendly  consultation.    The two countries agreed in principle to the extension of  the  trade to the other points on the China-India border apart from  Lipulekh and Shipki.    The minutes said that both sides agreed to explore the  possibilities of expanding technology transfer, setting up joint  ventures in various areas and trading in complete plant and  production lines.    The next session of the joint group will be held in Beijing.     "
0,FT911-870 ,"FT911-870 _AN-BEIBNAETFT 910509   FT  09 MAY 91 / BMA to demand suspension of NHS reforms      By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent   DOCTORS' leaders will today ask Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, to suspend progress on the government's National Health Service reforms and examine alternative ways of improving the service. Representatives of the British Medical Association will meet Mr Waldegrave in an atmosphere of political tension over the reforms, which took effect only five weeks ago. Two of the new self-governing hospital trusts formed as part of the changes have already announced up to 1,000 job losses, and the Universities Funding Council has expressed concern that the reforms might damage medical education. The BMA, which lost all contact with the government during its campaign of opposition to the health reforms, will offer to take part in joint talks with the government to explore alternative ways of improving services to patients. In return, it wants Mr Waldegrave to 'urgently review the consequences of the internal market concept' on which the reforms - which separate the funding of health care from its supply - are based. It will also call on the health secretary to stop preparing to introduce further self-governing trust hospitals and GP fund holders next year. Relations between the medical profession and government have improved since Mr Waldegrave became health secretary. Although he has shown willingness to examine the progress of the reforms with the BMA, he is unlikely to respond favourably to demands to suspend their development. Dr Jeremy Lee-Potter, chairman of the BMA council, said the 'current chaos' in the NHS was a direct result of imposing an unworkable administrative system on a service that was already facing financial crisis. 'The government has got it wrong because it did not listen,' he said. North Western regional health authority has appointed British Airways to advise on ways of improving services to patients. The airline will adapt its customer services training courses to help develop similar initiatives in the health sector.  The Financial Times   London Page 8  "

While he would ensure that continuity was maintained in  Slovak foreign policy, the existing problems should be solved  fairly quickly, said Kukan, former Czechoslovak and later Slovak  ambassador to the U.N.    The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik intended to meet  the  conditions set by the Council of Europe (CE) concerning national  minorities, he said. He himself wanted to press for bilingual  road signs in the south of Slovakia where 600,000 Hungarians  live, but said the decision would ultimately be parliament's.  (Slovak-Hungarian road signs were banned by the Meciar  government.)    Kukan also attached great importance to relations with  Austria, adding that the only thing he was ""not very optimistic""  about was the problems concerning Slovak nuclear power stations.  Asked if Austria's attempts to prevent the financing of the  Mochovce nuclear power station by the European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) could worsen relations  between the two countries, Kukan said he thought the  consequences would be ""not at all good.""    Slovakia had not yet managed to persuade the Austrians that  Mochovce would not represent a threat to the environment, he  said. ""We have no choice but to hold further scientific talks,""  he added. With regard to Austrian offers to provide  supplementary electricity instead, the foreign minister said  that he did not have detailed information yet, but nonetheless  ""these things should be seriously looked into one more time.""    Kukan said he knew of no specific date for the integration  of  Slovakia into the European Union (EU), but could imagine it  happening ""within several years."" He said the change of Slovak  Government had shown that Slovakia was a democratic country,  because it had all happened without problems. The Visegrad  countries (Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary)  would enter the EU separately, Visegrad being only ""a very free  union,"" the foreign minister said at the end of the interview.

In an outspoken statement the king said Mr Arafat had one 'last chance' to sign an agreement on Jordan's economic role during transitional Palestinian autonomy in the occupied territories. Otherwise, he said, Jordan would move ahead with its own separate talks with Israel. Displaying frustration at being left out of discussions between the Palestinians and Israelis on limited self-rule, the king complained about Mr Arafat's constant procrastinations during talks with Jordan. 'We cannot go on saying there is co-ordination if there isn't or that there is agreement when there is none,' he said. The king's ultimatum came amid increasing Israeli dissatisfaction over the stalled Cairo autonomy talks and within the PLO itself over Mr Arafat's leadership style. Senior PLO officials met yesterday in Tunis to try to persuade their chairman to widen the decision-making process and come up with a coherent strategy for talks with Israel and Jordan. An economic agreement between Jordan and the PLO which would give Jordan's central bank wide-ranging monetary responsibilities in the occupied territories has been ready for months. But Mr Arafat has held back from endorsing it for fear of relinquishing Palestinian fiscal responsibilities to the Jordanians. Jordan has already signed a memorandum with Israel to allow banks in Jordan to reopen branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And Jordan's central bank governor recently said the reopening of branches would now not depend on the economic pact with the PLO. The king also buried prospects of a Jordanian/Palestinian confederation, arguing that the idea was premature. 'I have requested that my brother (Arafat) drop the expression of confederation from his dictionary and not to discuss it in any form or manner,' he said. The PLO has been at pains to emphasis that the autonomy agreement with Israel will eventually lead to a confederation between Jordan and a Palestinian entity and joint committees had been established to discuss the issue. Relations between the PLO and Jordan have been strained since the August announcement of talks between the PLO and Israel in which Jordan played no part.   Countries:-  JOZ  Jordan, Middle East.

Cuban delegation sources said that Robaina and Al Thani  talked about the current state of bilateral relations and shared  the two governments' interest in finding ways to expand and  develop them in a warm and friendly atmosphere. Robaina  expressed his country's willingness to promote cooperation with  Qatar in areas already identified, such as health, medical  products, tourism, and sports.    Meanwhile, Prince Al Thani reiterated his government's  willingness to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based  on respect for the sovereignty and free choice of social  development systems, regardless of pressures from third  countries. He added that he was aware of the situation in Cuba  and made a pledge to promote the visit of a delegation of  businessmen to Havana in the coming weeks. Al Thani accepted  Robaina's invitation to visit Cuba and learn firsthand about the  Cuban situation.    In addition, Robaina held a working meeting with Public  Health Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Suhaym Al Thani and the health  delegation that visited Cuba recently. Bin-Suhaym conveyed his  willingness to hire health personnel and buy pharmaceutical  products to be registered and sold in Qatar. The Qatari  official conveyed his admiration for the Cuban public health  system, particularly, the results obtained with the concept of  the family doctor (basic attention for the population).    During this second visit to this Arab-Persian Gulf emirate,  Robaina also met with the minister of finance, economy, and  trade, to whom he explained the characteristics of foreign  capital investment in Cuba. The Qatari minister confirmed that  in July, he will submit various proposals to his government  regarding areas in which it is feasible to begin immediate  commercial exchanges.

The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South  Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days  here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with  the EU.    ""We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing  to do business with us,"" committee member Stella Sigcau said.    Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South  Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the  community following its first all-race elections next month.    The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political,  trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections,  to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades.    The South African authorities, including the African  National  Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for  a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the  post-apartheid economy.    But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South  Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring  African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can  be more widely spread.    A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin  said  it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to  join regional groupings.    These include the Southern African Development Community,  originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid  South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP)  group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention.    ""But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will  still be important to stimulate regional development,"" he said.    South African Manpower Minister Leon Wessels, a member of  the  delegation, said: ""There has been a greater convergence of  ideas. We feel ourselves closer to the heartbeat of southern  African.""    South African Ambassador to the EU Neil van Heerden spoke of  an ""emerging consensus"" about EU-South African relations, and  said he was confident that agreement could be reached ""on a fast  track"" after next month's elections.

[Borovickova] It was often emphasized during the breakup of  Czechoslovakia that very close, sui generis very special,  relations will continue to exist between the Czech and Slovak  Republics. This certainly applies in relations between people,  but not at the government level. Can it be said that our  relations are closer in some things--or different--from what  they are with the Czech Republic's other neighbors?    [Zieleniec] I would even say that our relations are very  close and special. I do not believe that this applies only to  people and not to the governments. Not only relations between  the individual ministries, but also between their individual  employees are routine, something that, after all, is not typical  in foreign political relations--for example, in our relations  with Poland and Hungary. I am not even talking about more  distant countries. Almost all communication between governments  is held via the foreign service. This is not the case in our  relations. The intensity of the links between the two countries  in the economic, legal, social insurance, health insurance  spheres, and so forth is unique. In essence, it is possible to  say that we have succeeded in maintaining for the long-term the  things that, following the breakup of the state, were special  and very important for the practical lives of our citizens:  Their status with regard to the citizens of the other state,  employment opportunities, and the possibility of unrestricted  movement. You can cross our common border, although we have  technical problems with it, wherever and whenever you like, even  in a forest. It would be difficult to find something like this  anywhere else in Europe. However, because our relations are so  remarkable and close, there are also problems.    [Borovickova] Is there any coordination of stances on major  international issues between the Czech and Slovak Foreign  Ministries? For example, you have the Sudeten Germans and we  have the Carpathians....    [Zieleniec] The kind of coordination you are talking about  is engendered because we have a common interest in many areas.  Our national interests and the national interests of Slovakia  logically coincide. We lived for a long time in a common state  and we inherited many commitments. Our nations are close to  each other, and they feel an affinity and affection for each  other. All of this is projected into what is called state or  national interests. It is of fundamental interest to the Czech  Republic that Slovakia is democratic and prosperous and that it  has the same foreign policy orientation as the Czech Republic.  That is, an orientation toward Western Europe. This is also  prompted by simple geopolitical reasons. It is good to have  friends for neighbors.    [Borovickova] Do you believe in the existence of spheres of  influence in present-day Europe?    [Zieleniec] Not only do I believe this, but I am convinced  that, as it was for centuries, so will it be in the future.  Europe--Central Europe, in which we live--is the object of the  power-wielding interests of various states and powers. This is  something that we have been very well aware of in the past 45  years. This is something that we know we will have to face in  the future. The issue, however, lies in ensuring that we orient  our state in the long term toward political cooperation with  those countries with whom we have a similar scale of values and  with whom we share the same way of life. This is a matter that,  in this context, is very important; and, for us, this is  indubitably Western Europe.    [Borovickova] In this context, what is your view of Russia?    [Zieleniec] Russia is a large country, a power, even a  superpower. It is a country that has played and will continue  to play a very important role in the history of Europe and the  world. It is important for us that it succeeds in becoming  stabilized and that a parliamentary democracy, a market economy,  and an efficient economy is asserted there; this is also a  prerequisite for political stability in this huge country.  Incidentally, this is not only what we want; it is also what  the Russian democrats want.    [Borovickova] What is your assessment of Czech-Austrian  relations in view of the completion of ""undesirable"" Temelin?    [Zieleniec] This is a time-sensitive issue. Discussions are  under way on more finance for it. This is also an issue of some  significance on the Austrian domestic political scene.  Elections are coming up. I do not think this issue can have a  long-term influence on Czech-Austrian relations, which are very  good. We have historical ties to Austria, there are ties  between our people, and I believe that not only Austrian  politicians, but also Austrian citizens are aware of this.    [Borovickova] Do you know how many of the staff in your  ministry are Slovak nationals?    [Zieleniec] We place no emphasis on nationality. We have an  unequivocal criterion--citizenship. Naturally, it is a  condition that we employ only Czech citizens in our diplomatic  services.    [Borovickova] So, Slovak nationality plays no role even in  the decisionmaking on appointments to senior posts?    [Zieleniec] Take a look around the ministry and you will see  that we pay no attention to this.    [Borovickova] Since we are talking about nationality, you  are of Polish origin, your deputy, Mr. Bratinka, is of Slovak  origin, and it is rumored that Mr. Vondra is of Hungarian origin  and was called Csapo. Is this true?    [Zieleniec] I do not know. I acknowledge my Polish origin.  Whether Mr. Bratinka derives his origin from the fact that he  was born in Slovakia, I do not know. As far as Mr. Vondra is  concerned, I simply do not know. You see, we do not bother  about this....    [Borovickova] How do you feel as foreign minister in a  state where, apart from yourself, foreign policy is also  ""formulated"" by the Office of the President of the Republic, the  chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, the prime  minister, and recently also the defense minister, while not all  of them always agree with one other? Do you manage to sleep  peacefully?    [Zieleniec] I have been sleeping peacefully since childhood.  If you look at our Constitution, you will see that there are  many constitutional officials in the Czech Republic who have  authority in foreign policy. We are not an exception, however.  It is the same elsewhere. The authority is different, but it  exists. Therefore, foreign policy is the result of cooperation  among these officials. The problem is in coordinating these  issues, in preventing aberrations. This is my job; at least,  this is what I am trying to do. It does not always succeed, but  I think some progress is being made here. We meet regularly  with those constitutional officials you mentioned, and we  discuss key foreign policy issues. If you look at Germany,  Austria, or the United States, there are also more  constitutional officials active in foreign policy there. Their  opinions are not unanimous. Each one emphasizes a slightly  different point of view, depending on his constitutional  function. If there were only one opinion, it would be like it  was under communism. People now have the opportunity to look a  little deeper into the process of the evolution of political  opinion. By the way, even in Slovakia this opinion is not  unanimous.    [Borovickova] There is currently a great deal of discussion  about the Walderode case. Mr. Bratinka recommended to the  Interior Ministry some time ago the names of several individuals  who are ""worthy of special consideration"" from the point of view  of speeding up the process of granting them Czech citizenship.  Was this preceded by discussions at your ministry. or was this  his own initiative?    [Zieleniec] First of all, Mr. Bratinka did not recommend Mr.  Walderode to anyone. He did write a letter to the Interior  Ministry containing several names, but Walderode was not one of  them. When he wrote this letter, Mr. Bratinka was entrusted  with running the section whose authority also included  expressing an opinion on domestic political issues from the  foreign policy point of view. It is necessary to view his  recommendation within the framework of the normal procedure  between individual state administration bodies in the Czech  Republic. The Agriculture Ministry expresses an opinion from  its point of view, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs from  the point of view of its jurisdiction, and the Foreign Ministry  from its point of view. The final decision fell to the Interior  Ministry, and it made it. I think that the whole case has been  blown out of proportion, especially the attestation that Deputy  Bratinka provided.    [Borovickova] These ""aristocratic"" cases are juxtaposed in  the Czech media with the Volhynian Czechs. What is your opinion?    [Zieleniec] I do not view this as an extraordinary course of  action. I think we have to view this as a normal civil  procedure, regardless of whether someone has a name that was  once aristocratic. According to the law in our country, the use  of aristocratic titles is prohibited, and everyone is equal  before the law, whether he is the descendant of a famous  aristocratic family or a Volhynian Czech. The problem is  something else. It is associated especially with property  restitution, and this concerns the former group of people. The  issue of the Volhynian Czechs involves mass citizenship, and I,  as a citizen, am of the opinion that, because we are a civic  state, these issues should be resolved individually. It is  necessary to view each applicant as a potential citizen of this  state.    [Borovickova] How did Moscow crop up in your curriculum  vitae?    [Zieleniec] I was born there because, at that time, my  parents were working in Moscow. I was there for three months.    [Borovickova] You are going to Bratislava on Friday [11  March]. What will you do there inasmuch as you do not have a  counterpart?    [Zieleniec] I am going privately at the invitation of the  Slovak Foreign Policy Association.    [Borovickova] Can you tell us anything more about this?    [Zieleniec] I will deliver a lecture on the Czech Republic's  foreign policy. This is not an official visit. I do not have  any extraordinary meetings planned.     "

WORKER REWARDS DIFFER;    INSURANCE, OTHER EXTRAS -- BUT LESS FLEXIBILITY -- COME WITH LARGER COMPANIES      By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer      Here's the scenario: You're looking for a job at a retail firm, and you have  two offers, one from a small, mom-and-pop clothing store and another from a  major chain. Which job do you take?    If you want to work for higher wages, have medical coverage and a pension plan  for your old age, your best bet might be to think big, as in Big Business. But  if friendliness, flexibility and potential opportunity are high on your  priority scale, less can indeed be more in Orange County's burgeoning  small-business sector.    But beware: While some at large corporations fret about perks like fitness  programs, workers at small businesses often go without basic medical coverage.  And outright worker abuse -- ranging from non-payment of wages to forced  overtime -- is more prevalent at small companies.    It's not that small-business owners necessarily take management training from  Simon Legree. The major problem is profitability, a state of being that many  small businesses find elusive.    ""Regardless of the employee benefits you're talking about, you have to be a  profitable company to offer them,"" said Frank Swain, chief counsel for advocacy  at the U.S. Small Business Administration. ""Small firms and new firms don't  have adequate revenues and profits to offer employee benefits.""    Little wonder. The Orange County Business Development Center says that 72% of  all new business starts will fail within their first three years. Nationally,  88% of small-businesses start-ups fail to celebrate their third birthday,  according to the Department of Commerce.    But it's not all sack cloth and ashes in the land of the entrepreneur. Small  companies often offset low wages and limited benefits with increased  flexibility in such things as work schedules. And federal studies show that the  women and men hired by small businesses are getting breaks that are next to  non-existent in larger firms.    ""By employing workers with little or no prior work experience, small firms  improve the sustained employment prospects of these workers,"" says the 1987  ""State of Small Business: A Report of the President.""    But in more tangible areas such as health insurance, paid vacations, retirement  programs and sick leave, small businesses are outclassed by their bigger  counterparts. Consider the results of a nationwide study by the  Washington-based Employee Benefits Research Institute:    * Retirement programs are offered by 91% of companies with 100 or more workers,  compared to only 43% of firms with fewer than 100 employees.    * A full 99% of the larger firms give paid vacations, while only 81% of the  smaller companies pay for such breaks.    * Paid sick leave is a reality in 67% of large companies, but only 46% of  smaller ones.    What does this mean for Orange County? Of the areas's approximately 80,000  businesses, 96% have 50 or fewer workers. So benefits taken for granted by  employees of, say, Rockwell International or Fluor Corp., are simply not an  option for many county workers.    And the smaller the business, the fewer benefits its workers tend to receive.    Among participants in The Times Small Business Poll, 44% of firms with five or  fewer workers offer no health insurance. In contrast, only 6% of firms with 26  to 50 workers have no health care coverage.    After paid vacations, health insurance is the benefit most demanded by workers,  according to the SBA's Swain. And it's the one that presents perhaps the  biggest dilemma for small business owners.    ""Small employers feel like they want to offer health insurance,"" Swain said.  ""Employees are increasingly demanding health insurance. But it's the benefit  that's going up in cost the most.""    The eight full-time workers at Camelot Research Corp. in Anaheim are enjoying  health insurance for the first time in the company's 5-year history. It took  until 1989 for the company, which sells computerized foreclosure listings, to  make enough money to cover the $1,000 monthly premium payments.    ""We started off not offering benefits at all in the beginning,"" Camelot owner  Ronald M. Frumkin said. ""Within the first 6 months, we started offering paid  holidays. Then we also gave them a week's vacation. This is the first year  we've offered health insurance.""    The altruistic side of Frumkin wanted to offer insurance as a way to ""share the  wealth"" of his now-prosperous company. The pragmatic side realized that  insurance is an important hiring and retention tool, even though he will pay  dearly for it. The SBA estimates that employer health insurance costs are  rising about 30% each year.    ""Getting employees is not the problem,"" Swain said. ""It's finding the good  ones, people who care about the quality of the job. . . . When I do find them,  I do anything I can to keep them.""    Part-time labor is another issue that tends to separate small-business  employment from work at larger firms. Part-time workers are generally paid less  and denied benefits. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, nearly 20% of  the labor pool works fewer than 20 hours, according to the SBA. At companies  with 100 or more workers, only 8% are employed part time.    And then there's the paycheck. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, 40% of  the work force earns less than $5 per hour, the SBA said, while only 19% makes  $10 or more. At larger firms, about 20% of the workers make less than $5 per  hour, while nearly 40% earn $10 or more.    While big corporations have been criticized for workplace problems like the  so-called glass ceiling -- an invisible barrier to promotion of women and  minorities -- smaller companies are fraught with more fundamental worker  abuses.    In the 12 months ended July 31, workers filed 153 complaints with the Orange  County Human Relations Commission, which tracks such problems as unpaid wages,  forced and unpaid overtime, poor working conditions and failure to provide  mandated workers compensation and unemployment insurance.    That number is triple the estimated 50 cases filed in 1985, the first year of  the commission's concerted effort to reach local workers, educate them about  their rights and intercede on their behalf.    What kind of businesses treat their workers so badly? It's impossible to  generalize, said Barbara Considine, the Human Relations Commission's employment  specialist. But the workers who have come to her have all been employed by  small, marginal companies.    ""I never see someone come in here accusing Xerox or the Irvine Co.,"" Considine  said. ""I tend to get people who work for very small companies, businesses that  are struggling themselves. . . . But that's no excuse. If you can't pay your  workers, you shouldn't be in business.""    Last October, Martin Alanis and his cousin, Jose A. Escobedo, were promised $5  an hour for remodeling and repairing homes as members of a four-man work team  hired by a construction company. For four weeks, they worked primarily in Santa  Ana repairing two homes, said Alanis, 18, who supports a wife and 4-month-old  son in Mexico City.    ""He did pay us, but only once when he wrote a check to Jose,"" Alanis said. ""But  when Jose took it to the bank they later told him there were no funds to pay  for it on the account it was written on.""    Alanis said the owner of the construction company owes him about $500 and owes  Escobedo at least $700. In December, Alanis and Escobedo complained to the  Human Relations Commission, and Considine contacted the owner.    ""I talked to the employer, who admitted hiring them,"" she said. ""He told me he  was doing them a favor by teaching them a trade. He said, 'I'll pay them when I  get the money, but I just don't have it.' ""    The telephones at the construction company have been disconnected, and the  owner could not be reached for comment. Considine said she referred Alanis and  Escobedo to the State Labor Commission to file a complaint.    But not all small companies are borderline bankruptcies, and many make a great  effort to do what they can for their workers.    Tim Millsaps is vice president of national sales for Kanvas by Katin and will  soon be co-owner. Millsaps admits that ""being a small business makes it  difficult to offer good benefits.""    In an effort to ensure health insurance for the surf-wear company's seven  workers, Kanvas by Katin joined an employee leasing firm, which pays the  workers and covers their insurance needs for a fee, which is lower than Kanvas  would have to pay for insurance alone.    In addition, several of the firm's seamstresses work at home, and the company  offers unpaid leave to allow for childbirth and continuing education.    ""They get exactly the same job they had before when they come back,"" Millsaps  said. ""We have a guy right now who took a year's leave of absence for school.  He'll come back no worse off -- and possibly better, depending on how he does  at school.""    And then there's Kanvas by Katin's special brand of flex time.

WORKER REWARDS DIFFER;    INSURANCE, OTHER EXTRAS -- BUT LESS FLEXIBILITY -- COME WITH LARGER COMPANIES      By MARIA L. La GANGA, Times Staff Writer      Here's the scenario: You're looking for a job at a retail firm, and you have  two offers, one from a small, mom-and-pop clothing store and another from a  major chain. Which job do you take?    If you want to work for higher wages, have medical coverage and a pension plan  for your old age, your best bet might be to think big, as in Big Business. But  if friendliness, flexibility and potential opportunity are high on your  priority scale, less can indeed be more in Orange County's burgeoning  small-business sector.    But beware: While some at large corporations fret about perks like fitness  programs, workers at small businesses often go without basic medical coverage.  And outright worker abuse -- ranging from non-payment of wages to forced  overtime -- is more prevalent at small companies.    It's not that small-business owners necessarily take management training from  Simon Legree. The major problem is profitability, a state of being that many  small businesses find elusive.    ""Regardless of the employee benefits you're talking about, you have to be a  profitable company to offer them,"" said Frank Swain, chief counsel for advocacy  at the U.S. Small Business Administration. ""Small firms and new firms don't  have adequate revenues and profits to offer employee benefits.""    Little wonder. The Orange County Business Development Center says that 72% of  all new business starts will fail within their first three years. Nationally,  88% of small-businesses start-ups fail to celebrate their third birthday,  according to the Department of Commerce.    But it's not all sack cloth and ashes in the land of the entrepreneur. Small  companies often offset low wages and limited benefits with increased  flexibility in such things as work schedules. And federal studies show that the  women and men hired by small businesses are getting breaks that are next to  non-existent in larger firms.    ""By employing workers with little or no prior work experience, small firms  improve the sustained employment prospects of these workers,"" says the 1987  ""State of Small Business: A Report of the President.""    But in more tangible areas such as health insurance, paid vacations, retirement  programs and sick leave, small businesses are outclassed by their bigger  counterparts. Consider the results of a nationwide study by the  Washington-based Employee Benefits Research Institute:    * Retirement programs are offered by 91% of companies with 100 or more workers,  compared to only 43% of firms with fewer than 100 employees.    * A full 99% of the larger firms give paid vacations, while only 81% of the  smaller companies pay for such breaks.    * Paid sick leave is a reality in 67% of large companies, but only 46% of  smaller ones.    What does this mean for Orange County? Of the areas's approximately 80,000  businesses, 96% have 50 or fewer workers. So benefits taken for granted by  employees of, say, Rockwell International or Fluor Corp., are simply not an  option for many county workers.    And the smaller the business, the fewer benefits its workers tend to receive.    Among participants in The Times Small Business Poll, 44% of firms with five or  fewer workers offer no health insurance. In contrast, only 6% of firms with 26  to 50 workers have no health care coverage.    After paid vacations, health insurance is the benefit most demanded by workers,  according to the SBA's Swain. And it's the one that presents perhaps the  biggest dilemma for small business owners.    ""Small employers feel like they want to offer health insurance,"" Swain said.  ""Employees are increasingly demanding health insurance. But it's the benefit  that's going up in cost the most.""    The eight full-time workers at Camelot Research Corp. in Anaheim are enjoying  health insurance for the first time in the company's 5-year history. It took  until 1989 for the company, which sells computerized foreclosure listings, to  make enough money to cover the $1,000 monthly premium payments.    ""We started off not offering benefits at all in the beginning,"" Camelot owner  Ronald M. Frumkin said. ""Within the first 6 months, we started offering paid  holidays. Then we also gave them a week's vacation. This is the first year  we've offered health insurance.""    The altruistic side of Frumkin wanted to offer insurance as a way to ""share the  wealth"" of his now-prosperous company. The pragmatic side realized that  insurance is an important hiring and retention tool, even though he will pay  dearly for it. The SBA estimates that employer health insurance costs are  rising about 30% each year.    ""Getting employees is not the problem,"" Swain said. ""It's finding the good  ones, people who care about the quality of the job. . . . When I do find them,  I do anything I can to keep them.""    Part-time labor is another issue that tends to separate small-business  employment from work at larger firms. Part-time workers are generally paid less  and denied benefits. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, nearly 20% of  the labor pool works fewer than 20 hours, according to the SBA. At companies  with 100 or more workers, only 8% are employed part time.    And then there's the paycheck. At companies with fewer than 100 workers, 40% of  the work force earns less than $5 per hour, the SBA said, while only 19% makes  $10 or more. At larger firms, about 20% of the workers make less than $5 per  hour, while nearly 40% earn $10 or more.

In the expanded complaint, the NLRB will charge that the company has tried to  sidestep the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents nearly  2,000 Nordstrom workers in the Seattle area, by illegally encouraging employees  to negotiate directly with the company to resolve disputes over back pay.    The union and many individual Nordstrom workers have alleged that managers  coerced employees into not charging the company for many of their work hours.    The new NLRB charge stems from an investigation by the agency that found that  Nordstrom sent employees two memos urging them to talk to company managers  about their claims regarding unpaid off-the-clock work. Under federal labor  law, unionized companies must negotiate wages, hours and working conditions  with their unions.    Previously, the NLRB accused Nordstrom of two other unfair labor practices:  negotiating directly with workers on a new labor agreement and withholding  documents requested by union officials concerning the back-pay dispute.    The NLRB is seeking only to force Nordstrom to halt the alleged practices,  which the company disputes. If a hearing officer rules in the agency's favor,  there would be no financial damages.    In a separate action, however, the Washington Department of Labor and  Industries on Thursday found Nordstrom in violation of the state's minimum-wage  act and ordered it to pay an undetermined amount in back wages. The union has  estimated that the back-pay claims could total more than $30 million in that  state alone.    Bruce Nordstrom, company co-chairman, countered in a prepared statement that  the nature of the ruling made it ""difficult to assess the extent of any  financial obligations."" But he added that the company believes any financial  impact would ""not be material"" and that it is evaluating an appeal.    Nordstrom's stock was off $1.75 on Tuesday, closing at $27.75, but analysts  attributed the fall mainly to the general decline in the market and to an  announcement by the company Thursday that it expected lower earnings.

ROK  President Kim Yong-sam Answers IZVESTIYA Chief Editor Igor  Golembiovskiy's Questions""]    [Excerpt] [Golembiovskiy] Mr. President, you were the  first South Korean politician to come to Moscow. That was five  years ago. You played an important role in establishing  diplomatic relations between Moscow and Seoul, which presaged  the most extensive links between our countries. Why, in your  view, have Russian-Korean relations proved to be so modest?    [Kim] As you have correctly remarked, I was the first South  Korean politician to visit the Soviet Union. Afterward, in  March 1990, I visited the USSR again. At that time there were  no diplomatic relations between our countries, and therefore my  visits were extremely difficult. Official diplomatic relations  between the ROK and the USSR were established six months after  my visit; I think that even my modest efforts played a part in  this.    Relations between our countries have been developing very  dynamically since September 1990 right up until the present  moment. The treaty signed between the ROK and the Russian  Federation during President B. Yeltsin's visit to the ROK in  November 1992 became the systemic basis for the development of  bilateral relations. Relations in the political, economic,  social, cultural, and other spheres are being developed on this  basis. In the political sphere, in addition to top-level  bilateral visits, frequent exchanges have taken place at the  level of foreign ministers and other state figures.    Trade turnover between the two countries last year reached  almost $1.6 billion, almost twice the level of the previous  year. This testifies to a dramatic growth in our economic  relations.    The number of visits by citizens of the two countries has  also grown. Thus last year 18,000 Russians visited the ROK,  almost twice as many as in the previous year. But at the same  time, when I say that our relations do not yet meet our mutual  expectations, I mean that they do not yet fully correspond to  the great potential for cooperation which is worthy of our  countries.    My visit to Russia should serve as a boost to relations  between the new Russia and the new Republic of Korea. We have  accumulated healthy experience. Our cooperation will develop  further on the basis of this experience and our mutual interests.    [Golembiovskiy] Your predecessor, President Roh Tae-Woo,  promised Moscow a loan of $3 billion, of which our country  received only half. Now the question of returning this $1.5  billion has arisen; moreover, the Republic of Korea refuses to  accept anything Moscow offers in payment for this debt -- from  raw materials to arms. The impression arises that Seoul is not  very committed to trade and economic relations with Russia. Is  this so?    [Kim] The loan was frozen because the major part of the debt  had not been paid. Bilateral relations are now under way at a  working level; moreover, all proposals put forward by the  Russian side are discussed. I believe that we will be able to  resolve this problem.    Your words about the ROK's lack of interest in trade and  economic relations with Russia are evidently connected with the  fact that you do not have an exact idea of how our relations are  developing. Once again I will repeat that our cooperation with  Russia in the economic sphere is developing very dynamically.    Russia is a country with great economic potential, the basis  of which is constituted by its fundamental science and advanced  high technology, its rich natural resources, and its high level  of public education. The development of economic relations  between the two countries on the basis of our economies'  complementing one another will proceed more quickly if we manage  to combine with Russia's potential our industrial technology and  our experience of working in the international market.    At the same time, investments and trade depend mainly on how  mutually profitable our direct links with individual countries  become. Hence the two countries' governments must work on  expanding and consolidating the legal and structural base in  order to exclude difficulties and obstacles in the activity of  Korean and Russian entrepreneurs alike.    Many South Korean entrepreneurs are already working in the  Russian market, and I hope that my visit to Russia will help to  create favorable conditions for more energetic activity on their  part.    [Golembiovskiy] The absence of international monitoring of  North Korea's nuclear installations worries the whole world. Do  you not think nevertheless that talk of the possibility of war  and any kind of military preparations only aggravate the  situation? Ultimately there is no precise information regarding  the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea, and it is hard  to imagine its leaders' really wanting a military conflict.    [Kim] At the moment there is no precise evidence that the  DPRK possesses nuclear weapons. However, there are suspicions  that Pyongyang has long time been developing nuclear weapons and  is already using a considerable number of nuclear components for  military purposes. In order to rid the international community  of these doubts it is necessary to ensure total glasnost  regarding North Korea's nuclear installations. The DPRK should  accede to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as quickly as  possible and ensure that full inspections are carried out in its  country.    The ROK Government and the world community are making every  effort to resolve the North Korean nuclear problem peacefully if  possible. However, there is a limit to the world community's  patience. In the event that North Korea does not renounce its  plans and continues to develop nuclear weapons, rigorous  sanctions by the world community will inevitably follow.    [Golembiovskiy] Do South Korean diplomats plan to take part  in the multilateral conference on this subject proposed by the  Russian Foreign Ministry?    [Kim] I would first like to express gratitude to Russia for  cooperating in tackling the North Korean nuclear problem. The  International Atomic Energy Agency, South and North Korea, the  United States, Japan, China, Russia, and other interested  parties are not only holding bilateral consultations but also  making efforts in this area on a multilateral basis via the UN  Security Council. In this connection I think that for the time  being we should continue to follow the efforts made by the world  community. [passage omitted]     "

The Crimean economy has been drawn into the general economic  crisis that has gripped all the former CIS countries, but this  crisis is particularly dramatic in Russia and Ukraine.  Inflation is galloping ahead in Ukraine; it is a particular  feature of the Ukrainian economy, a particular feature of its  leadership because of specific stances taken by the leaders and  senior officials in the Council of Ministers and the bank, the  people who make these kinds of decisions.    Last year, as you know, the Russian ruble depreciated to  one-tenth of its value and the karbovanets to one-hundredth of  its value. When you have this kind of depreciation of the  currency, you get a very rapid drop in the standard of living  for workers in the public sector, first and foremost, and the  pensioners. Social tension increases sharply. The incomes of  Crimean people have diverged from, and not overtaken, those of  their neighbors across the Kerch strait, from Krasnodar Kray.  All of this has given rise to great discontent with Crimea  being part of Ukraine, to calls for Crimea to join the ruble  zone and so on.    Analysis of the situation of Crimea demonstrates, moreover,  that Crimean industry and agriculture were set up first and  foremost to trade with Russia and Crimean industrial  enterprises. Crimea has a lot of top-class enterprises that  received large sums of capital investment even in the stagnation  years and are now lying idle. These enterprises were oriented  towards trading with Russia and obtaining materials from Russia.  As economics minister, I have already had several trips to Kiev  for consultations with the leadership of Ukraine on the reforms  in Crimea. It is clear to us that any steps we might take can  only be done with the good will of Ukraine. Moreover, certain  steps were very well received by Ukraine, not well in the sense  that somebody approved these steps in themselves, but in the  sense that there was a view that these kinds of things needed to  be done in Ukraine -- in particular, currency regulation. The  fixed rate of the karbovanets is a colossal obstacle to getting  Ukraine out of crisis. And now, as far as I know, Ukraine  itself has made a decision to move to a floating exchange rate.    Crimea is a unique region in terms of its natural resources  and its geographic situation, and we certainly need bolder  economic solutions for Crimea, in my view.    [Gavrilov] That means you're saying there could be a free  economic zone set up here, like many that have been set up. I  believe such proposals have, in outline, been made?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, we have come across such projects. You  couldn't really make the whole of Crimea a free economic zone,  because these zones are set up in areas where there are open  spaces away from the inhabitants. Well, Crimea has developed  industry and developed agriculture cooperatives actively with  Ukraine and we are therefore not looking to set up a free  economic zone. We are talking about the possiblity of  implementing economic reforms more rapidly than Ukraine in the  areas of currency regulation, of having a more active program of  attracting foreign capital into Crimea. Many investors say they  would put money into Crimea, but the stability question wipes  out their intentions.    Crimea and Ukraine have a difficult relationship on the  question of allocating central credit resources to Crimea. One  could generalize and say credit allocation in Ukraine is not  quite normal and is reminiscent of Russia at the start of 1992.  All in all, everything in Ukraine reminds me of our Russian  history of two or three years ago. However, in the area of  finance and credit, Russia has made tangible steps forward in  those years and has to some extent succeeded in setting up and  stabilizing a new finance and credit system. I see that in  Russia now there is no great difference between the Central Bank  of Russia bank rate and that of commercial lending rates. In  Ukraine there is this difference.    [Gavrilov] A lot of people are now talking about the Saburov  team, Saburov's Moscow team, and you're a full member of that  team. Can you tell me, please, what this team is? Is it people  who just happen to be there or are they all people of like mind  who knew each other before?    [Chernyavskiy] This idea arose because President Yuriy  Meshkov invited Saburov in effect to be prime minister of  Crimea, and Saburov then decided to invite in several people  from Moscow to be able to implement a certain agreed policy.    [Gavrilov] Do you notice the effect that people say that  Moscow invaders are coming in to get Crimea's economy to pick  up? One hears rejoinders that ""they"" have lived in Moscow with  their offices of economists and academics.    [Chernyavskiy] Professionally, I don't personally believe  anybody is pushing me in Crimea, and it has always been the case  that there have been a lot of people in the natural sciences  coming here. If you're talking about economic centers, economic  institutions, one's own economic school, there is none of that  in Crimea.    [Gavrilov] Tell me, is it going to be hard for you and your  Moscow friends to come here and work?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, of course, it has been quite a drastic  step and, of course, it is very difficult work. Moreover, we  have taken a very big drop in income because officials are  poorly paid in Crimea by Russian standards. For the time being  I still see my mission in Crimea as interesting.    [Gavrilov] You won't run away?    [Chernyavskiy] That's a good question. When we came to  Crimea in February, I and probably all members of the team  started to look at Crimean problems from the standpoint of  Crimea and...

When addressing the  plenum of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Cuban Vice  President Carlos Lage confirmed emigrants are not deprived of  the right to invest in Cuba, although the specifics of that  process are pending definition.    Future facilities for Cuban-born entrepreneurs are part of  the process of normalizing relations with the expatriate Cuban  community, the first part of which involved holding the  aforementioned conference in Havana last weekend. At that time,  the Cuban Government launched a number of measures aimed at  normalizing ties with emigrants, among them eliminating the  requirement that those who leave the country legally wait five  years before returning.    Young emigrants will also be permitted to study at Cuban  universities provided they defray the cost. Travelers will not  be required to pay for a hotel room upon arriving on the island,  and the Foreign Relations Ministry will create a special  department to deal with the affairs of the expatriate Cuban  community.    Possible emigrant investment in Cuba in the near future  complements the aforementioned measures and reveals the  soundness of previous steps taken to reach the decision.  Recently, a meeting between Cuban officials and Cuban-American  owners and businessmen, known in the United States by its  acronym OCA, was held in Havana to explore the possibility of  joint ventures.    A desire has been expressed by both sides, but that desire  is  stumbling upon the obstacles of the U.S. economic blockade,  worsened by the implementation of the so-called Torricelli Law.  The same emigrants, who met recently in this capital in The  Nation and the Emigrants Conference, agreed on the need to lift  the blockade because, in addition to threatening the very  existence of 11 million Cubans, it blocks the normalization of  ties between Cubans on and off the island.    As stated by some of the participants at the Havana  conference, the Cuban economic opening is being blocked by the  stubborn isolationist policy of Washington.     "

The Renamo men have been  gradually handing over their weapons to the officials in the  Unomoz peacekeeping mission.    DOMINGO interviewed Renamo liaison officers in the three  assembly areas in the area of jurisdiction of the Southern  Regional Command, and it found that there is mutual trust  between the Renamo forces and the ""blue helmets"" who have been  deployed at those centers.    Major Aurelio de Freitas and officer Meque Nyumba, of the  Renamo command for Neves assembly area, noted that good  Renamo-UN relations also extend to the civilian component.    To back up their statements, Freitas and Nyumba explained  that, from a comparatively small group of 50 men, the number of  soldiers increased to more than 200 in only a matter of days.    In addition, the health post set up by the peacekeeping  mission has been assisting the people who live in the vicinity  and who are under Renamo's control.    This climate of trust is further enhanced by the fact that,  as the soldiers receive orders from their Maringue headquarters  to move to Neves and present themselves for registration, the  process of disarmament and collection of war materiel is  accompanied by the distribution of the goods to which they are  entitled. In concrete terms, those goods are food and clothing  that is distributed to individuals or to groups of men. [passage  omitted]    Freitas and Nyumba confirmed that each one of the soldiers  under their command had received the quantities of food set by  the World Food Program, WFP. Those foodstuffs included corn,  rice, beans, peas, cooking oil, sugar, and salt.

The new office reports directly to the Ministry of Foreign  Relations and has already started to implement agreements  reached at the recent Cuban emigrant conference, which took  place last month in Havana.    More than 200 Cubans residing in other countries attended  the  meeting, which was convened by the Foreign Ministry. They  discussed ways of securing normal relations with their country  of origin, despite the reasons that led them to live abroad.    Jose Cabanas, a graduate of the Higher Institute of the  Foreign Service of Cuba, was appointed to head the newly created  office, whose creation is also a result of the conference  between the Cuban Government and the participants at the April  conference.    According to sources close to the Foreign Ministry, Cabanas  is adding the final touches to the first decisions of his new  office. The decisions will be announced in the coming days.    Among the decisions, as announced by Foreign Minister  Roberto  Robaina during the recent conference, is the implementation of a  process for children of the emigrants to study certain  specialized careers at several Cuban higher education centers.    Likewise, there are several decisions that will make it  easier for Cuban nationals living abroad to travel to the  island, including the elimination of a provision requiring them  to pay for reservations at local hotels, which is part of the  tourism program that has been in place up until now.    The Foreign Ministry is planning to set up a publication  directed at improving information emigrants receive in the  countries where they live, particularly in the United States.  Conference participants admitted that this information is  distorted.    Work at the Directorate for Affairs of Cubans Residing  Abroad  is directed at implementing these decisions and creating ways to  expand the contacts initiated with the emigrants.     "

This period is also  intended to facilitate the work of the Greek presidency of the  European Union [EU], which began 1 January and ends 30 June.    Although Foreign Minister Javier Solana has diplomatically  denied during several of his parliamentary appearances that the  establishment of relations with Macedonia by six EU countries  (Germany, France, Belgium, Britain, the Netherlands, and  Denmark) represents a major failure of the common foreign and  security policy, it could hardly be interpreted otherwise when  half the EU countries reject what the other six approve in an  especially difficult situation such as that prevailing in the  former Yugoslavia. To this must be added another affront which  the Spanish Government will hardly forget: Chancellor Kohl  publicly lied during the Spanish-German summit in Granada when  -- asked at a news conference whether his country was preparing  to establish diplomatic relations with the Republic of Macedonia  -- he replied that the matter was not on his government's agenda  for the next few months. Ten days later Bonn announced the  exchange of ambassadors with Skopje.    For Spain and the other EU countries which did not support  the French, British, and German initiative, the aim now is to  facilitate the course of the Greek presidency, which looks like  being difficult. ""To send ambassadors to Skopje now will not  resolve the political and security problem threatening that  republic and the Kosovo region. The United Nations undertook a  serious commitment by sending Blue Helmets to Macedonia, and  Spain supports this decision. We must bide our time and hope  that the Macedonians and Greeks will reach a compromise  solution,"" a Spanish diplomatic source told LA VANGUARDIA.    The Spanish Government has been quite sensitive to the  criticisms condemning it for not joining the group of the  European ""heavyweights"" in establishing diplomatic relations  with Macedonia.

According to him,  since 1985 economic aid has declined and will continue to  decline until 1996, when it will disappear completely.  Consequently, the central government has prepared a series of  plans aimed at solving the situation in a firm and specific  manner.    [Begin recording] [Salaverria] Our plans have been made  taking into account the projected aid reduction. The news has  just been publicized, but we knew six to eight months ago that  aid would be reduced. Now, when you referred to an aid package  last year totaling over $200 million, this includes other forms  of aid and not direct aid.    For instance, during the war there were years in which we  received approximately $100 million worth of military aid. Now  we have no military aid, as we no longer need it because the war  is over. This may be the great difference in all this. Later,  military aid was cut to $90 million, $70 million, $40 million,  and so on. It was difficult to keep it at $13 million last  year. And now we are faced with no military aid, because we do  not have a war.    [Unidentified reporter] However [words indistinct]  reconstruction of the country [words indistinct] made calls to  help. Several governments offered assistance [words indistinct]  offers have not materialized. Does the Foreign Ministry [words  indistinct] to bring in this aid?    [Salaverria] Yes.

The struggle for independence in the  colonial republics is a direct continuation of this national  awakening movement. As long as the Union was preserved, it is  clear that basic democratic reform in some of the republics was  not implemented.    Thus, there was a need for a political organization with a  national orientation in Uzbekistan. The Erk Democratic Party  came to the fore to fill this need. From the time the party was  formed it set for itself the goal of national independence and  used its power in this direction. On the foundation of the  earlier national awakening and this movement, basic reform in  society was the path selected by Erk.    Viewed from this point of view, it was natural that the  national aim was not to move toward the literal concept of  ""democracy"" accepted in the West. Forces not completely  understanding the meaning of this began to take aim at Erk from  various directions the day it was founded.    On one hand, representatives of the totalitarian regime  placed obstacles in its way (this is why the party was not  officially registered for a long time), and on the other,  radical communists who had suddenly become ""democrats"" attacked  it.    Perestroyka was brought about through the dismantling of the  empire, and its colonialized people attained national liberation.    Under this historical situation, communists who had turned  into ""democrats,"" including representatives of the Birlik  movement such as Abdurayim Polatov, completely repudiated the  goal of independence; ""we will not separate from Moscow: If we  separate from Moscow, we will be unable to attain democracy,""  they claimed.    However, the healthy part of the Birlik movement was  together  with the Erkists in this struggle. The majority of the members  of this movement joined the ranks of Erk. This became especially  evident during the referendum held to preserve the Union.    Under existing circumstances the forming of democratic  traditions in the concept of a nation and in society became a  regular duty. Thus the Erk party, as a constructive opposition,  opted for the parliamentary way of democratic struggle, in other  words, entering the government through the electoral process. In  the Baltic republics, representatives of the national movement  came into the government by means of elections, also.    On the basis of the plan and struggle of the Erk party, the  passing of the Declaration of Independence at the Supreme  Council of Uzbekistan and the participation of Muhammad Solih,  the founder and chairman of the party, in the presidential  elections was an expression of this goal. These actions  undoubtedly raised the political understanding of the nation.    After the elections the party continued its path of  struggle,  and ERK, its press organ, continued to cast light on events in  the Republic although it was placed under merciless censorship.    Erk did not stop at this. It gave precedence to the people's  interests and its own suggestions, and struggled to introduce  these into the direction of the government.    Forces in favor of strengthening democratic principles in  the  government began to group around Erk and the Forum of Democratic  Forces of Uzbekistan was formed. Birlik also joined this Forum.  Birlik cochairmen and activists Bek Toshmuhamedov, Gulchehra  Nurullayeva, Dadakhon Hasan, and others demonstrated that Erk  was firmly on the road. Not only did the government oppose the  formation and activity of the Forum, but also the Polatovs,  whose goal and struggle was unknown.    Individuals who attach the title of ""democrats"" to  themselves  like Abdurayim Polatov, who was then and is now a communist,  have found no other function than denigrating the Erk party. For  example, it is sometimes forgotten that Polatov, who calls  himself a ""democrat"" and yelled ""Down with communism!"", was  secretary of the Communist Party's primary party organization at  the Cybernetics Institute where he worked.    I was never a communist, but if I had been, I would have  been  ashamed at yelling something like that.    After the Istiklol Yoli [Independence Road] Party was  founded, I expressed my opinion about this on Radio Liberty. In  response, Abdurayim Polatov, in a radio interview, said that he  was glad and the government was also glad that two traitors had  left the Erk party.    Polatov lied when he said in his interview that ""Erk was  founded before the parliamentary elections of 1990."" In the  first place, the 1990 parliamentary elections took place in  February 1990. As for the Erk party, it was founded in April  1990. And Muhammad Solih was not elected to parliament in his  capacity as party chairman, but as a writer and public servant  known to the people.    Polatov has accused Erk of being in the constructive  opposition. Yes, we are a party of constructive opposition now  and in the future. We are different from the ""shadow parties,""  which declare the government's line to be their own line, and  the radical communists, who lack both their own line and  proposals for one. The Erk party has a clear program in every  sector and concrete proposals which it has stated to the  government in every sector. We are fighting to apply this  program to life.    If we come to the allegation of Abdurayim Polatov, the only  reason for this is that he is jealous of the Erk party, because  when Erk was organized in April 1990 he himself was struggling  to organize a party. He named it the Birlik party. But the  majority of Birlikists refused to join it.    The basic democratic forces today are grouped around Erk,  and  the party, under the present serious conditions, is acting in  solidarity with all progressive forces in the Republic. Our  friends, who know themselves to be true Birlikists, are fighting  shoulder to shoulder with us.    Following the last party congress, democratically inclined  religious officials, who had wavered earlier, joined our  struggle. Their activity has been a great help to us since the  Erk party wants our nation to be formed as a nation of high  principle.    There are those who do not recognize this unity movement.  But  there are more who do than do not. They are the Uzbek people.     "

The activity swirling around him suggested otherwise, particularly the sight of  Secret Service types in shirt sleeves and ties peering over fences and checking  out the neighbors. A temporary telephone trunk line had been strung hastily  above the street and a big, red fire truck had rolled up, unannounced, to check  Webster's house for fire hazards.    The President of the United States is to drop in on the 72-year-old,  semi-retired janitor Monday and personally deliver a ""Point of Light"" award for  Webster's work on the Oakwood Beautification Committee.    The group was formed about a year ago at the suggestion of the Los Angeles  Police Department, which was frustrated in its efforts to clean up the  crime-ridden streets in the Oakwood area of Venice. Drug dealing in broad  daylight and shootings between gangs by night had made it one of the city's  more dangerous neighborhoods.    Relations with the police were marked by years of hostility. Some residents  complained of what they perceived as sporadic, heavy-handed sweeps through the  area that had little lasting impact on crime.    Webster, a World War II veteran who bought his Venice home in 1962, is a  founding member of the committee. He said he was first approached by Borden  Olive of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. ""I told him we need  to organize something concerning drug abuse and the way the people are letting  the community run down,"" Webster said.    The son of a farmer who raised corn and cotton, Webster was reared in Waco,  Tex., where he began working at 14, after the eighth grade. ""My philosophy of  life is work,"" Webster said emphatically, leaning forward on a plastic-covered  chair in the living room where George Bush will meet with him and the rest of  the Beautification Committee board. ""I have never been unemployed.""    Webster was a psychiatric aide at a veterans' hospital in Waco, and held a  similar job with the Veterans Administration in Westwood until his back was  injured in a traffic accident in Santa Monica and he was forced to take a  disability retirement. He went on to do janitorial work in commercial buildings  on the Westside, which he still does part time.    The coveralls are part of a solution to his back pain, Webster said. Wearing  pants with a belt hurts, he explained, though he will forgo the uniform and don  his Sunday best to greet the President.    Webster, who sent his two daughters to school out of the neighborhood, said he  tried to be involved in another citizens' group, but found they only wanted to  complain, not improve things. He concedes that some members of his community  resent the success of the Oakwood Beautification Committee, but he was intent  on bringing them in to work for the common good. ""Our goal is to fight drugs  and not to fight people,"" he said.    Asked what he does for fun, Webster repeated what he said he told his wife:  ""Honey, at my age, the fun days is over."" He said he derives pleasure from  church activities and visiting with relatives on holidays.    ""He's not a rah-rah type,"" Police Lt. Jerry Szymanski said. ""He's a quiet  leader (who) doesn't need to stand out from the rest but is always there for  support.""    According to Szymanski, crime is down perhaps 44% since the police's Oakwood  Task Force has been concentrating its resources, including foot patrols, in the  area bounded by Rose Avenue, Electric Avenue, California Avenue and Lincoln  Boulevard. Szymanski, who heads that force, said his officers have become part  of the community and relations have never been better.    Police nominated the Beautification Committee to the White House, which was  looking for a ""Point of Light"" that George Bush could personally deliver.    One component of the committee's plan, which they said Bush will inaugurate, is  the posting of signs with the word DOPE in a circle with a diagonal line  through it. The caption reads: ""Buyers and dealers BEWARE. Your license plate  numbers are being reported to police.""    Committee spokesman Grant Hudson said that when the group got started this  would have been considered a risky statement to make. Though some in the  community have criticized the group for not immediately soliciting help from  veteran community activists, Hudson said the group had to build slowly because  people were afraid of retribution if their names were associated with a  fledgling crime-fighting effort.    As it is, Hudson said, he has been threatened. One woman's car windows were  smashed and shots were fired through another man's window. Now that the  multi-ethnic group is cohesive, everyone is welcome, Hudson said. The group's  coming-out party was a ""Taking Back the Streets"" march last month, attended by  City Atty. James Hahn and Venice Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Both have worked  with the group from the outset.    Longtime community activist Pearl White said she is one who fears that the  group's true agenda is to gentrify the neighborhood for high-income whites and  force poor people out of an area of wildly escalating property values.    Hudson, a renter, said his involvement stemmed from frustration over  neighborhood conditions that nearly prompted him to move ""to get out of this  hell hole. . . . People are getting involved in it because they will not  tolerate the living conditions here.""    Foster Webster is one of those people. He noted that government housing built  for low-income families has been abused by people who live there and who treat  it as a gift instead of their home. ""Some people have chances and don't want  them,"" he said. ""Nobody can keep you from having what you want.""    Webster also insisted that the committee is not trying to push people out, only  to stop drug dealing. One of the things he said he likes best about the  committee's work is the respect he has gained from the drug dealers themselves,  who now politely move on when he asks them to.    And, although a few eggs were hurled at the 300 marchers last month, Webster  said one drug dealer called out to him: ""You all are going to march us off  these streets, aren't you?""    That's the plan.      Photo, Foster Webster spruces up his front yard for President Bush's visit  Monday.

He said he was first approached by Borden  Olive of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. ""I told him we need  to organize something concerning drug abuse and the way the people are letting  the community run down,"" Webster said.    The son of a farmer who raised corn and cotton, Webster was reared in Waco,  Tex., where he began working at 14, after the eighth grade. ""My philosophy of  life is work,"" Webster said emphatically, leaning forward on a plastic-covered  chair in the living room where George Bush will meet with him and the rest of  the Beautification Committee board. ""I have never been unemployed.""    Webster was a psychiatric aide at a veterans' hospital in Waco, and held a  similar job with the Veterans Administration in Westwood until his back was  injured in a traffic accident in Santa Monica and he was forced to take a  disability retirement. He went on to do janitorial work in commercial buildings  on the Westside, which he still does part time.    The coveralls are part of a solution to his back pain, Webster said. Wearing  pants with a belt hurts, he explained, though he will forgo the uniform and don  his Sunday best to greet the President.    Webster, who sent his two daughters to school out of the neighborhood, said he  tried to be involved in another citizens' group, but found they only wanted to  complain, not improve things. He concedes that some members of his community  resent the success of the Oakwood Beautification Committee, but he was intent  on bringing them in to work for the common good. ""Our goal is to fight drugs  and not to fight people,"" he said.    Asked what he does for fun, Webster repeated what he said he told his wife:  ""Honey, at my age, the fun days is over."" He said he derives pleasure from  church activities and visiting with relatives on holidays.    ""He's not a rah-rah type,"" Police Lt. Jerry Szymanski said. ""He's a quiet  leader (who) doesn't need to stand out from the rest but is always there for  support.""    According to Szymanski, crime is down perhaps 44% since the police's Oakwood  Task Force has been concentrating its resources, including foot patrols, in the  area bounded by Rose Avenue, Electric Avenue, California Avenue and Lincoln  Boulevard. Szymanski, who heads that force, said his officers have become part  of the community and relations have never been better.    Police nominated the Beautification Committee to the White House, which was  looking for a ""Point of Light"" that George Bush could personally deliver.    One component of the committee's plan, which they said Bush will inaugurate, is  the posting of signs with the word DOPE in a circle with a diagonal line  through it. The caption reads: ""Buyers and dealers BEWARE. Your license plate  numbers are being reported to police.""    Committee spokesman Grant Hudson said that when the group got started this  would have been considered a risky statement to make. Though some in the  community have criticized the group for not immediately soliciting help from  veteran community activists, Hudson said the group had to build slowly because  people were afraid of retribution if their names were associated with a  fledgling crime-fighting effort.    As it is, Hudson said, he has been threatened. One woman's car windows were  smashed and shots were fired through another man's window. Now that the  multi-ethnic group is cohesive, everyone is welcome, Hudson said. The group's  coming-out party was a ""Taking Back the Streets"" march last month, attended by  City Atty. James Hahn and Venice Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Both have worked  with the group from the outset.    Longtime community activist Pearl White said she is one who fears that the  group's true agenda is to gentrify the neighborhood for high-income whites and  force poor people out of an area of wildly escalating property values.    Hudson, a renter, said his involvement stemmed from frustration over  neighborhood conditions that nearly prompted him to move ""to get out of this  hell hole. . . . People are getting involved in it because they will not  tolerate the living conditions here.""    Foster Webster is one of those people. He noted that government housing built  for low-income families has been abused by people who live there and who treat  it as a gift instead of their home. ""Some people have chances and don't want  them,"" he said. ""Nobody can keep you from having what you want.""    Webster also insisted that the committee is not trying to push people out, only  to stop drug dealing. One of the things he said he likes best about the  committee's work is the respect he has gained from the drug dealers themselves,  who now politely move on when he asks them to.    And, although a few eggs were hurled at the 300 marchers last month, Webster  said one drug dealer called out to him: ""You all are going to march us off  these streets, aren't you?""    That's the plan.      Photo, Foster Webster spruces up his front yard for President Bush's visit  Monday. BRIAN GADBERY / Los Angeles Times      Profile    "
0,FT923-6208 ,"FT923-6208 _AN-CH0BVAAZFT 920826   FT  26 AUG 92 / Cabinet approves Emperor's visit to China      By STEVEN BUTLER      TOKYO   EMPEROR Akihito and Empress Michiko of Japan are to pay an official visit to China in October to mark the 20th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The visit, approved by the Japanese cabinet yesterday morning after months of national debate, promises to be rich in historical as well as contemporary political significance. Relations between China and Japan go back 2,000 years, but this will be the first visit by a Japanese head of state to China. Approval of the visit comes after repeated invitations from the Chinese, and marks something of a diplomatic coup for them, as it will further ease the isolation imposed on them after the suppression of democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989. The visit is fiercely opposed by right-wing nationalists in Japan, who fear China will use the visit for its own political purposes and may try to get the Emperor to apologise for Japan's behaviour during the war or press for war reparations. A Foreign Ministry official, however, said: 'The Emperor is not going to China to apologise.' The visit is to promote friendship and goodwill. Nonetheless, anti-Japanese sentiment among Chinese stemming from the brutality of Japanese troops during the war remains strong, and the imperial family is still linked symbolically to the events of that period. The Emperor will not find it easy to summon words expressing sincere regret that will please both his Chinese hosts and critics at home, many of whom believe Japan was not responsible for the war. The Foreign Ministry official said the government was responsible for the Emperor's remarks during the visit. He admitted, however, that the issue was highly political and would be subject to careful consultation between the prime minister's office and the palace. Approval of the visit reflects a fundamental Japanese policy of trying to engage the Chinese in regional diplomacy rather than trying to isolate the country. 'Good relations between China and Japan should contribute to peace and stability in Asia and the world,' the official said. 'It is wrong to drive China toward the road to isolation.'

The reason does not lie in the Russian  Counter-Espionage Service's modest desire to keep quiet about  another success or in the German service's silent mourning of an  agent.    There are many reasons, but the main one is that both  agencies have agreed not to ""hand their dirty linen out"" for the  whole world to see. This is not surprising, especially  considering the fact that the matter concerns not only  professional secrets, but the observance of human rights as  well. Only a court can determine a person's guilt. To guard  the suspect's rights both sides are covering up his name and the  circumstances of his arrest.    The investigation is still going on, and it would be better  if the matter was not made public at all. Apparently, the  Counter-Espionage Service has yet to uncover the source of the  leak about the arrest. A babble-mouth is truly a great find for  a spy.    Having received a very sketchy confirmation of the incident  from Moscow, journalists bombarded official representative of  the German Government Dietier Vogel with questions. He stated  that Bernd Schmidbauer, Helmut Kohl's top aide on intelligence  issues, had a phone conversation with the head of Russia's  Counter-Espionage Service. Vogel declared that the two sides  ""are not attaching a lot of importance to this incident, and it  will not have any effect on the political relationship"" between  Russia and Germany.    The questions opened up by such events should be answered  only by the intelligence officials of the two countries, the  chancellor's representative explained. ""The truth is, that  intelligence operations are carried out all over the world, and  they do not have particular political significance"", he noted.    ""Besides, the Russian and German espionage agencies  cooperate  with each other to some extent. The Germans have their  intelligence mission in Russia, and the Russians, the former  KGB, have one in Bonn. They are, so to speak, officially  accredited. The two sides cooperate closely in many spheres, in  particular, in the fight against terrorism and organized crime"",  he said.     "

The  supporters of Democratic Party of Kurdistan Leader Mas'ud  Barzani and those of Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Leader Jalal  Talabani have been engaged in violent clashes. The fighting  broke out in a small area. It assumed a violent nature very  quickly.    The U.S. officials, who are very influential in the region,  belatedly decided to take action last week. They suggested to  Talabani, who has been living in Damascus and making no effort  to end the clashes in northern Iraq, that he ""should go to the  region and halt the incidents as soon as possible."" Talabani  responded by asking them to provide him with a helicopter  because he had to cross through territory under Barzani's  control. He stressed that he did not wish to do that.    However, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs received  reports that the area Talabani mentioned was not sealed off by  Barzani's men. In fact, several of Talabani's assistants left  Damascus and crossed through that territory to reach their area.  Considering that state of affairs, the U.S. officials rejected  Talabani's request.    The situation that has emerged in northern Iraq is as  follows: ""Syria is supporting Talabani against Barzani in the  clashes. Talabani seems to have urged Damascus to increase  Syria's military and political support for his supporters....  As far as I am able to see, Talabani and Barzani mostly differ  on matters related to northern Iraq's future. Barzani supports  the idea of a federation or a confederation with Baghdad. In  other words, he supports Iraq's territorial integrity. However,  Talabani wishes to establish an independent Kurdish State.""    The approach maintained by the two Kurdish leaders will  force  Turkey to willingly or unwillingly side with Barzani. Talabani  is either unaware of that state of affairs or he is convinced  that he stands to gain more by cooperating with Syria.... He  may be planning to use Syria when the situation returns to  normal in the region as a result of a peace agreement between  Syria and Israel.    Nevertheless, Turkey has not intervened in the fighting  between the two sides. That was the right thing to do. The  United States is expected to intervene in the situation in the  near future. A very high-ranking foreign ministry official has  said that ""Turkey has to maintain a wise policy.""    Considering the developments in northern Iraq, I wish to  criticize those who defend the view that the ""Hammer Force must  immediately withdraw from Turkey."" I do not know what else I  should say.    Question of Iran    Let us consider the developments that took place during the  Iranian delegation's visit to Ankara a few days ago:    1. The Iranian officials explained the anxiety the  developments in northern Iraq have caused in Iran.... They  conveyed a verbal message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to  President Suleyman Demirel on Iran's uneasiness.    22. President Demirel and the foreign ministry officials  informed the Iranian officials that Turkey is worried by Iran's  approach on matters related to the activities of the Kurdish  Workers Party [PKK]. The Iranian officials said that their  country has been trying to do everything it can on the matter.  They called for coordination between the two sides. The  framework of such a coordination is unknown. However, the two  countries can cooperate through the Turkish-Iranian Security  Committee.    23. The delegation did not propose joint intervention in  northern Iraq by Turkey and Iran.    24. The Iranian officials said that their country is  opposed to the establishment of an independent Kurdish State in  northern Iraq. The Turkish officials said that they shared that  view.    25. The Iranian officials said that they were worried by  the possibility that Talabani may emerge stronger against  Barzani as a result of the clashes in northern Iraq. The  Turkish officials responded by saying that Turkey and Iran  should wait until the situation becomes clear in a few months....    That is how the Iranian delegation's meetings in Turkey can  be summed up.... The Iranians seem to prefer to visit Turkey to  express certain views that otherwise could be conveyed through  telephone calls. Apparently, frequently traveling to foreign  countries seems to be attractive to them.    Someone Is Provoking    Several people seem to have disrupted the relations between  Turkey and the United States. In fact, they have been making an  intensive effort to achieve their objective in Washington. A  number of them have an ""official capacity.""    The U.S. Congress' Helsinki Commission on Human Rights has  been convinced to focus on the Kurdish problem in an  unprecedented way during the past few months. Unfortunately, it  has failed to discriminate between the PKK and the Kurdish  problem.    Speaking at a meeting that was held two days ago, the  members  of the International Human Rights Legal Committee made horrible  accusations against Turkey, in spite of the fact that they  visited Ankara to study the situation for only four days.  Kathryn Porter, wife of Republican Congressman John Porter,  addressed that meeting. She claimed that she was treated in an  unbelievable way in Turkey, which she described as a police  state and a country in which democracy does not exist.  Furthermore, she said that the situation in Diyarbakir was  worse than that in the former Soviet Union. She also claimed  that several of the people who accompanied her were killed and  that she was harassed by officials.    Kathryn Porter is not a new name for Turkey.... She  maintains a hostile attitude toward the Turks. In fact, she  traveled to south Cyprus and encouraged the Greek Cypriot women  to march against the Turkish Cypriot border some time ago. She  appeared in many photographs at the time.    The U.S. Embassy in Ankara has to realize the harm that is  being done to the relations between Turkey and the United States  by individuals who maintain hostile feelings against the Turks.  In fact, the U.S. Embassy has to take measures against them....  The matter is not a joke. It must be considered seriously.    Turkey is not a colony.... The U.S. ambassador in Ankara  must immediately explain that to Washington.... It seems that  the individuals who address the commissions of the U.S. Congress  are selected very carefully.... Ambassador Barkley, you must  end that state of affairs. Mr. Ambassador, have I made myself  clear?     "

The two sides discussed in detail the draft agreement on  three issues including repatriation of those who have entered  the areas of the other side in violation of relevant regulations.    Sources said that the two sides made progress in their talks  but differences remained.    According to the arrangement of the talks decided upon by  the  two sides yesterday evening, today's morning session covered the  topics ""Repatriation of Hijackers Across the Taiwan Straits"" and  ""Repatriation of Those Who Have Entered the Areas of the Other  Side in Violation of Relevant Regulations.""    The afternoon's topic was ""The Settlement of Fishing  Disputes  at Sea Across the Straits.""    Sun Yafu, deputy secretary-general of ARATS, said that the  common understanding and opinions voiced by the two sides are  serious and responsible.    He said that the fourth talks aimed to finalize the written  form of the agreement as soon as possible.    On repatriation of hijackers across the Taiwan Straits, Sun  said that the issue had been discussed three times. During the  last talks in Taipei, the two sides reached a basic framework  for an agreement.    He said that now the talks were focusing on arrangements  regarding factors that might crop up.    Liu Huiyou, SEF's deputy secretary-general, said that both  sides maintained the original understanding on the issue, that  is, that hijackers should be prosecuted.    Liu also mentioned differences on the issue, such as the  application of the provision about non-repatriation, time limit  for repatriation and other related issues.    Sun Yafu pointed out that the mainland side will not accept  the term that people of their own side shall not be repatriated  as it is the refurbished version of extradition between states.    He said that as a matter of fact, repatriation of criminals  or suspects between the two sides can be conducted according to  the ""Jinmen Agreement"", which still remains valid.    The two sides also differed on the issue of the settlement  of  fishing disputes, according to Sun.     "

At a closed-door Legislative Yuan session, Yin said Beijing  was still trying to cover up the incident, Legislators Ting  Shou-chung and Chen Shui-pien said after the meeting.    Beijing originally claimed the tourists were killed in an  accident, but on Sunday admitted that it had arrested three  suspects in what it said was a ""heinous robbery, arson and  murder case,"" although it fell short of details.    ""The three detained by Beijing are just scapegoats,"" Yin was  quoted by ting and shen as saying. ""There are others connected  with the incident who are not ordinary citizens.""    Yin said his bureau from the start believed the victims were  robbed and murdered, based on information gathered by informants  in Mainland China. He said the informants reported that  mainland President and Chinese Communist Party General Secretary  Jiang Zemin had set a two-week deadline for mainland police to  complete an inquiry into the incident. The report was confirmed  by the WEN WEI PAO, a Beijing-supported newspaper in Hong Kong,  on Tuesday.    Yin said his bureau will publish the information it has  obtained before Beijing begins its trial of the three suspects  as a way of pressing Beijing to be more forthcoming.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  (ARATS), Mainland China's intermediary body with Taiwan, in a  letter to its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) Wednesday reconfirmed the detention of the  three.    ARATS said the three had been planning a tour-boat robbery  on  the lake since last year. It said the robbers used explosives,  hunting rifles, and gasoline in their attack on the boat, using  jetskis to make their getaway.    Belongings of the victims, including money, watches, and  cameras, were later found at the homes of relatives of the three  robbers, ARATS said.    Meanwhile, in related news, President Li Teng-hui, while  receiving SEF President Ku Chen-fu on Wednesday morning, said  that Beijing ""is moving in the right direction on the case.""     "

(Saturday in Thailand), President Bill  Clinton must already have announced a major decision to lift the  trade sanctions imposed for 30 years on Vietnam, its adversary.    The decision of the U.S. leader will turn a new page in the  history of relations between the United States and Vietnam, now  free of conditions from the Indochina war. [passage omitted]    Those benefiting from the removal of the trade sanctions are  none other than private American companies which, from now on,  will be able to reap profits from Vietnam in full after allowing  Japan to gain huge interests for so long.    The American business sector believed that the sanctions  caused more damage to the United States than to Vietnam. It  deprived the U.S. private sector of huge ""business  opportunities"" during the 30 years of the sanctions. [passage  omitted] In the eyes of American businessmen, Vietnam is no  longer the enemy who killed more than 50,000 American GIs during  the war. Vietnam of the ""new era"" for them is a country with  high economic potential and the possibility of becoming another  ""new tiger in Asia."" More importantly, Vietnam can serve as a  ""base"" in the economic power play as a balance against China and  Japan. [passage omitted]    However, experts on this matter do not think the United  States will restore diplomatic relations with Vietnam as easily  as it decided to lift the trade sanctions (which stood for  economic commitments).    For the United States, the question of diplomatic relations  with Hanoi must certainly be linked with the question of human  rights, democracy development, and other conditions. Thus, it  will take a long time before the two countries can establish  full diplomatic relations.    As for President Clinton, he has once again demonstrated  political `courage' despite the fact that he risked being  opposed by war veterans. Yet the risk is worthwhile because he  has gotten full support from the business and political sectors,  especially from the rival Republican Party. With all the pros  and cons taken into account, it can be said that the whole of  the United States stands to gain from this action.     "

0,FT931-10148 ,"FT931-10148 _AN-DBJCVADOFT 930210   FT  10 FEB 93 / Ofgas chief to quit as soon as monopoly report is published      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   SIR James McKinnon, the gas industry regulator, is to step down in September, almost a year before the end of his contract. Sir James, renowned for his acerbic manner and combative style, said yesterday he would leave his post as director general of the regulatory body Ofgas after the publication of a report on British Gas by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, due in July. 'That report is bound to propose some fundamental changes to the business and I believe a new person should follow through those changes from beginning to end,' he said. Sir James's announcement came as Ofgas became embroiled in another row with British Gas over complaints from customers last year. Ofgas said complaints had risen by 89 per cent to 1,624, but British Gas said it was not aware of more than half those. Relations between the company and the regulator have been rancorous and have recently sunk to an all-time low. But Sir James, 63, attacked his critics yesterday: 'Many people are perplexed at the aura of tension between British Gas and Ofgas, but to think there would be no conflict between a regulator and monopoly supplier is somewhat naive.' Without the scrutiny of Ofgas, there would not be the 'tension and acrimony' that had developed, Sir James said, 'but neither would there be the results achieved'. He pointed to a 20 per cent drop in gas prices in real terms since privatisation in 1986 as one of his greatest achievements. Ofgas yesterday accused British Gas of over-charging schools for gas supply by at least Pounds 2,000 a year each when they opt out of local authority control. British Gas points to a legal technicality which means the company must charge schools separately for gas and not as bulk purchasers under a local authority.

In accordance with the protocol:    ""The appropriate organizations of the Russian Federation  pledge to supply, and organizations of the Republic of Hungary  to purchase, nuclear fuel in the form of ready-made fuel  assemblies and control assemblies throughout the period of  operation of the `Paks' Nuclear Electric Power Station in the  volumes necessary for the annual recharging of the reactors.""    ""The appropriate organizations of the Russian Federation  will  accept spent nuclear fuel from the `Paks' Nuclear Electric Power  Station in the form of fuel assemblies and control assemblies,  after being held for five years at the `Paks' Nuclear Electric  Power Station, throughout the period of operation of the `Paks'  Nuclear Electric Power Station on terms analogous to the  acceptance of spent nuclear fuel from other countries under  intergovernmental agreements concluded by the USSR prior to  1991,"" i.e. prior to the Russian Federation's adoption in  December 1991 of the Law ""On Protection of the Natural  Environment,"" whose Article 50, Point 3 prohibits the  importation of radioactive waste and materials from other states  for purposes of storage and burial unless an international  treaty concluded by the Russian Federation lays down other rules  (Article 93).    The Russian Federation president's Edict No. 472 ""On the  Russian Federation's Fulfillment of Intergovernmental Agreements  on Cooperation in Constructing Nuclear Electric Power Stations  Abroad"" appeared in April 1993 for the purpose of resolving  questions relating to previously concluded treaties. The edict  confirmed (Point 1) Russia's fulfillment of the USSR's  obligations under intergovernmental agreements on cooperation in  constructing nuclear electric power stations abroad concluded  prior to 1991, including in the sphere of the delivery of  nuclear fuel and the return of spent fuel from these nuclear  electric power stations to Russia for processing, entrusted  (Point 2) the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, Ministry of the  Environment and Natural Resources, Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Federal Inspectorate  for Nuclear and Radiation Safety with drawing up and approving  the procedure for accepting spent nuclear fuel from foreign  nuclear electric power stations for subsequent processing at  Russian enterprises, and also instructed the Russian Ministry of  Atomic Energy and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations (Point  4), when concluding corresponding contracts with foreign  clients, to proceed from the premise of the  preferential return to the client country of the  solidified radioactive waste formed during processing.    The ""Procedure for Accepting Spent Nuclear Fuel from Foreign  Countries' Nuclear Electric Power Stations,"" agreed with all the  aforesaid departments, was drawn up and approved in 1992 in full  accordance with the edict. It is of fundamental importance to  emphasize that the edict enshrined the legal possibility of  making exceptions from the general rule for the Russian Ministry  of Atomic Energy and Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations in  respect of the return of solidified radioactive waste to the  client. Thus, such an exception was agreed when spent nuclear  fuel was imported from Hungary in 1993 in connection with the  Hungarian prime minister's appeal to the chairman of the Russian  Federation Government with regard to the critical situation  concerning fuel at the ""Paks"" Nuclear Electric Power Station.  The Russian Federation's refusal to accept the said materials  would be a violation of our obligations, particularly the July  1986 contracts concluded with the ""Paks"" Nuclear Electric Power  Station on the basis of the USSR Government's decree. Such  actions would undermine Russia's international authority as a  reliable partner which strictly fulfills the international  obligations assumed prior to 1991 and would contribute to the  loss of an important East European market for our industry.    Wherever our country has helped to construct nuclear  electric  power stations (the CEMA countries of East Europe and Finland),  Soviet plans have been employed in respect both of the use of  fresh fuel and of the return of spent fuel to the USSR for  processing, pursuing, inter alia, the aims of the Treaty on the  Nonproliferation of Nuclear Technologies.    It must be borne in mind that Western firms (Westinghouse,  Siemens, EDF, and others) are today actively offering their  services in the construction and modernization of nuclear  electric power stations and deliveries of nuclear fuel, actively  squeezing Russia out of the East European market for nuclear  fuel.    It should be pointed out that Britain and France also offer  extensive services in processing spent nuclear fuel to other  countries (chiefly West European ones). France also carries out  large volumes of work on processing such fuel under a contract  with Japan.    During the processing of spent fuel, isotopes of uranium and  plutonium are extracted for subsequent use in nuclear power  generation, while waste from processing is vitrified and put  into lengthy storage. This technology has been developed and  introduced in our country to ensure the work of all nuclear  electric power stations with reactors of the VVER-440  [water-cooled, water-moderated power reactor] type constructed  by us prior to 1991, with due regard for modern demands with  regard to protecting the health of personnel and protecting the  environment.    The signed protocol to the 1966 agreement confirms the  economic relations which took shape between Russia and Hungary  prior to 1991 and does not run counter to Russian legislation or  the Russian Federation president's Edict No. 472 of 21 April  1993, and all the necessary procedures were observed in its  preparation, including agreeing it with the region in accordance  with Article 9 of the Law ""On Protection of the Natural  Environment."" It ensures the protection of Russia's economic  and political interests in East Europe and makes it possible,  inter alia, to resolve the problem of rehabilitating territories  polluted by industrial activity in the past and of implementing  the program for handling radioactive waste.    Therefore all attempts to cast doubt on the Russian  Federation Government's decision are unfounded and have nothing  in common with Russia's interests apart from the desire alone to  politicize the situation in the country.

The ongoing round of talks between Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) resumed here Tuesday morning  after a one-day recess.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu said after the  morning session that the two sides again discussed several  essential points, including the use of binding arbitration to  resolve cross-strait fishing disputes, ""automatic repatriation""  of illegal mainland immigrants and exemptions to repatriation of  mainland or Taiwan residents who hijack planes from the other  side of the Taiwan Strait to their homeland.    ""As Beijing is still reluctant to recognize Taiwan's legal  jurisdiction, the two sides failed to narrow their gaps on these  key issues during the morning talks,"" said Hsu, who is heading  the Taiwan delegation to the current round of talks.    Taiwan is hoping to automatically repatriate illegal  mainland  immigrants while Beijing insists that prior consultations be  held before each repatriation. The large number of illegal  mainland immigrants, some of whom have been in Taiwan detention  centers for more than one year, has placed a huge financial  burden on Taiwan.    SEF delegates and their mainland counterparts agreed to meet  again Wednesday morning. However, Hsu said he believes the  chances are slim for the two sides to reach any agreement on the  three issues during the current round of talks.    ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Sun Yafu said the Wednesday  session will be devoted to putting final touches on this round  of talks and discussing the timing for the next meeting.    The current round of talks began last Friday and are  scheduled to end Wednesday. This is the fourth round of  SEF-ARATS talks on the three issues since the heads of the two  organizations met in Singapore last April. The two sides have  not reached any accord on the issues in subsequent talks held in  Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei during the second half of last year.    The SEF delegation is scheduled to leave here for home  Thursday.     "

Reactions here varied from resigned pragmatism to anger and  disappointment that an opportunity to reconciliate Arab ranks  after the Gulf war was not made use of.    The King, who was officially reported to be going to Mecca  and Medina on the holiest day of Ramadan to perform 'Umra,  returned to Amman at 02:00 a.m. Wednesday morning.    Officials have been careful not to play up the visit's  political value and stressed the King's wish to be at the  Prophet's burial place in Medina on Laylat al-Qadr--the night of  destiny--which, according to Islam, is the night when the skies  are opened to receive worshippers' prayers.    Privately, however, politicians and anaylsts had expressed  hope that the visit would be an opportunity to break the  deadlock in relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia which  resulted from the 1990 Gulf crisis.    A well-placed source told the JORDAN TIMES that King Husayn  was aware that his trip to Mecca and Medina was to be a ""purely  spiritual visit.""    The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no  political significance or hopes should have been attached to  this short trip except that a ""psychological barier"" had been  removed with the King's insistence on the visit despite  continued tension in political relations between him and the  Saudi monarch.    ""The King's insistence on performing 'Umra was a duty he  felt  as a Muslim,"" the source said adding that ""this was a religious  trip and not a political one... there should be no  disappointment.""    ""A psychological barrier, if one is to think politically,  has  definitely been removed,"" the source said, explaining that while  King Husayn had previously stayed away from the Islamic holy  shrines because of the political situation between the two  countries ""he was able to break that barrier"" with Tuesday's  trip.    But the source conceded that had the two kings been able to  meet and resolve some of their differences ""it would have been  differences ""it would have been perfect.""    However, other officials, who also acknowledge that the king  had no scheduled meeting with the Saudi monarch before he left  for 'Umra, did not hide their disappointment.    ""The attitude by the Saudis was definitely negative and not  conducive to reconciliation,"" said a senior official.    ""When interests of states are at risk, top state officials  should rise above personal disputes,"" he added.    Western diplomats here concur with the disappointed  officials. Analysts describe the Saudi decision as ""counter  productive.""    News agencies quoted Saudi diplomats as saying that while  they had been told by Jordanian officials that there was no  scheduled meeting between the two monarchs, ""the royal court  only informed us that the King wanted to perform 'Umra,"" a  senior Saudi diplomat, who refused to be identified, was quoted  as saying by the AP. ""There was no request for any high-level  meetings.""    A source close to the palace said there was no attempt by  the Saudis to make any high-level contact with the King or any  member of his delegation.    ""We are very disappointed,"" said the source. ""The King was  reaching out in reconciliation but King Fahd did not respond.""    Although neither Jordan nor Saudi Arabia officially  confirmed  a reconciliation meeting, official sources had privately said  that the two kings were to meet Tuesday for the first time since  the outbreak of the Gulf crisis in 1990.    Relations between the two kingdoms soured after Iraq invaded  Kuwait in Aug. 1990 when Jordan refused to join Saudi-based  U.S.-led multinational forces that drove Iraq out of Kuwait.    Jordan, at the time, declared that while it condemned Iraq's  takeover of its smaller neighbour Kuwait it felt that the  problem had to be contained within Arab ranks.    King Husayn conducted a shuttle diplomacy between Iraq and  Egypt immediately after the invasion, trying to withhold an Arab  League condemnation of Iraq with Iraqi leadership promises that  he was ready to withdraw from Kuwait.    His attempts to contain the problem within Arab ranks,  however, failed when the Arab League voted to condemn Iraq  despite earlier promises to withhold the decision.    Saudi Arabia, enraged by the Jordanian position, responded  by  cutting off much-needed economic aid to Jordan and discontinued  its fuel supplies to the country.    Relations suffered a serious setback and diplomatic missions  between the two countries have operated with minimum staff since  that time.    Officials here hoped that a meeting between the two monarchs  would have turned a new page in bilateral relations.    ""The Saudis had told us that the King was welcome to perform  the 'Umra but that there was to be no scheduled meeting with  King Fahd,"" a senior official said.    ""Yet we were hopeful that this meeting would be arranged by  the time King Husayn arrived in Saudi Arabia,"" the senior  official added.    Analysts believed that King Fahd's decision to meet  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Yemeni leader 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih was an ""encouraging"" sign that the Saudi  leadership would also move to normalise relations with Jordan.  The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Yemen adopted a  similar position to that of Jordan after the Aug. 2 Invasion.    Amman's ties with most of the Gulf states, except Saudi  Arabia and Kuwait, have improved especially with Qatar, the  United Arab Emirates and Oman.    Officially, Jordan was careful not to raise hopes by  stressing that the King's visit on Tuesday was for purely  religious reasons but sources had also revealed that an advance  team from the palace was sent a week before the King's trip to  arrange for the meeting.    King Fahd normally grants courtesy audiences to most heads  of  state visiting his country on pilgrimage.    Some analysts here now expect relations between Jordan and  Saudi Arabia to worsen after King Fahd's ""rebuff.""    ""At best Jordan will try to contain the problem,"" said one  analysts. ""But the King will not try such a gesture again. He  has gone out of his way.""    Other analysts, however, disagree and say that there were no  high expectations of reconciliation at this time and that things  will just have to ""take their own pace.""     "

He said both sides of the strait did not want to see  the unfortunate accident happen, which killed 32 compatriots  from the two sides. He urged the Taiwan side to view the  accident objectively and calmly.    On 31 March, a fire broke out on a pleasure boat in  Zhejiang's Qiandao Hu, which, to our great sorrow, killed 24  Taiwan compatriots who had come to the mainland for sightseeing  as well as eight mainland compatriots. The State Council's  Taiwan Affairs Office grieves over the deaths, and expresses  profound sympathy and solicitude for the families of the Taiwan  and mainland compatriots who died in the accident.    The State Council leaders have attached great importance to  problems arising from the fire, and have urged the Zhejiang  Provincial People's Government to earnestly deal with the  aftermath of the accident and to expedite investigations of the  cause of the accident. The Ministry of Public Security, the  National Tourism Administration, and Zhejiang Province  immediately took measures to conduct on-the-site rescue,  inspection, and search for victims' bodies. Acting on a  briefing by Zhejiang's departments concerned, the Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait promptly took the  initiative to inform Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation about  the relevant circumstances. Currently the departments concerned  are continuing to exert efforts to further deal with the  aftermath, and to investigate the accident's cause, striving to  release it as soon as it is verified.    The responsible person said: Both sides of the strait did  not want to see this unfortunate accident happen. We trust that  Taiwan compatriots at large will show understanding for the  measures taken and the efforts made by the mainland departments  concerned to deal with the accident. We are willing to listen  to positive suggestions and opinions from various parties,  including Taiwan compatriots. It is our hope that Taiwan's  relevant departments will view the accident in an objective and  calm manner to prevent some people from exploiting this accident  to create public opinion and trouble unfavorable to the  development of cross-strait relations.

This, because he can  see the League's electorate being encroached on by his pushy  ally, with his image as the first businessman to head a  government, and his government by television penetrating  everyone's homes. Perhaps the inventor of Forza Italia will not  demolish the League's base in the deep north. But, as some  sociologists have pointed out, it is focusing on the urban  services sector and industry in the provinces. It is gathering  support among the fluctuating bourgeoisie that is crying out for  optimism and expects another Italian miracle capable of pushing  prosperity well beyond the level of ""a little workshop and a  little Alfa Romeo,"" despite the millions of billions of public  debt and the troubles affecting big industry. Can people be  permitted to dream? It is natural, in every era and under any  conditions, as Manilov showed in Gogol's ""Dead Souls.""    This is a desperate situation for the League leadership. And  the prospects are of conflict between Bossi and Berlusconi,  partly because they share no common language that can reconcile  the League's unsophisticated supporters in the valleys and city  outskirts with the Berlusconi supporters, who prefer to talk  about opinion polls, targets, ratings, and shares.    The level of the conflict is rising, partly because, after  the [former League ideologue] Miglio case it has become apparent  that Berlusconi is unwilling to pay any special regard to the  unruly Bossi. So the latter's fundamental survival instinct is  coming into play, and that can prove fierce.    His ministers in the government seem more cautious, but they  all share the survival instinct, which prompts ""that crazy uncle  from Brianza"" [Bossi] to sometimes go too far.    Other League representatives point out that it is  unnecessary, even dangerous, to attack Berlusconi every day, but  add that it would be unacceptable to dissolve into the  ""Berlusconi soup.""    So how, for instance, will the League's parliamentarians  vote  when the television decree is debated? This document, subject  to several amendments before becoming law, may perhaps gain  garner some additional support capable of investing, through  drastic regulations, Berlusconi's shares in order to resolve the  conflict between public and private interests. For weeks Bossi  has been criticizing Fininvest -- the private half of the  political authority of television -- while controversy raged  over the spoils sharing system that has for years dominated the  RAI [Italian Broadcasting Corporation], which can now be either  freed from this system or subjected to it once more.    But there is more besides the skirmishes between the two  most  obvious antagonists. Bossi has all the more reason, if  possible, to be on a collision course with [National Alliance  leader] Gianfranco Fini. This, because the League's voters in  the Po Valley are demanding autonomy for local government to  levy taxes right away and abhor the leanings toward state  control and welfarism of the postfascists, who have their  dominant strongholds from Rome southward. And also because  Bossi's supporters are remote from the bureaucracy in Rome,  whereas Fini's supporters have always had reference points there  and are indeed exerting pressure on and surfacing in every  department.    Bossi can also consider himself free from any electoral pact  with Fini. While the balance of forces in the Senate remains  uncertain, the main coalition in the Chamber of Deputies  consists of two separate alliances -- between Berlusconi and  Bossi in the north and between Berlusconi and Fini in the south.  There was no joint program among the three at the national level  for the March elections, nor are there any direct relations  between Bossi and Fini. But behind Fini there is now emerging a  substantial band of ""comrades"" who retract nothing with regard  to fascism, and ""all their pride lies in that nothing.""    This being so, how are parliamentary proceedings likely to  be  in the near future? Already in the dispute over committee  chairmanships, the government alignment lost in the Senate,  5-13, because it refused to believe that an understanding with  the opposition forces was opportune, not on the basis of the old  and deplorable system of ""associationism"" but from the viewpoint  of the balance of forces. Be that as it may, what are those  five committees worth, if the chairmen on the government side,  almost all of them making their debut, are not acquainted,  through inexperience, with every aspect of the regulations and  every aspect of parliamentary practice?    Parliament already has to consider some 70 decrees on  urgent matters that have yet to be made law. Then there will be  the budget session, with the Finance Bill and its ""supplement,""  with insufficient scope to satisfy the government's legislative  ambitions. Among other things, it will be necessary to fill the  financial chasm, some 30 trillion lire, created in the budget by  two rulings by the Constitutional Court concerning INPS  [National Social Security Institute] pensions. How often will  the government be defeated in the Senate? These are troubled  times, despite the prime minister's persistent optimism since  the 12 June elections, just a month after the inauguration of  his new ministers, at a time when nobody could yet judge their  work in relation to the promises and expectations.    If, moreover, the government's uncomfortable position in the  Senate is exacerbated by conflicts among the three major groups  within the coalition, plus the demands of the minor groups, in  the months ahead we may witness an outright storm in parliament.  Certainly, Berlusconi will claim credit for any partial success  and will blame any possible failure on the other forces'  parliamentary strategy, will talk about ungovernability, and  will threaten another early election. But what will his chances  in six months' time, or more be? And what will the opinion  polls show, assuming that the president agrees to another  election?    Under such circumstances, anything is possible. Indeed, any  observer can only be considered reliable for 24 hours.

""We are turning into an information-analytical structure  which would cooperate with the Foreign Intelligence Service, the  Federal Counter-Intelligence Service and the tax inspection,"" he  believes. Petrov noted that the priority task of the board which  previously dealt with checking the implementation of laws and  decrees, will be the preparation of informational-analytical  materials for the Russian leader about the activities of the  federal power bodies and power bodies of the subjects of the  Federation.    Speaking about the right to demand documents necessary for  check-ups from enterprises and organizations, Petrov pointed out  that the board has no intention to violate the law on commercial  secret. ""Our enquiries may concern regular information about the  financial and economic activities,"" he said.    According to Petrov, commercial structures will not be the  main target of check-ups. ""We are more interested in the federal  and regional power structures and high-ranking officials,"" he  said.    Petrov noted that the president's decision to transform the  board was not caused by some current political reasons, and by  no means is linked with the package of economic decrees signed  recently by Boris Yeltsin. IF Note: According to the provision  on control board at the president, it performs the following  functions: prepares and presents to the president analytical  information about activities of federal power bodies, state  power bodies of the subjects of the Federation on implementation  of the Russian Constitution, decrees and orders of the  president, checks activities of the federal executive power  bodies, executive bodies of the subjects of the Federation,  their leaders and apparatus, as well as institutions and  organization, carries out check-ups of activities of the  presidential administration's division, considers complaints and  appeals of citizens, enterprises, institutions and organization;  analyzes activities of special control and supervision bodies of  the federal executive power bodies and their subdivisions in  regions, etc.     "

Hungary was represented by Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky,  International Economic Relations Minister Bela Kadar,  Transportation Minister Gyorgy Schamschula, and Minister of  Industry and Trade Janos Latorcai.    The Russian negotiating group included Telecommunications  Minister Vladimir Bulgak, Foreign Economics Minister Oleg  Davidov, Nuclear Energy Minister Vitaly Mikhaylov, Deputy  Finance Minister Andrei Vavilov, and Deputy Foreign Minister  Sergei Krilov.    Hungarian Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman told the  press that the talks focussed mainly on bilateral economic  cooperation. The two prime ministers agreed that unresolved  issues outstanding from the past should be quickly settled,  including Russia's debt to Hungary, so that efforts can be  concentrated on strengthening business ties.    Herman said the $800-900 million which Russia owes Hungary  could be repayed through the participation of Hungarian  companies in Russian privatization, the use of non-commercial  services, or machine deliveries. The possibility of further  arms purchases was also raised, though Hungary would prefer  modern market methods of debt repayment which promote economic  relations.    Ministry leaders are to spend the next day-and-a-half  discussing debt settlement. It is hoped that an agreement on  this issue will be signed during Chernomyrdin's visit.    The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction that  bilateral trade has stopped declining and conditions have been  created for an increase in the near future.    Chernomyrdin said Moscow hopes Hungary will move ahead from  the 7th place it presently takes among Russia's trading  partners. Boross believes Hungary could mainly increase its  exports of farm and food products, medicines and buses.    Regarding the Hungarian-Russian basic treaty, Chernomyrdin  said that while the former parliament was unable to approve it,  there is now a good chance for ratification.    Touching on the South Slav crisis, the Russian prime  minister  stressed that Moscow will do all it can for a peaceful  settlement as soon as possible, which he noted was also in  Hungary's best interest.    The two heads of government voiced agreement that political  relations are settled and progressing fairly well between the  two countries.     "
0,FT943-1428 ,"FT943-1428 _AN-EIYAEAASFT 940924   FT  24 SEP 94 / Congress near agreement on lobbyist curbs      By JUREK MARTIN   The US Congress moved closer yesterday to passing legislation severely limiting the favours its members may receive from lobbyists. But with only two weeks remaining before recess, Republicans threatened to block action on other substantive legislation, including a watered-down healthcare reform bill, proposals to change the financing of election campaigns and a measure protecting Californian desert lands from development. The lobbying breakthrough came with the agreement of a joint House-Senate conference committee on a unified bill to be presented to the Senate early next week and the House shortly after. Both passed different bills earlier in the year. The bill would prohibit members of Congress and their staffs from accepting meals, entertainment, travel, legal defence fund contributions and all but the most inexpensive gifts from lobbyists. Campaign contributions would not be covered. The estimated 13,000 paid lobbyists in Washington would be obliged to register with the government (only about 4,000 now do). They would also be required to disclose their financing and expenditures, whom they lobby and on what issues. The issue has populist appeal in advance of the November mid-term elections in which the anti-Washington mood of the nation is already evident. The defeat on Tuesday of Congressman Mike Synar of Oklahoma in a Democratic primary and the re-election problems of Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House (19 points down in his Washington state district, according to a poll out yesterday), were tart reminders of this political reality. But the Republicans showed themselves disinclined to hand the Democratic leadership and President Bill Clinton anything that could be portrayed as victories during the November polls. A mainstream group of senators, including some moderate Republicans, continued to press for modest healthcare reform improving coverage for pregnant women, children and the aged. Most on Capitol Hill now consider the cause of healthcare lost for this session, though Senator George Mitchell, majority leader, refuses to concede defeat. Senate Republicans also threatened to use an obscure parliamentary device - known as the post-cloture filibuster - to prevent action on campaign finance reform, an issue high on President Clinton's agenda. This bill would place financial ceilings on the amount that could be spent in any race and would provide for partial government financing.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

This could be interpreted  as underestimating Bulgaria, a country with which the Czech  Republic has very close relations.    [Havel] President Zhelev has already visited here, and I  visited Sofia in the days of Czechoslovakia. We were not able  to accomplish everything we had hoped to, despite the fact that  President Zhelev and I have known each other since our days as  dissidents. My brief visit is not meant to underestimate  Bulgaria--precisely the opposite. Because I will be visiting  Romania, a country where I have never been, I said to myself  that I cannot be so close to Sofia and not stop over for a while  to meet with President Zhelev again. In addition, there is a  relatively substantial Czech community in Bulgaria, and a very  strong Czech-Slovak club has been active there for many years.  I am really very sorry because I always say that I am going to  find time for my compatriots in your country, and I never could  until now.    [Bekhar] Is this the only thing bringing you to Bulgaria?    [Havel] We are two countries that, willingly or unwillingly,  have many common concerns. We did away with communism at about  the same time, and now we are struggling with its consequences.  You and we alike want to construct a real democracy and join  the European structures. Both you and we have no guarantees  that one day we will not make any mistakes. Therefore, the more  frequently we exchange experiences and talk to each other, the  greater our chances will be to eliminate the shadow of communism  as soon as possible.    [Bekhar] Experience also used to be exchanged in the  past....    [Havel] Oh my God, you know I mean something else. In the  past, we had a strange, imposed friendship, in which everything  was clear and precise. Afterwards, when CEMA and the Warsaw  Pact collapsed like a house of cards and it became clear that  this entire market was an artificial creation, it appeared that  we would have to construct something new.    [Bekhar] And what is that?    [Havel] I can tell you in one word: democracy.    [Bekhar] This is clear, but you know that the love for  democracy passes through the stomach. Therefore, don't you  think we could help each other a lot more if there were a free  and custom-free market between Bulgaria and the Czech Republic?  There are traditions in this sphere....    [Havel] The Czech Republic, in principle, adheres to the  maximal liberalizing of trade. I plan to discuss this subject  in Romania, and, obviously, we will talk about this in Bulgaria,  but everything requires time. A group of experts is studying  whether it is possible to intensify trade between our countries.  By the way, the same applies to Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia.    [Bekhar] All this could be a lot simpler if Bulgaria were a  member of the Visegrad Four. Will you support Bulgaria's  admission into this group?    [Havel] It is not that simple. [passage omitted]    [Bekhar] Then you think that no state has the chance of  joining this alliance, regardless of its goals and structure?    [Havel] I think that expanding the group now is pointless.  Personally, I support small regional communities. This is the  case of the Scandinavian countries, Great Britain, and now the  Visegrad Four. However, this does not mean that we consider  ourselves superior to the Balkan states. It is just that you  are in the south and we are in Central Europe. This hardly  gives us any advantage, but it nevertheless remains a historical  and geographical fact. The small communities can always react  rapidly and practically. In addition, they have common  interests and could protect them more successfully.    [Bekhar] Do you think we should create a Balkan federation?    [Havel] God forbid! I do not want to give any advice. At  least I have not been authorized to do so. Actually, why should  you not create such an entity? A new organization would emerge,  and, as was the case was with the Visegrad Four, everyone will  want to join. This is, to a certain degree, characteristic of  our time. We are all nervous and are watching each other to see  that no one gains an advantage over the rest by integrating with  someone else. Everyone wants to join every possible  organization, which is impossible. You have so many common  interests with Greece and Romania. It makes no difference  whether it is a postcommunist state or not. Greece is a member  of both NATO and the European Union. It could be very useful as  a member of a Balkan community or alliance; it makes no  difference what it is going to be called. If one day the  nightmare in Yugoslavia is over, perhaps some of its former  republics will also join. Albania also is doing whatever it can  in order to become a democratic state. You and Turkey belong to  the Black Sea Cooperation Zone. The Czech Republic is not a  member of this organization. It has no business there....  [passage omitted]    [Bekhar] The former communists in Eastern Europe began to  return in a rather triumphant manner. This time they are armed  with rightist economic programs. Are you not afraid that the  same could happen in the Czech Republic?    [Havel] For several reasons, I think it would be impossible.  First, Prague used to have the most conservative communists  among the Warsaw Pact countries. That regime was so rotten and  compromised that I do not envy its heirs. This is why they  quarrel so much among themselves. In addition, there is no  serious leftist force in the Czech Republic that proposes  anything serious. The leftist forces that exist in Slovakia,  Poland, and Hungary simply do not exist in the Czech Republic.  There is a rather hard-core communist party, whose members are  those who do not want to part with the illusions of their life.  In addition, there are two smaller communist parties, with  which it is possible to conduct a discussion of sorts, but they  do not represent any electoral force or threat to anyone.  Finally, there is another factor: The most capable and smart  communists in the Czech Republic long ago became capitalists and  vote for the most rightist parties simply because, for them,  capitalism is better than communism.

The  airport police have taken him from the plane for investigation.  It was initially determined that there were no accomplices.    During the interrogation, (Chou Wen-chiang) said he was born  in [words indistinct] in 1958 and was a resident of Guangdong's  Lien County. He has a heart ailment [words indistinct]. He  said he hijacked the plane because he was dissatisfied with his  low pay of only a few dozen yuan a month, and he received a  compensation of only 8,000 yuan after his elder sister was  killed by an unlicensed driver.    According to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, the plane,  which was hijacked at 1920, gave the signal at 1924 that it had  been hijacked. While our military and radar placed the plane  under close surveillance, two F5-E fighter jets took off from  the Chiayi Airport to intercept it. The fighters intercepted  the plane at 1939 and guided it to a safe landing at the Chiang  Kai-shek Airport at 1956. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Minister Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the Executive  Yuan panel in charge of affairs about hijacking, indicated that  the case will be handled according to the principle that the  hijacker and the plane will be handled separately. He said the  plane, after being routinely checked, will be allowed to fly to  its original destination, but the hijacker will be turned over  to judicial authorities for handling. He reiterated that while  the government is firmly against any plane hijacking and will  strictly punish any hijackers, relevant Chinese communist  authorities should strengthen their security checks to forestall  any hijacking attempts. He added that the hijacker will be  repatriated after the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] has  consultated the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] and reached a common understanding with the  latter. He said the hijacker will never be be allowed to stay  in Taiwan.    As usual, the SEF has immediately notified ARATS on the  procedures that will be taken for the repatriation of the  hijacker.

He expressed regret over the statement  and was not bullish about the development of current  Sino-British relations.    In an interview with this reporter, Ma Yuzhen made a  thorough  analysis of the development of Sino-British relations and the  disputes caused by the Hong Kong issue in recent years.    First, he refuted four points in the statement Patten made  when he returned to Britain last week to attend a hearing of the  Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee.    1. Patten accused China of just making a concession in the  Hong Kong political structure talks over lowering the voting  age. This was at variance with the facts. In fact, China made  major concessions in two other matters: Agreeing to let  district boards and the Urban Council practice the single seat,  single vote system and agreeing to abolish the appointed seats  in the Urban Council and district boards before 1997 so as to  reach an agreement.    ""When he spoke at the hearing, Patten distorted China's  position in the 17 rounds of talks and ignored the facts. It is  unfair to try to overwhelm the other side by distorting its  position and viewpoint. If even the most rudimentary rules of  political negotiations are not followed, is there any  credibility to speak of?""    Patten Misleads Britain and the Hong Kong People    2. Patten stated on many occasions that he did not believe  that China would dare overturn the three-tier council structure  that he was pursuing just out of consideration of the pressure  of world opinion. If he does think that, it means he is  dreaming. Otherwise, fully aware that China will keep its  promises, he still continues to pursue the three-violation  uncooperative policy. This way of doing things is utterly  irresponsible toward the Hong Kong people and Sino-British  relations. In terms of political and legal principles, China  can and must disband the three-tier councils in 1997. Patten's  remark was designed to mislead Britain and the Hong Kong people.    Ma Yuzhen also refuted Patten's analogy of installing panes  of glass for the Hong Kong people. He said: ""The Hong Kong  people have lived in this house without any panes of glass for  more than 100 years. Now, when the British authorities are  about to leave, they say they will install panes of glass, and  in so saying they do not consult the host and residents. This  way of doing things is ridiculous. It is an expression of phony  benevolence. ""    Regarding the pressure of world opinion which Patten  stressed, analyzing it, Ambassador Ma Yuzhen said: Of the 180  or so countries in the world, most are China's friends and Third  World countries. They have experienced suppression by the  imperialists. Will they now sympathize with Britain on the Hong  Kong issue? China is improving its relations with 20 or so  developed countries one after another. Moreover, since they  have their own agendas, they will not change their policies  toward China in accordance with London's wishes.    Patten Tries in Vain To Continue Colonialist Rule    3. Patten criticized China's attitude as being  ""unreasonable."" Refuting the criticism, Ma Yuzhen said:  ""China's response to Patten is based on an analysis of past  events concerning China and Britain in the last 100 years or so  and thus is very reasonable. It is really unreasonable for the  British side to try in vain to continue its colonialist rule as  the 21st century approaches.""    4. Patten interpreted the spirit of the Sino-British Joint  Declaration as being ""fair and trustworthy elections."" Ma  Yuzhen pointed out: This is a distortion of the spirit of the  Joint Declaration. Deliberately misinterpreting and belittling  a document of great historic significance as a document  concerning elections in a narrow sense is an act far removed  from the spirit of the Joint Declaration.    ""The spirit of the Joint Declaration lies in the Chinese  resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong after 1997. Britain  must return Hong Kong to China after 1997. This is a matter of  sovereignty complete with administration. After the turnover of  sovereignty, China will pursue the one-country, two-systems  policy and conduct elections in accordance with the Basic Law.    China does not oppose either elections or democracy.  However, if this is interpreted as the spirit of the Joint  Declaration, even though public opinion is misled, those who are  familiar with the Hong Kong situation cannot be misled.""    When it came to the repeated British appeals for a  resumption of talks, Ma Yuzhen stated: Let him who tied the  bell on the tiger take it off. Unless the British side changes  its uncooperative and antagonistic Hong Kong policy and  withdraws the first-stage political structure draft which it has  submitted to the Legislative Council, the Chinese side must  otherwise accelerate its preparatory work, and, through the work  of the Preliminary Work Committee [for the Preparatory Committee  of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] and the  concerted efforts of the Hong Kong people, China will ensure the  smooth transition of Hong Kong.    Nevertheless, he stressed: The Preliminary Work Committee is  a working organ. It is neither an organ of political power nor  a shadow government. Hence, there is no question of replacing  the Hong Kong Government. ""In the situation in which the  British side is not cooperative and there are just three and a  half years left until 1997, the only way to guarantee a smooth  transition is for the Hong Kong people and Preliminary Work  Committee to intensify cooperation.""    Patten Plays the Same Old Trick Before Quitting the Colony    Ma Yuzhen accused Britain of playing the popular-will card  with a view to realizing the ""three violations."" This is a  replay of the small trick played by Britain every time in the  past when quitting its colonies. The Chinese Government  attaches importance to the opinions of the Hong Kong people and  this can be seen from the fact that four years and eight months  were spent soliciting the opinions of the Hong Kong people  regarding the Basic Law, but the British Government has never  valued the popular will in its rule over Hong Kong in the last  100 years or so.    Ma Yuzhen took over the job of ambassador to Britain in 1991  and has since then experienced the process of Sino-British  relations turning from good to bad. He discussed his views.    One was that China attached importance to developing  relations with Britain and regarded Britain as an important  country which carried considerable weight [you fen liang 2589  0433 6852] and maintenance of friendly relations with the latter  as being conducive to world peace. ""Although there are  differences between China and Britain, they have common  interests, such as a long-term interest in maintaining Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability. The current situation of  retrogression is something China does not want to see. China has  never done anything harmful to its relations with Britain. The  responsibility for this situation does not rest with the Chinese  side.""    Britain Undermines Sino-British Relations    The other view was that in approaching Sino-British  relations, it was necessary to review past events from a  historical point of view. ""During the 200 years from the visit  to China of a British envoy in 1847 to the coming to Hong Kong  of Patten as governor, Sino-British relations have been full of  twists and turns. Before the Opium War, it can be said that the  two countries treated each other as equals. However, from 1840  to 1949, Britain invaded China using military force five times  and China was thus in an unequal position of being invaded and  bullied.    ""In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan,  Britain recognized the state of Manchuria set up by Japan in  northeast China and closed the Yunnan-Burma Railway when China  was facing the most difficult times. It was after Japan  attacked its colonies that Britain adopted a policy of opposing  Japan. After 1949, Britain recognized China quite early on. It  was not until 1972, when British Prime Minister Edward Heath  adopted a farsighted China policy and normalized Sino-British  relations, that the two countries began to exchange ambassadors.  Relations between the two countries developed smoothly up to  1989, when, together with other Western countries, Britain  imposed comprehensive sanctions against China because of the  Beijing disturbance.""    Ma Yuzhen became ambassador to Britain in 1991, when China  and Britain resumed contacts between high-level officials. His  feelings about his work were that there were quite a few people  of foresight in British political, industrial, and commercial  circles, and they hoped to strengthen cooperation with China.  He has all along worked happily. However, it was a pity that  the formerly very good situation of cooperation between China  and Britain was undermined by the change Britain made in its  China policy in October 1992.    An Impact on Cooperation in Other Fields of Endeavor Is Hard  To Avoid    As far as the current relations between China and Britain  are  concerned, Ma Yuzhen advised the British Government, which had  landed itself in a hole, to stop digging the hole and undo what  it had done so far by quoting the former Labor Party Minister  Dennis Healey as saying: ""When you land yourself in a hole, you  must stop digging the hole.""    However, he added: The termination of Sino-British talks  does not mean that the two countries do not have any normal  diplomatic channels. The British side has violated the  agreements on the issues of political structure and the new  airport, adopted an uncooperative and antagonistic attitude, and  undermined the cooperation between China and Britain step by  step. Consequently, an impact on other aspects of Sino-British  cooperation is hard to avoid.    He anticipated that it would be hard for Sino-British  relations to take a turn for the better in the short term.  However, he was fully confident that Hong Kong had a bright  future. In 1997 Hong Kong would be able to revert to China  smoothly.    After 1997, China also will be able to implement  sovereignty,  the Basic Law, and the one-country, two-systems concept to the  letter.    ""Cast away illusions, have greater confidence, step up  preparatory work, heighten vigilance, guard against sabotage,  and rely on the motherland."" These are words of advice Chinese  Ambassador to Britain Ma Yuzhen gave to the Hong Kong people.     "

Honduran Vice President Walter Lopez Reyes told NOTIMEX that  ""Honduras disagrees with a forceful invasion of Haiti"" and that  he voiced this position to the U.S. military leaders who arrived  in Honduran territory today.    Perry and McCaffrey arrived at the Palmerola Military Base,  where they met with Foreign Relations Minister Ernesto Paz,  Government Minister Efrain Moncada Silva, Vice President Walter  Lopez Reyes, and Armed Forces Chief General Luis Alonso Discua  Elvir.    Lopez Reyes made assurances that the government of President  Carlos Roberto Reina would be willing to cooperate with a  mission to restore peace in Haiti requested through a UN or OAS  resolution. He said that military leaders in the Clinton  administration have never asked Honduras to support an invasion  and that they only requested our ""opinion"" on the Haitian  situation.    Another topic discussed by the Honduran and U.S. officials  was the future of the U.S. base in Palmerola, located in the  central Department of Comayagua. This installation was built in  1983 when anti-Sandinist armed groups in Nicaragua, known as  ""contras,"" used Honduran territory as a base to launch their  armed operations with U.S. financing and aid.    This base legalized the U.S. military presence in Honduras,  and its construction cost over $30 million. ""We talked about  the future of Palmerola as a regional counternarcotics training  center,"" Lopez Reyes pointed out. Honduras is unable to  maintain this base, and thus, the vice president admitted that  it could hardly be transferred to Honduran hands. Palmerola  will also be used by the U.S. National Guard and Army Reserves  to train in engineering and civilian-military operations, Lopez  Reyes added.    He denied that the United States will transfer to Honduras  the 82d Airborne Division, which invaded Grenada in 1983,  because there has been no thought of transferring the Southern  Command (headquartered in Panama) to Palmerola, as was reported  in this capital.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will head for Puerto  Rico today, after visiting Panama and Honduras, and he will  return to Washington on Sunday.     "

Robaina stressed during his speech that Cuba's independence,  sovereignty, right to speak for itself, and other principles are  not negotiable.    When introducing Robaina, Monsignor Pedro Padura, bishop of  Rosario, reiterated the Argentine people's solidarity with Cuba  and encouraged the Cubans to continue ""tending their garden of  hope.""    Robaina responded by saying that his fellow countrymen know  how to tend that garden with ""their sweat, their hearts, and  their very lives if necessary.""    The event was held in a theater in downtown Buenos Aires and  attended by more than 1,000 people. It was organized by the  Solidarity With Cuba group made up of dozens of friendship  societies from various sectors.    The Cuban leader spoke at length of the current situation in  Cuba, denounced the U.S. blockade, and expressed his  appreciation for international solidarity with Cuba.    Regarding the anti-Cuban campaign focused on the alleged  violation of human rights on the island, Robaina strongly  rejected those accusations and said there are millions of people  in the world who have no rights at all.    There are millions of people, Robaina stressed, who cannot  read or write those two words (human rights).    Robaina met yesterday with Argentine President Carlos Saul  Menem during a meeting the two leaders described as positive.  Robaina also met with members of the Senate and Chamber of  Deputies foreign affairs committees, held two working sessions  with acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, and met with  Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez.    The distinguished guest also spoke of ""investment and trade  with Cuba"" at the headquarters of the Argentine Chamber of  Commerce and discussed Cuba's foreign policy with members of the  International Relations Council (CARI).    Robaina was declared ""illustrious guest"" by the Buenos Aires  Study Council [Consejo Deliberante de Buenos Aires] and met with  former President Raul Alfonsin, leader of the Radical Civic  Union, and members of the broad front coalition and the  socialist union.    Robaina also met with Cubans residing in Buenos Aires.     "

The U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, and  Undersecretary of State for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau,  have recently made statements indicative of U.S. intentions to  open a direct dialogue with the Islamic Republic.    Following 14 years of desperate efforts to undermine the  legitimacy of Iran, the United States is finally heeding  international pressure and is trying to come to terms with the  political realities of the Islamic Republic.    Pelletreau recently told the House of Representatives'  Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs that the United States will not  try to destabilize the government of Iran and no longer  considers the Islamic Republic to be a temporary phenomenon.  Washington's apparent change of heart is motivated by two  objectives. First, since the demise of the international  bipolar political power structure, and due to the ambiguous  nature of the emerging `new world order,' Europe has exercised  its right to make political decisions independent of the U.S.,  and has therefore gained increasing influence in the Middle  East. Most European countries, in defiance of the United  States, have established and maintained cordial relations with  Iran, thereby limiting American influence in this region.    Second, the failure of the U.S.-imposed Middle East peace  talks has prompted Washington to consider using Tehran's  spiritual influence in the Islamic world to revive and  legitimize the peace accord, and to indirectly contain what it  perceives to be the epidemic spreading of 'Islamic  fundamentalism' in the Muslim Middle East.    Realizing and accepting global realities, America is eagerly  awaiting to reoccupy its dominant position in the Middle East.  Iran has all along endeavored to stay faithful to its own  Islamic Revolution while leaving open the possibility of  reconciliation with the U.S. provided that America releases  Iran's assets, which are frozen in U.S. banks, and refrains from  covert and overt operations aimed at isolating and destabilizing  the Islamic Republic.    Considering the resulting benefits for both sides, if  relations are indeed re-established, the United States stands to  gain a lot more than Iran, therefore, it should be prepared to  make greater concessions. Iranian officials are well aware of  this fact and will base their demands and proposals accordingly.     "

During his visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Celso  Amorim has been trying to design a more dynamic position for  Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country  has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings  have been scheduled for April when British Foreign Minister  Douglas Hurd visits Brasilia, and the Brazilian foreign minister  will visit France at the invitation of his counterpart, Alain  Juppe. Amorim will address the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee then.    These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years.  As just an example of the poor period being experienced by  Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to  Brazil has been postponed four consecutive times during the past  few years.    The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to  Germany foreshadow a new period. In Bonn on 25 February, the  Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important  meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O  ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: ""If Brazil hopes to play a  leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these  talks."" The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President  Fernando Collor of destroying our country's foreign policy and  not replacing it.    The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our  country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its  bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward  France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, Brazil's three  principal European partners, which represents a priority in  Itamaraty's strategy. The effort to further approach these EC  countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and  investments. Amorim emphasized: ""To this end, however, it is  necessary to hold political talks.""    In the case of Germany, the Brazilian foreign minister  explained: ""The tripartite agreement's ratification was  essential because diplomacy and development must work together.""    Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the  German interest in Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System].  The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic  control system in the Amazon region. The French and Americans  also have expressed interest in this project.

I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to  participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson  Mandela tomorrow.    Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by  his  friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at  the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international  airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house  and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral  and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation.  I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the  South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South  Africa is also a main point of their conversation.    Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over  the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in  office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the  sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when  he carried out a broad program of activities that included  participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province.    The two countries have also adopted, at different  international forums, common positions on just causes, when  firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to  great enemy pressures.    Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the  spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens  our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young  Ghanaians are studying in Cuba.    Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban  personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the  delegation members reported on the main activities taking place  in our country.    We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where  the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not  be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The  Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of  the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.  [passage omitted]     "

The Cuban diplomat, who is his government's top  representative in Panama, stated at a news conference that the  document on which legislator Leo Gonzalez based his charges is  ""counterfeit, spurious, and prefabricated.""    Martinez noted that the bogus document, which reached the  Cuban Embassy through ""a friendly Panamanian,"" was delivered by  him on 25 April to Panamanian Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos  Cordero. He warned Cordero about the possibility that it might  be used as part of ""a disinformation campaign.""    The document links ranking members of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party (PRD) and members of the Papa Egoro Movement  with operations to exchange drugs for weapons in Cuba,  legislator Gonzalez revealed.    Spokesmen for both parties noted that Gonzalez's charges are  the result of his low vote expectations in the upcoming  election, in which he is up for reelection and, according to  political polls, could very well lose.    The Cuban charge d'affaires noted today that the document  features forged signatures of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina; Panamanian Consul Robert Infante; and Hector Hernandez  Pardo, director of the Superior Institute of Foreign Relations  of Cuba.    To enable reporters to confirm the forged signatures, he  showed them official Foreign Ministry documents with the  signatures of the officials, which were different from those  contained in the controversial document.    ""They do not match. They have been altered and forged,""  Martinez said, insisting that the Cuban Embassy ""wants to  resolve this matter.""    ""We have been and will continue to be objective, and we do  not meddle in Panama's domestic affairs,"" the diplomat stated,  describing as ""irresponsible"" the manipulation of such an  ""extremely delicate"" issue that could affect relations between  two states.    Miguel Martinez explained that the ""counterfeit documents""  were available months ago in the Panamanian capital, and he  added that people whose identity he did not know were asking up  to $20,000 to sell them.    Since the U.S. Army invasion on 20 December 1989, relations  between Cuba and Panama have been maintained at a nominal level  without any diplomatic representative at embassy level.     "

Blas F. Ople, chairman of the Senate  Foreign Relations Committee, called on the national government  yesterday to lead other members of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) in an intensified diplomacy to defuse the  atmosphere of gathering war in the Korean peninsula.    Ople said that the use of economic sanctions by the United  Nations against an already isolated North Korea could force a  desperate and paranoid government in Pyongyang to consider the  war option which can drag the Philippines and other Asian  countries in a new, unpredictable international crisis.    What makes the situation volatile is the unpredictability of  the Korean leadership which is composed of ""mysterious, shadowy  personalities and very little is known about them,"" he said.    North Korea, the last Stalinist state in the world, has a  mutual defense treaty with the People's Republic of China (PRC),  the world's most populous nation. Its two top leaders are Kim  Il-song and his son Kim Chong-il, ""who is more erratic than his  father,"" Ople told Senate reporters.    ""No one doubts that both father and son are capable of going  to war against all odds,"" Ople observed as the clouds of war  loomed over the divided Korean peninsula as a result of North  Korea's refusal to allow United Nations' inspection of its  nuclear facilities.    President Clinton, acting on the request of the U.S.  commander in South Korea representing the United Nations, has  ordered the dispatch and installation of ""Patriot"" missiles as a  counter measure against the North Korean's, heightening tension  in the Asian region.    ""North Korea itself is an arms bazaar where routinely Middle  East countries shop for missiles. Some of the scud missiles  (bought from North Korea) were used in Iraq by Saddam Husayn who  is 10 times more predictable than Kim,"" Ople said.    Technically, the Korean War which began in 1950 has not  ended, although the armistice at Panmunjon negotiated in 1953  has held up for nearly four decades. Any resumption of  hostilities will mean activating a multinational force to face  an invasion of South Korea, Ople said.    He expressed hopes that the Department of Foreign Affairs  (DFA) and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), along with  the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), have contingency  plans as there are an estimated 40,000 Filipinos in South Korea.

""We haven't reached agreement on the main points, but we  have  made some progress,"" said Sun Yafu, vice general secretary of  the semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait (ARATS). However, he indicated that this progress  amounted to little more than going ""into greater detail on our  differences.""    Sun's counterpart in Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF) Xu Huiyu said his team had proposed holding the fifth  round of talks as soon as possible in Taipei. The Chinese side  has yet to respond to the proposal.    Both stressed the need to deepen the discussion at the next  round of talks.    The five-day talks -- which focused on repatriation of  aircraft hijackers and stowaways -- appeared on the brink of  collapse earlier on the weekend as the result of deep  differences over the issue of jurisdiction, according to Taiwan  newspapers. The SEF and ARATS negotiators reportedly shouted  and accused each other of breach of trust and of failing to live  up to promises made at earlier meetings.    Taiwan insists the hijacking issue be solved within the  framework of the repatriation of all ""criminals,"" such as  illegal immigrants and sea-pirates, while China wants the matter  to be dealt with separately. The two sides began to talk  seriously about the hijacking issue following a spate of such  incidents which saw 15 asylum-seeking Chinese people hijacking  11 Chinese airliners to Taiwan since April 1992. The teams have  already reached an agreement in principle on the matter, but it  has since become bogged down in jurisdiction and sovereignty  issues. Taiwan insists it has the right to try the hijackers,  while China demands they be sent back to the mainland  immediately.    China and Taiwan's Red Cross societies also have an  agreement  already on repatriating tens of thousands of illegal immigrants  that have sneaked into Taiwan in recent years but Beijing has  been slow in taking them back, with disputes arising from who  should foot the bill. Some 2,223 illegal immigrants remain in  Taiwan detention centres.    Beijing has viewed Taiwan as a renegade province since 1949,  when the Nationalists fled to the island after losing a civil  war with the communists.     "

Accordingly, it is expected that the  United States will be in favor of the trends toward pluralism;  that the regional powers' right of speech will be strengthened;  and that the roles of international institutions and  international organizations, including the United Nations, will  be enhanced.    Powerful countries will constantly make efforts for  disarmament, including cutting nuclear weapons. However, the  regional arms race will be intensified, because uncertainty may  take place as a result of the weakening of the influence of the  United States and Russia. In this connection, the need for  multilateral cooperation to cope with the issue concerning  regional security will be raised.    In particular, because of the relative economic stagnation  of  the United States and the European Community (EC) and because of  the rapid economic growth of the East Asian countries, the world  order cannot but become more multilateral.    It is expected that the settlement of the Uruguay Round (UR)  negotiations and the establishment of the World Trade  Organization (WTO) will promote the free trade system in the  international economic order.    In addition, as the atmosphere for security and economic  cooperation is heightened in international society,  international concern and cooperation toward the environment,  narcotics, and terrorism--the factors traditionally irrelevant  to security--will be increased.    Accordingly, in order to stably manage the world's security,  economy, and other factors traditionally irrelevant to security,  international society's cooperation and the leadership of  advanced countries, including the United States, will be more  necessary.    The Situation of Northeast Asia    The factors of constant tension--including the enhanced  roles  of Japan and China, the regional arms race, the instability of  Russia, and the North Korean nuclear issue--exist in Northeast  Asia.    However, the relations among the four powers in the region,  which have been important in stabilizing the regional order,  will be improved. Accordingly the atmosphere for cooperation  among the four powers will be maintained.    In connection with the issue concerning security, it is  expected that U.S.-Chinese relations, Japanese-Chinese  relations, and U.S.-Japanese relations, which have become three  pivots in maintaining the Northeast Asian order since the end of  the Cold War, will be developed to promote cooperation.    In particular, because since September 1993, the United  States has strengthened cooperation with China, including the  revision of a hard-line policy against China and because China  has also positively promoted the improvement of its relations  the United States, there will be considerable progress in  U.S.-Chinese relations this year.    The Atmosphere for Cooperation Among the Four Powers Will Be  Maintained    Taking into consideration the roles of the United States and  China in Northeast Asia, the improvement of the relations  between the two countries will have a positive influence on the  stability of the regional situation.    It is expected that because of the settlement of the UR  negotiations and because of the agreement on establishing the  Trade and Investment Committee in the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC), economic exchange among the Northeastern  Asian countries will be further expanded.    However, because the United States may put more  market-opening pressure on regional countries which may enjoy  great economic booms, trade friction between the United States  and regional countries may take place.    It is expected that such an atmosphere in Northeast Asia  will  have a positive influence on the reunification environment  rather than a negative influence.    The development of relations among the four powers--United  States, Japan, China, and Russia--will contribute to resolving  North Korea's nuclear issue and establishing peace in the  region. The development of the relations among the four powers  will play a positive role in leading North Korea to open its  door.    The fact that the neighboring four powers are in favor of  maintaining the present situation on the Korean peninsula while  North Korea wants to resolve the issue concerning the Korean  peninsula, including the nuclear issue, through negotiations  with the United States rather than direct negotiations with the  ROK, may be a stumbling block to improving North-South relations.    North Korea's Inner Situation    Above all, it seems that in political domains, North Korea  will constantly intensify the unity around the leader [suryong]  and the implementation of the 10-point program of great unity of  the whole nation.    To consolidate the system for Kim Chong-il's power  succession, North Korea will constantly strengthen its  idolization work for Kim Chong-il. Accordingly, there is a  possibility that Kim Chong-il may be appointed chairman of the  party military commission.    Internally, as to the issue concerning the  agriculture-first, light industry-first, and trade-first  economic policies, North Korea may fully encourage farmers and  workers to invigorate the stagnant economy. Externally, North  Korea may promote a limited openness to induce foreign capital  and technology.    At the same time, it is expected that to minimize a bad  influence caused by the change of the neighboring environment,  North Korea may fully hold rallies of all kinds of social  organizations in a bid to strengthen internal social control.    The Strengthening of Internal Social Control    However, because of the influx of overseas information  through openness, social and economic deviation may be increased  gradually in North Korea.    In the meantime, it is expected that regardless of economic  stagnation, North Korea may adhere to a policy giving priority  to the Army to strengthen Kim Chong-il's authority.    North Korea's External Relations    Based on their traditional friendly relations, North Korea  and China will continue to strengthen political relations,  economic exchange and cooperation, and military exchange.  However, to promote sustained economic development, China may  seek to change benefactor-type relations based on ideology into  give-and-take cooperative relations.    North Korean-U.S. relations will depend upon the progress in  the negotiations over North Korea's nuclear issue. Taking into  consideration the two sides' will to avoid catastrophe, North  Korean-U.S. relations may be positively developed.    Accordingly, it seems that North Korea and the United States  may discuss the issue of enhancing the dialogue level according  to the holding of the third round of the North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks, the issue of promoting economic cooperation,  and the issue of expanding the exchange of people.    The rapid development of North Korean-Russian relations may  be difficult. However, according to Russia's policy based on  actual interest, the economic exchanges between the two  countries will be improved gradually. At the same time,  regardless of the readjustment of the military allied relations,  military exchange and cooperation will be maintained between  North Korea and Russia.    North Korean-Japanese relations will be improved politically  and economically both.    In particular, it seems that the North Korean-Japanese  negotiations to establish diplomatic relations, which have been  brought to a deadlock since the eighth round of the talks, will  be resumed. Accordingly, the economic exchange between the two  countries may become actually brisk.    North Korea's Strategy Toward the South    This year, there may be not a considerable change in North  Korea's strategy toward the South, including its existing policy  on the theory of excluding the South Korean Government and its  reunification tactics.    Accordingly, North Korea will denounce the South Korean  Government by using various propaganda means and will constantly  agitate the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification,  the National Alliance of Youths and Students for the Country's  Reunification, and the Alliance for the ROK Youths. However,  because the ROK movement circles have been weakened since the  civilian government was launched, because the United States and  Japan have put pressure on North Korea to resume North-South  dialogue, and because the neighboring environment has changed,  North Korea may attempt to change its tactics while adhering to  its basic strategy of revolutionizing the South.    In other words, as a tactic for holding the third round of  the North Korean-U.S. high-level talks, North Korea may propose  that ""the pannational council for forming a reunified state"" in  which the South Korean Government and other figures of all  strata participate be formed.    In addition, it is highly likely that as a tactic for  demonstrating its legitimacy, North Korea may propose that ""a  scholastic fact-finding team for King Tangun,"" in which the  South Korean Government figures and other figures from all  strata participate, be formed.    North-South Relations    Above all, it seems that even though a point of compromise  may be found through North Korea's acceptance of the ad hoc  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in  1994, the stage for ensuring the transparency of the nuclear  issue will not be reached.    Accordingly, it is highly likely that North Korea's nuclear  issue will be a stumbling block to improving North-South  relations this year.    As to North-South dialogue, various issues which have been  caused by the North Korean systems unrest, the nuclear issue,  and the North's hard-line policy toward the South, may make it  difficult to reach a point for North-South reconciliation.    In connection with North-South dialogue, in case North Korea  accepts the IAEA's inspections, the North and the South will  promote talks to exchange special envoys. However, taking into  consideration North Korea's pretentious dialogue strategy, it is  highly likely that in connection with the issue concerning the  exchange of special envoys, North Korea may avoid discussing  agenda related with nuclear issues, including North-South mutual  inspections.    In addition, even though North-South dialogue is resumed to  reopen the channel for North-South high-level talks and to  implement the North-South Basic Agreement, North Korea may avoid  implementing the basic agreement. This is because North Korea  has actually denied the channel for high-level talks through its  proposal for the exchange of special envoys and it is concerned  about the possibility of unrest caused by brisk exchange and  cooperation.    Accordingly, even if a point of compromise is smoothly  reached in North Korean-U.S. negotiations, the stage for fully  implementing the basic agreement may not be reached.    North-South economic exchange and cooperation will depend  upon the progress of the negotiations over the nuclear issue.  However, if North Korea assumes the attitude to accept nuclear  inspection, North-South economic exchange and cooperation will  be brisk.    Even if North-South economic exchange becomes brisk, taking  into consideration North Korea's lack of foreign currency and  the backwardness of its production capacity, the rapid  development of North-South economic cooperation may be  difficult. However, it is expected that if processing-for-wages  trade [imgagong kyoyok] smoothly develops, the North and the  South will launch a small-scale joint venture in the light  industry field at the Nampo industrial complex.    North-South social and cultural exchanges may be expanded  gradually. However, it is highly likely that North Korea may  avoid discussing and delaying the issue concerning separated  family members.     "

The SEF delegation will stay near Qiandao Lake for two days  [words indistinct] to Hangzhou Thursday. During their stay,  they will inspect the boat on which 24 Taiwan tourists and eight  mainlanders were robbed and murdered while on a lake cruise.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu Hui-yu, in summing up the  talks on the first day Monday, said only that he had to see  relevant exhibits before he could continue to discuss the matter  with ARATS authorities. He said that at the present stage, SEF  could only say it was trying to learn more about the incident.    SEF and ARATS are non-official conduits set up to conduct  cross- strait relations in the absence of official ties.    During the first day of talks on the crime, the mainland  maintained that only three suspects took part in the robbery and  murder and no members of the mainland military were involved.  The three attempted to blow up the ship after the killings, but  failed, the mainland said.    Ji Shaoyan, a Hangzhou coroner, insisted that no bullet or  other wounds were found on any one of the victims. He said that  all the victims suffocated from carbon monoxide poisoning when  explosives were thrown into a tiny 17-square-meter space on the  lower deck of the boat into which all the victims were herded at  guns' point earlier.    He said that some of the bodies were so badly burned that  the  heads fell off the bodies when the victims were removed from the  ship.    The SEF delegation, comprised of SEF officials,  criminologists, and representatives of the victims, posed more  than 200 questions surrounding the incident during the first day.    ARATS used a briefing, videotape, slides and question and  answer sessions to explain the incident.    Representatives of the victims were dismayed after hearing  the briefing and the videotape on the aftermath of Qiandao Lake  incident.    SEF Deputy Secretary-General Hsu also said that SEF was  disappointed after not being allowed to meet with witnesses and  suspects in the case.     "
0,FT933-1445 ,"FT933-1445 _AN-DIXCIAAQFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / VW apology for halting Skoda deal      By PATRICK BLUM      PRAGUE   VOLKSWAGEN, the German car manufacturer, yesterday apologised to the Czech government for its sudden cancellation of a DM1.4bn (Pounds 560m) financing package for Skoda, its Czech subsidiary, only hours before the deal was due to be signed in London last week. VW reaffirmed its commitment to expand and modernise production at Skoda and promised to increase the variety of cars to be produced at the Czech plant. 'Volkswagen expressed regrets over the embarrassment caused to Skoda's majority shareholder (the Czech government) by its last-minute decision made last week,' said a statement issued at the end of a three-hour meeting in Prague. The meeting was attended by Mr Ferdinand Piech, chairman of the VW management board, Mr Werner Schmidt, VW finance director, and Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, as well as Mr Tomas Jezek, chairman of the National Property Fund, which oversees privatisations. VW's decision to call off the loan at the last minute came as a shock in Prague. Only a day before the announcement, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the prime minister, had welcomed the planned financing, which was to be guaranteed by the Czech government. VW said the financing package was no longer necessary because productivity improvements at Skoda meant investment requirements would be considerably lower than initially planned. The VW group is undertaking a fundamental review of its capital spending plans and is expected to announce further far-reaching cuts in November after a meeting of its supervisory board. VW took a 31 per cent share in Skoda in 1991 and is due to raise its holding to 70 per cent by 1996. It had previously announced plans to invest DM7bn over 10 years, but this figure is now expected to be reduced significantly. It has planned to more than double Skoda's production capacity to more than 400,000 cars a year, modern-ising its facilities and expanding products with the introduction of a second car range. The cancellation of the loan increased fears in Prague that VW was reducing its commitment to the venture. Relations between the Czech government and the German carmaker had soured recently following a dispute caused by Skoda's decision to increase sharply the prices of its cars, and Czech concerns that VW was no longer interested in developing a local nework of suppliers. Neither issue was discussed at yesterday's meeting.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.     Skoda Automobilova.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     CZZ  Czech Republic, East Europe.

In the first official government reaction to the March 31  disaster that caused an outcry in Taiwan amid accusations of  foul play, the foreign ministry pledged that the findings of the  investigation would be made public as soon as possible.    Chinese media reports have so far insisted that the boat  fire  on Qiandao Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang was  accidental, despite charges from relatives of the Taiwan victims  that arson and robbery were the motive.    ""The departments concerned are combining their efforts to  deal with the aftermath of the incident, making further  investigations into its cause and trying to find out the truth  and make it public as soon as possible,"" a foreign ministry  spokesman said. ""We do not wish to see a repetition of this  tragedy.""    Taiwan has strongly criticised China's handling of the  incident, especially the decision to cremate the bodies before  they could be returned to Taiwan and their refusal to let  relatives near the boat.    The Taiwan cabinet on Wednesday suspended sightseeing tours  to China effective May 1, following on an earlier decision to  suspend all cultural and educational exchanges and threats of  sweeping economic reprisals.    The government in Taipei, driven off the mainland after  losing a civil war to the Chinese communists in 1949, has banned  direct, political contacts with China, but permitted private,  non-political and indirect exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.    Tang Shubei, vice president of the China's semi-official  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS)  warned Taiwan on Wednesday against using the boat disaster as an  excuse to impede exchanges between the mainland and the  Nationalist island.    The foreign ministry also sought to reassure foreign  tourists  who might be wary of travelling in China in the wake of the  incident.    ""All tourist departments are carrying out overall safety  checks and putting into practise all kinds of measures to ensure  the safety of tourists,"" the spokesman said. ""We believe that  foreign tourists travelling in China should not and will not be  affected by individual incidents.""     "

Juan Fleites, director of Cupet, which is negotiating a  joint  venture for the plant with its Mexican counterpart, Mex-Petrol,  told NOTIMEX the following: ""Should we reach an agreement on the  refinery, we could start receiving Mexican crude oil.""    Since March, Cupet and Mex-Petrol have been studying  alternatives to extending and modernizing the Cienfuegos  refinery, the country's largest refinery, located on the  south-central coast.    Yesterday, Carlos Ferrer Argote, Mexican Foreign Relations  Secretariat Caribbean affairs director, said the negotiations  could include the supply of crude oil. He added: ""Both parties  are working to yield results in the best of interests. We are  trying to conclude as soon as possible, but it is difficult to  conduct studies.""    The lack of oil and the shortage of spare parts for its  Soviet-made infrastructure are keeping the refinery, which can  refine 3 million tons annually, almost halted.    Cuba is also negotiating with Colombia the supply of oil to  offset the fuel deficit that emerged from the drop of purchases  from the defunct Soviet Union. The purchases dropped from 13  million tons to less than half that amount between 1991 and  1992. According to the agreement, Cupet and Mex-Petrol will  invest $200 million to start production at the extended and  modernized plant, to supply the domestic market, and to export  surpluses.    Ferrer, who was in Merida, Yucatan State, attending the 19th  Caribbean Studies Association Congress, pointed out exports  could be sold to countries in the region. He also said the  Cuban-Mexican study is analyzing ""an ample spectrum of crude  oils, from the lightest to the heaviest, to match the quality of  supply to the prices of hydrocarbons and their byproducts.""    Cupet's director confirmed the project has already  determined  its investment strategy: Each party will invest $100 million,  half the total investment. The Mexican contribution will be as  follows: 50 percent in resources and 50 percent in joint venture  assets, which will be charged to the Cuban debt. The Cuban and  Mexican central banks have an agreement that, among other  issues, allows the settling of the $310 million Cuban debt  through ""swap"" [previous word in English] operations.     "

Bank loans which went to science and technology sectors  increased from merely 15 million yuan in 1984 to 6.3 billion  yuan in 1993, according to a conference sponsored by the China  Commission for the Promotion of Relations Between Science and  Technology and Banking, which was held yesterday in Nanning,  capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.    At present, only about 15-20 percent of the scientific and  technological achievements in China can be put into practical  use, due to the lack of necessary funds, according to the  meeting.    However, banking services related to science and technology  undertakings have been developing rapidly over the past few  years since the People's Bank of China initiated a science and  technology loans project and various professional banks started  similar services.    Banks have become another accelerator for the development of  science and technology following state budgets and funds raised  by enterprises on their own.    In 1984, the Bank of Industry and Commerce and the Bank of  Agriculture took the lead in granting loans to the development  of science and technology, which reached 15 million yuan for the  year.    The figure reached 6.3 billion yuan in 1993 when the  country's finances were in disorder for a time. Of the loans,  1.2 billion yuan went to the ""Spark Program"" in favor of local  economic development, 1.7 billion yuan went to the ""Torch Plan""  in support of the development of high- and new-technology  projects, and 900 million yuan went to a program which is aimed  at the promotion of new technologies among traditional  enterprises.    The other funds went to research programs on the application  of military technology to civil use, application of achievements  of research institutes, exploration of resources, environmental  protection and the development of new medicines.    Under the coordination and support of the People's Bank of  China, professional banks have developed the services for nearly  a decade and have achieved great economic gains.    Statistics from Shenyang, a major industrial city in  north-east China's Liaoning Province, show that high and new  technologies contributed to about 31 percent of the output value  yielded by the enterprises in the city last year, largely  because of support from bank loans.

Villar Anleu, who represents the northern Quiche Department  and is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, won the  support of 70 of the 91 deputies who attended the regular  evening session of Congress.    The Guatemalan Christian Democracy [DCG], the Solidarity  Action Movement [MAS], dissidents of the Union of the National  Center [UNC], the Guatemalan Republican Front [FRG], and  minority parties supported Villar's slate, made up of three vice  presidents and eight secretaries.    DCG Secretary Alfonso Cabrera and Deputy Obdulio Chinchilla  Vega, who returned to his seat on 12 January after losing an eye  in an attack in May 1993, headed the negotiations to draw up  Villar's slate.    Villar, who was head of the DCG bloc last year, ran against  the slate headed by Carlos Perez Castaneda and made up of UCN  and FRG candidates, which received the remaining 21 votes.    Neither the 12 deputies of the National Vanguard Party (PAN)  who had resigned nor their alternates attended the regular  session headed by Lobo Dubon.    Villar will be sworn in on 14 January by Lobo Dubon, who  acknowledged Villar's victory on 12 January at a solemn session.  One of Villar's first tasks will be to listen to the government  report that President Ramiro De Leon Carpio will present on 15  January.    This directorate will not complete its one-year term as  established by the Constitution because if the yes vote wins in  the 30 January referendum, Guatemalans will elect a new Congress  this year.    The Congress Directorate is composed as follows:    President: Marco Vinicio Villar (DCG)    First Vice President: Jorge Alberto Monroy (formerly of UCN)    Second Vice President: Marco Tulio Merida (MAS)    Third Vice President: Juan Francisco Alfaro (formerly of  UCN)    First Secretary: Clodoveo Dominguez (DCG)    Second Secretary: Eduardo Mendez Pinelo (formerly of UCN)    Third Secretary: Francisco Reyes Ixcamey (formerly of  FRG)    Fourth Secretary: Rafael Oliveros Ramirez (MAS)    Fifth Secretary: Edna de Ruano (formerly of UCN)    Sixth Secretary: Felipe Franco Trujillo (MAS)    Seventh Secretary: Pedro Gomez Chavez (formerly of UCN)    Eighth Secretary: Jose Aguirre Quinteros (PID)  [Democratic    Institutional Party]     "

We ordinary mortals do not know that lawyers entertain in  all  earnestness a concept which acknowledges that enterprise and  crime are indissolubly linked and that it is time to introduce a  moratorium on the struggle against economic crime. What are the  arguments for this? OK. It is impossible to accumulate  original capital honestly -- that is self-evident. So, a  moratorium must be introduced. When criminal businessmen steal,  pardon me, accumulate quite a lot of money, they start investing  it in legal business, thus helping out society by producing  goods, creating jobs, and so on.    Nonsense? Nothing of the sort. This concept has not emerged  from nothing and it has quite a few supporters. Admittedly,  there are also other professors who think that you can avoid  bloodshed, racketeering, and thievery when accumulating capital,  but this group is clearly in the minority.    Life regrettably confirms that the first group of scientists  are correct. M. Yegorov, Russian first deputy minister of  internal affairs, said that over 40,000 state and commercial  enterprises belong to criminal groupings. These groupings,  using counterfeit advice slips and other methods, have effected  financial operations worth over 1 trillion rubles.    Typically these bigwigs have little scope for crime and they  are making vigorous inroads into politics, but this kind of  fusion of criminals and corrupt politicians is very dangerous.  The strangest thing is that Russia still does not have clear  laws to help distinguish between honest and criminal business.    Criminal groupings are dividing up spheres of influence at  full speed -- from below -- but at the very top a completely new  trend has emerged: the creation of powerful organizations with  leadership at oblast, kray, or even regional level.    In this situation the largest commercial structures must set  up their own security services, but they still cannot do without  the militia. And many people realize that. At any rate  businessmen's mistrust of internal affairs organs is gradually  subsiding. Today the Ministry of Internal Affairs is willing to  guard banks and offices and transport money and securities, as  well as ensure personal security. I am of course only talking  about honest business. It may nonetheless exist....     "

Balaguer led the closing session of the conference, which  began on 22 April in the capital city's convention center. The  conference was attended by 215 Cubans currently living in 29  countries around the world who responded to an invitation from  the Cuban Foreign Ministry.    The meeting was private. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina announced yesterday several agreements as the  preliminary results of the conference. Vice President Carlos  Lage today announced that there is now a better understanding,  between Cubans living both on and off the island.    According to Miguel Alfonso, spokesperson for the  conference,  the five-year waiting perod required of Cubans who left the  island legally in order to be allowed to visit the country was  eliminated. It will no longer be mandatory for emigres visiting  their relatives in Cuba to make reservations at a hotel, either.  Other changes will allow Cubans and their children living  abroad to study on the island if they pay the established  tuition and fees. The study will look into the possibility of  publishing a magazine directed at Cuban emigres.    The emigrants also proposed the creation of an emigrant visa  and a more expeditious procedure for traveling to their country  of origin for humanitarian reasons.    From now on the Foreign Relations Ministry will have the new  task of coordinating the work of all Cuban institutions  regarding emigration in order to ensure a systematic, efficient,  and harmonious process.    In addition, Lage confirmed that the emigrants will not be  excluded from investing in the island, although he said the  specific details and types of investment will be discussed at  future meetings.    In addressing the plenum, the vice president of the Cuban  Council of State said that, in general, foreign investment  regulations will be applied in such cases as established by  current legislation.

The agreement includes  the exchange of teachers, researchers, and students between  universities and institutes of the two countries, to expedite  the training process in the areas of greatest scientific  interest.    The Cuban mission, which was made up of Higher Education  Minister Fernando Vecino Alegret, Higher Education Vice Minister  Miguel Garrido, International Relations Director Fernando Rojas  Avallos, and Matanzas University Rector Angel Vega, visited  several Brazilian universities in the Brasilia Federal District,  and in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao  Paulo, to identify areas and possibilities for cooperation.    In the state of Sao Paulo, the mission's visit was  coordinated by Roberto Muller Filho, secretary of science,  technology, and economic development. Muller accepted the entry  of 10 Cuban scientists as visiting professors to carry out  research at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo State  University (UNESP), and Campinas State University (Unicamp).  The agreement also includes scholarships for Cuban students in  Sao Paulo universities for masters degrees and Ph.D.'s, as well  as for Brazilian professors from Sao Paulo agricultural  technical schools to be trained in Cuba.    The main areas of knowledge for exchange are: molecular  biology, civil construction materials, immunology, agriculture  and livestock, health, education, physics, genetics, biology,  energy, and biotechnology. Vecino said: ""The main purpose of  the scientific exchange with Brazil is to strengthen the  postgraduate studies of Cuban professors.""    He explained that Cuba has 46 universities with 24,000  professors, of whom only 20 percent have doctorates. He added:  ""The goal is that at least 50 percent of that amount get their  doctorates.""    The Sao Paulo Science and Technology Secretariat will  provide  additional funds, along with the Sao Paulo Federation to Support  Research (Fapesp), to finance the scholarships for the  researchers and postgraduate students. Muller reported that the  program will start with the arrival of 10 Cuban scientists to  carry out joint research, who will get about $1,500 per month.    Cuban Minister Vecino also visited the Sao Paulo State  Federation of Industries (FIESP) to evaluate the possibility of  the transfer of business technology through associations.    As a result of the visit to the FIESP, a business delegation  will visit Cuba in the first half of this year to identify the  areas of interest.     "

0,FT943-4579 ,"FT943-4579 _AN-EIHDIACRFT 940908   FT  08 SEP 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Getting the measure of PR - Claims that public relations cannot be evaluated are increasingly questioned      By VANESSA HOULDER   Ever since public relations emerged as a discipline in its own right, the industry has been struggling to prove its effectiveness and professionalism. But attempts to evaluate PR are often hampered by the belief that its methods are too subtle and results too intangible to be measured. The view that PR was too 'creative and intuitive' to be evaluated was long held by Shirley Horn, UK director of corporate communications at Hewlett-Packard, the computer manufacturer. Until three years ago, the nearest she came to measuring the effectiveness of her work was 'eyeballing the size of the clippings binder'. But in 1991 she was sent, under duress, on a three-day course about total quality management. It convinced her that PR was a process that could be evaluated like other disciplines. 'I emerged on a soapbox,' she says. 'Since then, we have been successfully applying total quality management methodology to PR processes - documenting, measuring and continuously improving the effectiveness of each process.' She now measures everything from the correlation between coverage and the speed of response to journalists' telephone calls, to the number of thank-you letters written by dinner guests. Horn's belief that PR can be usefully evaluated is increasingly widely shared. 'This is the age of 'if you can't measure it, don't do it',' says Sandra Macleod, managing director, Europe, of Carma International, a media evaluation service. It is one of more than a dozen media evaluation services recently established in the UK which quantify trends in media attitudes to various issues and messages affecting a company. Part of the value of media assessment to a PR department is that it helps underpin the case for a particular budget. Jane Drew, a public affairs manager at American Express, finds that using the Carma evaluation system helps demonstrate to senior management the effectiveness of PR campaigns. 'We find it useful because PR is not taken as seriously as marketing or finance,' she says. Evaluation reports can also suggest ways to improve a PR campaign. Bass, the brewing company, uses the Impact system developed by Infopress, a PR consultancy, to keep track of messages concerning matters such as quality, innovation, tradition and management. If the tracking studies show that a message such as 'Bass offers quality brands' is being expressed less frequently in the press, the company will try to remedy the trend by, say, making extra efforts to publicise awards won by its beers, says Lesley Allman, external communications manager. Evaluation reports may persuade companies to drop a campaign. For instance, a drive by Philip Morris to counter criticism about the impact of tobacco on health was found to be fruitless. Other benefits of evaluation reports include identifying journalists who have been particularly favourable or hostile towards a company. PR departments may also be able to assuage the wrath of a chief executive incensed by a negative article, by demonstrating that overall coverage of the company is becoming more positive. Conversely, a critical press can sometimes alert a company to an area of weak performance. But not everyone believes that media evaluation techniques are a satisfactory measure of PR's effectiveness. One inevitable problem is that PR managers have no direct control over the results of their efforts in the media. Moreover, it may be hard to disentangle the impact of a public relations programme from that of other marketing exercises, such as direct mail, promotions or sponsorship. Another problem is that media response to a PR campaign is not the full story. The ultimate purpose of most PR campaigns is to influence consumers, or target groups such as shareholders or parliamentarians. The impact of the campaign may need to be monitored by using survey research, setting up focus groups, keeping track of share price movements and measuring sales. PR evaluation also does not weigh success in limiting press criticism after a damaging news story has emerged. Admittedly, companies that continually attract negative comment can measure the performance of their PR departments by keeping track of the volume of negative messages in the coverage. The department can also measure its success in tempering the bad news with some positive messages. But most commentators agree that the greatest obstacle to PR evaluation is cost. Although it may be reasonable to justify spending Pounds 10,000 to evaluate the effectiveness of a PR budget of, say Pounds 250,000, the cost of evaluation represents a large proportion of a small budget, unless research is carried out in-house. There is a distinct lack of enthusiasm on the part of PR consultancies and their clients to find the extra cash to evaluate their campaigns. Quentin Bell, president of the UK Public Relations Consultants Association, recently dropped an attempt to introduce a standard evaluation tool for the PRCA's members because of the lack of support for the move from clients and consultancies. Jon White, a visiting professor of public affairs at City University, believes that the need of PR practitioners to evaluate activities is 'partly a matter of professional insecurity'. He points out that PR is not alone in experiencing difficulties with measurement and evaluation, which present problems in all areas of management. The point is echoed by Mike Beard, president of the Institute of Public Relations, who argues that other disciplines such as finance, human resources, law and marketing rarely have standard evaluation systems. 'Other professions are not obsessed by the issue, nor should we be,' he says. Yet the absence of an industry-wide measurement technique is regretted by many people who believe that PR needs to improve its professionalism. 'It would make the industry more quality-oriented if it allowed itself to be subject to evaluation,' says Dermot McKeone, deputy chairman of Infopress. Quentin Bell goes further. It is crucial that PR demonstrates its effectiveness, he argues. 'Unless we can get clients to insist on evaluation, there will not be a PR consultancy business in 25 years' time.'

0,FT911-1249 ,"FT911-1249 _AN-BEGBDAEBFT 910507   FT  07 MAY 91 / Pretoria may return land to blacks      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   THE South African govern-ment appears ready to restore land to some of the 3.5m blacks forcibly removed under apartheid, reversing an earlier decision to reject all claims for restoration. In an interview in today's Financial Times survey of South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk makes clear that his government is willing to moderate its tough line on the land issue, which has been criticised by anti-apartheid groups and foreign governments. This appears to be part of the government's attempt to create a climate conducive to constitutional negotiations at a time of rising political tensions. The African National Congress has said it will boycott talks unless the government takes steps by Thursday to end violence which has left more than 150 people dead in the past week. Relations between the ANC and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party further deteriorated during the weekend amid further killings - six people died in a bus ambush in Tembisa township, north of Johannesburg yesterday - and an Inkatha threat, later denied by Chief Buthelezi, to deploy 250,000 armed warriors in black townships around Johannesburg. Mr de Klerk's policy shift follows the publication in March of a white paper which said that it 'would not be feasible' to restore land to victims of forced removals. The victims referred to are families evicted from their homes during the past 30 years as part of Pretoria's policy of confining all blacks to separate homelands. In the interview, which was conducted three weeks ago but was under embargo until today, Mr de Klerk stresses that the government is 'not . . . unapproachable' on the issue of restitution. 'Government's general approach to this issue is to address the cases concerned with sympathy and reasonableness.' It is understood that the government has agreed to set up a land commission to advise on claims resulting from apartheid removals. It is also understood that some of the legislation tabled as part of a land reform package will be withdrawn for further discussion. The government will go ahead, however, with a bill abolishing the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation, and the 1913 and 1936 Land Acts, which prevented blacks from owning more than 13 per cent of South Africa.

In an exclusive interview with the MENA correspondent in  Ankara dealing with his visit to Egypt, which will begin  tomorrow, Saturday [7 May], the Turkish president said that the  resources of Egypt and Turkey could together contribute to  establishing peace and stability in the Middle East.    Demirel added that he agreed with President Mubarak to  eliminate all barriers and protocols and to meet at any time.  They also agreed to stay in continuous contact to negotiate  various bilateral and international issues of mutual interest.    President Demirel said that both he and President Mubarak  realize their important responsibilities since Egypt and Turkey  have so much influence on the course of events in the Middle  East and can preserve security and stability in the region.    He added that if Egypt is considered a gateway to Africa,  Turkey is considered a gateway to the Islamic republics in  Central Asia, the Caucasus, and Europe.    In his speech, Demirel praised President Husni Mubarak's  wisdom in overcoming the problem that emerged during the  ceremony held in Cairo on Wednesday to sign the Israeli-PLO  Agreement.    He clarified that he telephoned President Mubarak to  congratulate him on his wisdom, which saved the agreement from  collapse before it even started.    President Demirel said that we consider the agreement signed  by Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo an important step in  establishing peace. We believe it will pave the way for and  open the door to the aspired for peace.    The Turkish president said in his interview with the MENA  correspondent in Ankara that when peace is established in the  Middle East we can then benefit from the large potential in the  region.    Demirel added that after the former Soviet Union collapsed,  the independent Islamic republics emerged, which Egypt and  Turkey are cooperating with in various social, cultural, and  economic fields to serve them.    Answering a question on the Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi economic  cooperation, Demirel said that the Israeli-PLO agreement, which  was signed on Wednesday in Cairo, will make it easy to realize  this cooperation. In this regard, he affirmed that Egypt and  Turkey have very good relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.    On the Turkish role in the Middle East peace process,  President Demirel said that Turkey has very good relations with  Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Israel.    He added that relations with Israel were limited until Egypt  and Israel signed the peace treaty that opened the door to  Turkey to develop relations with Israel.    The Turkish president said that contacts between his country  and Israel continue. He pointed out that it is possible during  the coming stage to establish peace agreements between Israel  and Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon.    On the Turkish stance regarding the idea of a Middle East  common market, President Demirel said that he believes such a  market can be established in time. However, he noted that a  common market requires certain developments in the region, such  as the return of Iraq to the international community.    He said that Iraq's return to the international community is  not Turkey's idea alone, but that some leaders of Islamic  countries share it.    Demirel affirmed that Iraq's return to the international  community as soon as possible could open the opportunity of  launching the concept of the Middle Eastern market. However, he  said that he does not know how Iraq's return should be handled.    On the international sanctions imposed on Iraq, the Turkish  president said these sanctions have not affected the Iraqi  Government or Iraqi President Saddam Husayn but the Iraqi  people, who are suffering from the shortage of their basic needs  of medicine and food. He added that Turkey has also suffered as  a result of these sanctions, noting that its losses since the  outbreak of the Gulf War have reached approximately $20 billion.    Asked about the differences between Ankara and Washington  over the repair of the Iraqi oil pipeline passing through  Turkey, President Demirel said his country is losing  approximately $4 billion annually as a result of the closure of  this pipeline. For this reason Turkey calls for the economic  blockade of Iraq to be lifted as a way of overcoming Turkey's  economic problems. He explained that the nonuse of the Iraqi  pipeline for an extended amount of time will damage it. He said  he is confident that in the next few days officials in  Washington will realize the need for carrying out maintenance  work on this pipeline.    Regarding the water problem, President Demirel explained  that  the Euphrates River also passes through Syria and Iraq. He said  Turkey is building 12 dams on the river to regulate its water  flow. He said his country has not yet begun the full  exploitation of these waters for generating electricity or for  agriculture. He said he hopes that Turkey will begin  exploiting these waters for generating electricity after these  dams are completed. He stressed that Turkey has no intention of  depriving neighboring countries of water.    Regarding the differences between Turkey and Greece, Demirel  accused Greece of providing shelter for the supporters of the  banned Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK].    He said Turkey does not object to a solution of the Cyprus  problem provided it is not an imposed solution. This is because  there are at least 150,000 Muslim citizens in the Turkish sector  of Cyprus while the Greek community lives in the other sector.  He added that an imposed solution on either party will not be  permanent and comprehensive. Therefore, there is a need for  dialogue.    Regarding the political solution proposed by some European  countries for the problem in southeast Turkey, President  Demirel condemned all acts of terrorism, describing them as a  human crime abhorred by religion and society. He said Turkey  cannot hold a dialogue with a terrorist band or organization  that kills innocent civilians. He added that no political  solution can be reached with a terrorist organization under any  pressure because the PKK uses terrorism. He said we will not  negotiate with terrorists and will not compromise on Turkey's  territorial unity.    On Turkey's role in solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem,  Demirel said Turkey has offered all it can in terms of aid and  contacts with Bosnian officials to reach a solution to this  crisis.    On the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Demirel said  Armenia continually commits aggression on Azerbaijani territory.  He called for a halt to these aggressive acts. He added that  Turkey gives every kind of aid to Azerbaijan to repulse these  attacks.     "

The money, which the Democrats suggested could be funded by further cuts in the  defense budget, would be added to a $738-million aid package approved last  November for Poland and Hungary.

The legislation, which calls for $211 million more than the Administration  requested for Eastern Europe in the budget it submitted to Congress on Monday,  logically would be financed by the so-called ""peace divided,"" Sen. Paul Simon  (D-Ill.) said.    ""We have spent something like 2 or 3 trillion dollars on defense since World  War II to protect us from the military threat posed by Eastern Europe,"" Simon  said.    ""Now that this threat has diminished, it is extremely important for the  security of this nation that we gamble on freedom in Eastern Europe.""    Pell's proposal would use the largest portion of the aid, $250 million, to fund  U.S. participation in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  being established to help East Bloc countries move toward democracy.    Another $80 million is earmarked for emergency food aid for Romania while $43  million would be used to promote the development of non-communist political  parties in several East Bloc states. A portion of that latter amount -- $10  million -- would be distributed as soon as the bill becomes law in order to  help emerging political parties prepare for upcoming elections in their  countries.    Pell described the bill, which would also liberalize trade restrictions and  provide non-economic forms of assistance such as management training to the  Soviet Union, as a ""modest start"" in addressing the profound political changes  and growing economic needs of Eastern Europe. He predicted that the amount  being proposed may well increase as the bill winds its way through Congress ""in  view of the profound interest"" that lawmakers share in ""supporting positive  developments in Eastern Europe.""

The legislation, which calls for $211 million more than the Administration  requested for Eastern Europe in the budget it submitted to Congress on Monday,  logically would be financed by the so-called ""peace divided,"" Sen. Paul Simon  (D-Ill.) said.    ""We have spent something like 2 or 3 trillion dollars on defense since World  War II to protect us from the military threat posed by Eastern Europe,"" Simon  said.    ""Now that this threat has diminished, it is extremely important for the  security of this nation that we gamble on freedom in Eastern Europe.""    Pell's proposal would use the largest portion of the aid, $250 million, to fund  U.S. participation in the new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  being established to help East Bloc countries move toward democracy.    Another $80 million is earmarked for emergency food aid for Romania while $43  million would be used to promote the development of non-communist political  parties in several East Bloc states. A portion of that latter amount -- $10  million -- would be distributed as soon as the bill becomes law in order to  help emerging political parties prepare for upcoming elections in their  countries.    Pell described the bill, which would also liberalize trade restrictions and  provide non-economic forms of assistance such as management training to the  Soviet Union, as a ""modest start"" in addressing the profound political changes  and growing economic needs of Eastern Europe. He predicted that the amount  being proposed may well increase as the bill winds its way through Congress ""in  view of the profound interest"" that lawmakers share in ""supporting positive  developments in Eastern Europe.""

Interviewed by the Colombian radio network RCN, Lage noted  that the decision when and if to visit Cuba is up to Gaviria.  Lage also stressed the open dialogue between the countries that  began during President Fidel Castro's visit to Cartagena last  August.    He added that the fundamental purpose of his visit, as was  that of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina in December, is to  further dialogue and the exploration of possibilities to  increase economic, commercial, and political ties that began  when diplomatic relations were resumed in October.    Lage has met with the ministers of foreign commerce and  agriculture and livestock and with the planning chief. He also  held a long meeting with President Gaviria, the most important  aspect of which, in Lage's opinion, was the frankness of the  analysis of bilateral relations, the current situation, and  problems between the two countries.    In his conversation with RCN and statements published today  by the daily EL ESPECTADOR, the Cuban leader recapped the  different economic measures his government has adopted,  including opening to foreign investment, and said all measures  necessary to defend socialism will be adopted.    Lage said tourism and the pharmaceutical industry have  prompted great interest on the part of Colombian businessmen,  with whom he held broad discussions today during a meeting  organized by the Industrialists Association and attended by the  major economic groups.    When asked about the illegal departure of Cubans from the  island, Lage replied that his country's policy is to allow  emigration and that anyone who wishes to leave can obtain a  visa. The United States, on the other hand, denies visas but  then accepts and grants immediate residence to anyone who  arrives illegally in that country.    Lage also noted that the majority of people support the  revolutionary system, which could not continue without this  support. In replying to another question, he said that Cuba is  the most drug-free country in the world, since it has no  narcotics, corruption, or organized crime. Lage will conclude  his visit today as the last leg of a tour that included Brazil  and Venezuelan.     "
0,FT943-1555 ,"FT943-1555 _AN-EIWEEAEHFT 940923   FT  23 SEP 94 / Piech set to oust VW finance director      By CHRISTOPHER PARKES      FRANKFURT   Volkswagen's finance director, Mr Werner Schmidt, is expected to be ousted shortly as a consequence of last year's near collapse of the group's Spanish subsidiary, Seat. Mr Ferdinand Piech, VW chairman, is understood to be seeking backing for his removal from key members of the company's non-executive supervisory board which will be asked to decide on the issue on November 25. While he can expect to garner a simple majority in favour of replacing Mr Schmidt from among his political and workforce allies on the board, he is believed to be taking pains to persuade members representing the Deutsche and Dresdner banks that Mr Schmidt, 62, should go at the end of this year. Relations between the two men have been poor since Mr Piech's appointment in January 1993. However, the chairman's determination to unseat Mr Schmidt has hardened recently following completion of a secret auditor's report on the circumstances surrounding last year's unexpected DM1.4bn (Pounds 574m) loss at Seat. Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, chairman, was fired last autumn, and the rest of the top management has since been replaced. Mr Schmidt was chairman of the Spanish company's supervisory board at the time, although there has not been any suggestion so far that he was any more aware of Seat's straits than Mr Piech. Shortly after details of the debacle emerged, Mr Piech remarked that earlier, much-lower estimates of the deficit from Seat's management board amounted to 'misinformation', which, in his view, was 'a crime with penal consequences'. It is believed, however, that further action is unlikely, especially since the situation at Seat is still not resolved, and labour unrest and other pressing problems are building up elsewhere within the group. A controversial Spanish government subsidy of Dollars 308m (Pounds 195m), officially earmarked for Seat's research and development budget, remains unpaid while the European Commission competition authorities examine its legality. Labour unrest is fermenting at the Czech subsidiary, Skoda, where the group wants to cut 800 jobs. VW has responded to a strike in its Brussels factory by transferring some the plant's production to Germany. At home, VW wants to reduce the workforce at its Emden factory, main source of the Passat range, by 30 per cent. Meanwhile, the plant has been given the job of repairing or replacing 9,000 faulty gearboxes discovered in the new generation VW Polo, due to go on sale next month.   Companies:-  Volkswagen.

Relations between Bratislava and Budapest have been  characterised thus far by Slovakia's apprehensions concerning  the unwillingness of Budapest to endorse the current  Slovak-Hungarian borders officially in the as yet non-existent  treaty between the two countries. Hungary's complaints about the  position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia, a dispute  over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube and minor  controversies over the unwillingness of Hungary to conclude a  readmission agreement or open new border crossings are among  other disputed issues, Weiss said.    ""However, the problems between Hungary and Slovakia are not  as dramatic as they are sometimes made out to be. We do not see  the situation as a conflict,"" Weiss said. He accused the former  Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar and the current  Hungarian cabinet of attempting to win points in the internal  political scene ""by excessively dramatising Hungarian-Slovak  problems and putting the blame on each other.""    ""If the French and the Germans have managed to reconcile,  then Hungarians and Slovaks can also come to terms,"" he said.  Weiss pointed to the fact that the SDL and the Hungarian  Socialist Party of Gyula Horn, a favourite of the forthcoming  Hungarian elections, are ready to conclude a basic inter-state  treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of the common border and  rights to ethnic minorities in both countries.    Weiss stressed, however, that his will to historic  reconciliation with Budapest has its limits -- all speculations  about territorial autonomy for the Hungarian ethnic minority in  Slovakia are unacceptable to us since they simply will not pass  in Slovakia.    Regarding Slovakia's relations with the Czech Republic,  Weiss  said they required primarily a matter-of-fact approach. Weiss,  who is considered a possible candidate for Slovak future  premier, further said:    ""We consider relations with the Czech Republic to be of a  key  importance. We want to proceed from all the positive steps  achieved during the 74 years of our co-existence. Naturally the  two countries are currently independent and have their own  interests which they want to protect. But these interests  should be pursued and protected on the basis of an expert and a  matter-of-fact dialogue.""     "

In Mr. Davydov's opinion, most  noteworthy was the attention that Western politicians and  businessmen devoted to the idea of adjustments in Russian  reforms: The need to ""humanize"" them was brought up in Davos  repeatedly. There were also promises to help Russia solve its  social problems, to grant its credits, and to establish socially  oriented funds for this purpose. The forum's participants  stressed the importance of continued reform, saying that the  pace of the process is not that important.    Mr. Davydov noted that the forum's participants basically  discussed issues of reform theory on the first day. After very  lengthy discussions and attempts to arrive at the best  definition for the concept of ""reform,"" they arrived at a common  view: Economic reform has at least three essential components:  liberalization of prices and foreign trade, privatization, and  efforts to combat inflation.    But Mr. Davydov saw nothing fundamentally new in the Western  experts' discussion of economic reforms in Russia. Much more  interesting, in his opinion, was the attention devoted at the  forum to the social factor of reforms. Most of the speakers  called attention to the fact that the changes under way in  Russia are psychologically and physically difficult for the  majority of the population. The conclusion was that it is  essential to ease reform time tables and methods. There were  also proposals for earmarking several special Western funds and  credits for social programs. Mr. Davydov said that such Western  steps are attributable primarily to the West's fear of the  ""Zhirinovskiy factor."" It was said repeatedly at the forum that  this factor ""will manifest itself increasingly distinctly as the  social situation of Russian citizens worsens"" and that a return  ""back onto the road of democracy will be far more costly.""    And so the impatience and interest with which the  participants awaited the Russian prime minister's speech was not  surprising. In the minister's opinion, Viktor Chernomyrdin  succeeded in reassuring his audience. But particular attention  was paid not to his statements about continuing and deepening  reforms, but to the prime minister's support for the idea of a  tough state financial policy to control inflation.

Angelopoulos focuses on the U.S. recognition of The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM]. It is difficult to  believe that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and the Ministry  of Foreign Affairs failed to understand the U.S. diplomatic  language in recent months and were surprised when Washington  established diplomatic relations with Skopje, Angelopoulos  contends. It is equally difficult to accept that U.S. policy  could suddenly change in a few days. The United States ""never  promised Athens anything,"" he continues, and the only element in  doubt was the timing of the formal recognition, which had been  rumored in Athens diplomatic circles to occur ""within a matter  of weeks at most."" The Papandreou government's 18 February  statement that the U.S. State Department had assured Athens on 1  February that recognition would not take place is a ""timid""  attempt at projecting an image of a Greek Government ""deceived""  by U.S. diplomacy and ""fails to convince anyone,"" Angelopoulos  asserts.    The ""Athens-Washington big love-in"" has surely been  interrupted, Angelopoulos continues, for U.S. positions on the  FYROM issue are ""clearly aggressive toward and critical of  Greece."" Despite official attempts by U.S. Ambassador Thomas  Niles to preserve good relations between the two countries, a  large segment of the Greek population believes the United States  is responsible for recent developments. However, Papandreou does  not want relations to worsen in view of his scheduled April  visit to the United States. Meanwhile, there are good reasons to  think that following the ""break"" caused by Papandreou's  announcement of the embargo against FYROM, initiatives aimed at  an Athens-Skopje dialogue will ""fatefully"" emerge, perhaps  leading to lifting the Greek embargo, as the Americans are  requesting, Angelopoulos notes. While this is the most  optimistic scenario, developments related to other Balkan  problems may still complicate matters for a Greek foreign policy  ""not noted for long-term, cool-headed planning,"" as well as for  Greece's European Union partners and Washington diplmats, whose  Balkan policies have thus far ""lacked accuracy and stability,""  Angelopoulos concludes.    The issue of U.S.-Greek relations is also discussed by  Alexis  Papakhelas, I KATHIMERINI's Washington correspondent, in the 20  February issue of the newspaper. Papakhelas concludes that  Greece can no longer expect from the United States a positive  attitude in the FYROM issue for the following reasons:    l. As good as President Clinton's personal intentions may  be,  he does not conduct President George Bush's kind of personal  diplomacy.    2. The U.S. State Department bureaucracy has a ""negative""  view of Greek policy because of past difficulties in  Greek-American relations during the 1981-89 Papandreou  administration, as well as because of its ""obvious"" sympathy and  concern about Turkey and FYROM.    3. Arguing that ethnic groups cannot determine U.S. policy,  professional diplomats ""abhor"" interventions by the  Greek-American lobby, which has mobilized on behalf of Greece.    While the United States supports Greece as a friend and  ally,  ""it does so only on issues not involving a third country,""  Papakhelas concludes.    Poll Results    As late as 13 February, but before U.S. recognition of The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, I KATHIMERINI published  the results of a 26-27 January poll conducted by the ALKO-MARTEL  polling organization, with a commentary by Yiannis Loulis [no  further information]. Respondents were asked their opinion on  continuing a dialogue with FYROM in the United Nations.  According to Loulis, results showed an ""impressive"" turn in  public opinion in favor of a more measured attitude toward the  FYROM issue. In fact, the number of partisans of a dialogue in  the United Nations increased from 77.2 percent last December to  the present 80.9 percent, while those who opposed it decreased  from 19.5 percent in December to 14.2 percent in January.  Respondents were also asked what could ""realistically"" be  expected from such a dialogue. Some 31.8 percent thought that  80-90 percent of Greece's expectations could be met, 27.3  percent thought that 60-70 percent of Greek expectations could  be satisfied, 10.3 percent that success would be total, 14.9  percent that few expectations could be met, and 7.5 percent did  not know.    Economic Repercussions    An article by Athina Kalaitzoglou in the 20 February I  KATHIMERINI reviews commercial relations between Greece and  FYROM and comments on economic losses FYROM will sustain from  the Athens-imposed embargo. Forty percent of basic goods,  including food items, enter FYROM from Greece and 70 percent of  imports-exports transit through the port of Salonica. In 1993,  FYROM imported through Greece 1.5 million tons of hydrocarbons,  487,000 tons of raw materials (zinc, manganese, and various  alloys), 101,000 tons of phosphates, and 118,000 tons of  coal--also, 8,500 tons of coffee, 5,000 tons of leather goods,  and 473 tons of cigarettes. Exports from FYROM to third  countries through Salonica amounted to 471,000 tons of various  goods. Provided governmental measures are respected by private  and public entities alike, FYROM problems will quickly mount,  Kalaitzoglou contends. She quotes Salonica economic circles as  stating that ""unless there are leaks, this is a golden  opportunity to put our money where our mouth is."" In addition,  the essentially agricultural FYROM economy has been unable to  attract foreign investments, she continues, the only possible  exception being minerals. On the other hand, the embargo will  affect around 25 Greek-FYROM companies created in recent years  near the common border in the areas of textiles, ready-to-wear  articles, food, and chemicals, Kalaitzoglou notes. Already, it  is estimated that Greek trade, notably in Northern Greece, has  already suffered losses of 3 billion drachmas.    Relations With Serbia    According to Nikos Marakis writing in the 13 February Athens  weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Greek-Serbian relations have  entered a ""trying"" period. Citing ""reliable"" diplomatic sources,  Marakis quotes Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic as saying  ""Athens is no longer a trustworthy conduit for communication  with Belgrade."" Marakis lists a number of reasons for the  falling out:    1. The refusal of the Greek Government to invite Milosevic  to  Athens following the October elections.    2. The absence of a reply from Prime Minister Papandreou to  an invitation to visit Belgrade before the NATO summit.    3. The rejection of Serbian proposals for a Greek initiative  within the EU framework aimed at diluting the pressure from the  military threat.    4. Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias' low-key reaction to  the decision of EU foreign ministers regarding NATO air strikes  against Bosnian Serbs.    According to a brief article in the 16 February I  KATHIMERINI, relations between Papandreou and Milosevic are  ""even worse"" than was thought. Belgrade is very ""disappointed""  with Greek policy on the former Yugoslavia, the article reports,  citing Milan Milutinovic, the Serbian ambassador to Athens, as  having said that a lack of understanding exists between his  government, the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Prime  Minister Papandreou. The article cites diplomatic sources as  noting that difficulties started when Papandreou, thinking that  a visit to Belgrade on his return from Brussels was ""too  daring,"" ignored Milosevic's invitation.

0,FT941-5417 ,"FT941-5417 _AN-ECGC1ABWFT 940307   FT  07 MAR 94 / Rise in fears for future of manual jobs      By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent   Britain's manual workers have grown increasingly pessimistic over the past month about job prospects, according to the latest in a series of monthly surveys for the Financial Times, published today. The survey, conducted by MORI, the pollsters, for Industrial Relations Services, the pay and employment analysts, showed that while 48 per cent of all workers said they were very or fairly concerned about becoming jobless in the next 12 months - compared with 44 per cent in January - as many as 58 per cent of manual workers asked in February were worried about their employment. This compared with 47 per cent of manual workers who expressed concern in January. An upsurge of anxiety has also occurred among workers aged between 35 and 54, with the proportion expressing concern rising by 11 percentage points to 54 per cent. By contrast there was a decline in concern among the over-55s from 41 per cent to 34 per cent in January. Forty-five per cent of those aged under 34 were worried, a percentage point less than in the previous month. The rise in anxiety has been greatest in the Midlands, where the proportion has risen from 41 per cent to 52 per cent. This may reflect local worries about job losses in after BMW's decision to acquire Rover. Today's figures also confirmed a trend that has been persistent since the survey began last April, which is that part-time workers appear less worried about redundancy than those in full-time jobs. Last month 49 per cent of full-time workers were worried about losing their job compared with 42 per cent in part-time employment. A further sign of a deterioration in expectations of recovery can be found in MORI's so-called 'misery index' which is compiled from both its economic optimism index and its fear of redundancy survey. The higher the index, the more miserable the public. Last month the overall index stood at 34 per cent, the second highest figure  -after October's - since the survey began. Misery is worst among manual workers, with a figure of 41 per cent, compared with 36 per cent in January. The survey is based on interviews between February 24 and February 28 with 1,007 adults aged 18 and over who work full-time or part-time across 149 constituency sampling points in the UK.

Here is our comment.    In the past two years, Vietnam-Thailand relations have  consolidated and developed in many fields. Exchange visits by  many high ranking delegations have been made. On 15 October  last year, party General Secretary Do Muoi went to Thailand  after a visit by Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. On 3 February this  year, President of the Thai Parliament Mr. Marut Bunnak visited  Vietnam, and, most importantly, Thai Prime Minister Chuan  Likphai said he will make an official visit to Vietnam.    During summit meetings within the two countries, mutual  understanding has been strengthened, contributing to the  development of bilateral relations in many fields. The Thai  prime minister as well as industrial, academic, and business  leaders in Thailand all expressed admiration for Vietnam  political developments and social stabilization. The coming  visit to Vietnam by Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai comes  after lifting of the American embargo. He said: Relations will  be strengthened between the two countries.    In economic relations, Vietnam and Thailand have concluded  exchange agreements including agreements on avoidance of double  taxation and investment protection. Bilateral trade relations  have developed rapidly from $65 million in 1990 to $158 million  in 1993, and 30 Thai investment projects capitalized at over  $120 million have been licensed by Vietnam. Many Thai senior  government leaders have called on Thai businessmen to increase  investment and trade activities in Vietnam.    At a workshop held in Bangkok on Monday by the Thai  newspapers THE NATION and BANGKOK BUSINESS [KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT],  Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri called for closer  cooperation between his country's government and private sector  to improve Thai competitiveness in Vietnam and Indochina.    Meanwhile, Thai businesspeople in Vietnam urge the Thai  Government to promote an intergovernmental agreement on an  Indochinese fund to help Thai businessmen in their competition  and speed up the development of a system of road and maritime  transport linking Thailand and Vietnam in order to promote trade  and tourism.    The Vietnamese Ambassador Le Cong Phung told the Bangkok  workshop that the U.S. lifting of the trade embargo and step by  step moving towards normalisation with Vietnam would not derail  Vietnam foreign policy and its external economic relations,  particularly those towards countries in Southeast Asia.

The involvement of  NATO brought in the Americans and that, predictably, drew in the  Russians. Three years after the Yugoslav crisis started, the  governments concerned decided on a measure they could have  implemented from the start: they established a ""contact group""  of officials to co-ordinate policies in Yugoslavia.    Ostensibly, a contact group makes sense. The positions of  the NATO governments and the Kremlin appear to be drawing  closer. NATO's failure to stop the Serbs destroying Gorazde was  followed by the failure of the Russian envoy in the Balkans,  deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, to achieve the same end  through persuasion.    The U.S. Administration has been pushing for stronger NATO  action in Yugoslavia precisely because it assumes that this time  the Russians are unlikely to object. Yet appearances can be  deceptive: the contact group is a device intended to take a  middle course between engaging Moscow in the Balkans and keeping  the Russians away. And, despite the current efforts, the West  is almost guaranteed to continue misreading the message from the  Kremlin.    We have persuaded ourselves that the Russians have a  historic  friendship with the Serbs. But although history plays a part in  the Balkans, it tends to provide only justification, not the  reason, for the Serbs' current policies. True, many Russians  feel some affinity with them. Historically, though,  Russian-Serb relations were dominated more by confrontation than  co-operation.    Nationalist politicians in Moscow today may have an interest  in reviving a historic pan-Slav alliance. But this is not  necessarily the same as friendship with the Serbs; Slovenia,  Croatia, Macedonia and Bulgaria are also Slav nations. It is  often forgotten, moreover, that Serbia's political elite was  educated at a time when Moscow was viewed as Yugoslavia's mortal  enemy. All Serb generals now fighting in Bosnia were trained  for a possible Soviet invasion. In short, the ""traditional""  Russian-Serb friendship is nothing more than a temporary  marriage of convenience and is unlikely to last.    Isolated from the world, Serbs see Moscow as their only  protector against military action from the West. But they are  also determined to show that they will not allow the Kremlin to  interfere with their war plans. Hence they ignored Russia's  demands for a halt to the carnage around Gorazde.    Having the limits of their influence exposed has been  frustrating for Russia's diplomats. But this does not mean that  Boris Yeltsin is now ready to give the West a free hand in the  Balkans. From the Russian perspective, the most important  consideration is not the ultimate arrangements in Yugoslavia,  but the lessons that the Balkan war may have for future European  security structures and the precedents Western action may set.    Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian politicians  kept the notion of a ""strategic partnership"" with the West. It  is easy to see what they had in mind: although weakened, Russia  should continue to occupy a place at the top table and be  involved in important decisions. The West understood this need,  and paid lip service to the concept. But events in Yugoslavia  exposed how insubstantial it was.    Russia's every demand for a new UN mandate in the Balkans  has  been rejected. Instead, the West has insisted on reinterpreting  resolutions already adopted by the Security Council. Often, as  far as Moscow was concerned, they did this without consulting  the Kremlin. The decision to nominate NATO to implement UN  policies in Bosnia was taken without consulting the Russians; so  was the decision to issue an ultimatum on Sarajevo, the shooting  down of four Serb planes over Bosnia and the launch of air  strikes on Gorazde on 10 April. At each stage, the West  promised the Russians would be involved, but this happened  after, not before, a decision was taken.    The tactic was familiar to the Russians, for it was the same  as the one used by the United States before the Gulf war.  Moscow was also excluded from the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations: the Russian foreign minister was invited only to  the signing ceremony in Washington, just an actor in a vast  Western-sponsored photo-opportunity.    So, when NATO issued its ultimatum on Sarajevo this  February,  Mr Yeltsin was determined not to be surprised again: instead of  relying on Western promises, he deployed troops around the  Bosnian capital, so ensuring that his country could no longer be  ignored.    Russia's main interest in Yugoslavia is to uphold a single  idea: that NATO should not be allowed to do as it pleases in  what Moscow still considers a Russian sphere of influence. The  West may be right to challenge this view. But to annoy the  Russians and fail to achieve any purpose in Yugoslavia is the  worst of both worlds.    Mr Yeltsin has recently revived his call for a summit on  Yugoslavia. The American administration has no interest in a  new conference that could force it to take on unwelcome  commitments. So, instead of a summit, this contact group will  now attempt to devise a joint East-West strategy that will allow  the Russians to claim they remain involved, while upholding  NATO's leading role in the Balkans. The creation of the group,  without prior consultation with either Spain or Canada, has  already infuriated both of these serious contributors to the  Yugloslav peace-keeping force. And the chances are that this  entire exercise will do little to change the situation on the  ground.    The contact group may restrict the Serbs' ability to play  off  one power against another. But realities do not change: the  Americans would like the Bosnians to accept that their republic  is irrevocably divided, but cannot say so publicly; the Russians  would like to limit NATO's involvement in the region, but do not  wish to pick a fight with the West over Yugoslavia.    The truth that the creation of the contact group seeks to  hide is simple. The interests of the West and those of Russia  do not coincide in the Balkans. For the Russians, the status  quo, created by Serb aggression, is acceptable; for the West, it  is not. The Balkans require a genuine commitment from  governments that believe strife in the area actually matters for  European security. The creation of the contact group sends  exactly the opposite message: bereft of new ideas, all  governments have agreed that their main purpose is to shelve  further disputes between themselves -- the very same lowest  common denominator that has failed every time in Yugoslavia.

0,FT931-1115 ,"FT931-1115 _AN-DCZBZAD0FT 930326   FT  26 MAR 93 / Management: Down Under the weather      By KEVIN BROWN   In the land of the long weekend, taking an unjustified 'sickie' is an inalienable right, jealously guarded by workers who spend more time at the beach than at their desks. Is this an outdated image of Australia, rightly condemned by politicians and business leaders alike? Or is there a grain of truth in the caricature? The answer, it seems, is a bit of both. Anecdotal evidence suggests that abuse of sick leave provisions - the infamous 'sickie' - is widespread. In justification, most workers will point to the provisions of the national or state 'award' covering their industry, in which terms and conditions are laid down by the quasi-judicial Industrial Relations Commission. Many workers regard the sick leave provisions as an extra holiday to be taken regardless of good health. This view is encouraged by managers who rarely require proof of illness. There is little hard evidence that this free and easy attitude to sick leave has led to higher overall absenteeism than in other industrialised countries. Indeed, research* for the Australian government by Bill Merrilees and Dale Miller from Newcastle University suggests absenteeism is lower in many industries - banking, construction, distribution and services. But evidence is emerging** that absenteeism is a significant problem in the public sector, which includes most of the power generation and telecommunications industries, as well as public administration, community services and about half of the transport and storage sector. According to research by Mark Wooden, associate professor at the National Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University in Adelaide, only the dangerous mining industry suffers worse absenteeism than these industries, which account for 87 per cent of public sector workers. Wooden says there is insufficient data to be certain about why the public sector should be more prone to the 'sickie' epidemic. But he suggests the reasons probably include more generous sick pay provisions, low job satisfaction, greater job security and less demanding management. 'I don't think Australians are lazier than anyone else, or any more inclined to take a day off,' he says. 'People are just responding to the incentives that are given to them, and in Australia the view is widely held that if the sick leave days are in the award, they are there to be taken.' *Report 7, Service Industry Research Programme, DITAC. **The Sickie: a Public Sector Phenomenon, and The Cost of Time Off Work in Australia; National Institute of Labour Studies.

Robert L. Fretz, the official responsible for Cuban affairs  in the U.S. State Department, said that his office had also  heard the rumors but did not have official reports from Havana  on Castro's health, ""nor any indication there was a change in  the situation in Cuba."" ""The regime seems to continue in firm  control of the police and the security forces,"" Fretz added,  saying that the United States ""continues to monitor the  situation closely.""    Gladys Gonzalez Noy, a Cuban dissident living in Havana,  told  the National Cuban-American Foundation (CANF), the largest  anti-Castroist organization, by telephone on Wednesday that  Castro was hospitalized last week after suffering a heart attack  following an attempt on his life. Acccording to Gonzalez Noy,  Castro was hospitalized at the Surgical Medical Research Center  (CIMEQ) in Havana last week but was transferred to another place  on Tuesday, according to a recording of a conversation supplied  to AFP and other media sources at CANF headquarters in Miami  (Florida).    Gonzalez Noy, president of the Pro-Free Art Association,  said  Castro was caught in the middle of a shooting, a rumor that  circulated last week. Although he was not injured, according to  her, the incident affected him greatly. ""First, before the  heart attack, Castro suffered a respiratory arrest as a result  of the whole situation,"" she affirmed.    Gonzalez Noy asserted that state security has just forbidden  her to leave her house and that there is an unusual police  presence in Cuba.    Other well-placed sources in Washington said, however, that  regarding Havana there were only reports of an increase in the  security presence around the CIMEQ hospital, one of the most  prestigious in the capital.    In Havana, a Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry official  questioned by AFP said on Wednesday that Castro is ""in perfect  health"" and conducted as usual an ""official activity"" on Tuesday  evening.    In fact, the situation seemed normal on Wednesday in the  Cuban capital, according to an AFP reporter.    Most officials at the Cuban Foreign Ministry have been busy  with preparations for the conference that, from Friday to next  Sunday, will gather representatives of the Cuban Government with  some 200 members of the Cuban exile community.

Later, before they left the prison, the warden gave each of  the visitors including Frank Wolf five pairs of stockings as  souvenirs.    But several days later Wolf claimed that stockings produced  by the Beijing prison had been exported to the U.S.    After he returned home Wolf displayed the stockings at a  hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee of the U.S. Senate as  ""proof"" that China had exported prison-made products.    Despite the fact that the Chinese side immediately clarified  the truth of the matter, Wolf closed his eyes to the facts and  continued to spread his allegations on many occasions.    Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy to China  made a request to the Chinese department concerned for embassy  officials to be allowed to visit the Beijing Number One Prison.    On March 30, 1993 the Chinese department concerned arranged  a  visit by three U.S. Embassy officials to the prison. During  their visit the embassy officials said that they had made a  detailed inquiry about Wolf's allegation and they would report  their conclusion to the American government.    Later, in the summer of 1993, Wolf again spread his lies at  a  press conference held in the U.S. and accused China groundlessly.    After repeated requests by the Chinese department concerned,  the U.S. Government published the investigation conclusion in  ""FEDERAL REGISTER"" on December 13, 1993, which conforms to the  facts.    Speaking about reform-through-labor products, a Chinese  Government spokesman said that the policy of the Chinese  Government is very clear. ""Reform-through-labor enterprises  have no right to conduct foreign trade,"" he said.    ""Since China and U.S. reached an understanding about banning  imports and exports of prison labor products, the Chinese side  has always abided by the agreement. And facts are the best  proof,"" the official added.     "

In an  interview on CNN's International Hour he pointed out that the  administration keeps a close watch on the development of the  political and economic situation in Russia and expresses its  concern to a certain extent. ""The transition to democracy and  the market in Russia is a long and painful process,"" the  high-ranking administration representative said.

Government Chairman Chernomyrdin  has assured everyone that he remains committed to the process of  reforms. We can only adopt a wait-and-see stance and follow  their further progress. Let us also remember that despite a  certain departure from the original course, the past year can be  described as successful in Russia. Approximately three-fourths  of small enterprises and one-fourth of medium and large  enterprises in Russia have now been privatized. More than 90  percent of goods are currently sold via the free market. We can  see progress, and our task is to support it by every available  means.""    Lake voiced U.S. concern at the possibility of growing  tension in Russian-Ukrainian relations following Yuriy Meshkov's  victory in the presidential elections in the Crimea. ""At the  same time we are completely satisfied with the reaction to this  event of the Ukrainian and Russian governments, which have  adopted a well-considered stance in this situation,"" the White  House representative observed. ""We are also satisfied with the  policy pursued by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk since his  meeting with Bill Clinton.""    Commenting on the statement by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader  of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, that air strikes by  NATO forces on Serbian positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina would  be regarded as a declaration of war on Russia, Lake observed:  ""I think we should be glad that Zhirinovskiy does not speak for  the Russian Government and has not been involved in shaping  Russia's foreign policy.

However their development  in many fields does not meet our mutual expectations,"" German  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an interview published in  the economic daily HOSPODARSKE NOVINY on Monday [7 March].    Kinkel stresses the need to realise that along with claims  for compensation by Czech victims of Nazism there at the same  time exist claims of Sudeten Germans expelled from  Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Kinkel says that Germany is  aware of its responsibility towards Czech victims of Nazism.  ""We will seek to find an appropriate solution,"" he says.    ""We are watching with interest steps by the Czech Government  concerning partial compensation for Nazi victims. But there  should not be any prejudices and a dialogue should be carried  out with Sudeten Germans,"" Kinkel says. ""Results of the  German-Czech commission of historians which recently published a  report on its symposium on `Germans, Czechs and Slovaks during  the First Republic' should be taken into consideration much more  than before, which would help make the discussion a  `matter-of-fact' one,"" Kinkel says.    Kinkel expresses satisfaction concerning German-Czech  economic relations. ""In the economic field, Germany, with a  roughly 25- percent share in both imports and exports, is  unambiguously the most important partner of the Czech Republic,""  he says. ""We have opened our market to Czech goods. Thousands  of Czechs have found jobs in Germany, and especially in border  regions. Millions of German tourists visit the Czech Republic.  By this we are considerably contributing to economic and social  stability in the Czech Republic,"" he adds. Besides, the Czech  economy ""has absorbed a considerable portion of German  investments oriented towards Central European countries,"" he  said.    On the future of Europe, Kinkel voices the conviction that  ""excessive regulation and centralism"" within the European Union  has to be moderated. However, the goals of the Union will  remain unchanged. On the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,  Kinkel says the approach by the EU, NATO and the United Nations  Security Council clearly shows the ""firmness with which the  international community reacts to the Bosnian war.""    ""To achieve a functioning security system in Europe it is  important that different institutions -- the EU, the Conference  of Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), NATO and Western  European Union (WEU) -- join together, Kinkel says, adding that  Germany supports such countries as the Czech Republic in their  efforts to approach the structures of European and  trans-Atlantic security.

0,FT932-9906 ,"FT932-9906 _AN-DELCNAA7FT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Japan to reaffirm UN commitment      By ROBERT THOMSON      TOKYO   MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, is expected today to deliver a strong reaffirmation of the country's commitment to the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Cambodia, as opposition demands for an immediate pull-out intensified. The Japanese government has been under extreme pressure since the killing last week of a civilian policeman in an ambush, and Mr Miyazawa has been advised to make an address that shows the government is both concerned about the safety of the peacekeepers and is committed to the UN operation. However, the National Police Agency, which has responsibility for the 75 civilian police officers sent to Cambodia, continued to argue yesterday with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) over the duties given to Japanese officers. Officials at the NPA say Japanese police, who are not carrying arms, have been given inappropriate responsibilities such as acting as bodyguards and, in some cases, have not been given sufficient water or provisions by the UN authorities. Relations between Untac and the NPA have been strained since about eight Japanese police officers returned to Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, without official approval after the killing of the Japanese officer. The police officers have since returned to their posts. A Japanese television news programme poll of 690 people last weekend found that 52 per cent believe the police and 600 military personnel should be withdrawn, while 37 per cent believe they should remain in the country. The killing of the officer has stirred debate over whether the conflict in Cambodia now fits the five principles which supposedly govern Japanese participation in international peacekeeping operations. One of those principles is that a ceasefire agreement is in place, and opposition parties say the Cambodian ceasefire has collapsed. Meanwhile, a six-member advance party left Tokyo yesterday for Mozambique, where 48 Japanese military personnel are due to assist in another UN operation. The other members of the group are due to leave before the end of this month and will co-ordinate transport operations. Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, yesterday suggested that China will not be a significant military threat to the region over the next five years, but he warned that the country's rapid economic growth could be accompanied by an expansion of military ambitions in about 20 years' time. In a meeting with Mr Toshio Nakayama, the director-general of Japan's Defence Agency, the prime minister said that the US-Japan-China triangular relationship had to remain stable to ensure that China had no incentive to build up its military capability.

All  of those surveyed agreed that Japan's new generation of bureaucrats  view the United States differently from their elders.  Several  writers asserted that the new generation of bureaucrats believes it  is time for Japan to move away from its close association with the  United States and toward closer ties with Asia.      Focusing on how negotiators from the ranks of Japan's bureaucracy  took the unprecedented step of saying ""no"" to the United States in  the recently-broken off U.S.-Japan framework talks, several  academics and journalists analyzed the changing views of these  bureaucrats toward Japan-U.S. relations.  None of the writers  expressed surprise over the reaction to the breakdown of the  framework talks by Japan's negotiators who, according to the 13  February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, showed ""pride, confidence, and delight  that they had defeated [sic] the United States for the first time in  trade negotiations.""      Bureaucrats' Reliance on Economic Theory - Writing in the 9  February ASAHI SHIMBUN, Motoshige Ito, a Tokyo University economics  professor, asserted that Japan's bureaucrats based their negative  response to U.S. demands on what he referred to as the  ""internationally recognized economic theory"" that numerical targets  will lead to managed rather than free trade.  He said that ""the  contemporary mid-level bureaucrats who are responsible for working-  level negotiations"" no longer ignore economic theory in trade  negotiations.  Unlike their predecessors, who, he claimed, believed  in strong government economic intervention, contemporary bureaucrats  understand and apply in their arguments ""internationally recognized  economic theory, which they learned while studying in U.S. graduate  schools.""  This change in the thinking of bureaucrats ""will be an  important factor in Japan's trade negotiations over the long run,""  Ito observed.      Ito criticized the U.S. Government for allegedly not following  economic theory ""that is prevalent in American universities.""  Contrary to the above trend among Japanese Government officials, he  wrote, the U.S. Government ""appears to be moving away from arguments  based on economic theory.""  Ito cited numerical targets as one  example, claiming that ""no authoritative economists"" in the United  States support numerical targets.      Generational Change, Emergence of Multilateralism - Former  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official Yukio Okamoto, writing  in the 11 February NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN, pointed to a ""generational  change"" among Japanese negotiators as one reason they could say ""no""  to the United States.  He observed that the present generation of  bureaucrats ""do not feel a debt to the United States"" for its  postwar assistance to Japan.  This ""diminished appreciation of past  favors,"" combined with ""accumulated frustrations from many years of  dealing with what, in their view, has been an excessively demanding  United States,"" is a factor that is ""small but impossible to  overlook"" in the politics of negotiations.      Alongside younger bureaucrats ""diminished appreciation"" of the  United States, there is also reportedly a trend toward a more global  Japanese approach to diplomacy.  According to an article by Tokyo  University political science professor Takashi Inoguchi in the 22  February MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Japanese MOFA bureaucrats have been  steadily ""globalizing"" Japan's diplomacy since the collapse of the  Liberal Democratic Party government last year.  According to  Inoguchi, they are beginning to treat the Japan-U.S. relationship as  just ""one element"" in the overall ""formation of global economic and  security rules.""  Although the Japanese-U.S. relationship is still  ""preeminent,"" Inoguchi observed, the relationship has ""changed in  quality"" and is likely to be handled from a ""multilateral  perspective.""      In a similar vein, ASAHI SHIMBUN economic reporter Kenji Takeuchi  in a 9 February article pointed to the emergence within the Japanese  bureaucracy of a ""multilateralist faction,"" which maintains that  Japan should shift the focus of its trade policy from Japan-U.S.  bilateral trade to trade with other countries.  According to  Takeuchi, contemporary Japanese bureaucrats prefer multilateral  negotiations to bilateral talks with the United States because  multilateral talks are more ""open"" and based on ""universal rules.""      Younger Bureaucrats Influenced by Pan-Asianist Arguments -  Writing in the 15 March issue of EKONOMISUTO, Kenji Suzuki, a  MAINICHI SHIMBUN editorial staff writer, contended that the  breakdown of the framework talks was a ""logical consequence"" of the  views of young Japanese bureaucrats, who are ""cool"" toward the  United States and ""inclined"" toward Asia.  Suzuki went on to say  that the views of Kazuo Ogura, former director general of MOFA's  Economic Affairs Bureau, who is now ambassador-designate to Vietnam,  have provided the theoretical grounds for the emergence of ""Pan-  Asianism, or nationalism under the name of Pan-Asianism,"" among  young bureaucrats.  He noted that, while Ogura carefully avoids the  term ""kenbei"" (dislike of the United States) and ""openly emphasizes""  the desirability of cooperation with the United States, his writings  have ""provoked nationalism"" among young bureaucrats, ""even though  they are not the mainstream views in MOFA.""      Suzuki claimed that Ogura's articles have attracted young MOFA  bureaucrats chiefly because he focuses on the ""cultural"" aspects of  Japan's foreign relations rather than ""technical"" aspects of  security and economic relations, as many bureaucrats allegedly did  in the past.  He noted in particular that two of Ogura's articles-  -""Crack Between the Empire of Ideas and the Lost People"" published  in the June 1991 GAIKO FORUM, and ""For Restoration of the Rights of  Asia"" published in the July 1993 CHUO KORON -- have influenced young  bureaucrats.  In the GAIKO FORUM article, Suzuki observed, Ogura  termed U.S. demands put forth in trade negotiations as an attempt to  make Japan its ""mental colony"" by forcing the Japanese to ""have the  same sense of values as Americans.""  In the CHUO KORON article,  Suzuki wrote, Ogura called for restoring the ""tradition and spirit  of Asia,"" since ""Western civilization--an endless pursuit of greed  and self-assertion--cannot resolve the world's problems.""  Suzuki  also claimed that the best-selling book written by Ichiro Ozawa, co-  leader of the Japan Renewal Party (Shinseito), Blueprint For  Building a New Japan--""which has been enthusiastically read"" by many  young bureaucrats--has been used by them as a source of ""Pan-Asian""  inspiration.  To support his conclusion about the thrust of Ozawa's  book, Suzuki cited the passage in the book, in which Ozawa calls for  a shift from ""Western to Oriental values.""     Suzuki asserted that ""most"" young diplomats are ""fed up with  negotiations with the United States, which give working-level  bureaucrats nothing but many troubles and pain"" and are influenced  by the idea of ""returning to Asia.""  He noted that young diplomats  now want to be assigned to Asia, where they feel ""much more  comfortable,"" rather than serve in the United States.  According to  Suzuki, this ""inclination"" is spreading to other ministries, such as  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry.  He claimed that the young diplomats often say:  ""If  things do not work with the United States, there is always Asia.""  (Author:  Innes.

But the relationship is in worse  shape, politically speaking, in 1994 than at any time since Suez.    The damage is at its worst among the Democrats, and this is  extremely serious, since they have majorities in both houses of  Congress, as well as the presidency. But the Republicans don't  have much use for Britain's present government, either, even  though that government went to such extraordinary lengths to  help George Bush in the presidential election of 1992, thus  alienating the winner, Bill Clinton. But the Republicans of  today don't want to know about George Bush anymore than about  John Major. A Republican flier has just been issued in  connection with this year's mid-term congressional elections.  It carries pictures of three worthies: Ronald Reagan, Margaret  Thatcher and Bob Dole. This is a reminder of how great the  relationship once was, and now is not.    All Americans knew who Mrs Thatcher was. Most admired her,  and all who could conceivably vote Republican not only admired  her when she was prime minister but still admire her. That is  why her picture is on that flier.    The Tories, when they ditched Mrs Thatcher, may possibly  have  been doing the right thing by their party, and for its fortunes  in Britain. But they were throwing away a great asset in  international relations, especially relations with America. And  Britain acquired, in place of that asset, a liability. If  Britain repudiated that marvellous Margaret Thatcher, well,  there must be something wrong with Britain, mustn't there?    As for Mr Major, his name and image carry hardly any  connotations here. But for those who do know something about  him, the connotations are negative, consisting mainly of a vague  impression that he is the guy who stabbed Mrs Thatcher in the  back.    The deterioration shows in a number of ways. There is the  decision to ignore British protests and sell aircraft with  advanced radar to Argentina. That could not have happened under  Mrs Thatcher. There is increasing talk of an emerging  Franco-American leadership, especially over Bosnia. Britain is  presented as dragging its feet over Bosnia. I believe Britain  was right to oppose the drift towards military intervention.  But for the present it is the French who are giving a lead in  the direction favoured by popular opinion in America.    Then there is the small but revealing episode of Gerry Adams  and his visa. First of all, Mr Adams would not have been  granted an American visa while Mrs Thatcher was prime minister.  Mrs Thatcher inspired fear, both in Washington and in Dublin.  Mr Major inspires nothing in particular, in either capital.  Since the Downing Street Declaration of 15 December, with its  fatal concession of the Hume-Adams wording on  self-determination, Albert Reynolds has been under the  impression that he can get away with pretty well anything where  the present British government is concerned, even getting an  American visa for the political head of the Provisional IRA,  while the IRA's ""armed struggle"" against Britain continues.    The granting of that visa was one symptom of a general  deterioration in Anglo-American relations. But the consequences  of granting the visa have accelerated the deterioration. This  was not mainly a result of Gerry Adams' anti-British tirades on  Larry King Live and elsewhere. These reached huge audiences but  embarrassed his more respectable sponsors, who had bought the  line that Mr Adams is now an earnest seeker after peace. There  was consequently a certain revulsion against him in influential  quarters.    But then Mr Major's government, by the form of its protest,  compounded the damage already done. It is in general  inadvisable for a government to protest publicly against  something it has been unable to stop. This only advertises the  inability in question. And this was all the worse because the  inability was the result not of harsh fate but of sheer  incompetence.    Mr Major could have nipped that visa in the bud. He should  have known what Albert Reynolds was up to and made him stop. He  should have called on Mr Reynolds to oppose -- as all previous  Irish governments have done -- the granting of a visa to the  president of Sinn Fein. He should have warned Mr Reynolds that  if he failed to do so, he would be placing the future of the  Anglo-Irish agreement in danger. Had Mr Major done that, Mr  Reynolds would have advised Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and  Edward Kennedy to withhold support from this year's visa  application as from previous ones, and the visa would not have  been granted.    Having failed to prevent what he could quietly have  prevented, Mr Major then protested at the top of his voice:  several decibels too loud to be of help to Anglo-American  relations in their present frail condition. To send a formal  protest to the British ambassador in Washington would have been  enough. To carpet the American ambassador in London was far too  flamboyant. It inevitably evoked the anti-British component  always latent American nationalism.    The New York Times is rather less nationalistic than most  Americans and is generally not anti-British. Yet its comment on  the carpeting of the America ambassador was the nastiest I have  seen in a respectable American newspaper in relation to an ally  of the United States. The editorial appeared Saturday under the  headline: ""The Lion Whines About Mr Adams."" The heading  faithfully reflects the hostile and contemptuous tone of the  whole editorial.    The argument was on First Amendment lines, as if this was a  British attempt to impose censorship on the United States,  instead of a protest against the granting of a visa to a known  enemy of Britain and a spokesman for terrorism. But the tone of  the editorial was unmistakably that of aroused American  nationalism on an anti-British binge. Intellectually, the  editorial is contemptible, but as a symptom of dangerous forces  at work in unexpected places it must be taken seriously.    In general, there may not be a lot Mr Major can do about  improving Anglo-American relations. But there is one not  insignificant area in which he can do something. He can warn  Dublin -- belatedly but still effectively -- that if it again  lends itself to making trouble for Britain in the US, it will  undermine the Anglo-Irish agreement through activities  incompatible with the spirit of that agreement. Mr Reynolds  would take such a warning seriously.    For the rest, Mr Major should reflect that he has now to  mend  his fences with a US administration which his government  foolishly strove to prevent from ever coming into being. He has  a lot to live down. President Clinton's hero is John F Kennedy,  whose motto was: ""Forgive your enemies, but remember their  names.""     "

During the conversation Meri  answered questions by special correspondents of Interfax  Aleksandr Budris and Boris Grishenko.    Interfax: Mr. President, how do you see a way towards the  improvement of relations between Estonia and Russia?    Meri: I cannot say that I am satisfied with the present  status of relations between the countries. 18 rounds of  Estonian-Russian talks prove the opposite: it is necessary to  move faster toward normalization of relations between the  neighboring countries.    I think that all existing problems in relations between  Estonia and Russia can be resolved in a civilized way.  Although, frankly speaking, two years ago I was more optimistic  on this issue. It seemed to me that all problems can be  considered calmly and friendly. Including those which remained  as a criminal heritage of the treaties between Stalin and  Hitler. Taking this opportunity, I would like to note that  although Estonia and Russia had conflicts sometimes, but  historically they maintained normal relations. Extremism was not  characteristic for any of the sides.    We, Estonians, are realists by nature and we know that  Russia  will always be our closest neighbor. And we would like to take  a positive experience from our common past, not a negative one.  We have enough of it.    Interfax: How can Russian-Estonian talks be intensified by  putting them on the path of concrete decisions?    Meri: First of all, I would like to stress the use of these  talks, because there are people in both countries who doubt  their expediency. The Estonian-Russian dialogue is now rather  active. It cannot be interrupted.    If delegations of both countries have been meeting regularly  for two years, these are not instant contacts, but serious  bilateral cooperation.    But there is a dangerous tendency in this dialogue: talking  to each other for long, specialists can go deep into details and  lose important strategic targets.    It seems to me that a meeting between the Estonian and  Russian presidents could help break this vicious circle. I am  sure that our meeting with Boris Yeltsin would enable us to  conceptually resolve the most important problems in relations  between the two countries, from economic to cultural ones.    We do not break off contacts with the Russian president. We  conduct correspondence with Boris Yeltsin by official channels.  But unfortunately I cannot indicate a possible date of such a  meeting. Let me add that I am its supporter.    IF Note: On April 30 during an official visit of Latvian  president Guntis Ulmanis to Moscow, IF's correspondent asked  Yeltsin the following question: ""When will the Russian-Estonian  treaty on the withdrawal of troops be signed?"" ""We would very  much like to sign such a document,"" the Russian president said.  ""We do not have special goals in Estonia, especially military  ones. We also intend to pull our all troops from Estonia.  However, Russia would like to do it in the same way as it was  done with Lithuania and Latvia -- on the legal basis, so that a  treaty with a clear timetable of control over its implementation  is signed. We work so with Germany, from where all Russian  troops will be pulled out this year. Therefore, in case of  Estonia, they need to show goodwill, and from our side there is  already full agreement.""    Interfax: Lately the Estonian political circles have been  talking about the need to attract Finland as a mediator in the  Russian-Estonian talks. What is your opinion on this issue?    Meri: I welcome any step which would lead to improvement of  Estonian-Russian relations. I think that mediation by the  experienced politician -- the Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari  would ease the tense atmosphere created at the Estonian-Russian  talks. Let me repeat that after two years of meetings the  delegations did not make any progress.    I would like to note that the withdrawal of Russian troops  from Estonia and Latvia meets the interests of Russia itself.  With full certainty I can say that the withdrawal will be  followed by activization of economic relations between our  countries. And this means that in this case we are talking  about mutual benefit, not about the victory of one side and  failure of another.    Estonia is a small country, but it is also capable of being  useful for such continent as Russia. Take our geopolitical  position, our convenient harbors. Is it possible to say that  Rotterdam port, for example, belongs to some separate country?  It belongs to the whole Europe.    Interfax: What do you think about the border dispute between  Estonia and Russia?    Meri: Any border dispute, including ours, is similar to  ""Pandora box"": nobody knows how it can be closed or who can do  that. However, we have to find a clear answer to this question  too.    I think there is a possibility to simply delay resolution of  this problem for 5-10 years, by finding some proper solution of  border disputes. Of course, we are not talking about a new iron  curtain, bu I am sure that such border should equally defend  both Estonia and Russia from criminals, smugglers, drug dealers.  This border should gain a European character.    Interfax: How do you see the role of NATO in contemporary  world?    Meri: I think this organization has not obtained more  enemies and it transformed from the military union into a kind  of fire team. The power of NATO is aimed not against someone,  but at safeguarding stability in the world. Like firemen, NATO  is organized and disciplines, that is why we trust NATO.    Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania altogether can set up a  peacekeeping battalion. The tragedy of Yugoslavia proves once  again that a calm Europe is being born painfully.    Interfax: How do you see the resolution of the problem of  non-native residents of Estonia, those who are not citizens of  the republic?    Meri: I think politicians should answer this question. The  attitude to citizenship is the right and the duty of every human  being, it is a very intimate feeling. Let everybody decide  which country he likes more in his heart. There have been  mistakes on both sides concerning this issue. Some Russian  politicians are trying to speak on behalf of Russians,  Ukrainians, Georgians living in Estonia and to speak in their  defense. Let me remind that such position caused contradictory  attitude of these very people, many of who are descendants of  Estonian citizens.    When people say that non-Estonians should defend their  rights  in Estonia, I ask: which rights in particular? This question  is hard to answer for our opponents and for us. It is good that  our northern phlegmatic character allowed us to put this dispute  into a calm and civilized path.     "

A Government Source Comments on a Presidential Edict  Abolishing Export Quotas and Licensing""]    [Text] After the edict canceling export quotas and  licensing has been adopted, the role of special exporters will  increase substantially, a government source who asked not to be  identified said in an interview with NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA.  Because even now the oil pipeline is operating at full  capacity, the abolition of oil quotas and licenses without  abolishing the special exporter status effectively gives the  advantage of ""getting into the pipe"" to those companies which  have benefited from their status in the past. However,  considering that the oil pipe does not stretch like rubber, it  can be assumed that if special exporters were also abolished,  bribes and connections would be used, which would lead to a  civil war over the oil pipelines.    Experts are rather critical of the edict on cancellation of  duties and quotas. Thus, some politicians believe that the  edict is nonviable. Others (including NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  source) point to the edict's equivocal wording which will lend  itself to different interpretations by specialists.    In fact the presidential edict annulled Appendix 1 to last  year's government resolution ""On Liberalizing Foreign Economic  Activity"" which laid down procedures for quantity regulation and  licensing. Commenting at NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's request on the  new trade scheme, the source noted that it is clear already:  Military equipment, dual-purpose goods, gold, and precious  stones will be subject to licensing and quantity regulation.  Furthermore, under the presidential edict, international  delivery quotas, established from outside, will remain on  aluminum and textiles.    ""Much will depend on the interpretation which the government  puts on the edict in its resolutions,"" the source said. ""At  present it is difficult to say definitely what the edict's  implications will be or how they will impact on the business  climate in Russia and foreign investments.""    Earlier, Deputy Foreign Economic Relations Minister Andrey  Dogayev said that the state will regulate trade through six to  seven domestically produced goods, including deliveries within  the framework of ""external quotas"" under international  agreements.    Incidentally, a joint statement by the government and the  Central Bank provides for the cabinet's obligation to lift  restrictions on all commodities with the exception of crude oil,  diesel fuel, electricity, nickel, aluminum, and copper,  restrictions on which, according to the statement, will be  lifted at the end of 1994.

Effective security  measures have been taken to protect him. Weizman was invited by  President Demirel. His arrival in Ankara is regarded as his  first visit to a foreign country after he was elected to serve  as Israel's president.    The officials in Ankara and Tel Aviv have described his  visit  as vital. Meanwhile, Weizman has said that his first visit to  Turkey is very important for Israel.    It is common knowledge that the relations between Ankara and  Tel Aviv have improved noticeably in the economic and military  fields during the past few years. It is also common knowledge  that the Zionist regime and the Turkish Government have  maintained high-level relations for a long time. Turkey was the  first Islamic country to officially recognize Israel on 28 March  1949.    President Demirel has said that the objective behind  Weizman's visit is the improvement of relations between Ankara  and Tel Aviv, which have existed since 1948. Several experts  have linked the improvement of relations between Turkey and  Israel to their common interests, stressing that the  geopolitical conditions in the Middle East after the agreement  the PLO reached with Israel have given momentum to the relations  between the two countries.    Meanwhile, the Zionist officials believe that the  strengthening of the Islamic movements in the Middle East pose a  threat to Israel's security. In fact, Prime Minister Rabin has  recently described the Islamic movements in the region as a  threat to the Middle East peace process.    Tel Aviv is convinced that Turkey plays an important role in  the region not only because it supports the Zionist regime but  also because it is an Islamic country governed by a secular  administration and has significant water resources and advanced  technology, which enables it to manufacture F-16 aircraft. As  such, Turkey can meet Israel's vital needs. For example, it can  supply water to Israel.    It has been reported that Demirel and Weizman have held  talks  on the joint use of water resources in the region, developments  in the Middle East, the agreement between the PLO and Israel,  and the improvement of bilateral cooperation between the two  countries.    However, considering a possible reaction by Turkey's Islamic  people, the Turkish officials must try to find a logical  explanation for the recent improvement of relations between  Ankara and Tel Aviv.

At a weekly press conference on Thursday [28 April], Chinese  Foreign Ministry's Wu Jianmin made the statement in response to  the U.S. adoption of a new legislation.    The modified Murkowski Amendment was adopted ten days ago by  the joint conference of the U.S. Senate and the House of  Representatives. The document asserts that the Taiwan Relations  Act takes primacy over the 1982 Sino-U.S. Joint Communique in  which the two governments pledged to resolve the issue of U.S.  arms sales to Taiwan. Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin  criticized the American legislation, saying its essence negates  the bilateral communique. Wu Jianmin said the modified  amendment not only undermines the relations between the two  countries, but sets up obstacles to the reunification of China's  Mainland and Taiwan. He urged the U.S. Government to abide by  the guiding principle governing bilateral ties and take  immediate measures to keep Sino-U.S. relations from serious harm.    On another issue concerning the U.S., spokesman Wu Jianmin  expressed opposition to a reported meeting between President  Bill Clinton and the Dalai Lama. Wu Jianmin said Dalai is not  only a religious leader, but a political exile. And for a long  time, he has engaged in activities aiming to split China.  Therefore, the spokesman concluded any official meeting with  the Dalai Lama is an act of support for a separatist attempt and  amounts to an interference in China's domestic affairs.    The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman also dismissed the  linkage between the MFN [most-favored nation] status and China's  nuclear tests. Reports say some American legislators have  warned that China's continued nuclear testing will do no good to  the likelihood of the U.S. extending its tariff privileges. The  spokesman said: among the world's five nuclear states, China has  conducted the smallest number of nuclear tests, which account  for only four percent of U.S. testing.    Finally, Wu Jianmin described the report that China has sent  an additional 30,000 troops to Tibet and deployed them along the  border with India as a sheer fabrication. Wu Jianmin said such  a report has an ulterior motive. He said China and India signed  an agreement on the maintenance of peace and tranquility last  year and have begun to negotiate on troop reduction along the  line of actual control    For China Radio International, I am (Li Peiquan).

Speaking to theologians in a mosque here Wednesday night, he  said ""despite all efforts launched by the U.S. to conspire  against the Islamic Republic of Iran, Iran's policies formulated  by the late Imam Khomeyni are successfully going ahead.""    Rowhani who is the chief of Majles Foreign Policy Committee  and the leader's representative at SNSC, said the United States  has suffered defeat in post-Soviet era in international and  regional arena and after the admission by Russia that they have  failed in their plans.    He said the hard efforts of the U.S. to persuade Europe and  Japan not to cooperate with Iran in economic and commercial  areas have failed. He deplored the U.S. for raising a ballyhoo  on Iran's foreign debts by giving unrealistic figures which he  said had failed to reach anywhere.    Answering a question on Iran's relations with the  neighbouring countries, Rowhani said ties with Turkey are  satisfactory. In light of national and security issues, Turkey  has no other way but to maintain growing relations with Iran and  ""we welcome friendly relations with Ankara.""    On relations with Iraq, he said if grounds are provided for  Iraq in the international arena, Baghdad would be willing to  consolidate ties with Tehran. However, he added, it was Iran's  natural right to respond severely to the armed attempts by  counterrevolutionary groups outside the borders.    On ties with the Persian Gulf littoral states, he said Iran  employed logical ways is to settle its problems with these  states in order to foil U.S. attempts to bring discord into the  Persian Gulf.    He described Iran's relations with Pakistan as excellent and  on Afghanistan, he said Iran was the only mediator in the  conflict. He said the prospect of relations with Afghanistan  was promising.    On the fall in oil prices, he said lower oil prices can  prompt a new mechanism to cut off dependence on oil and pave the  way for economic growth through non-oil exports.    Rowhani said Iran's non-oil exports reached dlrs. 5,000  million [figure as received] this year. The figure is expected  to reach dlrs. [dollars] 6,000 million next year, he said.    He put emphasis on Iran's relations with Saudi Arabia and  said issues including oil, presence of foreign forces in the  Persian Gulf, and Hajj pilgrimage entitled Tehran to strengthen  mutual relations with Riyadh.

The communique came at the end of four days of talks here  between Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)  and its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).    While a ""high-level of understanding"" had been reached on  certain issues, further efforts are needed to overcome remaining  differences ""so as to reach a written agreement as soon as  possible,"" said the communique, signed by SEF and ARATS  vice-chairmen Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shubei.    Both sides have agreed to hold further working-level  negotiations in Beijing during the last 10 days of March. Any  agreement arising from those talks will then be signed in Taipei  by the two vice-chairmen.    In a clear reference to the thorny question of Taiwan  handing  over mainland hijackers, the communique said only that a degree  of consensus had been reached on the need to repatriate those  who crossed the Taiwan Strait illegally.    The word ""hijackers"" was noticeably absent from the text,  indicating continuing disagreement over the key issues of  jurisdiction and sovereignty that have dominated the divisive  repatriation dispute.    While both sides agree in principle that mainland Chinese  who  divert planes to the Nationalist island should eventually be  repatriated, Beijing is unwilling to recognise Taipei's rights  of jurisdiction in dealing with the hijackers.    China views Taiwan as a renegade province and refuses to  take  any steps that may be construed as a recognition of the island  as a political entity.    However, Tang had said Thursday that the latest negotiations  had seen ""differences shrinking"" over repatriation, illegal  immigrants and fishing disputes.    The communique stressed that future negotiations should  focus  on the practicalities of cross-Strait relations and avoid  sensitive legal or political issues.    According to the communique, the March talks will focus on  combatting piracy, strengthening intellectual property rights  and enhancing judicial cooperation.    They will also discuss a second summit meeting between the  SEF and ARATS chairmen, Ku Chen-fu and Wang Daohan, who last met  in Singapore in April.    Both sides also agreed to promote scientific and  technological exchanges and reciprocal visits by Chinese and  Taiwan journalists.    Chinese nationalists fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a  civil war to the communists on the mainland. Beijing and Taipei  both claim to be the legitimate government of all China.     "

In practice, the Clinton Administration's foreign  policy has undergone several adjustments. At the start, it was a  Tarnoff doctrine. Later, it was an enlargement strategy, and  then six strategic priorities.    The United States is still exploring how to define its  position in the post-Cold War world. In such exploration, an  inevitable question is how to adapt America's foreign policy  ideas to the reality of the contemporary multipolar and diverse  world.    In early 1993 when Clinton assumed the presidency, he was  confronted with a grim situation both at home and abroad. The  post-Cold War world was filled with complex, volatile, and  uncertain factors. The Western economy remained in the doldrums  on the whole. In the United States, there were innumerable  economic and social problems. Quite common among the public was  the introversive feeling that ""we have only to sweep the snow at  our doors and not bother about the frost on others' roofs."" As  regards the role to be played by the United States in the  post-Cold War era, divergent views existed among various  circles, and no consensus could be reached.    Over the past year, Clinton has firmly taken the  reinvigoration of the American economy as the central task. His  foreign policy has shown the heritage of the past as well as  something new created by himself. The heritage finds expression  mainly in his upholding America's leading role in the world,  stressing the need to maintain a strong national defense despite  the reduction of the armed forces and military spending, giving  generous assistance to Russia, and promoting the peace process  in the Middle East.    The new part of Clinton's foreign policy reflects both the  salient features of the post-Cold War era and the characteristic  tradition of the Democratic Party. The past year has seen a  painstaking course traversed by the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy, with achievements as well as faults and  setbacks. Accordingly, the policy has been continuously adjusted  in the course of practice.    I. Five Basic Ideas Characterizing the Clinton  Administration's Foreign Policy    1. Ensuring U.S. economic security as a primary pillar  of U.S. foreign policy. Clinton and his foreign-policy team  have all along taken the reinvigoration of the U.S. economy and  the promotion of world economic development as the central goal  of the foreign policy. For instance, Clinton's efforts at the  July 1993 summit meeting of the G-7 nations in Tokyo brought  about an industrial products market access agreement among the  U.S. and European countries and Japan. Later, he made all-out  efforts to win Congress approval for the North American Free  Trade Agreement. In November, he officiated the APEC ministerial  conference and held informal meetings with leaders of the APEC  members in Seattle. And, finally, he managed to conclude  successfully the seven-year-old Uruguay Round of GATT talks  before the 15 December 1993 deadline. As U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher said, Clinton's above-mentioned activities  plus his plan to cut the U.S. deficit by $500 billion within  five years constitute the ""integral elements of the most  ambitious international economic agenda that any President has  undertaken in almost half a century.""[.sup]1[/]    In foreign trade, the Clinton Administration stresses a  ""fair  trade"" principle in opening overseas markets to boost U.S.  exports and increase employment at home. It has taken a firm  stand in trade talks and, on many occasions, even resorted to  unilateral sanctions, which have led to serious confrontation  with its allies, including European countries and Japan. In  addition, the Clinton Administration has adopted an  export-oriented national strategy of ""less aid to foreign  countries and more trade development,"" ""linking aid to foreign  countries with trade promotion,"" and ""relaxing restrictions on  exports of certain high-tech products."" As a result, more world  markets were opened to American products in 1993 than at any  time in the last two generations.[.sup]2[/]    2. An apparent shift of foreign policy priorities to  the Asia-Pacific region. In recent years, the trade volume  between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has  accounted for 40 percent of America's total foreign trade and  exceeded its trade with Western Europe by 50 percent. East Asia  contains the most dynamic economies in the world. Historically,  the United States fought in three wars in Asia during the last  50 years, while more and more Asian immigrants have served to  ""enrich America's cultural and economic mosaic.""[.sup]3[/]  For this reason, Christopher said: ""No area of the world will be  more important for American interests than the Asia-Pacific  region."" ""It is thus crucial to the President's domestic  agenda.""[.sup]4[/] Winston Lord, Assistant Secretary of State  for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, also made the remark that  ""the Clinton Administration has elevated Asia's importance and,  in short, Asia is now more important than ever.""[.sup]5[/]  This is why Clinton's first overseas trip was to Asia and he  proposed the establishment of a ""New Pacific Community.""  Christopher made three visits to Asia within one year, and on  his visit to ASEAN countries, he clearly expressed the intention  to get positively involved in the multilateral Asian security  dialogue following the ASEAN ministerial meeting. Taking the  opportunity of the APEC conference in Seattle, the United States  sponsored informal meetings with the leaders of the countries  concerned. The meetings deepened the U.S. cooperative relations  with the Asian-Pacific countries and promoted the APEC's  development. In addition, the Clinton Administration has  maintained the U.S. troops in the Asia-Pacific region at the  same 100,000-strong level as in Europe. It is with such a  background that the Clinton Administration has ""recognized  China's obvious importance in bilateral, regional, and global  partnership.""[.sup]6[/] In September 1993, Clinton himself  made a decision to proceed with ""all-round contacts,"" raise the  level of dialogues, and develop extensive exchanges with China.  In November, a U.S.-China summit took place in Seattle, the  first such official meeting since 1989. This meeting helped  improve the relations between the two countries.    3. Promotion of Western democracy and human rights  worldwide raised to the height of one of the three pillars of  U.S. foreign policy. There are several reasons for this:  First, stressing the promotion of democracy and human rights is  a historical tradition of the Democratic Party. Second, the  United States regards its victory in the Cold War as a triumph  of its ideology and values. As Clinton once said, ""our greatest  strength is the power of our ideas.""[.sup]7[/] Third, after  the Cold War, the United States has no arch enemy and needs to  uphold an ideological banner as a major instrument to maintain  its rallying force at home and abroad. For these reasons, the  Clinton Administration has put forth an ""enlargement strategy""  to enlarge worldwide ""the community of market democracies"" as a  U.S. global strategy to replace the ""containment strategy"" of  the Cold War era. To carry out its democracy and human rights  policy, the Clinton Administration has applied pressure through  bilateral and multilateral channels, by means of ideological  infiltration through cultural exchanges, and by using assistance  and most-favored-nation treatment to foreign countries and the  State Department's annual human rights reports. It has even set  up so-called ""free"" radio stations of one kind or another to  conduct subversive agitation and propaganda in an effort to  unscrupulously intervene in others' internal affairs.    4. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and  their vehicle missiles viewed as a practical and primary threat  to U.S. national security; prevention of arms proliferation put  to the fore in the U.S. foreign policy and regarded as ""one of  the most urgent priorities of the U.S. national  commitments.""[.sup]8[/] This involves two principal  tasks: One is to make every effort to remove the threats from  the massive nuclear weapons kept by Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,  and Kazakhstan. The other is to prevent nuclear, biological, and  chemical weapons and missiles from proliferating to those Third  World countries that the United States believes are the most  dangerous. To this end, the United States has used both the  carrot and the stick. It has either used the tactics of  improving bilateral relations and providing aid or resorted to  sanctions as a threat and punishment. The Clinton Administration  is trying to consolidate the system of nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons, conclude a treaty of comprehensive ban to all  nuclear testing, and establish a sound ""missile technology  control mechanism"" by 1996. In the eyes of the Clinton  Administration, ""the most urgent arms-control issue in the  1990's is to fight the long-term threat caused by arms  proliferation.""[.sup]9[/]    5. The United Nations and other international  organizations are utilized to promote so-called  multilateralism. The purpose of multilateralism advanced by  the United States is to achieve its foreign policy goals while  dividing the burden among nations to remedy its own financial  and material deficiencies. Also, if action must be taken, the  United States will be ""in a legal position"" to do so, and it  will be easy to win support from the American public. In June  1993, Madelenine Albright, chief of the U.S. Mission to the  United Nations, further stressed that multilateral engagement  must be led by the United States and become an ""assertive  multilateralism""; otherwise, it cannot serve America's goals  well and may even damage major U.S. interests.[.sup]10[/] In  this regard, the Clinton Administration particularly underscores  the important role of the United Nations and, in actual fact,  regards it as ""a major means of the U.S. foreign  policy.""[.sup]11[/] Because of this, Christopher visited the  UN Headquarters in New York and called on Secretary General  Boutros Ghali shortly after he took office. It was also for this  reason that the U.S. Mission to the United Nations has been  extremely active. In particular, the Clinton Administration  attaches importance to the UN peace-keeping function in dealing  with regional conflicts. If necessary, Christopher said, the  United States will act alone, but if at all possible, it will  deal with problems in a multilateral way and prefer to act  together with others.[.sup]12[/] This is precisely the policy  the United States pursues in dealing with the issues of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, and Haiti. Under the U.S. powerful  impetus, the UN peace-keeping operation has expanded from five  missions, less than 10,000 troops and military observers, and a  $233 million expenditure in 1987 to 13 missions, 75,000 troops,  and an expenditure as high as $3 billion in 1993, resulting in a  hard-to-bear burden on the United Nations.    Three Adjustments in the Clinton Administration's Diplomatic  Practice    (1) Appearance of the ""Tarnoff Doctrine""    The first major test faced by the Clinton Administration  with  respect to foreign policy was how to deal with the armed clashes  among the three factions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the  beginning, Clinton took a firm stand and directed the spearhead  of pressure at the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serbia  Republic. In addition to stepping up economic sanctions,  establishing an international court to prosecute ""ethnic  cleansing"" criminals, setting up no-fly zones, and air dropping  relief supplies, he made two proposals: lifting the arms embargo  on the Muslim force and launching air strikes on Serb positions.  But, due to the opposition within the U.S. Government,  especially from the military, plus the strong objection by its  NATO allies such as Britain and France, the Clinton  Administration later took a retreat policy and shelved these two  proposals. The U.S. hesitation and vacillation on the  Bosnia-Herzegovina issue induced doubt and perplexity at home  and abroad. On May 1993, U.S. Under Secretary of State for  Political Affairs Peter Tarnoff made a candid statement to the  press. He stated unequivocally that the Clinton Administration's  stand and action on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue were by no  means an expedient move, but manifested a new basic policy:  Limited by its financial and material resources, the United  States must now concentrate its efforts primarily on developing  the economy. It can no longer assume a leading role everywhere  as in the Cold War era. Instead, the U.S. involvement in  regional conflicts must be commensurate with the threat to its  interests. With regard to the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue, which is  primarily a European question, the United States has no  intention of acting unilaterally; it is necessary to take  concerted action with the European allies playing a main role.  This is the ""Tarnoff Doctrine"" foreign policy later so-called by  the U.S. press. Originally, the ""Tarnoff Doctrine"" represented a  selective-engagement and proper-retreat policy that the Clinton  Administration tried to implement to cope with the new post-Cold  War situation. Yet, because of its improper presentation and the  inopportune time (when Clinton had some failings in domestic  affairs), this kind of statement just helped intensify the image  of weakness of Clinton's leadership, added to the growth of  isolationism at home, and produced a harmful effect on America's  ""leading position"" in the world. Under such circumstances, it  was immediately denied by the authorities.    (2) Presentation of the ""enlargement strategy""    Since then, the Clinton Administration has not only stressed  in words that ""the United States must play a leading role in the  world; this is the core of Clintonism,""[.sup]13[/] but taken  deliberate actions to show America's strong image and active  engagement in international affairs. Chief among them are: At  the Tokyo summit of the G-7 nations, the United States displayed  a leading role in reducing deficits, promoting the Uruguay Round  negotiations, and developing the world economy. It promoted and  organized the Western action to aid Russia. It launched a sudden  raid on the Intelligence Building in Iraq's capital to show its  determination and ability to act unilaterally. It decided to  send 300 troops to Macedonia to prevent the spread of the  conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina and promised to send as large a  peace-keeping force as 25,000 men to the area after the factions  involved have reached a peace agreement that they are willing to  abide by. In Somalia, it expanded the role of the UN  peace-keeping force and the U.S. troops, saying that their  mission is not only to provide humanitarian relief but also to  build a local police force and restore the country's order. With  regard to banning arms proliferation, it took a strong stance  and imposed blockades and sanctions against other countries. In  the Middle East, its active mediation eased the problems  aggravated by the incident of Lebanese violence and sustained  the peace talks. And Christopher personally led a U.S.  delegation to the UN human rights conference and launched an  offensive against some Third World countries on the issue of  human rights.    These U.S. actions have scored some achievements. The most  remarkable one was the signing on 13 September 1993 in  Washington of a Declaration of Peace Principles between  Palestine and Israel for self-government of the Gaza Strip and  the Jericho area. On the other hand, setbacks were encountered  and prices paid. The most prominent was that bloody clashes  continued in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, for this, the United  States and its European allies criticized each other scathingly.  In Somalia, armed clashes intensified between the UN  peace-keeping force and the United Somali Congress, leading to  casualties of the peace-keeping troops, American servicemen  included. This immediately triggered a strong voice at home,  demanding the withdrawal of American troops from that country.    With this background, Secretary of State Warren Christopher,  Assistant to the President for National Security Anthony Lake,  Chief of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations Madelene  Albright, and President Clinton, one after another, made four  attention-drawing speeches in late September 1993. Two notable  ideas were set forth. One was the ""enlargement strategy""  expounded by Lake. It consists of four points: 1) consolidating  cooperation and unity among those democracies that have  instituted the market system as a core force in carrying out  this strategy; 2) actively supporting nascent forces that are  building market-based democracies--i.e., Russia, central and  East European countries, and other CIS states; 3) isolating  diplomatically, economically, militarily, and technologically  those states hostile to the market and democratic systems and  prompting those non-democratic countries that have adopted the  market mechanism to advance toward democracy; and 4) providing  humanitarian aid to developing countries suffering bitterly from  natural disasters or man-made calamities and prompting them to  develop markets and democracy.[.sup]14[/]    The other idea was prominently reflected in the following  passage in Clinton's address to the United Nations General  Assembly: ""The United Nations simply cannot become engaged in  every one of the world's conflicts. If the American people are  to say `yes' to UN peacekeeping, the United Nations must know  when to say `no.'""[.sup]15[/] From now on, he said, the  United States will ask some rigorous questions before deciding  on whether to take part in a peace-keeping operation. Examples  of the questions are how much threat is posed to peace, whether  the peace-keeping mission has a clear objective, whether an end  point can be identified for the mission, and how much the  mission will cost. In people's eyes, this is a retreat from the  original U.S. miltilateralist stand of vigorously advocating the  reliance on UN peace-keeping operations to deal with issues of  regional conflicts.    The above-mentioned ""enlargement strategy"" and the selective  peace-keeping operations reflect the confusion and  self-contradiction of the U.S. foreign policy ideas. On the one  hand, it has a great ambitious goal. On the other hand, it feels  that it has limited methods and is incapable in practice. As a  commentary published in a U.S. newspaper puts it well, ""the  Clinton Administration's difficulty lies in how to preserve  America's traditional leadership while minimizing its  international commitments so as to concentrate its efforts on  domestic affairs.""[.sup]16[/]    Shortly after Clinton's above address, the U.S. and UN  peace-keeping operation suffered a serious setback in Somalia.  In a combat on 3 October, 18 U.S. soldiers were killed, and  another several dozens were wounded. The U.S. military personnel  sent to Haiti to restore the democratic order were rebuffed and  forced to come back before landing. At that time, U.S. public  opinion vied to criticize the government. Representative Frank  McCloskey of the House Foreign Affairs Committee wrote an  article openly asking Christopher to resign. Meanwhile, the  acute difference between the United States and its European  allies in the Uruguay Round negotiations threw their relations  to an all-time low. And the U.S. relations with some Third World  countries also kept deteriorating.    (3) ""Six strategic priorities"" put forth by  Christopher    Under these circumstances, the U.S. Government once again  reviewed and reexamined its foreign policy. On 4 November when  testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  Christopher delivered another important speech, setting forth  ""six strategic priorities"" for the U.S. foreign policy and the  ""realistic principles"" for dealing with regional conflicts. The  contents and order of the six strategic priorities are as  follows: 1) ensuring U.S. economic security; 2) supporting the  political and economic reforms in Russia and other CIS members;  3) revitalizing NATO to meet the challenges faced by Europe  under the new circumstances; 4) enhancing ties and cooperation  with the Asia-Pacific region--this includes the ""U.S. efforts to  work out a comprehensive relationship with China that permits  resolution of differences in a broad, strategic context""; 5)  advancing on the basis of the breakthroughs made in the  Arab-Israel peace process and trying to bring about an overall  and lasting peace in the Middle East; and 6) promoting the  nuclear nonproliferation principle worldwide and solving other  global questions.    In dealing with regional conflicts such as those in Haiti,  Somalia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the U.S. general guideline is:  The U.S. role and the extent of its involvement will need to be  informed by a strict assessment of its own interests and the  interests of others. It must examine every case--asking rigorous  questions and giving measured answers--to find the course  commensurate with U.S. interests. ""The United States will not  attempt to force a settlement on Bosnia militarily. No imposed  settlement would endure,"" Christopher pointed out  unequivocally.[.sup]17[/] It seems that his testimony  reflects a relatively pragmatic attitude now taken by the  Clinton Administration. In action, this attitude is essentially  reflected in two ways: One, the Clinton Administration is more  able to face up its mistakes and has made a more appropriate  policy adjustment. Two, it pays attention to using dialogues and  consultations to reduce naked suppressive action.    The Clinton Administration Still Exploring How To Define  U.S. Position in the World    In a February 1993 article entitled ""Clinton and the World,""  Dr. Henry Kissinger said that Clinton's task is to find a role  for the United States to play in a world that it can neither  dominate nor simply withdraw from.[.sup]18[/] Generally  speaking, the Clinton Administration's diplomatic practice over  the past year seemed to ""zigzag"" on the road to explore how to  do this. The ""Tarnoff Doctrine"" at the inception was a  not-so-successful attempt to ""retreat"" and ""shrink."" The  subsequent ""enlargement strategy"" was aimed at reestablishing  the U.S. dominance in the world as a general guiding principle  for the American foreign policy. Yet the ruthless reality gave a  lesson to this principle. As Charles Maynes, chief editor of the  U.S. quarterly FOREIGN POLICY, commented in an article, ""the  United States must recognize the ruthless reality that even a  superpower will become exhausted in trying to act as a world  police."" Under the current U.S. situation marked by a strained  financial budget and a shrinking military force, the adoption of  the ""enlargement strategy"" ""seems to be marching toward  shouldering unlimited new responsibilities rather than limiting  the U.S. commitments.""[.sup]19[/] So the ""six strategic  priorities"" and the realistic principle for dealing with  regional conflicts were put forward in an attempt to resume  America's relatively pragmatic status in the world. Of course,  regardless of the adjustments, the above-mentioned five major  foreign policy ideas remain in the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy. At this time, it appears that the United States  is still in the process of exploring how to define its position  in the post-Cold War world.    Nonetheless, it should be noted that an inevitable question  in this exploration is how to adapt the U.S. foreign policy  ideas to the multipolarization trend and diversification reality  in the contemporary world. An obstacle to such adaption is the  traditional U.S. concept that its foreign policy should serve  the American values. As I see it, while United States is fully  entitled to believe in and publicize its values, it has no right  at all to impose its values on others. Nor does it have any  right to press other countries and interfere in their internal  affairs in various ways in an attempt to create a global order  and peace under the rule of the United States. This is the key  reason for the sharpening contradictions between the United  States and many Third World countries. It is also a main cause  leading to unrest in the world. There is no exaggeration if we  attribute such contradictions and unrest to the hegemonism and  power politics contained in the U.S. foreign policy.  Footnotes    1.

UNION RALLY PLANNED      By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SACRAMENTO      A bill aimed at cracking down on the latest proliferation of garment sweatshops  in the Orange and Los Angeles counties is heading to Gov. George Deukmejian's  desk.    The International Ladies' Garment Workers Union announced Friday that it would  stage a rally in the Los Angeles garment district next week calling on the  governor to approve the bill.    On Thursday, the Senate approved the bill 21 to 12, the minimum required for  passage. The measure, sponsored by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-West Los Angeles),  would make designer-name, garment-industry sweatshops, which employ underage  children and immigrants at sub-minimum wages, responsible for labor abuses  committed by their independent suppliers.    The bill was introduced in March after a series of articles in The Times  revealed that many independent contractors still run sweatshops paying as  little as $1.45 an hour to children and immigrants, including Southeast Asians  relocating to such Orange County communities as Garden Grove, Santa Ana and  Westminster.    Under provisions of the bill, name-brand clothing manufacturers would be held  ""jointly liable"" for labor and safety violations committed by their  subcontractors, many of whom pay immigrant children and women by the piece of  clothing sewn in their homes or in crowded, fire-prone shops.    Depending on the complexity of the job and the speed of the stitcher, the piece  rate often translates into less than the California minimum wage of $4.25 an  hour.    Hayden had predicted that his bill would pass the Legislature and said the  biggest test would be whether Deukmejian would sign it into law.    Linda Kerrigan, a spokesman for the Department of Industrial Relations, which  is responsible for state labor-law enforcement, said the agency has remained  neutral through the legislative debate and has not yet decided whether to  recommend that the governor sign or veto the bill.    Steve Nutter, regional director for the garment workers' union, on Friday  called the bill ""more of a human rights issue than a labor issue."" He said the  union will seek a meeting with the governor to urge him to approve the measure.    The bill's passage comes as the Industrial Relations Department, whose budget  for labor-law enforcement has already been slashed, faces another $7-million  shortfall as a result of the current budget crisis, a situation, Nutter said,  that opens the door to rampant abuses.    ""I would imagine the amount of time actually spent doing garment industry  enforcement is small indeed, much smaller than 10 years ago,"" Nutter added.

The treaty's approval has put an end to rising speculation  in  the international community about Brazil's real commitment to  using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in light of the fact  that the bill was only approved after difficult discussions took  place in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.    The German Government has conveyed satisfaction over the  Senate's endorsement of the special inspections to be conducted  by the IAEA, which will control the movement of nuclear  materials to and from Brazilian facilities. In remarks to  GAZETA MERCANTIL, a German Embassy source said: ""It is a  positive step, but we are still awaiting the approval of the  amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty on nuclear nonproliferation  in Latin America and the Caribbean."" The Tlatelolco Treaty will  be discussed after the Carnival celebrations. The source added:  The nuclear issue will no longer be a problem for the visit  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim is scheduled to make to Germany on  23 February.    In recent months, Germany has expressed great interest in  the  approval of the nuclear agreements by the Brazilian Congress  because a German law will only authorize international  cooperation in sensitive technology with countries that are  signatories of comprehensive safeguards agreements with the  IAEA. The deadline for the recipient country to meet this  requirement expires late next year.    Foreign Minister Amorim also expressed satisfaction with the  Senate vote that, in his opinion, clears the way for developed  countries to provide technological cooperation to Brazil.    Amorim also noted that the quadripartite agreement is more  important than the Tlatelolco amendments -- which have yet to be  approved -- for the international community because the  Tlatelolco Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons in Latin America,  is applicable only to the region. Both Amorim and the German  Embassy have expressed confidence that the Tlatelolco amendments  will be approved in the next few weeks.    Argentina, which is Brazil's partner in peaceful nuclear  projects because they both set up ABACC, also has welcomed the  agreement's approval. A Buenos Aires source said: ""The image  of the two countries, particularly on the nuclear issue, will  improve."" The Argentine Congress already had approved both the  quadripartite agreement and the Tlatelolco amendments some time  ago.     "

""It is not a question of making a payment in order to throw  people out. I simply said that compensation could be given for  the transfer (of sovereignty). This is quite normal throughout  the world where this type of transfer has occurred. Although  there have not been many such transfers, there has always been  economic compensation,"" Di Tella said in a radio interview.    The foreign minister had stressed in an interview that he  granted to the British newspaper THE FINANCIAL TIMES that the  Argentine Government would be willing to ""consider financial  compensation"" for the Malvinas residents ""in view of the  psychological distress that would affect them when they handed  over the sovereignty of the islands.""    In view of the repercussions regarding these remarks, Di  Tella made it clear that the proposal to compensate the Kelpers  [preceding word in English] ""is part of a much more complex  negotiation"" between the involved parties.    ""The consideration that must be taken into account first is  how to deal with the way of life of the islanders. If this does  not come first, ""the issue of compensation will seem to be  offensive. The economic part, which also exists and which I  believe to be very important, would come after that,"" Di Tella  said when referring to the government's proposal.    Through the constitutional reform that is under way, the  2,000 Malvinas residents could obtain the legal status of a  ""minority"" and this would legally guarantee respect for their  language, religion, and customs.    This is established in a draft bill that the Foreign  Ministry  is studying and that the executive branch will presumably submit  to the Constituent Assembly, which is sitting in the city of  Santa Fe. The so-called Kelpers [preceding word in English]  would then be considered Argentine citizens, although with the  status of a ""minority"" with their own characteristics as is the  case with the indigenous peoples or the members of some foreign  communities.    The initiative is being developed by officials, politicians,  and technicians of the Foreign Ministry headed by Di Tella on  the basis of a proposal made by Justicialist Party Deputies  Carlos Branda and Florencio Acenolaza. Acenolaza is the  president of the Foreign Relations Committee.     "

Thus, Cisneros answered a series of criticisms by expert  Federico Ruiz Guinazu, who maintained that ""the Foreign Ministry  is mistaken regarding the Malvinas"" because it does not center  its demands on the basis of ""sound rights that must be  reiterated repeatedly.""    Cisneros stresses: ""Isolation alienated the country from the  world's centers of power, it caused a confrontation with the  United States at an immense cost, and it systematically  alienated it from the rest of Latin America; although the  country tried to establish a minimum of ties with the  continent's countries, in the end we ended up clearly being the  unpopular party.""    He defended the current policy when he indicated that Brazil  and Chile had never been ""potential partners because they had  always been two of our hypothetical military opponents.""    The Malvinas was the third hypothesis, ""which ended up with  the country embarking on a war with the country that is the  owner of the world's third-largest navy, an ally of the planet's  most powerful nation, a policy-making partner in NATO [acronym  given in English], and a permanent member of the UN Security  Council.""    The official highlighted the fact that currently trade with  Chile has tripled in view of reciprocal investment amounting to  several million dollars, and that Brazil ""is the main purchaser,  the second- largest supplier, and it is a partner in a common  market [Common Market of the South], together with two other  members, that will change the region's history.""    Regarding the Malvinas, Cisneros maintains that in this  matter ""a community of interests and the joint exploitation of  resources that will, in time, provide the basis of coexistence  that one day will help in agreeing to a non-traumatic transfer  of sovereignty"" is currently being sought.    ""The negotiating alternative evolves, not from the  replacement of the law, but as a second stage that is logically  the continuation of the basically legitimate alternative, which  for 50 years has demonstrated that it is capable of obtaining  the justification for us, but not the islands."" Cisneros said in  a signed note to a Buenos Aires morning newspaper.    In this respect, he indicated that Argentina has always  pointedly and efficiently demanded Argentina's rights over the  islands at each and every one of the appropriate forums.     "

By WILLIAM D.

A terse one-paragraph announcement ended a 40-year rupture begun with the  triumph of communism in Romania after World War II. Relations will be resumed  at full ambassadorial level, the Vatican said, without naming the envoys to be  exchanged.    The return of an official Vatican presence in Eastern Europe has quickly  followed the fall of communism there. The process began last July when  relations were restored with Pope John Paul II's native Poland.    So far this year, relations have been resumed with Hungary, which the Pope will  visit in 1991, and with Czechoslovakia, which he visited last month. Official  ties have also been resumed with the Soviet Union, although not yet at  ambassadorial level, in the wake of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's  visit to the Vatican last December.    There is no sign yet of renewed links between the Holy See and Bulgaria and  Albania, but neither has ever had full diplomatic relations with the Vatican.  Both are officially atheist, and neither has a large Roman Catholic population.    In Romania, relations were broken by an insurgent Communist government in July,  1950, which gave the Vatican nuncio 72 hours to leave the country. They are  being resumed by the government that succeeded dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who  was executed last Christmas Day during a popular uprising.    By the Vatican's count, there are 1.4 million Roman Catholics in Romania today,  and some 1.5 million followers of the Byzantine or Eastern rite affiliated with  Rome.    Of Romania's 23 million residents, about 18 million are members of the Romanian  Orthodox Church, which was tolerated by and cooperated closely with the  government under Communist rule that began in 1948.    As in the Soviet Union, Byzantine rite churches in Romania were officially  incorporated into the Orthodox Church under Communist rule, and Orthodox  bishops seized the cathedrals of Roman Catholic bishops, according to the  Catholic Almanac. More than 50 priests were executed, and another 200 died in  prison.    In March, John Paul named seven Latin rite bishops and five Byzantine rite  bishops to restore the Romanian church hierarchy to its pre-Communist level.

Bilateral economic and technological cooperation situation    1) Chinese joint venture enterprises in Indonesia.    Some 84 Sino-Indonesian joint ventures have been set up in  Indonesia since reestablishment of relations which have the  approval of Indonesia's Investment Committee or of China's  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade  [MOFERT--organization name as published], of which, 23 have been  approved by the latter organization and officially have informed  our office; seven have been approved by the former organization  and officially have informed our office. Chinese investment  agreements approved by MOFERT amount to $11.0025 million. The  primary means of Chinese investment is by introducing equipment,  manufacturing technology, set up and debugging, and conducting  training, which account for approximately 90 percent of all  Chinese investment agreements. Major projects include textiles,  glass, watches, electricity, chemical industry machinery,  universal machinery manufacture, activated charcoal, printing  ink, pharmaceuticals, fishing, and technical consulting.    2) Engineering contracts, and technology and labor export  cooperation.    Between January and June 1993 China signed Indonesian  engineering contracts and labor cooperation contracts at $41.52  million, up 640 percent over the same period in 1992, of which,  the former accounted for $29.89 million, up 1014 percent over  the same period in 1992, and the latter for $1.63 million, up 20  percent over the same period in 1992. Completed projects and  projects being completed include: a 35,000-ton grade oceanic  tanker and a 5 x 35,000 kilowatt thermal power plant unit. Work  continues on complete alkalization equipment, cooperative  gulch-gold mining, coal mine exploration and design, hot sheet  steel plant construction and electrical transmission projects.  In 1993 two contracts were signed for complete power generation  equipment alone. One is a 2 x 25,000 kilowatt t hermal power  plant unit. The other is China's largest thermal power plant  unit, a 2 x 200,000 kilowatt project. The latter project alone  is worth nearly $300 million, including plant selection and  design, construction, equipment supply, unit set up , debugging  and operation training. Only such a unified group of economic  and technological cooperation projects with elect  rico-mechanical equipment exports can better motivate and  promote swifter developments in Sino-Indonesian bilateral  economic cooperation to improve and spur on political and  diplomatic relationships between the two countries.    3. Future outlook and growth    According to the ranking of countries in China's import and  export trade totals, Indonesia at present is in 14th place. In  the three years since reestablishment of relations, it is also  the country with the largest import expor t trade deficit with  China. However, because the strong mutual dependence between the  import and export commodities of both countries, we could say  that Indonesia will be a large potential market for China's  product exports, especially electrico-mechanical products and  complete equipment exports. It should be a key point in our  strategy to promote market diversification . Towards this end I  recommend using China's strength in producing  electric-mechanical products and complete sets of equipment  combined with China's contract engineering in Indonesia to  promote future growth in Sino-Indonesian economic and trade  relations. It is important that the following work be done well:    1. Stress developing China's strengths in the  industries of electric-mechanical products and complete sets of  equipment, and participate in the transformation of Indonesia's  production enterprises.    At present Indonesia's major economic and trade partners are  Japan, the United States, the EC, the ROK, Taiwan and Singapore  and other ASEAN countries (regions). To develop its economic  might swiftly, while actively developing its import and export  trade, Indonesia tends towards more preferential conditions to  attract overseas clients and foreign funds to open domestic  joint ventures and thereby accelerate expansion and strenthening  of economic and technological cooperation with various countries  and regions of the world. According to statistics from the  Indonesian Investment Coordination Council, as of the 31 August  1993, the accumulated global investment in Indonesia was $69.66  billion. The major investment industries are the chemical (19.6  percent), tourism (10.7 percent) and mining (9.3 percent) along  with machinery manufacturing, papermaking and textiles. The  aforementioned countries have been in the Indonesian market a  relatively long time and their actual strength is far greater  than China's. Regarding high class consumer goods in the  Indones ian consumer market, their products are high grade, good  quality, strongly functional, high priced and delivered on time.  The Indonesian light and textile industries have grown to a  certain international level with their own characteristics.  However, its electro-mechanical industry is still in the infant  stage; the country's largest machinery manufacturing plant only  corresponds to a medium-sized Chinese one. The majority mainly  do repairs. A few factories can produce some parts and small  volumes of small and medium-sized mechanical equipment. The  country has no complete electro-mechanical production system.  There still is no production of power plant equipment. Thus we  should stress importing complete medium and small capacity  thermal and hydropower generators, electric transformer  equipment, metallurgy equipment, mining equipment, a variety of  construction machinery, petrochemical and chemical industry  equipment, agricultural machinery, complete cement production  equipment, plus technology for computer-controlled system  software. China's greatest strength in opening and developing  Indonesia's markets is in equipment and technology to satisfy  the needs of Indonesia's production enterprises and extended  reproduction therein.    2. The effective way to develop Indonesia's industrial  product market should be active encouragement an d organization  of projects uniting economic and technological cooperation to  import and export trade.    Catering to the needs of the Indonesian Government, support  Chinese enterprises under contract work in Indonesia through  Indonesian economic cooperative projects to spur on exports of  Chinese electro-mechanical products and complete sets of  equipment or use the sup eriority of both exports to promote  bilateral economic and technological cooperation. This would  both improve the economic results of China's export enterprises  and earn us a lot of foreign exchange. Such forms of mutual  bi-directional investment cooperation also will improve friendly  relations with both countries. Given the shortage of Indonesian  funds, China should appropriately assemble some limited fiscal  power suited to Indonesia's peculiar situation and provide  necessary export loans to expand exports of complete sets of  electro-mechanical products.    3. To open the Indonesian market we must take note of  the form of China's model projects in Indonesia.    China severed relations with Indonesia for 23 years for  various reasons, making present Indonesia still harbor  misgivings regarding China. For example, Indonesia granted birth  certificates to people from 45 countries and regions, excluding  China. Although Indonesia's industrial and commercial world  understands China, not all understand China's complete  electro-mechanical equipment. Likewise they have many  misgivings, thus it is extremely important that we set up  several successful large-scale complete ""model"" projects in  Indonesia. Provided we all give priority to this matter at home  and abroad, it will have results very quickly. Recently we  coordinated with t hose at home and abroad to bring closer  bilateral relations through construction of an irrigation  project in Indonesia, promoting future bilateral cooperation in  broader areas.    4. Squarely face China's export product problems.    The old issue of the quality of China's export products,  which is difficult to resolve, is the fundamental issue for  entering the Indonesian market. The competitiveness of  electro-mechanical product quality lies in their superior  performance, ease of operation and work safety. At least we must  ensure that China's products are about the same as those of the  advanced countries of Europe and the United States. Second is  establishing product sales networks and after-sale service  networks, including parts and components and repair networks.  Finally, we must ensure that China's export products to  Indonesia do not compete for sales at rolled back and lower  prices. This would both confuse opening up the Indonesian market  and shatter the development base for enterprises to be  independent. Therefore, domestically, we must enhance the  restraint and control mechanisms over export products through  the chambers of commerce of various industries. At the same  time, mesh with the coordinated management of overseas  economic commerical attaches, and really consolidate and further  develop the Indonesian markets already opened.    5. Establish a project contract model suited to  Indonesia.    This contract model mainly incl udes the following:    1) Foreign contract projects themselves are a complex system  of projects. This is the same in every country. Basically they  involve two major processes: the process from bidding,  negotiations, study, economic and technolgical feasibility draft  approval to signing a contract; and the process from project  technical design, site selection and design approval,  construction, equipment manufacture, check and acceptance,  transport, assembly, debugging to going into commercial  operation.    2) Indonesian contract projects must correctly squarely face  special human relations and the phenomenon that ""money opens  doors"" which determine relations between Indonesian proprietors  and Chinese enterprises. We must firmly uphold the cooperative  division of labor principle that proprietors are responsible for  anything related to Indonesian work and conditions outside of  construction while anything related to China's relevant domestic  procedures and work is the responsibility of the Chinese  contractor.    3) Indonesian contract projects must firmly uphold the  overall responsibility of the Chinese side. We must divide labor  with Indonesia. The Chinese side should undertake responsibility  for technical guidance on projects in Indonesia. This is because  Indonesia still is now an economically undeveloped large country  with many people and rather high unemployment. We only arrived  at this rather appropriate solution after 1992 when the  Indonesian Government built a five unit 35,000 kilowatt  coal-burning electrical power plant project which caused a  ""labor wave.""    China and Indonesia have a close geographical location.  Economic and trade dependence is strong. In the more than three  years since relations were re-established on the basis of  voluntary equality and mutual benefit, the developing bilateral  economic and trade cooperative relationship fully accords with  the desires and basic interests of the people of both countries.  Looking to the future full of confidence, we should work harder  and strive to make greater developments in Sino-Indonesian trade  and economic and technological cooperation in 1994.     "

0,FT944-13278 ,"FT944-13278 _AN-EJ1D8AB2FT 941028   FT  28 OCT 94 / Rumbold quits lobbying directorship      By JAMES BLITZ   Dame Angela Rumbold, the deputy chairman of the Tory party, last night resigned as executive director of a political lobbying company, amid allegations that it had been involved in negotiations over the channel tunnel rail link. Dame Angela, one of the party's most respected figures, surprised MPs by standing down from Decision Makers, a prominent lobbying group. The Tory MP gave no reason for her decision to resign, and no specific allegations of impropriety have been raised against her by Labour MPs. But earlier this week a newspaper drew attention to a successful campaign by the lobbying company to put the Channel tunnel rail link station at Ebbsfleet in Kent rather than Stratford in east London. The article in the Evening Standard claimed that cement company Blue Circle, which owns the land chosen for the site of the station, employed Decision Makers to press its case with the govern-ment. According to the Standard members of the lobbying company met government ministers, including Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary. Dame Angela, who has regularly declared her position with Decision Makers in the Commons register of members interests, said yesterday that she had done nothing wrong, but had decided to step down following the newspaper report. She told the paper earlier this week: 'I'm very open about it. I've absolutely nothing to hide at all. Everyone knows perfectly well where I was coming from. I wasn't going in to meetings as deputy chairman of the party. I was going in as a representative of Decision Makers.' Earlier this week Mr Bryan Wilson, Labour industry spokesman, referred the reports about Ebbsfleet to the Commons committee on members' interests. However, Labour MPs expressed surprise yesterday that Dame Angela had decided to step down when no specific allegations had been levelled against her. Mr Wilson said: 'Coming on the heels of the Ebbsfleet story, Dame Angela's resignation appears to represent an admission that a conflict of interest has existed.' Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, demanded a statement by Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, over whether he had been influenced by Dame Angela in the choice of station. Dame Angela, 61, is a former minister at the Department of Education and more recently served as minister of state at the Home Office. She first entered parliament 12 years ago. After the 1992 general election she was given the deputy chairmanship of the Tory Party and was put in charge of recruiting new parliamentary candidates.   Companies:-  Decision Makers.

This is how some White House officials, who  preferred to remain anonymous, have described the present state  of relations between the two countries. They held a briefing  for a group of Russian journalists on Monday.    The officials stressed that normal relations, and this is  how, in their opinion, the current level of the  Washington-Moscow dialogue can be described, do not exclude  difficulties and problems. Moverover, the number of such  problems and difficulties has lately increased.    Asked by ITAR-TASS about the reasons behind these  difficulties, one of the White House officials said that he  could only repeat what was already said in Moscow and Washington  -- the ""honeymoon"" in American-Russian relations is over. This  ""honeymoon"" began after the end of the ""cold war"", he stated,  and America's assessments of Russia then differed sharply from  its assessments of the Soviet Union. In his opinion America had  then established excessively close relations with Russia which  could not be kept up. Speaking about the end of the  ""honeymoon"", the official said he was not referring to any  crisis. Normal relations envisage differences too, he said. In  solving its domestic political problems Russia is again  beginning to play an active role on the world arena -- in Europe  and the beyond its bounds. He said he believed some differences  between the two countries were quite normal in these conditions.    It is an open secret that the results of the parliamentary  elections in Russia were a surprise for the United States,  another White House official said. The administration had  closely followed the developments in Russia, but it did not  foresee such an outcome, he added. The resignation of two main  architects of the Russian reforms -- Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov -- were a shock not only for many officials of the  administration, but also for the congress, the press, and the  American public at large. The official said that this shock was  explained by the fact that America had cultivated its relations  with Russia largely relying on the presence of reformers in the  Russian Government. Analysing the latest events, the American  side has arrived at the conclusion that strong American-Russian  relations should be developed irrespective of personalities, on  the basis of the mutual understanding of bilateral interests.  The results of the parliamentary elections and of several events  that have occurred lately on the international arena have,  without doubt, increased differences in America's and Russia's  approaches, but have not unsettled their bilateral relations.

Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov's office said after he  met  with a delegation from the European Union that the talks could  be held ""under the auspices of the United Nations and with the  help of the European Union.""    The EU delegation headed by European Commissioner for  Foreign  Relations Hans van den Broek was to relay the Macedonian offer  to Greek authorities who broke off negotiations on the dispute  last October.    Van den Broek said he would meet Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias later Wednesday and Greek Prime Minister  Andreas Papandreou the following day. He hinted that he may  then return to Skopje for further discussions.    Van den Broek stressed that it was essential to end the  dispute between the two countries to avoid an escalation of the  conflict, which has irked Greece's EU partners who have  threatened to haul Athens before the European Court of Justice.    ""Both sides are aware they they are living in a dangerous  part of the world,"" van den Broek said. ""And good neighboring  relations between Athens and Skopje are a prerequisite to  prevent an escalation in the region.""    Greece announced on February 16 that it was blocking all  trade to Macedonia through the northern Greek port of Salonika,  which handles most of the country's imports including oil.    Athens justified the move by citing Macedonia's ""continual  provocations and growing irredentist intransigence"" and by  claiming that the former Yugoslav republic has territorial  ambitions in the northern Greek province of the same name.    Earlier Wednesday Papoulias said that Athens wishes to have  good relations with its neighbor but the latter must accept the  ""logical"" demands made by the Greek Government.    The demands call for ""Skopje"", the name Athens uses to  designate Macedonia, to stop ""hostile propaganda"" against  Greece, to remove from its national flag a sun symbol that  reflects the ancient Greek dynasty of Macedonia and to remove a  constitutional clause calling for the liberation of Macedonia.    Meanwhile, Belgium Wednesday, in an apparent affront to  Athens over the seemingly endless dispute, recognized The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the provisional name given it  pending a resolution of the conflict.    Six other EU countries recognised Macedonia before Greece  took over the Union's revolving six-month presidency in January.     "
0,FT934-7844 ,"FT934-7844 _AN-DKRC7ADSFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Howard to seek bar on industrial action by prison officers      By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent   THE government plans today to raise the stakes in a confrontation with the Prison Officers' Association by seeking a High Court injunction banning the traditionally militant union from taking industrial action. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will argue that, since prison officers hold the office of constable, industrial action involving breach of contract is outside employment law. If the courts endorsed this view, it would prevent the union taking most forms of industrial action at a time when it feels threatened by the introduction of private prison management. A ballot of POA members approved action short of an all-out strike over the government's market testing programme, which will extend private management. The union is also protesting over transfer of work to support-staff, as well as prison violence and overcrowding. Action started last week with little disruption so far, but the union plans to refuse to accept most new admissions to prisons next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. This would mean up to 2,000 prisoners having to be held in police cells as an emergency measure. Mr Derek Lewis, director general of the Prison Service, said the action could represent a 'serious threat to the operation of the criminal justice system and law and order'. The home secretary will seek the injunction this afternoon unless, as appears unlikely, the union executive calls off the proposed disruption by midday. Prison officers, said Mr Lewis, shared some rights of detention with police officers and held the office of constable. According to his legal advice, this meant they were not workers within the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. Their dispute was not a trade dispute as defined by the act, and the POA did not enjoy immunity under it. The union leadership could not incite prison officers to breach their contracts of employment. The POA leadership stood by its decision to call next week's action. Mr John Bartell, chairman, described Mr Howard's proposed action as a 'cynical attempt to neuter a union that is causing difficulties for the government'. Britain already has two private prisons and the contract to run a third, at Doncaster, will be awarded next month. The POA, which has a hardline reputation, feels under attack because private operators are unlikely to recognise it. It appeared to go hesitantly into the present dispute, but the position being adopted by Mr Howard confronts it with the risk of losing its ability to call action in the future.

Reyes]    [Text] Beijing has reaffirmed its commitment to a common  economic exploration and development program for the disputed  Spratly Island group but has remained silent on an accompanying  proposal for a phased military force reduction among contending  claimants in the area.    In an official statement, House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr.,  who is currently in Beijing in his official capacity as  president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Inter-parliamentary Organization (AIPO), said Chinese  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reaffirmed his  country's support for the adoption of a common economic  exploration and development program in the area.    Messrs. de Venecia and Qian agreed that a common economic  development program in the island group ""could include  fisheries, minerals, oil and gas exploration, maritime  arrangements, and weather forecasting.""    But Mr. Qian was noncommittal on Mr. de Venecia's remarks  regarding a four-year old proposed ""concomitant reduction of  forces (which) would be a prelude to eventual demilitarization  of the Spratlys."" However, Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin of  Beijing's National People's Congress (NPC) assured the AIPO  delegation that Chinese parliamentarians support proposals for  contending parties to temporarily shelve their claims to  sovereignty to the islands.    Current strategic assessments of forces stationed in the  islands have manifested continuing constructions of air and  naval support facilities, aimed at facilitating force buildup  during crisis situations.    The AIPO delegation had earlier held discussions with  President Jiang Zemin, NPC standing committee chairman and  former security chief Qiao Shi, as well as Foreign Relations  Committee Chairman Zhu Liang, during which Mr. Jiang had vaguely  assured the delegation that his government would ""play a  positive role, not a negative role"" in dealing with the  currently brewing crisis in the Korean peninsula.    Mr. Jiang had also issued the customary assurance that his  country ""will not be a threat to its neighbors in Asia or to  world peace,"" pointing out that increases in his country's  defense budget were caused merely by ""inflation adjustment.""    For his part, Mr. de Venecia sought views on China's  experiences with special economic zones, reforestation, forest  conservation, mass housing, operation of township enterprises,  and waste disposal.    Mr. de Venecia led a 12-man ASEAN delegation composed of  Reps. Antonio Cuenco of Cebu, Victor Ortega of La Union, and  Roque Ablan Jr. of Ilocos Norte; Deputy Speaker Eugene Yap Giau  Cheng and Teo Tee of Singapore; Tjokong Tarigan Sibero and  Benjamin Massakh of Indonesia; Shahidan Kassim and Chor Chee  Heung of Malaysia; and, Adm.

Departments concerned even decided to ""suspend  cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges and activities,""  ""comprehensively boycott mainland tours,"" and other things.  What was more, after the mainland's public security department  announced that the case had been solved, Taiwan's ""Mainland  Affairs Council"" and ""National Security Bureau"" went so far as  to spread rumors, thus deliberately deepening Taiwan citizens'  misunderstandings against and estrangement from the mainland.  The action of some people in Taiwan is unfavorable to the  development of cross-strait relations.    The Qiandaohu incident is an unfortunate and rare  occurrence.  After it was reported, leaders of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council have paid great attention to it. The Taiwan  Affairs Office under the State Council; departments of public  security, transportation, and tourism; the Zhejiang Provincial  Government; and the Association for Relations across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] have coordinated with each other with all their  might to deal with the aftermath of the incident. Over the  course of 17 days of hard work, the public security department  finally solved the case. It should be said that without the  great attention from all sectors and their all-out efforts, it  would not be an easy job to solve such a notably major case  within such a short time. We cannot but note that some of the  Taiwan authorities had ulterior motives when they turned a blind  eye to such efforts and went about stirring up Taiwan  compatriots' resentment against the mainland.    After over 40 years of separation, the personnel contacts  and  trade and economic exchanges between the two sides of the strait  are not only conducive to the development of cross-strait  relations but also benefit compatriots on both sides during  their exchanges. In the past few years, the exchanges and  contacts between people on both sides have been growing  frequent. The number of Taiwan compatriots coming to the  mainland for tours, sightseeing, investment, and various kinds  of exchanges and activities increases by the day. Taiwan  compatriots have altogether made over 5 million visits to the  mainland. The mainland has attached importance to cross-strait  relations, cross-strait exchanges and contacts, and the  guarantee of the rights and interests of the broad masses of  Taiwan compatriots; the safety of the lives and property of  Taiwan compatriots touring the mainland is protected by the law.    Of course, there have been some incidents causing serious  losses of lives and property of people on both sides of the  strait in recent years. We maintain that the fundamental  experience, as well as the fundamental attitude, in properly  handling such types of individual incidents should take into  consideration the overall state of developing cross-strait  relations and maintaining the legitimate rights and interests of  people on both sides; approach these incidents objectively,  calmly, and practically; and never seize on the incident to  exaggerate matters and deliberately harm cross-strait relations  as well as the feelings of people on both sides. The mainland  has been doing exactly this. In 1990, two incidents caused the  deaths of 46 mainland compatriots during the repatriation of  mainland fishermen by the relevant departments of Taiwan, and in  recent years, Taiwan's military police repeatedly fired at and  shelled mainland fishing boats in the Taiwan Strait, causing  several casualties. Can it be said that the families of the  dead mainland compatriots felt no grief and indignation?  However, when the mainland handled these incidents, it assumed  the attitude of taking cross-strait relations into account so  that cross-strait relations did not regress, and the feelings of  people on both sides thus were not hurt because of the  aforementioned incidents. This has constituted a sharp contrast  to the Taiwan authorities' attitude in handling the Qiandaohu  incident.    As far as the Qiandaohu incident is concerned, it should be  normal that families of Taiwan compatriots and relevant  departments in Taiwan might have different opinions and views on  the handling of the victimized Taiwan compatriots at the  beginning of the case. In an attitude of giving priority to the  fundamental interests of people of both sides and through  patient communication and coordination, however, it is not  difficult to solve the problem rationally. As for the case, the  principle of ""judging the criminal case as it stands"" must be  upheld. The case could be solved promptly or slowly, and it is  certain that the public security department will investigate the  case thoroughly and catch the real culprits. This is not only  an issue concerning the protection of Taiwan compatriots' rights  and interests but also is a measure that the mainland must take  to ensure social order. The correct action for the Taiwan  authorities should be consoling the victims' relatives, so how  could they intentionally take advantage of their grief and  sorrow to stir up people's resentment? Moreover, such types of  incident are not the fault of cross-strait exchanges, and people  on the two sides will not, and are unlikely to, stop their  contacts and tours because of an accidental criminal case. The  Taiwan authorities, however, wanted to suspend this and hold  that on the pretext of this incident, in an effort to harm  cross-strait relations.    It can be seen that because of different social systems on  the two sides, plus 30 to 40 years of separation, there are some  differences in their concepts and measures for approaching  problems. But this does not matter. As long as the two sides  hold frequent contacts, including contacts of high-ranking  personnel such as holding the second Wang Daohan-Gu Zhenfu [Ku  Chen-fu] talks, based on the common belief of promoting the  development of cross-strait relations, such misunderstandings  can be eliminated completely, and their common ground can be  enhanced. Now, the ARATS has once again invited personnel of  the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and its experts to Hangzhou  to hear the briefing by investigators of the case on the case's  details. The ARATS has also agreed, in principle, to exchange  opinions with the SEF on incidents involving the safety and the  losses of lives and property of compatriots on the two sides in  the course of cross-strait exchanges in recent years, and it has  put forward specific suggestions. This is an important move to  intensify communication, eliminate the negative effect caused by  the Qiandaohu incident, and develop cross-strait relations. We  hope that both of them will make earnest efforts to develop  cross-strait relations, and we sincerely hope that the SEF  personnel will depart for the mainland as soon as possible and,  taking the overall state of cross-strait relations into  consideration, will further eliminate the misunderstanding and  estrangement through understanding and make contributions to  maintaining and developing cross-strait relations.

The  personal mutual understanding between Yegor Gaydar and Boris  Fedorov has clearly broken down, and taking account of the major  tactical disagreements between Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis,  this points to a serious split within Russia's Choice.    It was natural and inevitable that political relations would  have to be clarified after the blow of the 12 December election  results. Russia's Choice is now becoming what amounts to a  constructive opposition to the government, and is entering new  and very complex relations with the president. A key role will  be played in Viktor Chernomyrdin's new government by  professionals with centrist views, close to directors' circles.  In a new spiral, and in different conditions, a government of  experienced managers is being set up which is ideologically  related in many ways to the Ryzhkov-Abalkin cabinet.    Only one person is left in the government today from the  government of the first Yegor Gaydar cabinet of two years ago --  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoliy Chubays, chairman of the State  Committee for the Management of State Property.    Anatoliy Borisovich, you have found yourself in proud and  romantic isolation, alone among strangers. What will you do in  a government without Gaydar and Fedorov?    [Chubays] Well, first of all the decision on Fedorov has not  yet been adopted, so I would not draw such unequivocal  conclusions, let us wait a little. Second, I do not entirely  agree that Chubays has been left alone in the government, it  must be said that I have been working with these people for more  than a year now. Relations have certainly not always been  simple, and there are serious difficulties as well, but  nevertheless there has been real work on privatization with  these people in this government, and everything that has been  done on privatization has been done in this line-up. So we have  experience of work in a friendly environment, a not entirely  friendly environment, and an entirely unfriendly environment.    [Svanidze] How is the environment now?    [Chubays] I am ready to answer that question as soon as the  new government line-up is announced.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, do you see yourself now more  as deputy prime minister or as a member of the Russia's Choice  bloc?    [Chubays] Both, to an identical degree. Furthermore, I think  it is important that Gaydar's actions too -- I think it has not  yet been fully understood, but they must be regarded not as the  actions of Yegor Gaydar personally but as the actions of the  leader of a major political bloc. I remind you, by the way,  that today Russia's Choice has the most seats in the State Duma,  significantly more than either Zhirinovskiy or the Interregional  group. Gaydar as an individual perhaps might have followed some  other line, but as leader of the bloc, he is acting as a leader  should act.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin is a firm man. How do you find working with him?    [Chubays] I don't think it would be proper for me to assess  my own actions, but I have worked and work in the government  only as long as I follow the line which I consider to be the  right one, which I can answer for. That means that I have  followed that line until today, and it is that line which I can  answer for.    [Svanidze] So the character of the leadership does not worry  you in this instance?    [Chubays] No, why do you say that? The character of the  leadership is very important for me, and I think that the  premier of the government has to be a firm man, that is his  duty. Otherwise there is nothing underpinning you, otherwise it  is simply impossible to work.    [Svanidze] In that respect Viktor Stepanovich's personal  qualities suit you?    [Chubays] From the point of view of the firmness of his  character, undoubtedly.    [Svanidze] Anatoliy Borisovich, we have a triangle here:  Viktor Chernomyrdin and his government, President Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin, and the reformist party bloc. Which of  them do you plan to be guided by the most?    [Chubays] Things have worked out in such a way that the job  I  do would be impossible without the president's personal support.  It would be impossible without the personal support of Gaydar,  and everything Gaydar did back in the first government from  1990. It would be impossible without the present government as  well. Relations have been quite complex within the government,  but in spite of that, the line has been maintained, and I remind  you that my version of the privatization program was adopted at  a session of the government a month ago. Therefore it is, if  you like, the work of several authors -- the president, the  government, and the Russia's Choice bloc, probably to varying  degrees.    [Svanidze] You are answering about your work, but I am  asking  about you, whom do you as a politician intend to follow? After  all, the president, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and the  reformers, let us say in Russia's Choice, do not occupy the same  positions on all issues.    [Chubays] I intend to follow the fulfillment of those  duties which I personally as a member of the government took on  before the people when I began the issue of privatization checks  on 1 October 1992, and I am compelled to discharge these duties  in full, all the more so as our program is fully supported by  Russia's Choice, and in the Russia's Choice program there is a  whole section on privatization, which I wrote myself.    [Svanidze] What stance do you think the president should now  be adopting: father of the nation, the supreme arbitrator, or a  person persistently following a definite line?    [Chubays] Undoubtedly the president is unable to choose some  kind of black or white position for himself. So it is a  question not of either one or the other, but of finding  correlations between degrees or measures. I am convinced that  the president will remain president as long as he remains the  guarantor of reform in Russia.    [Svanidze] But for how long will he be the guarantor of  reform in Russia, if we are talking about Yeltsin? At the  moment it is a question of whether he should weigh up all  positions, like the statue personifying justice, or whether he  should have political preferences of some kind.    [Chubays] He must undoubtedly have political preferences and  be guided by the reforms, but at the same time, he must of  course weigh up the balance of political forces.    [Svanidze] But he must demonstrate preferences?    [Chubays] I think so.    [Svanidze] Thank you. I remind you that you were watching  Anatoliy Borisovich Chubays live on Russian television on the  ""Details"" program. Goodbye.     "

The protocol proposes the development of cooperation in the  areas of energy, transportation, communications and other areas.  It further proposes establishing new areas for cooperation.  Speaking at the signing ceremony of the protocol, Kumbaracibasi  said that the two sides had discussed all the issues in a  mutually benevolent atmosphere at the meeting.    Stressing that the relations between Turkey and Russia were  improving, Kumbaracibasi said that both sides carried good  intentions towards eliminating the problems and that more  importantly, they had reached an agreement in principles on the  issue of new and wider projects.    Davydov, who also spoke at the conference, said that the  volume of commerce between the two countries would reach $2  billion and noted that this meant that the volume of commerce  between Turkey and Russia would equal that between Russia and  the United States. He said, ""Turkey will continue to be our  most essential commercial partner.""    The issue of the hardships that Turkey came face to face  with  at times when Russia cut off Ukraine's natural gas was also  discussed at the meeting and the two sides agreed that the  section of the Russian pipeline passing through Ukraine be  bypassed, thus enabling the transportation of natural gas to  Turkey. Although the issue of the threats which carrying oil  through the straits posed for Istanbul was not openly discussed  at the meeting, it was nevertheless noted that the two sides  wholeheartedly supported the technical meetings on the prospect  of finding alternatives for transporting the oil. Meanwhile, at  a meeting he had with Kumbaracibasi on Wednesday morning,  Russia's first deputy prime minister, Oleg Soskovets, noted that  the issue of oil and gas was the most important area of  cooperation between Turkey and Russia and suggested that the two  sides cooperate on constructing an oil and gas pipeline between  Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Armenia. Officials  reported that Russia was interested in the projects for building  a nuclear plant in Turkey and building a dam on the Coruh river  and that moreover it wanted to build a thermal power plant in  Turkey. According to the protocol, the dam and thermal power  plant be discussed only when Russia increases the amount of  natural gas it gives to Turkey from the present amount of eight  billion cubic meters to 10.5 billion cubic meters.

The partnership relations which are taking shape between  Moscow and Washington have had a positive effect on trade  dialogue. In 1993 trade turnover between Russia and the United  States increased 20 percent compared with 1992 and was $4.3  billion (in 1992 it was about $3.6 billion). There has been an  almost threefold increase in exports -- from $639.9 million to  $1.997 billion, which has made it possible in practice to reduce  to a minimum the traditional deficit in reciprocal trade: In  1992 Russian exports were a little more than four times less  than imports from the United States. Unfortunately the structure  of trade turnover remains the same -- reciprocal deliveries are  based on raw material and agricultural goods. At a time when  machine building articles make up only 2 percent of Russian  exports to the United States.    An analysis conducted by experts on the eve of the  Washington  session showed that it is not so much the uncompetitive nature  of many Russian goods which remain a serious obstacle in mutual  trade as U.S. barriers on the path of high-technology items made  in Russia and the tough antidumping legislation. That is why,  when he set off across the ocean to take part in the  intergovernment commission, Viktor Chernomyrdin was pursuing two  more attendant aims. The first was to persuade legislators to  repeal the notorious Jackson-Vanik amendments to the trade law  which makes granting partners most-favored nation status  dependent on freedom to leave those countries, while the second  aim was to get the U.S. Administration to recognize Russia's  status as a country with a transitional market economy.    Viktor Chernomyrdin's meeting yesterday with President Bill  Clinton and the talk the day before in the U.S. Congress seems  to have advanced matters from a standstill. Viktor Stepanovich  said that he ""succeeded in persuading the U.S. Administration to  grant Russia the status of a country with a transitional market  economy"" and Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy commented as  follows on Moscow's request: ""I think that restrictions on  trade with Russia should be repealed and will be repealed. That  will require a certain amount of work. But many restrictions  are left from the cold war and they do not apply to the present  day.""     "

Border violations are intolerable, whoever commits them,  Aleksandr Panov, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, told Interfax.    He admitted the existence of a territorial dispute between  the two countries and emphasized that Russia did not refuse to  discuss it. ""If one party says a problem exists, the other  cannot say it does not,"" Panov observed.    In his words, the territorial issue will be one of the items  on the agenda of the Russo-Japanese working consultations to be  held in Moscow on February 21 and 22 under the joint  chairmanship of Hiroshi Fukuda, Panov's counterpart, and himself.    The deputy minister also said that the Russian negotiators  would raise the issue of Japanese ships crossing illegally into  Russian waters. ""We will insist that the Japanese authorities  take the necessary steps to prevent this,"" Panov said.    The meeting will discuss ""a wide range of issues"" around the  wording and signing of a peace treaty. ""We do not expect any  dramatic or sensational decisions or recommendations. It will  be a usual working meeting,"" the diplomat said.    Commenting on the ""Zhirinovskiy factor"" Deputy Russian  Foreign Minister, Aleksandr Panov, told Interfax that Japan had  responded to the statements of the LDP [Liberal Democratic  Party] leader ""rather calmly.""    According to the diplomat, ""it was very difficult to  determine the true position of Zhirinovskiy."" Panov reminded  that Zhirinovskiy had stated in his book The Last Breakthrough  to the South his preparedness to give the Kuril Islands to Japan  if he came to power, however, he failed to even mention the  number of the islands which were to be given. Moreover,  according to the information received by the Russian Foreign  Ministry, the LDP leader stated the same position during  conversations with Japanese representatives. However, on the  other hand Zhirinovskiy said that he might threaten Japanese  with a nuclear bomb, Panov remarked.    On the Japan visit by Director of the foundation Strategy,  Gennadiy Burbulis, the deputy Russian foreign minister informed  that Burbulis' visit was made so as to participate in the  trilateral Japanese-U.S.-Russian conference on security in Tokyo.    Comparing the current situation in Russian-Japanese  relations  to the one last year, the deputy foreign minister pointed out a  ""significant move forward.""

""Both parties understand this very  well. We believe that we have prospects for further development  in our relations,"" Panov concluded.     "

The tension in relations between Russia and the  Baltic countries is mounting. State Duma Deputy Vyacheslav  Igrunov (""Yabloko""), member of the Committee on the CIS,  answered OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's questions about the prospects for  the development of these relations.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that the friction in Russia's  relations with the ""Baltic troika"" has grown more intense  recently?    [Igrunov] Yes, probably. Whereas the status of the  Russian-speaking minority in the new independent states was of  little interest to most people in Russia at one time, now there  is so much concern about this problem that it has even resulted  in the revision of policy guidelines. Politicians from the  ""patriotic"" camp and even those who are customarily called  democrats have displayed profound impatience with their  neighbors because of the status of their fellow countrymen.    In a certain sense the new round of conflicts in relations  with the Baltic countries was unavoidable. We are caught in a  vicious circle: The deterioration of conditions in Russia is  motivating the political class in the Baltic countries to seek a  place under NATO's protective umbrella. Any Western concessions  in this respect then evoke an unhealthy reaction from Russia. We  were too late to do everything possible for the Russian-speaking  minority during a relatively calm period, and now we have to  take extraordinary steps to keep the situation from getting  worse, and all of this is being done today, now that we have a  new parliament, where the absolute majority of deputies are in  favor of the restoration of the USSR or of dramatic measures to  protect Russian interests. Similar changes have taken place in  the agencies of the executive branch of government. This is  making a grievous impression on our northwestern neighbors, an  impression which will be exceptionally difficult to dispel.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] If the majority of Duma deputies are in  favor of restoring the USSR, then why did the number of deputies  signing up for the parliamentary committee on the CIS fall short  of even the number required by the rules of procedure for the  formation of a committee?    [Igrunov] There is no contradiction here. On the contrary,  the committee is supposed to find civilized ways of establishing  cooperation within the CIS for progress in integration, but most  deputies do not even acknowledge the CIS as an entity worthy of  consideration. They are not concerned about these matters and do  not feel that they warrant attention. They prefer simple  solutions--either economic pressure or the use of force in some  form. They are acting according to Zhirinovskiy's logic: ""They  will crawl to us on their knees and beg to become Russian  provinces.""    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Will the recent decisions of the Brussels  session of the NATO Council influence the leaders of the Baltic  states to give up their plans to join this military bloc?    [Igrunov] No, they will continue to seek membership. The  experience of recent years has shown that, despite the West's  cautious stance, the persistence of the Baltic countries has  always brought them success. Apparently, the leaders of those  states are now hoping for the exacerbation of the situation in  Russia, which could change the NATO stance.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Which are the problems that could  escalate  tension in the near future?    [Igrunov] One example is the military transit traffic  through  Lithuania to Kaliningrad Oblast, which is still part of Russia's  territory and one of its main military bases. Any attempt to  limit this traffic could evoke a regrettable response.  Furthermore, there is a Lithuanian minority living in  Kaliningrad Oblast. This ethnic minority has assimilated well  and has not displayed any particular interest in its historical  roots, but it still might be exploited for the escalation of  tension.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Are you saying, in other words, that  difficulties can be anticipated primarily in relations with  Lithuania?    [Igrunov] No, they are more likely to occur in relations  with  Latvia and Estonia. In my opinion, this will be caused primarily  by the deterioration of economic conditions. Russia is unlikely  to continue allowing the free re-export of its nonferrous metals  and fuel through the Baltic countries. These operations are now  being conducted with the active participation of the  Russian-speaking population there; the restriction of the  re-export operations could have an adverse effect on this  minority's economic status and cause ethnic and cultural  conflicts.    Besides this, there is the extremely acute problem of the  civil rights of our fellow countrymen. Latvian and Estonian  politicians are trying to exploit the tension resulting from  Zhirinovskiy's victory. A third of the Russian-speaking  population in Latvia will be ineligible to vote in local  government elections. There is little difference between this  and the situation that existed in South Africa until recently. A  legislative bill on the prosecution of individuals who were  engaged in anti-Estonian activity during the years of Soviet  occupation is being deliberated in Estonia. According to this  document, the laws of the Estonian Republic remained in force  during the whole period when Estonia was part of the Soviet  Union, and all of the people who violated these laws are  criminals and should be punished. It is true that there have  been verbal stipulations that these legal standards were not  completely in force at that time, but this does create the  possibility of judicial proceedings against any individual who  lived in Estonia during the Soviet era. Most of the  Russian-speaking population did not even know anything about  these laws. Obviously, the new law--if it is passed--will be  enforced selectively--on ethnic grounds. There are already some  suggestions of this.    Relations with the Russian-speaking population have been  relatively calm to date in Lithuania (just as, incidentally,  recent relations with the Polish minority). This could continue  if A. Brazauskas' economic policies do not fail. In all other  respects, Lithuania will be extremely active and is most likely  to be more persistent than the others in seeking NATO  membership. Nevertheless, if the Russian Government and  parliament behave prudently, Lithuania could serve as a bridge  to the two other Baltic states for the improvement of relations  with them.    [OBSHCHAYA GAZETA] Do you feel that Russian policy toward  the  new independent states is acquiring new aims?    [Igrunov] Patriotic aims are unavoidable in Russian policy.  In my opinion, Zhirinovskiy is not simply a Russian problem, but  a global one. Look at what is happening in Germany or the United  States. We can only wonder whether European civilization is  capable of a reasonable response to its own challenge. If we  view the matter from this vantage point, Zhirinovskiy is a  permanent factor, and not a temporary one, in our policy. The  alternative is politicians like Luzhkov, and not the democrats.  We are running out of time, we will have to make our move soon,  and now we must decide how we can preserve our own values in  this situation.     "
0,FT933-909 ,"FT933-909 _AN-DI0BZABNFT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Job fears fall despite rising unemployment      By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff   FEARS by British workers that they could lose their jobs over the next 12 months have slightly abated, according to the latest monthly survey by MORI for the Financial Times. Fear of redundancy or becoming unemployed appears to have decreased over the past few weeks, in spite of two successive monthly increases in unemployment and the possibility of job losses in the public sector because of the government's decision that any pay increases there must be funded by increased productivity. Anxiety over the possibility of redundancy peaked in July, according to the survey, when 51 per cent of those in work said they were either 'very concerned' or 'fairly concerned'. The downward trend began in August when 47 per cent expressed this view. However, in the period up to September 20 the figure had fallen to 43 per cent of all workers. Any increase in confidence could flow through to the housing market because job-loss fear is believed to restrain people from taking on big new financial commitments. The groups which had become more optimistic by changing their viewpoint most over the month were young people, women, part-time workers and people living in the north of England. The most anxious were the middle-aged, men, full-time workers and unskilled manual workers. Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said: 'The recent rise in the published unemployment figures, and the possible impact on public-sector jobs because of the public-sector pay freeze, have not apparently adversely affected individuals' fear of job loss.' MORI interviewed 992 adults in full- and part-time work. UK unemployment will continue to rise during the final months of this year before falling in 1994, according to the latest forecast from National Westminster Bank. The recent slowdown in economic growth has reversed the downward trend in unemployment, says Mr David Kern, NatWest chief economist. Registered unemployment fell for four consecutive months earlier in the year but has since risen by 4,300 in July and 5,800 in August. Mr Kern expects unemployment to rise by a further 20,000 this year, leaving the total 50,000 short of its January peak, but then fall by 125,000 in 1994, with the largest proportional falls occurring outside the south-east. The NatWest forecasts imply a modest fall in the unemployment rate, as a percentage of the workforce, to 9.9 per cent by the end of next year from the current level of 10.4 per cent.

This was the first time since the crime that SEF officials  and crime experts were allowed to visit the mainland to probe  the investigation into the incident, which has frozen  Taiwan-mainland ties.    Hsu said his delegation, comprised of victims' relatives,  lawyers and forensic scientists, hopes mainland authorities will  reveal all the facts pertaining to the crime.    ""Only by doing so can the fragile Taiwan-mainland ties  return  to normal,"" Hsu said.    Mainland authorities Monday turned down the Taiwan mission's  request to see autopsy reports and instead showed them slides  and taped records about the condition of the bodies.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait  (ARATS), SEF's mainland counterpart, also rejected the mission's  demand to interview the four men arrested for their alleged  involvement in the crime. SEF and ARATS are non-official  conduits for mainland-Taiwan relations.    ARATS Deputy Secretary-General Li Yafei, who was among the  mainland officials meeting with the Taiwan delegation, said  people in the mainland feel as sad as the people in Taiwan do  about the accident and the mainland authorities have tried their  utmost to crack the case.    According to a report by the Hong Kong-based WEN WEI PO, Wu  Liming, a suspect who was charged for complicity in the crime,  works for the Hangzhou armed police.    All 32 passengers and crew aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao  Lake in the eastern province of Zhejiang were found burnt to  death in a small room in the boat on April 1. Luggage and other  belongings were missing.    Although mainland authorities arrested the four suspects and  said they have tried their best to investigate the accident, Hsu  said many suspicions surrounding the incident remain.    News of the mishap was suppressed at first and then the  Zhejiang authorities claimed it was an accident. Reporters,  especially those from Taiwan were barred from the crime scene.  Relatives of the victims, who were furious over the autopsies  carried out without their consent, were confined in their  hotels, and SEF officials were three times refused permission to  visit the mainland to probe the case.    Taiwan has since suspended cultural and educational  exchanges, banned sightseeing trips, and is reviewing its  economic policy toward the mainland in protest of the mainland's  inappropriate handling of the incident.

The official added that the commitments were assumed with  [word indistinct] in the legislation and the Mexican economic  situation and that equitable treatment was also considered, as  well as advancements in economic deregulation insofar as  economic, political, and legal conditions allow.    He said that among the most difficult requirements Mexico  must meet is to achieve strong, sustained growth [words  indistinct] to ensure that foreign businessmen will have greater  freedom to conduct all types of business in Mexico.    Dultzin also said that Mexico will receive the same  treatment  as other members [words indistinct] of the activities [words  indistinct] Mexicans in those nations.    As for the membership fee, Dultzin, who has also served as  technical coordinator for Mexico's integration process with the  OECD since 1993, emphasized that the members' annual  contributions, determined by GDP, population, and exchange rate,  finance the organization.    He also pointed out that joining the international  organization could mean that the Mexican public debt will go  from a 100-percent risk factor [ponderacion] to being risk free,  as is the case with the U.S., German, French, and British debts.    Loans extended to Mexican banks, instead of being subject to  a 100-percent risk factor, as is currently the case, would only  be subject to 20 percent. Dultzin explained, however, that the  country will not receive the benefit automatically.    Mexico had to take several measures to be accepted into the  OECD, such as adjusting [words indistinct] and satisfying  minimum maritime transportation safety requirements.    Dultzin indicated that Mexico's deep sea fishing fleet meets  current safety requirements, while the country's freighters will  be given a stipulated period of time to fulfill the requirements.    He added that consultations were made with the United States  and Canada to solve issues related to the automobile industry  included in the free trade agreement negotiations.    The Mexican official indicated that Mexico's OECD admittance  date, 24 March, had been anticipated from the beginning of the  year, which encouraged more long-term confidence and  self-confidence among Mexicans.    Mexico established relations with the OECD in 1982 after  joining the organization's Steel Committee, where it gradually  increased its participation until it was finally accepted in  1990 as a full member.    In 1991, arrangements were made for an OECD mission [words  indistinct] after which Mexico was accepted as an observer in  several of the organization's committees.     "

The Liberal Democratic Party [LDS], the Democratic Party,  the  Greens-Ecologically Social Party, and the Socialist Party are  thus supposed to form the new LDS--the Liberal Democracy of  Slovenia.    The new party, which, after unification, will possess 30  seats in parliament, which is one-third of all deputies, will  continue to be led by Dr. Janez Drnovsek. He particularly  emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with the  Christian Democrats this morning. We have reports by Bojan  Veselinovic, Sandi Frelih, and Gojko Brvar from the separate  party congresses in Bled this morning:    [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] The morning congress of the  Liberal Democrats was opened by party president Dr. Janez  Drnovsek, who said that foreign countries are following the  events in our country with interest and added that the  reputation of the present LDS is growing gradually but steadily.  Faced with the choice of whether to continue building on teh  party's autonomy and risk another showdown with the newly  emerged party or to link itself with the Eco-Greens, the  Socialists, and the Democrats, we have decided in favor of  unification, Drnovsek said.    Unification, he said, does not mean a change in the  composition of the present coalition. Drnovsek particularly  stressed the need for the new LDS to cooperate with the  Christian Democrats to ensure the stability of the political  scene. Relations will be good with the two remaining government  parties until program differences occur, Drnovsek said.    The afternoon unification congress is supposed to elect:  Drnovsek as the president of the new LDS, [Dimitrij] Rupel as  the president [as heard]; 60 members of the party council, which  will be formed proportionally on the basis of the results of the  last general elections; [Igor] Bavcar, [Vika] Potocnik, [Viktor]  Zakelj, and [Peter] Tancig for vice presidents; and [Gregor]  Golobic as secretary general.    They will subsequently agree as to who will coordinate the  work of the clubs of deputies of the three merging parties in  the parliament. The afternoon congress is also supposed to  decide about the amendment to the proposed documents, with  which, bearing in mind various material situations in the  merging parties, secretaries general of these parties would  guarantee with their personal assets the settlement of any  possible party debts.    Let us also report that the new LDS will have 30 seats in  parliament, which is two seats less than it would have had if  the current Democratic deputies [Tone] Persak and [Danica]  Simsic were have supported unification.

Anxiety is most prevalent among women, part-timers and the young. People in the Midlands appear the most vulnerable, with very little improvement in confidence compared with the north and south.

As Mr Major -- who is to visit Washington this month --  moved, officials were desperately trying to limit the damage to  British interests caused by the almost unchallenged access to  the U.S. media which the Sinn Fein president enjoyed for 48  hours.    But the government was unable to conceal its dismay at  President Bill Clinton's decision to issue a visa for Mr Adams.    Publicly, Downing Street put on a brave face. A senior  official said the Anglo-U.S. relationship was ""alive and well  and extremely vigorous.""    In private ministers and senior officials were bitterly  disappointed at President Clinton's decision to overrule his  most senior advisers.    One senior minister said the president appeared to have put  UK-U.S. relations and the future of the Northern Ireland peace  initiative at risk to placate the U.S.'s vocal Irish-American  lobby.    The government was also upset by the largely sympathetic  coverage given to Mr Adams by the U.S. media, and by the lack of  balancing comments from Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary.  A Downing Street official said: ""Douglas Hurd worked his arse  off to get himself on American television screens. He has been  pushed off the networks by programmers who have decided that  Gerry Adams is more interesting.""    The mood in Downing Street is unlikely to be improved by a  broad hint from Mr Raymond Seitz, the U.S. ambassador to London,  that he advised Mr Clinton not to allow Mr Adams into the U.S.    Officials disclosed that Mr Seitz was called to Downing  Street for talks on Tuesday [1 February] as part of a diplomatic  drive to persuade Mr Clinton to distance himself from Sinn Fein.  ""There was a big tussle in my government about this,"" Mr Seitz  added.    He hoped Mr Adams' experience in the U.S. would ""act as an  encouragement for him to renounce violence and condemn it when  it occurs. We will have to wait and see.""    The British position was also put to Mr Al Gore, the U.S.  vice-president, by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and by  Sir Robin Renwick, British ambassador to Washington.    Downing Street said the flurry of diplomatic activity bore  fruit in Mr Clinton's statement on Tuesday which supported the  Anglo/Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland and abandoned  the idea of a U.S. ""peace envoy"" to Belfast.

0,FT932-3946 ,"FT932-3946 _AN-DFKB5AD2FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Clough denies personal payments for transfers: Venables spoke of 'bagfuls of money', says Sugar      By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent   LONG-STANDING claims that unorthodox financial practices are commonplace in British soccer were fuelled yesterday when it was alleged that Mr Brian Clough, the former manager of Nottingham Forest football club, received personal payments when transferring players to other clubs. The claim was made by Mr Alan Sugar, the Tottenham Hotspur chairman, in an affidavit submitted to the High Court hearing into his attempt to sack the Spurs chief executive, Mr Terry Venables. The allegation was strongly denied by lawyers for Mr Venables. Mr Martin Mann QC, for Mr Venables, claimed that Mr Sugar had attempted to pervert the course of justice by threatening Mr Jonathan Crystal, who is a barrister, fellow Tottenham director and ally of the chief executive, unless he dropped crucial evidence from his affidavit. A separate hearing on this issue is due to start on Monday. In his affidavit, Mr Sugar claimed that when Mr Venables was trying to buy Mr Teddy Sheringham, the England international, from Nottingham Forest for Pounds 2.1m, he told the Spurs chairman that Mr Clough 'likes a bung' - a personal payment - to make transfers go smoothly. Mr Venables had told him the usual procedure was for Mr Clough to be met in a motorway service station where he would be given a bagful of money, Mr Sugar claimed. The allegation was strongly denied by both Mr Venables and Mr Clough. In an affidavit submitted to the court, Mr Venables described the claims as 'bizarre' and 'a lot of nonsense'. Mr Clough also denied that any money had passed between himself and Mr Venables over the transfer. 'The last time I was in a motorway service station, I went for a wee,' he said. Relations between Mr Sugar and Mr Venables had now deteriorated to such an extent that one of them would have to sell his shares and leave the club, Mr Mann said. He accused Mr Sugar of reneging on an agreement, reached when the two men first took control of the club in June 1991, that they would retain equal voting rights. After the club's rights issue in November 1991, when Mr Sugar extended his stake in the club from 23 per cent to 46 per cent, the chairman began a campaign to undermine Mr Venables's position, he said. In one case, Mr Sugar negotiated a deal with BSkyB without making any reference to Mr Venables, Mr Mann said. The hearing is expected to end today.

The Federal  Counterintelligence Service Public Relations Center expressed to  us the hypothesis that the representatives of U.S. special  services could be in Moscow in order to ask us not to touch any  of their intelligence agents or agencies.

No, most likely this was not an exchange of mutual  grievances. Most probably, the Americans, who have involved  their President in an unprecedentedly tough and hard-hitting  role in the spy mania campaign, who themselves blew up the  ""affair"" to the proportions of a national tragedy, came to  Moscow to size up the prospects for the contacts which -- as is  well known -- exist between the two countries' special services.  Have they not gone too far, have they not spoiled everything  hopelessly? Of course, no official will say whether this is the  case. But experts propose that the ""spylords"" could have  actually taken away specific proposals with them from Moscow.  Though we think that AP is right here: They returned from the  Russian capital, to a Washington resounding from the spy  ""fall-out,"" with nothing at all.     "

The Chinese vice  foreign minister summoned the U.S. ambassador in Beijing and  made it clear to him that the United States has interfered in  China's internal affairs by approving that law. Meanwhile,  speaking at the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee's session, the  architect of the Pressler Amendment, Senator Larry Pressler,  accused China of developing nuclear missiles capable of striking  the United States, which can create security concerns among  neighboring countries.    The question is: Has Senator Larry Pressler taken onto his  shoulder the onus of creating causes of friction in Pakistan's  and China's relations with the developed nations? One can ask  this because his every statement seems to be directed toward  protecting the interests of India or Israel. Under these  circumstances, if one were to say that Larry Pressler and  Stephen Solarz are political cognates, then it would not be  inappropriate. In his aforementioned statement, without naming  India, Larry Pressler tried to bring home the point that Chinese  missiles with the capacity to strike the United States could  pose a threat to India's security. It seems India is fast  increasing its lobbying in the U.S. political and legislative  institutions to purchase Patriot missiles and technology from  that country.    As for Taiwan and Tibet, Pakistan recognizes these two  regions as parts of China. However, India and the United States  are gradually carrying forward their policies under a well  thought-out plan to create an uprising against Beijing in Tibet  and make Taiwan refuse to come under the sway of Beijing's  administration. The United States, after having deferred the  Tibet issue to India, is now playing the role of a silent  spectator and is keeping the Taiwan issue directly in its own  hands. If all these things are analyzed, then it will become  crystal clear in the very first stage that the conspiracies to  blockade China from all sides are being executed very cunningly.  The recent U.S. approval of a legislation about Tibet and  Taiwan also points to the Indo-U.S. conspiracy against China.    The seminars currently being organized in Pakistan to pave  the way for the implementation of the U.S. plan to divide the  state of Jammu and Kashmir also seem to be a link in the chain  of this conspiracy. The people of Pakistan openly support the  protestations made by the Chinese vice foreign minister against  the U.S. law and demand that Washington stop its increasing acts  of interference in the Asian region, because it is essential for  the preservation of global peace.

Parliamentary sources have revealed to  AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies in a closed session  held the evening of the day before yesterday that ""there is an  agreement of views"" between the United States and Syria on the  main lines of a settlement, ""but Israel still has reservations  regarding al-Himmah triangle which Syria considers to be its  own."" The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that Syria ""is  requesting that the triangle be given back to it on the grounds  that it had belonged to Syria since 1938.""    Al-Majali said Egypt considers the triangle, known as ""the  Palestinian Golan,"" to belong to the Palestinians, and therefore  negotiations on it should be between Israel and the PLO,  according to parliamentary sources. Al-Himmah triangle is  located at the point where the territories of Syria, Israel, and  Jordan meet (north of the Jordanian kingdom).    Al-Majali also revealed that there is a border dispute  between Jordan and Syria, and another dispute over water quotas,  although he did say that relations are ""at their best.""    At the secret session of the House of Representatives,  al-Majali also revealed that, during King Husayn's recent talks  with President Hafiz al-Asad in Damascus, Syria asked of Jordan  a level ""higher than coordination"" in their bilateral relations.  The parliamentary sources interpreted the Syrian request as a  call for some form of integration or unity.    The sources told AL-HAYAH that al-Majali told the deputies  that the reply to Syria was briefly that Jordan ""believes in  coordination provided relations are not based just on slogans  and emotions but rather on reason and a scientific approach.""    He also said a Syrian delegation headed by Prime Minister  Mahmud al-Zu'bi and including Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar'  will visit Amman on Saturday [11 June] for the meetings of the  Syrian-Jordanian Higher Committee, which will be meeting for the  first time since the Gulf crisis to discuss development of  economic and political bilateral relations.    He told the deputies that Syrian-Jordanian relations are at  their best, with the exception of ""some problems"" related to  water quotas and border posts. The parliamentary sources said  Jordan is still urging Syria to stop exceeding its share of  water from al-Yarmuk River.    It is worth noting that Israel is also taking a part of  Jordan's share in the Jordan and al-Yarmuk rivers.    The same sources said the border dispute is over a Syrian  request to replace al-Ramtha border post with a border post in  the area of Jabir on the border between the two countries.  Jordan agrees to the introduction of a border post in Jabir,  provided the border post at al-Ramtha remains.    The prime minister also said King Husayn contacted the  Syrian  president the day before yesterday, and the latter confirmed  that the Syrian delegation will arrive in Amman on Saturday.    The sources quoted al-Majali as saying that the Syrians are  still refusing to participate in the multilateral negotiations  ""to avoid discussion of the issue of water rights, particularly  our rights to water controlled by Syria.""    Reviewing Jordanian-Palestinian relations, al-Majali  expressed Jordan's displeasure with Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat's procrastination, failure to coordinate with Jordan,  and disregard for Jordanian interests.    The parliamentary sources also quoted al-Majali as saying  that ""we talk a lot about Palestinian coordination with Jordan,  which we seek and hope for, but in practical terms it is  nonexistent."" He pointed out that the Palestinian coordination  committees ""come for a meeting every time his excellency  President 'Arafat comes, and we explain the situation clearly  and underline the seriousness of the matter for us both, and  point out that coordination does not mean that we would lead or  dominate them....""    He added: ""We thought that, by virtue of our experience as a  state, we were qualified to help and aid them in their affairs  as they are about to build their own entity...but President  'Arafat always insists on speaking in generalities, and he  ignores details and the work of the (joint) committees.""    Al-Majali added that when the PLO sent Ahmad Quray'  (Abu-al-'Ala'), head of the PLO Economic Department, to Jordan  with the aim of arriving at an economic agreement after the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement was signed in Paris; ""an agreement  was reached, but they postponed the signing...and that remains  the case to this day.""    He said that, in his view, what is going on now ""is an  attempt to drag (Jordan) along, in that the Israelis and the  Palestinians reach agreement and then drag us along. We  categorically reject that.""    He added: ""In the past, we excused them because their  attention was focused on survival, symbols, and sovereignty and  they had no time to discuss details...but at the latest meeting  we told them that there will be no excuse after today and that  we care about our own interests as they do about theirs...and  that if we decided to work alone that would harm them more than  it would harm us.""    Commenting on al-Majali's statements, Deputy 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Kabarati, speaking on behalf of some of his colleagues, said  he supports the general policy of the government in its endeavor  to protect Jordan and its interests ""proceeding from constant  Jordanian principles and adapting to regional and international  changes and to the realities on the ground so that Jordan may  continue to be a player and not become just a playground as its  enemies want it to be."" On Jordanian-Palestinian relations,  al-Kabariti said ""inasmuch as we are eager to save as much as we  can of the elements of unity between the two banks (of the  Jordan River), and although I believe that we should lay down  the basis and rules for building future unitary relations  between the two states, God willing, equally, we should not  allow these genuine feelings to prevent us from carefully  examing President Abu-'Ammar's ['Arafat's] policies and his  extreme indulgence in tactics at the expense of strategy to the  point of ignoring the historical and geographical facts which  link our two peoples and countries, and even his clear  insistence on moving in the opposite direction to these  facts....""    Al-Kabariti urged the government ""not to be embarrassed to  talk about this matter in detail, and to let all the  informational, political, and popular forces participate in a  balanced and objective way. The public should be reassured that  we resolutely and sincerely turn our attention to Palestine and  its interests without the slightest interst in hegemony or  control but without that undermining our determination, above  all, to protect Jordan's interests, particularly its security,  future, and economy, and without becoming captives of  courtesies, meetings, and minutes which are the prevailing order  these days.""    Twenty deputies spoke during the closed session which lasted  about three hours. They covered the various issues raised by  the prime minister.     "

Narasimha Rao, should  call-off or postpone his proposed visit to the United States,  sometime in summer. The Ministry of External Affairs itself is  sharply divided on the issue with one section strongly  advocating the visit, while the other group pleads that in the  vitiated atmosphere nothing tangible will emerge, which would  help consolidate the ties between the two countries and remove  growing misunderstandings on a host of issues.    If one were to analyse the tone and tenor of recent remarks  by the American President, Mr Bill Clinton, and his aides, it is  evident that they do not see India requiring any high-level  attention. Probably, this has been the trend for well over two  decades. No American President visited India since Mr Jimmy  Carter, nor for that matter has any Secretary of State come in  the past decade. There do not seem to be any plans for any  visits in the near future either.    The Americans have even managed without an Ambassador to  India. Basically, there is a love-hate relationship between  India and the United States. But all the loving and hating is  done by India only.    Be that as it may, there are those who feel that the recent  spate of provocative statements from the White House and the  State Department makes it all the more imperative for Mr  Narasimha Rao to meet the top U.S. leadership and other opinion  makers in the country. They point out that such  misunderstandings can only be sorted out at the highest  political level and the Prime Minister would be making a mistake  if he did not do so because of false prestige.    If indeed, as is widely believed here, certain key aides of  President Clinton were responsible for pushing this  administration towards a hostile position vis-a-vis India, a  personal encounter between him and Mr Rao may well restore the  balance. Moreover, Prime Minister Rao would also have the  opportunity in Washington to meet influential Congressmen,  Senators, officials, academics and journalists to explain New  Delhi's case on Kashmir, the nuclear non-proliferation treaty  (NPT) and a host of other contentious issues.    Those who support Mr Narasimha Rao's going to Washington are  convinced that he would get strong backing from the business  lobby there which is keen to invest in this country because of  the economic liberalisation. The Prime Minister himself is  perceived as the chief sponsor of the reform policy and this  should enable him [to] project a progressive image of India in  the United States as a counter to anti-Indian propaganda about  human rights violations in Kashmir and Punjab as well as on  nuclear proliferation in the sub-continent.    Comparisons are being drawn with the political leadership in  Beijing which has managed to deflect criticism on the human  rights front by luring big American business with tempting  investment prospects in China. A similar gambit by Narasimha  Rao, it is argued, could yield handsome dividends with U.S.  businessmen pressurising the Clinton Administration to stop  making provocative statements and gestures against this country.    The other argument in favour of the proposed visit by Mr  Narasimha Rao is that if he refused to go to Washington out of  pique with the Clinton administration, it would only allow  Pakistan--its Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, is also  scheduled to visit the United States within a few months--a free  propaganda run. It is felt that Ms Bhutto would then use this to  project New Delhi as inflexible and recalcitrant on issues like  Kashmir and NPT.    Those who are against the Prime Minister going to  Washington,  however, turn these arguments on their head. They point out that  in diplomacy, timing is almost everything and at a time when  there is so much suspicion and misunderstanding between  Washington and New Delhi, a Prime Ministerial visit could be  counterproductive with only the differences between two  countries getting articulated.    Conventional wisdom would suggest that the overall impact on  bilateral relations of the sustained barrage of negative  pronouncements on India from the Clinton Administration,  including the President himself, cannot be healed by a mere  visit to Washington by Mr Narasimha Rao. In fact, there is a  possibility of both sides being unduly sensitive about working  out a compromise at the moment.    There is also the question of personal vibes between Mr  Narasimha Rao and the U.S. President. Both leaders come from  different generations and cultures with clashing styles and  world views.    While it is possible that a leader like Rajiv Gandhi may  have  hit it off with President Clinton, this appears to be far more  unlikely in the case of Prime Minister Rao. Even if there are no  open hostilities, there is every chance that a personal  encounter between the two would be lacklustre and per-functory,  resulting in no diplomatic breakthrough.    Mr Narasimha Rao's mild professorial style, however  impressive to the knowledgeable on India affairs, is also  unlikely to attract much media attention in the United States.  This may lead to unfavourable comparisons with Ms Bhutto's visit  which is bound to cause more flutter in the U.S. media.    In any case, the flamboyant young Harvard educated leader  has  many more personal friends in the U.S. establishment,  particularly in the Clinton Administration. Under the  circumstances, Mr Narasimha Rao, if he goes to Washington, would  be running a patently unequal race with his Pakistani  counterpart.    Significantly, most officials both in the Foreign Office and  the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) are palpably unenthusiastic  about Mr Narasimha Rao visiting Washington at this point. While  the Foreign Office is worried about the risk of an unsuccessful  Prime Ministerial visit to the United States further  complicating the already vexed triangular relationship between  New Delhi, Washington and Islamabad, the PMO is apprehensive  about the political repurcussions at home in the event of Mr  Narasimha Rao failing to pull off a public relations coup with  President Clinton.    There is a vast body of opinion-makers in this country  today,  including the national media, which closely follows the progress  of Indo-U.S. ties under a microscope. Not surprisingly, the  success or failure of Mr Rao's visit in all probability would be  exaggerated beyond its real implications for the relationship  between the two countries.    While in the long run, whether the Prime Minister goes ahead  or not with his trip to the United States may have far less  impact on bilateral ties than other factors. Mr Rao would have  to carefully weigh the pros and cons before agreeing to fix  dates for the proposed visit.    This has posed a serious dilemma for the Prime Minister who  has been pressing for a visit to Washington for the past many  months. A successful trip, besides restoring balance to  Indo-U.S. ties, would add yet another diplomatic feather to Mr  Rao's cap already embroidered with recent breakthroughs in  Beijing and Tehran and Davos.    A failure or even a damp squib in Washington, on the other  hand, would not only mean a personal loss of face for Prime  Minister Rao but also further add to the mounting strident  anti-U.S. chorus in this country.

Kim's visit, which kicked off on Saturday, coincides with a  new investment boom in China by more ROK companies.    Investment by large companies, such as Hyundai, Lucky  Goldstar, Daewoo and Sunkyoung, has surged in particular.    Chances are good that these companies will win bids for  China's major infrastructure projects.    The projects include the Beijing subways, dams on the Yellow  and Yangtze rivers, railways in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, telecommunication facilities and offshore oil  development.    Aside from energy, environmental protection and  pharmaceutical sectors, ROK companies are also competitive in  electronics and machinery industries.    The two countries still enjoy good co-operation in the  aerospace industry.    The Republic of Korea has listed 36 products as its top  exports, which include freight cars, auto parts and  refrigerators.    In September last year, the two countries convened a  high-level meeting to discuss the reduction of tariffs on ROK's  exports to China and the proportion of products by joint  ventures to be sold back to ROK markets.    The meeting paved the way for more ROK investment in China's  technology and capital-intensive projects.    The two sides also have agreed to set up a special work  panel  to oversee co-operative plans.    According to the agreement, ROK is responsible for  industrial, commercial, joint venture and energy projects, while  China takes on technology, information and market development.    Despite this progress, China has suffered a deficit in the  past few years, as much as $2.5 billion in 1993.    Chinese officials have complained that while ROK exports to  the mainland enjoy favourable terms, Chinese exports face  deteriorating conditions.    ROK has restricted imports of grain and other agricultural  products from China to protect its domestic market from being  squeezed.    And it still restricts Chinese business people from entering  its territory.    But on the Chinese side, the undesirable trade systems have  yet to be improved to further meet international demands.    China has in many cases imposed non-tariff measures to limit  imports, and such measures are not known to the outsiders.    But China has agreed to make public all its regulations to  rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) this  year.    It has become the largest overseas market for ROK  investment.  Most of the investment has ended up in shoes, leather, garments,  furniture, electronics and building materials sectors.     "

Davydov made the statement during a recent interview with  this XINHUA reporter.    While reviewing the past, Davydov said: Since 1992, both  Russia and China have been implementing measures that encourage  bilateral trade. Consequently, Sino-Russian bilateral trade  value in 1992 was $5.862 billion, up 50 percent on the trade  value between the former Soviet Union and China in 1991. In  1993, Sino-Russian trade continued to grow, reaching $7.679  billion, an increase of 30.9 percent over that of 1992; out of  the total, Russian exports to China increased 41.4 percent, and  imports from China rose 15.2 percent. He said: In 1993, China  became Russia's second largest trading partner; Germany topped  the list.    The foreign economic relations minister frankly admitted: In  the first quarter of 1994, Sino-Russian trade value has slid  temporarily, down 43.5 percent over the same period of 1993.  Analyzing major reasons for the declined trade value, Davydov  said: Russian industrial output has been dropping; commodity  prices have been rising; and transportation expenses have  increased. All these factors have adversely affected the  commercial organizations' enthusiasm to export. Meanwhile,  fewer Russian resources for exports, higher customs duties, and  governmental supervision over the export of raw and semifinished  materials are other contributory factors that have led to the  lower trade value. Additionally, Russian consumer markets have  been relatively saturated with commodities imported from China.    Minister Davydov believed: The downward trend in  Sino-Russian trade is temporary, because further expanding  bilateral economic cooperation suits the mutual benefit of both  countries. He proposed: Bilateral trade issues that need to be  resolved most urgently at present are as follows: Both  countries should ensure smooth traffic on transportation routes.  In accordance with changed circumstances, both countries should  amend the original Sino-Russian bilateral trade agreements so  that they will be compatible with the new conditions. The  central banks of both countries should reach an agreement  whereby some trading transactions, other than state-level  trading transactions, can be settled with their own currencies.  Both countries should improve policies on bilateral trade that  is state-regulated. Furthermore, both countries should provide  reliable information for entrepreneurs and traders in the two  countries. They should also resolve debt issues remaining  between them from the past.    Davydov expressed his belief: Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin's upcoming visit to China will facilitate  Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation to develop in a  healthy and stable manner.

Rams officials did not return phone calls to The Times on Tuesday. As outlined,  the settlement would cost the team almost $25,000 in payments to 22 musicians  for 11 home games, plus an undisclosed sum in benefits. The 22 musicians would  have made $102 plus benefits for each of three exhibition games and eight  regular season games.    If the Rams reject the settlement, the NLRB will issue a formal complaint and  schedule a hearing before an administrative judge, to be held in two to three  months, Warheit said. Charges against the Rams, according to Warheit, would  include failure to bargain in good faith, refusal to provide information to the  union and discriminating against employees because of union activity.    The Rams broke off negotiations with the union in July after the union refused  to reduce the size of the band from 22 members to 15, which Rams officials said  would have saved them about $1,000 per game.

For the previous 10 years, the team had contracted with professional players  from the musicians' union.

The Rams then moved to reopen negotiations, according to Amoss, but turned down  a union-proposed compromise of an 18-piece band, sticking with its demands for  a reduction to 15 members.

Talks broke off again, with union officials deciding to wait for results of the  NLRB investigation, which was concluded early this month.

That all state institutions, industrial, commercial,  financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private  individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as  of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the  Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial,  scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields  are canceled.    2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in  Clause  1 of this decree shall not extend to military and  military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions  of the UN Security Council.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation    [End box]    ""Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986  Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted  independent decisions restricting trade relations between the  two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against  South Africa by the United Nations,"" was how Leonid Safonov,  chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to  KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree.  Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions)  trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one  further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained  merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its  leader, Nelson Mandela.    Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been  lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms  supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and  petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977  remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will  be abolished only after the first free elections have been held  in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust  created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May  1994.    It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between  Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international  sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly  actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the  information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to  KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs  considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year  was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant  preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South  African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover  in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million.    Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement  in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record  contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics,  which only take account in practice of deals between major  (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, ""unclassified  commodities"" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale  wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in  experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and  not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa,  what is more, account in the South African statistical summary  for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million.    In the trade in ""classified"" commodities, on the other hand,  imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry  (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and  electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000)  accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place  in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports  from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000).    Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that  the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond  to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid  Safonov put it, ""One has the impression that Russian  entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the  novels of Louis Boussenard."" Meanwhile, according to him, not so  much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main  interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of  the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid  fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions  of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to  provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel  requirements. The technology of South African mining companies  permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many  of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far  above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South  Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation  was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is  more.    In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry  Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to  offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to  information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known  South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral,  Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the  Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy  stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets  for rolled products. The firms Ace, P.B. International, Latitude  Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies  from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode  copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric  cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry  Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct  contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia  joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the  Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to  KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been  concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian  cement also.    In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has  reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN,  Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles,  Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane  models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of  viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the  prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on  leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance  are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the  joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter  routes.    Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products  (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American  and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of  interest in South Africa to Russian importers.    Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the  South African market to consider the quite complex domestic  political situation in this country. Despite the fact that  President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to  avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality,  nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and  the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot  be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the  political instability factor when concluding contracts--and,  accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the  event of drastic changes in the political situation.    In addition, it is essential to take account also of the  following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation  has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims  the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was  signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers'  adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the  abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the  cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it  describes merely the most general principles of mutual  relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the  development of business--on the protection of investments and  the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual  contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to  the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not  be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of  these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in  respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South  Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial  activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies  to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a  citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must  pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa.    Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here,  according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary  citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive  income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals  and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South  Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax.    KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the  Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the  rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum  rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level  of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family  situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000  rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men,  $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate  of profits tax is 40 percent.    To return to the question of how promising South African  technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning  that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the  taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with  Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement  excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from  the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs  duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments  over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired  (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual  payments to negligible amounts).    And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact  that there is in South Africa the concept of ""white"" and ""black""  business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different  races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner  Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests  of ""white"" business) and the National Federative South African  Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black  entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen  in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber  of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of  1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the  Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on  cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also  with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition,  protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade  Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed.  All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000  South African companies--practically all which are of more or  less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade  relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a  sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule,  permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry  Chamber office could help them in their search.

The 45-month embargo on Iraq has  caused a heavy burden for Jordan. Relations between Jordan and  the United States are excellent. The U.S. position on Jerusalem  has not changed. The United States seeks to reach a  comprehensive peace in the region, and my tour emphasizes this.    These are highlights of Christopher's statements, which he  made at a news conference via satellite broadcast by several  world capitals.    If we want to assess these statements, we cannot but  describe  them as positive and consider them points in favor of the U.S.  policy in the region, that is assuming they were not made just  for consumption or to prepare for Christopher's upcoming tour of  the region, which will begin within days, in his capacity as a  full partner in the current peace negotiations between the Arabs  and Israel.    For the U.S. secretary of state to take note of the fact  that  the siege imposed on Iraq and the siege of al-'Aqabah have  caused a considerable burden for Jordan is something very  important, but talk and statements are one thing and actual  implementation is something else.    If the United States is serious about what it says, then the  first thing that it should do is to stop these measures and stop  all practices that cause any harm to any people in the region.    As for the peace process, the United States, which is the  full partner and main sponsor, should play its role honestly and  neutrally and without a clear and open bias to the Israeli side  as the situation is now. Israel still shows disregard for  international charters and resolutions and is obstructing the  path of peace in a bid to abort the peace process and preempt  the negotiations with the Arabs from tackling any issue that  brings a just and comprehensive peace closer.    The United States continues to supply Israel with all means  of strength, most modern weapons, and all it needs to remain  superior in the region, continue its deviation, and practice all  forms of repression, terrorism, killing, and siege on the  occupied territories, destroying houses, and launching  aggressions against cities and villages, whether in occupied  Palestine or south Lebanon. All these practices are carried out  while the U.S. Administration is aware of them.    At any rate, we are going to take Warren Christopher's  statements seriously, and we hope to see implementation on the  ground. Only then we will reconsider what is said about the  U.S. full bias toward Israel.     "

I  thought, 'Oh, my God, why does this have to happen here?' ""    The incident last March offers evidence of what some say is a disturbing trend  in Orange County: that as this onetime outpost of white suburbia becomes  increasingly urbanized and ethnically diverse, racial tensions are increasing.    There have been reports of skinhead attacks in Huntington Beach, of racist  literature distributed on high school campuses and at shopping centers in  Fullerton, and of mud and paint splashed on Little Saigon freeway signs. And  recently, a black family in Laguna Hills returned home and found their house  vandalized, its walls spray painted with racial slurs.    While there are no Orange County statistics on hate crimes, the rash of recent  incidents comes at a time when hate crimes are on the rise nationally and in  Los Angeles County, where they jumped 32% in the first half of 1990.    Rusty Kennedy, executive director of the Orange County Human Relations  Commission, said the county is at an important crossroads: It must either  accept a destiny as a cosmopolitan area with a harmonious blend of cultures, or  cling to the parochialism of the past, paving the way for future racial  discord.    "" . . . Right-wing groups that spew a lot of bigotry are all that some people  know about Orange County,"" said Kennedy, who runs the county-funded commission  formed to promote racial understanding. ""This is a time for us to change that  perception.""    The Laguna Hills incident was roundly condemned by community leaders, including  Sheriff Brad Gates.    ""These are the most despicable individuals that I can think about,"" Gates said.  ""Anybody that can steal about in someone's home and terrorize a family should  be handled accordingly.""    He added, ""We had several incidents in the last month or so. It's pretty hard  to gauge whether (hate crimes) are on the rise. But obviously any responsible  person would not like to see this continue in our community.""    In addition to speaking out after the Laguna Hills incident, Gates also  recently sent a memorandum to his deputies urging them to be alert to possible  hate crimes and sensitive in their handling of such cases.    Some community activists say that relations among the county's multitude of  racial and ethnic groups are tenuous at best and likely to deteriorate if  economic conditions worsen.    ""I think at this point the economy has been viable enough to keep potential  tensions under wraps,"" said William Billingsley, a UC Irvine doctoral candidate  studying race relations. ""But if there are serious economic difficulties in the  future, this could be a potentially explosive situation.""    Only recently, with the unprecedented infusion of minorities, has Orange County  begun to grapple with the complex social and economic conflicts inherent in a  multiethnic society.    Historically, the county evolved as a homogeneous, bedroom community for whites  fleeing urban crime, pollution and other ills that some attributed to  increasing numbers of blacks, Latinos and Asians moving into Los Angeles. A Ku  Klux Klan stronghold in the 1920s and later a place where the John Birch  Society was active, Orange County earned a reputation as a national symbol of  unbridled conservatism.    Richard Orozco, the first Latino appointed as an Orange County Municipal judge,  based in Santa Ana, remembers his initial impression of the county when he took  office in 1976: ""lily white.""    ""You'd go to a restaurant or to the movies and it was white,"" said Orozco, who  was raised in Los Angeles. ""I went to a Mexican restaurant in Laguna Niguel and  I was the only Hispanic in there except for the waiters.""    But all that is changing.    For, just as Los Angeles became increasingly Latino in the 1960s, Orange County  is undergoing a similar metamorphosis today. With a gross product about the  same as the entire nation of Argentina, the county has become a magnet for  minorities attracted by a wealth of economic opportunities.    The most dramatic changes seem to be occurring in the northern Orange County.  Because of lower housing costs and proximity to Los Angeles, Koreans,  Vietnamese, Mexicans and other immigrants are forever changing the complexion  of middle- and working-class white neighborhoods in Fullerton, Garden Grove and  Westminster.    In addition, more affluent non-white families are forging farther south into  planned communities such as Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, challenging Orange  County's reputation as the land of suburban white flight.    ""What is so astonishing about this current transformation is that it has  occurred almost overnight,"" said County of Orange demographer William Gayk. ""If  the trend continues, we will have something similar to what's occurred in L.A.  County.""    Consider, he said, that 20 years ago 90% of Orange County residents were white;  in 1990, that number dropped to 75% of 2.2 million people. And according to  current projections, one in three residents will be Latino or Asian by the year  2000. Blacks will account for another 2% of the population.    A better barometer of the county's future is the public schools. In 1970,  whites made up 86% of students in grades kindergarten through 12. This school  year, 44% are Latino, Asian or black.    In Santa Ana, only a few schools have any white students left, said Khamchong  Luangpraseut, director of the Indochinese program for Santa Ana Unified, the  county's largest school district.    Orange County has no central clearinghouse that keeps track of racially  motivated crimes. They can be reported to local law enforcement agencies, the  FBI or the Human Relations Commission, among other agencies. Often they go  unreported because the victims fear further repercussions.    However, a number of racially motivated incidents have drawn attention in  recent months:    * Late last month, in Orange, a newlywed couple -- the wife is Jewish and her  husband Catholic -- found that their car had been vandalized, its dashboard  marked with a swastika and an anti-Semitic death message scrawled in the dust  on its side. The couple reported a similar incident earlier this year: Someone  drew a swastika in the dust of the husband's windshield. Orange police said  they were investigating the incident as possible religious terrorism. The  couple has since moved.    * Twice in the last three weeks, rock-wielding vandals shattered a glass door  at the front of the Anaheim Korean Presbyterian Church in attacks that Anaheim  police said appeared to be hate crimes. In the first incident on Nov. 13,  messages including ""get out now"" were written in chalk on a church sidewalk and  an office blackboard.    * In August, a 15-year-old Garden Grove girl was disfigured in a brawl between  two groups of young people. Amber Jefferson, the daughter of a white mother and  black father, initially told authorities that she had been attacked because she  was black. The district attorney rejected her claims, saying that the incident  was sparked by a confrontation between two girls over a boy. Still, for a time  the incident became a cause celebre for civil rights activists and helped to  focus attention on racial tensions in the county.    * In June, three young whites described as skinheads attacked a 26-year-old  black man in the back parking lot of a Huntington Beach shopping center. The  victim told police his assailants were working on a car when one of them yelled  a racial slur at him. When he yelled back, they began beating and kicking him.  He said he managed to run away after one of the men threatened him with a  knife.    * In January, a white supremacist from Anaheim was arrested after allegedly  walking into a Fullerton pizza restaurant and threatening to kill a Jewish  cook. Martin Dayton Cox, 23, an ex-convict who was once bodily thrown off the  ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" also listed the cook's name and place of employment on a  white-supremacy group's recorded message line that urges callers to hate Jews,  blacks and other minorities.    * And in November, the Laguna Hills home of Delano De Silva was vandalized, its  walls and furniture painted with racial slurs. De Silva, an insurance  underwriter, was born in Panama but is now a U.S. citizen and Air Force  veteran. It was his 14-year-old son, a student at Laguna Hills High School, who  returned home and found the house vandalized. Sheriff's investigators called  the incident a ""classic hate crime"" and speculated that it was committed by  youths, possibly members of a skinhead gang.    Officials such as Kennedy of the Human Relations Commission say incidents such  as the one in Laguna Hills provide evidence that as Orange County becomes more  ethnically diverse, it must change.    ""I think the County of Orange more than any other area has a challenge to  change,"" said Korean American Assn. President Ho Young Chung, a 56-year-old  insurance agent from Westminster. Whites ""have no choice but to accept that  challenge and find a harmonious way to live together.""    Many whites, however, apparently do not believe that racism is a major problem.  A Times poll last year found that whites ranked prejudice lowest on a list of  concerns including crime, drugs, unemployment, moral decline, the economy, the  budget deficit, AIDS and foreign trade. Ironically, the same poll found that  blacks believe they encounter more discrimination in Orange County than  anywhere else in the Southland.    ""A significant part of the problem in Orange County,"" said Kennedy, ""is that  people do not acknowledge that racism is a problem. Everyone says, 'some  skinheads jumped a Vietnamese after school. It's just an isolated incident.' ""    Demographic experts say these kinds of conflicts are inevitable when the old  order gives way to a more culturally diverse county. But how can a community  defuse racial tensions before they escalate?    Latino rights activist Amin David is focusing his attention on the schools.  David, president of Los Amigos, a Latino activist group, is among a growing  number of community leaders and scholars lobbying for ethnic studies classes as  a required part the college curriculum.    ""I envision something that would embody the histories of the dominant  minorities and their contributions to our society,"" David said. ""Something to  give the Anglo a small handle on us.""    Ethnic awareness programs are already under way at a handful of county schools.  At La Quinta, a public high school in Westminster, Youth Leadership for Action,  a group of three white and four Asian students concerned about an increase in  racial incidents, is working to fight prejudice by sponsoring regular cultural  activities for their fellow students.    The demographic changes at La Quinta are typical of what has occurred at many  public schools in the county: 10 years ago, 71% of the students were white.  Today 42% are white, 32.2% are Latino and 24.7% are Asian.    The troubling results, some students say, are self-imposed segregatation in  lunchrooms, racially motivated gang violence and mutual distrust of other  ethnic groups.    ""I think that unless there are programs initiated either in the school or  community that will make people aware that things are changing and diversity  isn't always bad, there are going to be problems,"" said Qui Nguyen, 18,  president of Youth Leadership for Action's ethnic awareness council. ""We've got  to do something to get that message out.""      Photo, Racial slurs were scrawled upon walls by vandals who invaded the home of  a black family in Laguna Hills.

A Ku  Klux Klan stronghold in the 1920s and later a place where the John Birch  Society was active, Orange County earned a reputation as a national symbol of  unbridled conservatism.    Richard Orozco, the first Latino appointed as an Orange County Municipal judge,  based in Santa Ana, remembers his initial impression of the county when he took  office in 1976: ""lily white.""    ""You'd go to a restaurant or to the movies and it was white,"" said Orozco, who  was raised in Los Angeles. ""I went to a Mexican restaurant in Laguna Niguel and  I was the only Hispanic in there except for the waiters.""    But all that is changing.    For, just as Los Angeles became increasingly Latino in the 1960s, Orange County  is undergoing a similar metamorphosis today. With a gross product about the  same as the entire nation of Argentina, the county has become a magnet for  minorities attracted by a wealth of economic opportunities.    The most dramatic changes seem to be occurring in the northern Orange County.  Because of lower housing costs and proximity to Los Angeles, Koreans,  Vietnamese, Mexicans and other immigrants are forever changing the complexion  of middle- and working-class white neighborhoods in Fullerton, Garden Grove and  Westminster.    In addition, more affluent non-white families are forging farther south into  planned communities such as Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, challenging Orange  County's reputation as the land of suburban white flight.    ""What is so astonishing about this current transformation is that it has  occurred almost overnight,"" said County of Orange demographer William Gayk. ""If  the trend continues, we will have something similar to what's occurred in L.A.  County.""    Consider, he said, that 20 years ago 90% of Orange County residents were white;  in 1990, that number dropped to 75% of 2.2 million people. And according to  current projections, one in three residents will be Latino or Asian by the year  2000. Blacks will account for another 2% of the population.    A better barometer of the county's future is the public schools. In 1970,  whites made up 86% of students in grades kindergarten through 12. This school  year, 44% are Latino, Asian or black.    In Santa Ana, only a few schools have any white students left, said Khamchong  Luangpraseut, director of the Indochinese program for Santa Ana Unified, the  county's largest school district.    Orange County has no central clearinghouse that keeps track of racially  motivated crimes. They can be reported to local law enforcement agencies, the  FBI or the Human Relations Commission, among other agencies. Often they go  unreported because the victims fear further repercussions.    However, a number of racially motivated incidents have drawn attention in  recent months:    * Late last month, in Orange, a newlywed couple -- the wife is Jewish and her  husband Catholic -- found that their car had been vandalized, its dashboard  marked with a swastika and an anti-Semitic death message scrawled in the dust  on its side. The couple reported a similar incident earlier this year: Someone  drew a swastika in the dust of the husband's windshield. Orange police said  they were investigating the incident as possible religious terrorism. The  couple has since moved.    * Twice in the last three weeks, rock-wielding vandals shattered a glass door  at the front of the Anaheim Korean Presbyterian Church in attacks that Anaheim  police said appeared to be hate crimes. In the first incident on Nov. 13,  messages including ""get out now"" were written in chalk on a church sidewalk and  an office blackboard.    * In August, a 15-year-old Garden Grove girl was disfigured in a brawl between  two groups of young people. Amber Jefferson, the daughter of a white mother and  black father, initially told authorities that she had been attacked because she  was black. The district attorney rejected her claims, saying that the incident  was sparked by a confrontation between two girls over a boy. Still, for a time  the incident became a cause celebre for civil rights activists and helped to  focus attention on racial tensions in the county.    * In June, three young whites described as skinheads attacked a 26-year-old  black man in the back parking lot of a Huntington Beach shopping center. The  victim told police his assailants were working on a car when one of them yelled  a racial slur at him. When he yelled back, they began beating and kicking him.  He said he managed to run away after one of the men threatened him with a  knife.    * In January, a white supremacist from Anaheim was arrested after allegedly  walking into a Fullerton pizza restaurant and threatening to kill a Jewish  cook. Martin Dayton Cox, 23, an ex-convict who was once bodily thrown off the  ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" also listed the cook's name and place of employment on a  white-supremacy group's recorded message line that urges callers to hate Jews,  blacks and other minorities.    * And in November, the Laguna Hills home of Delano De Silva was vandalized, its  walls and furniture painted with racial slurs. De Silva, an insurance  underwriter, was born in Panama but is now a U.S. citizen and Air Force  veteran. It was his 14-year-old son, a student at Laguna Hills High School, who  returned home and found the house vandalized. Sheriff's investigators called  the incident a ""classic hate crime"" and speculated that it was committed by  youths, possibly members of a skinhead gang.    Officials such as Kennedy of the Human Relations Commission say incidents such  as the one in Laguna Hills provide evidence that as Orange County becomes more  ethnically diverse, it must change.    ""I think the County of Orange more than any other area has a challenge to  change,"" said Korean American Assn. President Ho Young Chung, a 56-year-old  insurance agent from Westminster. Whites ""have no choice but to accept that  challenge and find a harmonious way to live together.""    Many whites, however, apparently do not believe that racism is a major problem.  A Times poll last year found that whites ranked prejudice lowest on a list of  concerns including crime, drugs, unemployment, moral decline, the economy, the  budget deficit, AIDS and foreign trade. Ironically, the same poll found that  blacks believe they encounter more discrimination in Orange County than  anywhere else in the Southland.    ""A significant part of the problem in Orange County,"" said Kennedy, ""is that  people do not acknowledge that racism is a problem. Everyone says, 'some  skinheads jumped a Vietnamese after school. It's just an isolated incident.' ""    Demographic experts say these kinds of conflicts are inevitable when the old  order gives way to a more culturally diverse county. But how can a community  defuse racial tensions before they escalate?    Latino rights activist Amin David is focusing his attention on the schools.  David, president of Los Amigos, a Latino activist group, is among a growing  number of community leaders and scholars lobbying for ethnic studies classes as  a required part the college curriculum.    ""I envision something that would embody the histories of the dominant  minorities and their contributions to our society,"" David said. ""Something to  give the Anglo a small handle on us.""    Ethnic awareness programs are already under way at a handful of county schools.  At La Quinta, a public high school in Westminster, Youth Leadership for Action,  a group of three white and four Asian students concerned about an increase in  racial incidents, is working to fight prejudice by sponsoring regular cultural  activities for their fellow students.    The demographic changes at La Quinta are typical of what has occurred at many  public schools in the county: 10 years ago, 71% of the students were white.  Today 42% are white, 32.2% are Latino and 24.7% are Asian.    The troubling results, some students say, are self-imposed segregatation in  lunchrooms, racially motivated gang violence and mutual distrust of other  ethnic groups.    ""I think that unless there are programs initiated either in the school or  community that will make people aware that things are changing and diversity  isn't always bad, there are going to be problems,"" said Qui Nguyen, 18,  president of Youth Leadership for Action's ethnic awareness council. ""We've got  to do something to get that message out.""      Photo, Racial slurs were scrawled upon walls by vandals who invaded the home of  a black family in Laguna Hills.

Li will fly to Europe via Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang  Uygur Autonomous Region.    The Chinese premier was invited for the two-week trip by  Austrian Prime Minister Franz Vranitzky, German Chancellor  Helmut Kohl, and Romanian President Ion Iliescu and Prime  Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu.    Meeting the press at the Great Hall of the People here prior  to his departure, Li Peng said that ""the visit will help boost  the friendly relations and co-operation"" between China and the  three European countries.    He said that China wishes to see further development in the  co- operation with them in economy, trade, science and  technology, education and other spheres.    During his current return visit, Li will exchange views in  depth with leaders of the three countries on both international  and bilateral relations, especially bilateral economic  co-operation.    Li expected that some governmental agreements and business  accords will be signed with the three countries during his trip.    Western Europe now has a population of over 370 million and  its total GNP has overtaken that of the United States, he noted.    In addition, it boasts advanced technologies, and has  adopted  a relatively open attitude toward technology transfer to China,  Li said.    China has had very good trade ties with the region, Li  stressed.    Li said there has been a long history of co-operation  between  Germany and China, and Germany ranks as China's biggest trade  partner in western Europe.    Li revealed that his entourage includes not only  high-ranking  officials, but also executives from over 30 large and key  enterprises in metallurgy, power, petrochemicals, automobiles,  machinery and trade. All of them have direct business links  with Germany and Austria.    Li expressed the belief that the visit would bring fruitful  results to the economic co-operation between China and the three  countries.    During his absence, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji will act as  premier.    The premier's entourage includes Vice-Premier Li Lanqing,  Minister Wang Zhongyu of the State Economic and Trade  Commission, Vice-Minister Ye Qing of the State Planning  Commission, minister Liu Qi of the metallurgical industry,  Director of the Foreign Affairs Office under the State Council  Qi Huaiyuan and Vice-Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu.    Among those present at the Great Hall of the People to see  Li  off were Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji and and Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua  as well as diplomatic envoys in Beijing of the three European  countries.

""Beijing has not only failed to faithfully implement the  written agreements it has reached with Taiwan but has also often  distorted oral agreements or interpreted them out of context,""  said Kao Kung-lien, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC], which sets Taiwan's policy toward Beijing.    Kao was commenting on the slow progress in the ongoing round  of talks in Beijing between the two semi official intermediary  bodies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait on the three thorny  issues -- the repatriation of mainland hijackers, the  repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants, and the resolution  of cross-strait fishing disputes.    The talks between officials from Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation (SEF) and the mainland's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) have deadlocked over Beijing's  reluctance to recognize Taiwan's legal jurisdiction. During the  talks, Kao said, mainland delegates have unilaterally distorted  ""consensuses"" reached in talks between SEF Vice Chairman Chiao  Jen-ho and his ARATS counterpart, Tang Shubei, in Beijing late  last year concerning the three issues.    For one thing, Kao explained, the joint press statement  issued at the end of Chiao-Tang meeting said Taiwan would agree  not to include the repatriation of criminal suspects in  cross-strait agreements on the repatriation of illegal  immigrants and hijackers if Beijing would agree to SEF proposals  that Taiwan be allowed to automatically repatriate illegal  mainland immigrants and that it not have to repatriate Taiwan  nationals who hijack mainland planes to Taiwan.    In the current round of talks, which began March 25, Beijing  rejected the two SEF premises while simply insisting that  criminal suspects be excluded from any agreements on the  repatriation of illegal immigrants and hijackers.    Talks were adjourned Monday with no progress reported, and  will resume Tuesday. Reports from Beijing quoted chief Taiwan  negotiator Hsu hui-yu as saying that whether the talks will  continue through Wednesday as scheduled depends on whether any  progress can be made in Tuesday's talks. Hsu is also SEF deputy  secretary-general.    This is the fourth round of SEF-ARATS talks on the three  issues since the heads of the two organizations met in Singapore  last April. The two sides failed to reach any agreements in  subsequent talks held in Beijing, Xiamen and Taipei in the  second half of last year.    Another SEF secretary-general, Shih Chi-ping, was originally  scheduled to leave for Beijing Monday for talks with ARATS  officials on some cross-strait economic issues, but his trip was  canceled because of the lack of progress in talks on the  aforesaid three pressing issues.

Belluardo said that while immigration reform has not completely eliminated the  problem, the numbers of illegal immigrants who attempt to cross U.S borders has  been greatly reduced.

0,FT941-12755 ,"FT941-12755 _AN-EA1CHAD9FT 940128   FT  28 JAN 94 / Ofgas eases price setting factor: Domestic gas bills will fall more slowly to offset industrial losses      By ROBERT CORZINE   Ofgas, the gas industry regulator, yesterday relaxed the main element in the tariff formula which sets the price British Gas can charge to its monopoly market of about 18m residential customers. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, accepted a recommendation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission that the efficiency factor in the formula, set in 1992 at the retail price index minus 5 percentage points, be relaxed to RPI minus 4. The factor makes up 60 per cent of a consumer's bill, with the actual cost of the gas accounting for the remainder. The reduction is intended to compensate British Gas for the large loss of commercial and industrial customers to independent gas suppliers in the past two years, and the negative impact that has had on investment. Mr Norman Blacker, managing director of UK Gas Business, the domestic supply arm of British Gas, welcomed the decision, saying it would 'help redress some of the loss of income caused by . . . the introduction of competition into the market above 2,500 therms'. The financial benefit to British Gas is likely to be worth about Pounds 24m after-tax this year, according to City analysts. British Gas shares closed up 4 1/2 p at 349 1/2 p. Ofgas said the change would have little impact on consumers, who would simply see a slower rate of decline in gas prices. The regulator estimated gas prices would fall 1.8 per cent less over three years than under the RPI minus 5 formula. That would be equivalent to about Pounds 2 a year for the average household, it said. But the Gas Consumers Council said prices would fall by 3 per cent less over three years. Mr Ian Powe, director, said some would see this concession as a watchdog eating from the hand it used to bite. Many analysts saw the decision as further evidence of a rapidly improving relationship between Ofgas and British Gas. Relations between the two were often turbulent under Sir James McKinnon, former director-general, who stepped down last November. Earlier this week, Ms Spottiswoode admitted that Ofgas had at times 'exceeded its powers' in dealing with British Gas. But the regulator remained adamant that it would not implement another MMC recommendation that consumers pay for the break-up of British Gas. The government last month rejected that course in favour of the complete separation of the storage and transportation business from British Gas's trading arm. Ofgas said that since divestment was no longer an issue, 'there is no reason why the costs of internal restructuring should be borne by customers'. See Lex   Companies:-  British Gas.

The Russian naval chief, Admiral  Gromov, is due here soon, while the Chief of the Army Staff,  Gen. B. C. Joshi, will go to Russia later this month. Russian  ships will make a call at Bombay in the near future, while the  plans for joint naval exercises are under way.    At the political level too, the warmth and likemindedness,  evident during the stay here of the Russian President, Mr. Boris  Yeltsin, remains intact. According to latest indications from  Moscow, Russia will support New Delhi's stand at the U.N. Human  Rights Commission at Geneva, where Pakistan plans to move an  anti-India resolution. The warmth beneath the customary Republic  Day message from Mr. Yeltsin to the President, Dr. S.D. Sharma,  has not gone unnoticed. ""Our two countries are united,"" said Mr.  Yeltsin, ""not only by the concurrence of the core national  interest, adherence to democratic objectives but also by the  invaluable potential of mutual trust and sincere goodwill.""    The idea of the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's  visit to Moscow has been seriously mooted but the schedule is  yet to be finalised. At one stage, the two foreign offices  proceeded on the assumption of a trip in May--but, now a later  date is to be fixed, around the middle of the year.    The two leaders recently exchanged letters, dealing with  bilateral issues and the problems of their respective regions.  Kashmir and Indo-Pakistan relations figured in the two  communications though the precise references are not known  publicly. According to the Russian embassy sources here, Moscow  regarded Kashmir an integral part of India and affirmed faith in  its territorial integrity, considered a ""must"" not only for the  region but for the world as a whole.    On one issue, however, Russia will need to update its  position. Mr. Yeltsin's letter, it is learnt, had noted with  satisfaction Pakistan's decision to give up its plan for an  anti-India human rights-related resolution at the U.N. That  phase, however, proved short-lived with Pakistan thinking of an  identical move at Geneva. On trans-border terrorism, India has  every reason to draw comfort from the Russian view.     "

Cisneros made it clear that the official Malvinas policy is  not set by the Foreign Ministry, but ""by President Carlos Menem  himself.""    He said: ""There are only three ways in which to recover the  lost territories: to demand them by right, war, or through  negotiations,"" and he justified the use of the last alternative  because to ""insist only on the judicial factor is not enough to  recover the islands because the world organization does not have  an institution that can award what each country has a right to.""    In remarks to a radio station, Cisneros said that with this  type of claim, which he considered ""very dignified and very  correct for these times, we have the reason but not the islands.  There are two ways for a right to become a reality: war or  negotiation, there are no others. We already know what the  results of a war are with Great Britain; therefore, only  negotiation remains.""    Regarding the attempts to change the attitude of the Kelpers  [preceding word in English] regarding Argentina, Cisneros said:  ""It is not a question of seducing them to deceive them or  attract them with fantastic promises.""    He stated that there are two very distinct attitudes  regarding the Malvinas, and one of them ""has lasted for 160  years and it is the hostile attitude based on the premise that  if the islanders always get the short end of the stick,  Argentina will always be better off.""    Cisneros indicated that instead this government believes the  better way ""is everything to the contrary, and that as we  establish links of mutual interest they will begin to understand  that the only way they have to exploit their notable raw  materials is through cooperation with the only neighbor in the  world that God has given them.""    He mentioned that the fact that the British Government is  investigating alleged war crimes by its soldiers and that  Argentina has offered to clear up the mine fields are among the  achievements that have helped the rapprochement between the two  nations.    Finally, he stressed that for some time now ""millions of  Argentines"" have had two passports and can now visit the  islands, and ""this is a very important first step toward  unfreezing relations with the islanders.""

During the meeting at the  Congress in Washington, Mr. Pell praised his majesty's wise  leadership and his policy towards various regional and  international issues.    His majesty said Jordan has always sought to bring about  peace in the region, adding that serious work was to begin soon  to solve all issues on the coming agenda with Israel, signed in  Washington following the Israeli-Palestinian agreement. His  majesty pointed that the coming phase is critical and sensitive,  expressing hope of a new dawn in the region.    In answer to a question on Jordan's economy, his majesty the  king told the senators that Jordan is rebuilding its economy and  explained the impacts of the Gulf war on this economy. His  majesty added that such crisis had left Jordan under the big  burden of debts and voiced hope that peace would ease this  burden.    On Arab coordination, his majesty expressed dissatisfaction  for the lack of such coordination until now and stressed that  Jordan is keen on solving all problems on all tracks so as to  bring about a comprehensive peace capable of improving the  standard of living for peoples of this region.    On the Jordanian-Palestinian relationship, his majesty told  the U.S. officials that Jordan will do all it can to support  Palestinian brethren and make their self-rule a success.    His majesty's meeting with the senators was attended by the  prime minister, the chief of the Royal Court, his majesty's  political and military advisers, and the Jordanian ambassador in  Washington.    His majesty told reporters after the meeting that he  discussed several issues of common interest with the U.S.  senators and described the meeting as taking place in a friendly  atmosphere.    Meanwhile, the White House issued a statement on his majesty  the king's summit meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton last  night. The statement said President Clinton discussed with King  Husayn the peace process in the Middle East, in addition to  regional developments and bilateral relations.    President Clinton praised the courage and vision of his  majesty the king in pursuing peace with Israel and pledged  ongoing U.S. support for the Mideast peace process. Mr. Clinton  reaffirmed the support of the United States for a comprehensive  settlement in the Middle East, including the Syrian track.    President Clinton also said the Mideast peace process  remains  a very important priority for him and for the administration and  added that he was very encouraged by what has been achieved in  the whole process.

The letter says: As informed by  relevant Fujian provincial authorities, at about 0400 on 6  March, (Zheng Baoxing) and other fishermen from (Simu) Village,  Huangshi Town, Lianjian County, set sail on fishing boat  (?Yuminyu) No. 8509 to fish at waters near Mazu's (Daqi Island).  While searching for their lost fishing hooks due to broken  lines, they were suddenly fired at by the defense troops.  (Zheng Baoxing), a crew member, was shot dead on the spot,  while (Yan Huayong) and [words indistinct] were injured. After  the incident, the boat sought medical treatment but was rejected  by the defense troops firing their guns. Fifteen minutes later,  the boat sailed to Mazu's Beigan to moor at (Huaikaicun) pier,  and was again fired at by the defense troops. Only after the  repeated requests of crewman (Lin Huoqiang), two men, who  appeared to be officers, came to investigate and summoned a  doctor to give simple dressings for (Wu Guoyou)'s wounds. One  of the officers gave $15,000 New Taiwan dollars to (Lin  Huoqiang) as compensation. At about 1300, the Mazu side sent a  boat to tow (Yuminyu) No. 8509 from the pier. The fishing boat  returned to Huangshi, Lianjiang, at 1430.    The letter says: Over a long period of time, Taiwan's  defending troops stationed on offshore islands ignored the  brotherly friendship between the people on the two sides of the  Taiwan Strait. The incidents of firing at and killing or  injuring mainland fishermen occurred occasionally. In 1993  alone, there were 18 incidents wherein defense troops in Jinmen  and Mazu fired at or shelled mainland fishermen working on the  sea, causing bloodshed, deaths, and injuries. Of these, seven  people were killed and 15 were injured. The disgusting conduct  of Taiwan's defending troops stationed in offshore islands not  only caused great harm to the feeling of mainland's coastal  fishermen but also disrupted the normal production and life of  the Taiwan Strait. In addition, it brought utmost mental agony  as well as tremendous economic loss to the families of the dead  and injured fishermen.    Recently, we made many representations to relevant Taiwan  authorities. However, not only did the defense troops' firing  not stop, it became increasingly rampant. Our country has  strongly asked the relevant Taiwan authorities to adopt positive  and effective measures to stop this kind of incident from being  repeated and pay compensation, including compensation for the  losses of dead and injured fishermen in the (?Yuminyu) incident.

Kouri rejected Gen. Ordonez' comments and noted the quick  answer from Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Diego Paredes, who said  the general's reaction ""is part of the pressure from some  Ecuadoran political groups seeking to gain support for the  upcoming partial renewal of the Ecuadoran Congress.""    ""There is no territorial problem with Ecuador,"" said Kouri,  who pointed out that any debate on this issue should be made  based on the Rio Protocol, which in 1942 established the borders  between the two countries after a war in 1941.    Ordonez' declarations ""do not deserve an answer,"" said  Kouri,  who added that now Ecuador does not recognize the Rio Protocol,  saying that it is not ""applicable.""    Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on 30 March that  Peru should welcome Ecuadoran Presidnt Sixto Duran Ballen ""with  open arms.""    In relation to the new postponement of Duran Ballen's visit,  President Fujimori, who is in Pucallpa in Peru's central jungle  region, said: ""I presume there are reasons preventing him from  coming and we understand it.""    ""He, Sixto Duran, will find the most appropriate date; let  us  wait for him with open arms,"" reiterated Fujimori, who added  that relations between the two countries are at the highest  level.    The comments by the Ecuadoran general also were criticized  by  another congressman, Manuel Moreyra, of the opposition  Solidarity and Democracy, who said the Peruvian Government has  handled its relations with Ecuador badly.    He said the government made the mistake of making Ecuadorans  believe ""the country can give up part of its territory. We are  now paying the consequences of the bad management of our foreign  relations.""    ""What should have been said from the beginning is that Peru  will not give up a single centimeter of its territory,"" said  Moreyra, thus agreeing with Kouri that Ordonez' comments do not  deserve an answer.    Foreign Relations Committee President Oswaldo Sandoval, from  the government alliance Change 90-New Majority, said the new  postponement of President Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is the  result of internal political problems in Ecuador.    ""It is not a final postponement,"" said Sandoval, who  expressed his hope that the Ecuadoran president will visit Peru  before the end of 1994 in answer to the three visits made by  Fujimori to Ecuador.    He also added that Duran Ballen's visit to Peru is important  to strengthen the links between the two countries.     "

British Coal management had earlier told lawyers acting for the National Union of Mineworkers, the Nacods pit supervisors' union and the Union of Democratic Mineworkers that it would take every step necessary to prevent a deterioration of coal, faces, roadway, and equipment at pits where production has ceased in the past three weeks, and would make daily reports on their conditions available to the unions. Under the out-of-court agreement, British Coal has stated that it will not include the cost of resuming production at the pits in estimating their economic viability. British Coal has also agreed to give an undertaking that, in considering redundancies, it will not discriminate against miners opting to remain in employment during the 90-day consultation period. Mr Mark Stephens, a solicitor for the NUM, described yesterday's agreement as a 'major step forward' in union efforts to save the pits. 'We were preparing to go to court because we feared British Coal was adversely affecting the future economic viability of the pits,' he said. 'We have stopped British Coal from doing that. We believe these pits are now redeemable.' Nevertheless, yesterday's move was the second time in two weeks that the unions failed to win an assurance from British Coal that miners at the 10 pits would be kept in work. Union concerns about the future of the pits looked set to be refuelled yesterday after British Coal confirmed that it had sent out notice-of-redundancy forms to its 50 collieries in anticipation that hundreds of miners would apply for voluntary redundancy over the next few weeks. British Coal said it was complying with the terms of the Trade Union and Labour Relations Consolidation Act 1992, under which employers must give notice to the government and the unions if 100 or more employees are to be dismissed or made redundant over 90 days or less. Mr Ken Capstick, the NUM's vice-president said last night: 'The government and British Coal are deceiving the British people into believing there is going to be a period of consultation. But they are already in the process of closing the pits down.'  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

0,FT923-7552 ,"FT923-7552 _AN-CHSA3ADCFT 920817   FT  17 AUG 92 / British unions consulted less than on Continent      By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and MICHAEL SMITH   BRITISH unions and employees have been consulted far less about moves towards decentralisation and greater flexibility in industrial relations than their continental European counterparts, according to a study to be published next month. While most European governments have been promoting labour-market flexibility, the normal pattern outside Britain has been for such changes to be implemented in close consultation between unions and management, say Prof Richard Hyman and Mr Anthony Ferner of Warwick University. Analyses of trends in individual countries conclude that: 'Thatcherism' in Britain generally reinforced trends in industrial relations that were already under way rather than marking a change of course, and has not left British managers with a more strategic approach to industrial relations. In France, in spite of support for collective bargaining and stronger industrial relations institutions, unions have continued their long decline and employers are enjoying a resurgence in public esteem as wealth creators. The German dual system of industry bargaining and company-level works councils has proved remarkably adaptable but is responding more uncertainly to the challenges of reunification and the introduction of Japanese-style production concepts. Industrial relations in Italy have undergone the most remarkable transformation over the last decade, with co-operation in change encouraged by increasingly formal union-management arrangements. The study challenges the thesis that union power is withering away. It concludes: 'In most countries unions are still robust and are important agents of industrial relations change, especially where national unions maintain strong links with workplace organisation.'

THOSE WHO say that pay for the police and firefighters should no longer be indexed to general earnings should remember the circumstances in which the principle was introduced, a pay expert warns, Michael Smith writes. Sir Pat Lowry, former head of the Acas conciliation service, says: 'In the late 1970s the police were seething over what they considered to be their low pay and the Police Federation was under great pressure to amend its rules prohibiting strike action. 'The firefighters went on strike and the army was called out to cover for them.' Sir Pat, in the Institute of Personnel Management magazine PM Plus, says: 'If indexation is to go, we need an alternative in which the police and firefighters would have faith.'

In  the meeting, the need for expansion of trade ties and exchange  of goods between the two countries was stressed. The two sides  also agreed that two separate committees--comprising commercial  experts of Iran and Syria--be formed to survey practical ways of  promoting commercial cooperation between Tehran and Damascus.    Another important point is that Iran and Syria--as two  powerful states of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East--play a  sensitive and strategic role in the trend of events in the two  regions. They also have relatively common viewpoints on the  events taking place in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.  Based on this matter and also due to common stands of the two  sides on such vital political issues as the compromise deal on  Gaza and Jericho and occupation of south Lebanon by the Zionist  regime, it is essential that the scope of political ties be  expanded to also cover the domain of commercial relations.    During his December visit to Syria, Iran's first vice  president, Dr. Habibi, met and conferred with President Hafiz  al-Asad and also Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. In the  meetings, Dr. Habibi pointed out that Iran has constantly backed  stands of Syria as a country in the front line of combat with  the Zionist regime. From the standpoint of the Islamic Republic  of Iran, this support or consensus between Tehran and Damascus  is viewed to be an unavoidable necessity under the sensitive  conditions currently prevailing in the Middle East region.  Significantly, since the start of the so called Arab-Israel  peace talks process, Syria has been under extreme pressure from  America and its allies so as to divert it from the principled  stand and to force it into accepting the compromise agreements  brokered by America and Israel.    Dr. Habibi, who had led high-ranking political and economic  delegation to Syria--besides conferring with the key Syrian  officials on political events in the region and the world--also  spoke of the need for establishing and developing trade  relations between the two states. Hence it is imagined that the  Monday visit of Iran's commerce minister to Damascus aims at  pursuing the earlier agreements on commercial exchanges and  including practical ways to implement them.    In general, regarding to Tehran and Damascus, it can be said  that politics and economy are in fact two sides of a coin.  Hence, enhancement of relations in one sphere makes the  expansion of trade exchanges unavoidable. Talks of Iran's  commerce minister with the Syrian officials too--in view of the  commercial side of these relations--have duly stressed the  bolstering of economic ties.     "

""We felt shock upon learning the news (about the incident)  on  April 2,"" Lien said. ""Since then, we've asked relevant  government agencies, through the Straits Exchange Foundation  (SEF), to get help from the Mainland authorities.""    All efforts by Taiwan to get information concerning the  incident have been met with no response by Beijing, and every  reasonable demand has been categorically rejected, Lien said  after hearing a report by Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of the  Mainland Affairs Council.    ""The treatment of the incident by the Chinese communists,""  Lien stressed, ""is an indication of the Beijing regime's nature  -- its ignorance of basic human rights and its acting with utter  disregard for human life.""    Lien's condemnation was the harshest ever by a ranking  government official on the mysterious deaths. The 24 Taiwan  travelers, along with six Mainland crew members and two guides,  were burned to death inside the lower cabin of the cruise ship  that was ferrying them across Qiandao lake last Thursday. Many  commentators here suspect the victims were set afire by robbers  who first pillaged the boat.    As of now, little has been revealed about the incident due  to  Beijing's censorship. Relatives of the victims, as well as  reporters, were denied access to the boat and the bodies, and  the relatives were forced to accept Beijing demand that all the  bodies be cremated in Mainland China.    ""We can hardly imagine how a government could handle such a  big incident in such a dumb way,"" Lien said. ""Should the issue  not be fairly and reasonably handled and the truth not unfold,  it would definitely have a severe impact on private exchanges  across the Taiwan Strait.""    Lien also ordered the formation of a special task force to  investigate the incident, to be led by Vice Premier Hsu Li-the.    Pressure also continued to mount at the Legislative Yuan,  with legislators demanding that the government halt the  scheduled fifth round of talks between the SEF and the  Mainland's Association for Relations across the Taiwan Strait  until Beijing opens up about the case.    Meanwhile, relatives of the 24 victims plan to hold a press  conference upon their arrival at Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport on  Saturday.    The relatives, who departed for the Mainland last Sunday,  were detained at a hotel by security officials following the  breakdown of negotiations between the relatives and Mainland  officials over how the victims' bodies would be handled.

This point was made by Chinese President Jiang Zemin when he  had a two-hour talk here today with visiting Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori.    The two presidents pledged to push bilateral relations to a  new height. After their talks, China gave Peru a 39.1 million  U.S. dollar export credit.    Fujimori, who is here for a four-day state visit, previously  visited China in April 1991, and in the same year paid a transit  visit to Shenzhen in November.    Welcoming Fujimori, Jiang said: ""We are happy to see the  great achievements that the Peruvian Government and people have  made in maintaining political stability and in promoting  economic development, under your leadership.""    Jiang said that China and Peru enjoy traditional friendship.  In recent years, he said, that the frequent exchanges of  high-level visits between the two countries have further  enhanced bilateral understanding.    Jiang said that the friendly cooperative relations between  the two countries in various areas have been developing smoothly  in recent years, adding that bilateral trade volume has been  increasing annually and now Peru has become China's No. 4 trade  partner in Latin America.    Jiang, expressing satisfaction with bilateral economic and  technological cooperation, said that China is willing to expand  such mutually beneficial cooperation in different forms, and  that it encourages Chinese enterprises to invest in Peru and  Peruvian ones are also welcome in China.    Fujimori agreed with Jiang's views. He said that Chinese  products were suitable for Peru, and that Peru would like to  expand bilateral trade and wants to take in more Chinese  technology and welcomes Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in Peru.    He thanked China for its assistance and the favored  treatment  China offers in bilateral trade.    Fujimori said that Peru values its relations with China --  the only country to which he has paid two state visits.    Fujimori voiced support for China's entry into the  Pan-American Development Bank, saying that China's entry will be  conducive to trade cooperation between China, Peru and other  Latin American countries.    After the talks, Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister  Qian Qichen and Goldenberg Schreiber, president of Council of  Ministers and minister of foreign affairs of Peru, signed two  agreements: A Sino-Peruvian consular agreement and an agreement  on encouragement and mutual protection of investment between  China and Peru.    At the same ceremony, Wang Xuebing, president of the Bank of  China, signed with Goldenburg an agreement for China to provide  Peru with a 39.1 million U.S. dollar export credit.    Before the talks, Jiang presided over a ceremony welcoming  Fujimori to visit China.     "

New Adjustments Brewing in Japan's Foreign Affairs    With the world quickening its pace toward multipolarity,  disputes in Japan over its strategy for national development  will become fiercer than ever before. Right now, Japan's basic  line for its foreign affairs is to continue its readjustments  and seek changes while holding its ground so as to keep pace  with the changes of its external environment which have taken  place after the Seattle meeting. Due to the fact that  readjustments in its diplomacy are often affected by its  domestic affairs, it is possible Japan may delay or hesitate in  taking action.    1. Create an internal and external environment, pave the way  to becoming a powerful nation in political affairs.    Since Hosokawa took his office, Japan adopted the tactics of  making concessions to gain advantages on the issue of becoming a  permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan attached  importance to ""being recommended by other nations"" rather than  fighting for this membership and taking the initiative by  itself. As for the international environment, Japan believes  that the conditions for Japan to become a permanent member of  the UN Security Council have become ripe in each passing day.  Its next move will be to win popular support at home, while  trying to skirt around the barrier of ""amending its  Constitution."" In foreign affairs, it will launch another round  of offense with emphasis on becoming the fifth permanent member  of the UN Security Council and try to win more votes from  developing nations.    2. Exert greater efforts in promoting ""Asian Diplomacy,"" and  expand Japan's economic interests and political influence in  Asia. In view of its increasing economic dependence on Asia,  Japan will further try to raise its diplomatic status in Asia in  coordination with its domestic economic structural readjustment;  turn the Asia-Pacific region into its economic backyard and  diplomatic prop; and strive to gradually play a leading role in  managing Asia-Pacific affairs.    In dealing with Southeast Asia, Japan will ""make use of  economic means to expand its political influence,"" pave its way  with the outputs of its capital and merchandise, and develop  multilateral economic cooperation, while strengthening bilateral  relations. It will seize the forthcoming opportunity in the  normalization of U.S.-Vietnamese relations to strengthen its  infiltration into the Vietnamese market, advocate unified  actions to help Cambodia develop post-war reconstruction  projects, and expand its influence in Indochina. In dealing with  Northeast Asia, it will advocate peaceful dialogue; help the  United States and North Korea solve the nuclear issue with  peaceful means; try to officialize the dialogue on security  issues among Japan, the United States and Russia; and set up a  ""regional system for the control of exports of technologies  which can be used for both military and civilian purposes.""    3. Readjust its relations with the United States, and  gradually extricate itself from the situation wherein it  excessively relies on the United States for its economy and it  is politically contained by the United States. Within this year,  Japan and the United States will have their final showdown in  their ""overall economic negotiations."" In view of the fact that  agreements were already reached at the Uruguay Round of Talks,  the emphasis of U.S. strategy on its economic and security  matters will be shifted from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific  Ocean. It is making preparations to start a ""Pacific Round of  Talks for Trading"" aimed at opening up the markets in Asia.  Japan's market will be the first to be affected. The return of  the United States to Asia will inevitably intensify the  U.S.-Japanese contention for the leading role in economic  cooperation in the region. In addition to showing Japan's unique  status as a link between the United States and the ASEAN nations  within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), it will try  to play an even more active role in the East Asian Economic  Council (EAEC) proposed by Malaysia so as to balance U.S.  efforts in making use of the APEC Seattle meeting to increase  its influence in Asia.    4. Improve political relations between Japan and Europe, and  increase the radius in diplomacy. Hosokawa will visit Europe in  May. He plans to make use of his trip as a turning point to  strengthen the weaker link of the triangular relations among  Japan, the United States and Europe, and achieve a balanced  development. He will try to rely on the Japanese-European mutual  support to have more say in foreign affairs when he deals with  the United States. Japan will try to add new contents in the  ""Japan-EC Joint Statement"" and raise the bilateral political and  diplomatic relations between Japan and the European nations in  the past to the level of Japanese-European cooperation. It will  try to become a ""quasi NATO member nation,"" and make use of the  European Union and the European Security Council to ""push the  Japanese-European political cooperation into a new stage"" and  turn this type of cooperation into another strategic pillar in  Japan's diplomatic structure.    5. Strengthen political dialogue between Japan and Russia,  and create a ""soft environment"" for the normalization of  Japanese-Russian relations. In view of the fact that the  improvement of Japanese-Russian relations will help Japan  reverse its unfavorable position in the quadrilateral relations  among Japan, the United States, China and Russia, and improve  the strategic environment in Northeast Asia, Japan's Foreign  Minister Hata and Prime Minister Hosokawa plan to visit Russia  on different occasions in March and May. Japan will reaffirm its  stand to continuously support Russia's line of reform within the  framework set up by the group of seven Western nations;  implement its plan to aid Russia which it had announced before;  promote bilateral political dialogue; and encourage the exchange  of visits by leaders of both countries. Meanwhile, Japan will  continue to carry out negotiations on the issue of Japan's  Northern Islands and try to pave the way to finally solve the  problem in the ""post-Yeltsin"" period.    IV. Japan-China Relations To Enter a New Historic Stage    At a time when Japan is changing its political and economic  system and readjusting its foreign and domestic policies, it  will duly adjust its strategy toward China. Japan will seek to  establish a ""new-type post-war relation"" with China and to  ensure that the development of the Japan-China relation will not  be controlled by the United States. It will seek to establish a  Japan-China relations ""in the world"" and ""in the Asia-Pacific  region"" and maintain an ""ordinary relation between one state and  other"" which is not ""restrained by history.""    1. Proceeding from Japan's strategic interests, Japan will  not change its main foreign policy in maintaining the  Japan-China relations of friendship and cooperation. Recently  Hosokawa once again emphatically pointed out that Japan regarded  the establishment of a ""better Japan-China relations toward the  21st Century"" as the basic principle for its China policy. He  placed the Japan-China relationship on a par with the Japan-U.S.  relationship, and stressed that both of them are important  pillars of Japan's diplomacy.    In the development of its relations with China, Japan takes  into consideration the following new factors:    A) It takes Japan-China relations as the key for Japan to  attain the status of a ""major nation in political affairs.""  After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the Japan-China  relationship is strategically becoming more and more important  in Japan's foreign policy. Japan needs China's cooperation to  hold sway in the new order in the world and in the Asia-pacific  region. China holds a key vote if Japan is to become a permanent  member of the UN Security Council. The Japan-China relationship  is a trump card if Japan wants to raise its strategic diplomatic  status in dealing with the United States and to seek  independence in handling foreign affairs.    B) Japan regards the Japan-China relationship as an ""anchor""  in stabilizing the situation in Asia. This relationship is a  necessary condition for the promotion of economic development in  the Asia-Pacific region. Japan believes that peace, stability  and security in the Asian-Pacific region are still being  threatened by various factors even after the cold war ended.  Without a stable Japan-China relationship, there will be no  peace in this region. Whether the rapid economic development in  this region can be maintained or not depends on the economic  development and cooperation between Japan and China. Japan will  encounter endless difficulties in promoting its ""new Asian  diplomacy"" without China's support.    C) Japan seeks to develop the Japan-China relation so as to  check China's excessive growth which may harm Japan's interests.  In face of the increasing changes in China and the improved  relations between China and the United States after the Seattle  meeting, Japan is worried about the possibility of China and the  United States joining their efforts to contain Japan. It is for  this reason that strategically Japan needs to develop its  relations with China while containing each other.    2. Based on the developing situation, Japan is adjusting its  strategy in dealing with China.    First, Japan's strategic ideology has changed from one of  ""allying with China to resist the Soviet Union"" in the past to  one of relying on China's support to stabilize Northeast Asia  and the Western Pacific Region, and help Japan have more say on  international affairs and become a major nation in political  affairs. It is for this purpose that it must attach greater  importance to the Japan-China relationship in its foreign  policy, and improve the situation whereas the development of the  Japan-China relationship is constrained by the United States.    Second, the core of Japan's foreign policy has changed from  economic cooperation to paying equal attention to politic,  economic and security matters and from bilateral relations to  cooperative relations of a regional or even world nature.    Third, its China policy is to change from a ""special  relationship"" to an ""ordinary relationship."" That means to shake  off the yoke of historical issues and establish the Japan-China  relationship on the basis of reciprocity. Meanwhile, in its  China policy, Japan will stress the need to maintain a balance  in the triangular relationship among Japan, the United States  and China, and ensure that the situation is always to Japan's  advantage. In short, the Japan-China relationship will witness  new developments in the new year. The two nations will rely on  each other even more, and they would cooperate with each other  in more fields. Politically there will be more contacts at the  high level between the two countries, and a new situation will  emerge in economic cooperation. There will be more dialogue on  security matters in the Asia-Pacific Region and bilateral  security issues. However, with the continuous growth of China's  overall national strength, there will emerge competitions  between the two countries. While Japan enlists the support of  the United States and joins the ASEAN nations to strategically  contain China and ""psychologically hold back China,"" some of its  movements merits our attention.    A) It stressed the need to achieve an ""overall balance""  between economic cooperation and political security, and played  economic cards on the issue of politics and security. It  shortened the credit period of its loans to China so as to  maintain its influence over China. It imposed many restrictions  on the use of loans from Japan, the credit period and other  terms. It linked financial and economic cooperation between the  two nations with China's national defense modernization program,  the so-called military sales and the bilateral dialogue on  security matters.    B) Some of the members of Japan's ruling group who advocate  the establishment of a ""quasi-government relation"" between Japan  and Taiwan are gaining ground. Their aim is to safeguard Japan's  commercial interests in Taiwan and make Japanese products  economically more competitive. At the same time, they try to  make use of this to strengthen Japan's containment over China.  It is reported that Japan is negotiating with Taiwan on how  Minister of International Trade and Industry Hiroshi Kumatani  may visit Taiwan, and that it plans to invite Li Denghui to  visit Japan during the APEC summit meeting in Tokyo in 1995.  Nevertheless that does not conform with Japan's ""one China""  policy.     "

I. Selection of Accounting Personnel    1. Principles governing selection.    A) All economic (commercial) counseling offices involved in  foreign economic aid programs and enjoying diplomatic funding  should select and detail professional accounting personnel who  have certain work experience in the accounting field. All  economic (commercial) counseling offices enjoying diplomatic  funding only should detail professional or part-time accounting  personnel (i.e. concurrent posts taken by personnel of other  professions or by people outside the authorized personnel quota)  according to their own conditions.    B) Professional accounting personnel should be familiar  with, and have a good mastery of, the financial accounting  system as well as the financial system in Chinese embassies  (consulates) and acquire knowledge of the financial accounting  operation of foreign contracted labor services. Part-time  accounting personnel should have a good mastery of the financial  accounting system of Chinese embassies (consulates).    C) Professional accounting personnel should be selected from  among the professional financial accounting personnel in  relevant units and departments, such as the Financial Accounting  Department, the Administrative Department, and multifaceted  companies [cheng tao gong si 2052 1152 0361 0674] under this  ministry; part-time accounting personnel should have the  educational qualifications of technical secondary school, high  school, or above.    2. Selection methods.    A) Candidates selected by the Personnel Department in  accordance with the above principle will be assigned to the  financial sections of the Administration Department and  multifaceted companies to become familiar with relevant  financial accounting operations. They should take an exam on  accounting operations according to relevant stipulations and the  Personnel Department will be notified of their exam results.  All those passing the exam can immediately go through the  necessary exit formalities, while those who fail the exam should  not be sent abroad as accounting personnel.    B) All professional accounting personnel who have worked as  accounting personnel in economic (commercial) counseling offices  and are competent can be exempted from taking the exam. The  Financial Accounting Department will sponsor irregular training  courses on the financial accounting operations of economic  (commercial) counseling offices. Those who can obtain the  completion certificate from the training course are also exempt  from taking the exam when sent abroad.    II. Tasks of Accounting Personnel    1. Observe, publicize, and implement relevant policies,  decrees and orders, stipulations, and financial and economic  disciplines of the state.    2. In accordance with the stipulations of the financial  accounting system concerning foreign economic aid, manage the  funds and properties of foreign economic aid programs; take  charge of the settlement of local costs and contract purchase  price of projects under the economic aid contracted  responsibility system; and keep, work out, and submit accounts  of economic activities already incurred in a timely fashion.    3. In line with the stipulations of the financial accounting  system of Chinese embassies (consulates), manage the diplomatic  funds and properties of economic (commercial) counseling  offices; and keep, work out, and submit accounts of economic  activities already incurred in a timely fashion.    4. Supervise and check the financial revenue and expenditure  of projects under the economic aid contracted responsibility  system and find out and reflect problems to higher levels in a  timely manner.    5. Acquire knowledge about the overseas-based financial  accounting operations in representative offices, contracted  projects, labor cooperations, and joint ventures of various  international economic and technical cooperative companies;  provide them with relevant information about the country in  which they function; relay and supervise the implementation of  relevant internal documents and systems; and give assistance to  work in this aspect.    6. Conduct frequent investigations into and studies of the  financial accounting system, foreign exchange management,  taxation rules, operation of banking institutions, and financial  markets in the resident country, and send investigation and  research data back to the relevant departments at home without  delay.    7. Take good care of accounting records. An accounting  archive should be set up in line with relevant stipulations to  classify, codify, and bind accounting vouchers, books, and  various fiscal statements; specify the period for safe custody;  and assign special people to take charge of records management.    8. Do a good job in the handover of accounts. Before  their departure from economic (commercial) counseling offices  due to job transfer, accounting personnel should go through  handing over procedures with their successors in the resident  county. A handover inventory should be signed by the two  parties concerned and an overseer of the handover. It is  imperative to make a detailed inventory of fixed assets, reserve  materials, and cash in the treasury and ensure that there is  neither discrepancy between accounts and actual resources nor  disagreement between accounts. As regards temporary credit and  debit, detailed account statements should be worked out by unit  or by an individual and handed over with the proper endorsement  of the units and individuals concerned. A ""Statement on the  Balance of Bank Deposits"" should be prepared to ensure the  accuracy of the deposited amount.    III. Supervision, Examination, and Leadership Over  Accounting Work    1. Relevant departments, including the Financial Accounting  Department, the Administration Department, and multifaceted  companies, should organize, in a planned way, accounting work  inspection groups and call meetings on overseas-based accounting  work every year; check and give guidance to the financial  accounting work of relevant economic (commercial) counseling  offices; and hold lectures and tuitions on relevant financial  accounting operations to help accounting personnel deal with  certain problems and enhance the level of financial accounting  work.    2. As regards those economic (commercial) counseling offices  which are plagued by a relatively larger number of problems, the  ministry's Financial Accounting Department should work with the  relevant departments, organize a special work group, conduct a  comprehensive examination of the situation, and help solve  existing problems. The work group can also make suggestions to  the Personnel Department on the dismissal of truly incompetent  accounting personnel working in economic (commercial) counseling  offices.    3. Leading comrades of all economic (commercial) counseling  offices stationed abroad should strengthen their leadership over  the financial accounting work of their own offices, take the  lead in observing financial and economic discipline, support  financial accounting personnel to handle matters impartially,  and conduct regular supervision and examinations on the  financial accounting work of their own offices.    4. Accounting personnel who are on holiday back home should  go and report their work to the ministry's Financial Accounting  Department and the financial sections of the Administration  Department and multifaceted companies at a prearranged time.  Meanwhile, the Financial Accounting Department and the financial  sections of the Administration Department and multifaceted  companies will brief the accounting personnel on newly  promulgated financial accounting systems and offer explanations  and answers to relevant questions.

About two months ago he took over the Ministry of Interior  Relations in Carmelitas. He wants to free Venezuelan politics of  that ""old-fashioned attitude which many governments have had"" of  hardening their positions on their own mistakes and of not  wanting to tell the truth. He said: ""How am I going to say that  a thing is, when it is not?""    Therefore, he set up his office in the building inaugurated  by General Eleazar Lopez Contreras in 1936, not only ordering  the worn, red rugs to be cleaned but also having his office  ""swept"" to detect electronic listening devices. From that office  he stated unambiguously that the country has no money, that  succeeding governments have not given priority to personal  security, and that Venezuela has no clear idea of what its  position is on the narcotics traffic.    Furthermore, he intends to redefine the powers of the  Ministry of Interior Relations which, until now, has been the  center for bad relations and repression. He wants the ministry  to regain its powers as a government department from high level  politics. He said: ""I am trying to ensure that democratic  institutions function properly."" The personal security of the  ordinary citizen is the fundamental objective of his official  policy of state security.    He stated: ""The security of all citizens and the right to  life are not adequately guaranteed in Venezuela. I must say  that, despite the fact that there are some people who say that I  am talking like the attorney general. No, I am speaking as a  government minister and I have to tell the truth. No government  should have any problem in recognizing that.""    He stated that the subject of personal security is ""very  complex,"" because several factors are involved which do not  depend on the government. However, the government must clearly  play its role. He said: ""The first point which comes to mind is  that priority has not been given to personal security. We have  always tried to excuse this omission by saying that elsewhere in  the world, in New York, Lima, or Bogota, more people are killed  than here. And I always say that this is like the person who  says that someone drowned in water two meters deep, while  another person drowned in water four meters deep. In any case  they drowned, and it makes no difference.""    He argues that there are countries which successfully fight  against crime by bringing society as a whole and the ordinary  citizen into the struggle, because, ""governments and police  forces cannot do the job by themselves. Society must learn to  defend itself. Clearly, there is a negative factor here, the  absence of police in the streets. However, the first thing which  the present government did was to bring the police out into the  streets. If this is not possible, then there is the National  Guard. That is quite clear. It is also clear that the police by  themselves are not enough. They have many shortcomings. It is  also true that there are police who are involved in the rackets.  This problem is being dealt with, however. Some women friends of  mine even telephone me at home at night to complain of things  that are going on. Then I call the Metropolitan Police, even  though it may be nearly midnight. They are used to my calling  them at such a time to ask about some things. That is what we  are doing.""    [Pimentel] What would you do if insecurity continues? Do we  have to take repressive action to deal with the problem because  we have not been able to develop a crime prevention policy?    [Escovar] It is true that there has not been a policy of  preventing crime. Repression is inevitable if there is no  program for preventing crime. The fact that the police are in  the streets does not automatically mean that we are following a  policy of repression. The presence of the police is a sign of  authority, as in any other part of the world. However, that does  not mean that human rights are being violated. I do not support  breaches of the law.    [Pimentel] How will you combine the necessary amount of  repression with your own training which once led you, as a  prosecutor, to say that there is no government of laws in  Venezuela?    [Escovar] I am trying to make sure that the criticisms which  I expressed as a prosecutor, and now take into consideration as  a minister, might correct a considerable number of mistakes. One  of my criticisms is that you have to educate the police. I have  sent instructions to state and city governments to that effect.  The instructions given to the police in the past have always  been repressive, aggressive, and authoritarian in tone. Why not  give them democratic instructions? Let them exercise their  authority. I am not pretending that the police are weaklings.  They have to exercise their authority, particularly in such a  violent city as Caracas, where they are exposed to being blown  away with the wind. They have to be a solid instrument of order,  but they do not necessarily have to harm the personal security  of the ordinary citizen.    [Pimentel] Is that the approach which you plan to use with  the MRI [Ministry of Interior Relations]?    [Escovar] That is the approach which I am using, and I would  like to emphasize other weapons which the Ministry of Interior  Relations has which do not exclusively deal with security,  although, of course, that is the most important element. I am  not going to criticize my predecessors in this position because  I am not going to become involved in that kind of discussion.  What I want to do is to redefine and reformulate the role of the  Ministry of Interior Relations as a ministry of government and  of politics. There are many public opinion groups which should  feel that they are being heard and respected. It is very  probable that later on I will present a plan for the  reorganization of the ministry for consideration by the  government.    We should remember, however, that state and municipal  governments have their own responsibilities. If a gun goes off  in a city square, this does not mean that the minister of  interior relations ordered it. You can establish order without  firing guns into the air. There are other means of repression,  such as antiriot teams. You cannot expect Caracas to be a  goody-goody city, and the government does not expect that it  will be, either. The government has to exercise its democratic  authority in a vigorous and firm way.    Doors Which Open and Close    Escovar Salom does not believe that we face great  difficulties. He recalls the great political tensions which he  dealt with when he was the young director of the Faculty of Law  at the UCV [Central University of Venezuela] after the fall of  the Perez Jimenez government. The door which connected the  Faculty of Law and the Faculty of Humanities had been sealed. He  called a doorman and ordered him to open it. He explained that  this was quite a revolution and an enormous change in the  concept of university space. He said: ""For example, there are  many doors which open and others which close. There are still  others which are unjustifiably open.""    [Pimentel] In terms of state security the Ministry of  Interior Relations has two organizations within it which have  always been attacked because of their practices: the DIEX  [Directorate of Identification and Alien Affairs] and the DISIP  [Directorate of Intelligence and Prevention Services]. What are  you going to do with them?    [Escovar] I have always spoken in very critical terms  against  the DIEX. I have been told that nothing can be done about it.  There is general pessimism on this subject. The first thing that  you have to do is to identify the sources of corruption, because  not all officials in the DIEX are corrupt. I once asked the  members of the ministry trade union, who came to me and offered  their cooperation, to help me in cleaning up the DIEX. I wanted  to bring the members of the trade union into this job and give  them a motive for doing so. Of course, the sources of corruption  in DIEX do not like this, nor do they like computers, because  office automation, using computers, is an enemy of corruption.  It prevents officials from acting secretly.    DIEX needs cleaning up, organization, and automation. How  are  we dealing with the automation of DIEX during this period of  difficulties? I am studying the possibility of private  contributions and turning the DIEX into an independent agency  which could finance itself with its own resources. However, I  have not yet made a decision because I am still analyzing  whether this course of action is viable and what legal  difficulties there may be.    At the moment I have asked neighborhood associations to help  me to investigate DIEX. I am going to install two telephones in  the ministry to receive complaints from the public. The  telephone numbers will be made public soon. The person answering  the telephone in the ministry will have to give his name so that  the complainant will know whom to contact or to call again if  his complaint is not dealt with. That service is being  organized, and an announcement concerning it will be made  shortly. In DIEX we have to carry out a psychological revolution  to treat the public properly. I am going to send some experts to  tell people in DIEX that they should learn to say, ""Good  morning,"" ""with pleasure,"" and ""please.""    [Pimentel] Do you think that, beyond the matter of behavior  which you hope to change, the problem is also structural,  involving bureaucratic practices such as collecting money for  services rendered, gift giving in exchange for services, and  bribery?    [Escovar] It is true that in Venezuela the administration is  an obstacle course. And not only in the DIEX. This is a country  where it takes an effort to do anything. In the DIEX we have to  find out how many employees are not needed. We have to make a  personnel audit and find out which employees are involved in  corruption. This is something which is now being done. The other  task is to protect the decent and honest people who work there,  because at times those scoundrels represent the honest people,  silence them, and prevent them from doing their job. In this  area we are going to face the collective will of the ministry. I  am inclined to do that. We are going to see what the results  will be.    [Pimentel] Do you think that in this way you will be able to  control illegal and undocumented immigration which you have  criticized so much?    [Escovar] The DIEX is a fundamental instrument of national  sovereignty. Those activities are a crime of treason to the  fatherland. The official involved in that kind of activity can  be brought to trial. I have a clear position regarding the  matter of undocumented aliens. They cannot live in Venezuela. In  some cases there will have to be deportations, and I am ready  for that. Now, there are people who are illegal because they  have not been provided with the necessary documents, but they  are working. Cattle raisers in certain border areas have raised  that matter with me. However, the problem is in the illegal and  criminal element in the population. Venezuela has to have a  border policy but also a policy of selective immigration. In  this connection population policy has been confused with the  open door policy. Although there are no reliable statistics, I  believe that in Caracas there may be about two million  undocumented aliens. This is one of the open doors which must be  closed.    [Pimentel] And what about the DISIP?    [Escovar] We are doing the same thing with the DISIP. We are  reorganizing it. Gen. Rivas Ostos (the director) is doing a  quiet but efficient job. The DISIP is a state security police  service, but it does not have to be the Gestapo, nor does it  have to be violent or aggressive. This is a police force which  does not work for a political party or even the government, but  rather the Venezuelan state. That is the first thing that we  have to make clear. In Venezuela many people do not know that  the notion of a state is a permanent aspect of the national  community, while governments are transitory phenomena. In the  DISIP I am trying to apply the principle of identifying a  government official with the state. Previously, this  relationship was expressed in personal terms. The individual  official served interests which were not those of the Venezuelan  state. And I will not go on with this because a great deal is  already known about it and I do not need to repeat it.    [Pimentel] Regarding secret appropriations, when you were  attorney general, you said that these should be regulated. Do  you still think the same way?    [Escovar] The existing standards are the same. I contacted  the Office of the Controller General and asked it to suggest  what possible regulations might be applied. The important thing  to remember is that in the law establishing the Office of the  Controller General certain powers are given to the controller  general and eventually to the attorney general to exercise  supervision of the secret appropriations. Secret appropriations  cannot be a well from which funds can be drawn for all purposes.  Historically, it has been a means of providing welfare benefits  in exchange for certain favors. The appropriations for welfare  purposes do not have to be secret. They should be publicly  known. There could be further regulations on this matter.    Standing Still on a Pile of Rubble    Escovar Salom answered at least three telephone calls on his  internal office phone in less than one hour. These were  government matters which he had to deal with from his office. He  said that he works 11 hours a day and, ""as was the case in the  Office of the Attorney General,"" he takes no time off for lunch.  From time to time he adds to the volume of his recording of the  musical, ""Gypsy,"" by playing his violin.    [Pimentel] The narcotics traffic is another problem  affecting  state security. How are you going to deal with it?    [Escovar] The narcotics traffic is a new element on the  scene, and you have to know how to deal with it. (He wanted to  clear up some misunderstandings on the subject.) It is not a  matter of making concessions. Rather, this is a very serious  matter which has to be considered. The geopolitics of drugs  presupposes international activities. States as such do not have  the means of dealing with a crime which is essentially  international in scope. Of course, there is a policy of  prevention and of education in dealing with drugs. However, the  basic problem is how to act from the executive point of view  against the narcotics traffic and related money laundering.    It seems to me that so far Venezuela has not had a clear  idea  of its position on this matter. More or less sporadic efforts  have been made. There are some cases in the courts, but nothing  coherent or coordinated has been done about the matter. Perhaps,  later on, it might become necessary to establish a special state  agency, a specialized and autonomous body, such as the DEA [Drug  Enforcement Administration] in the United States. One very  important aspect is the laundering of narcotics profits, but  here we have begun with the error of believing that this is not  going on. That kind of business has been growing almost in  public view, but no one realized it. There are even people who  are offended when you mention it. Why should we deny this fact  if it is a reality?    In passing Escovar presented some views which he had  previously expressed at the SECONASEDE conference [National  Development Conference]. He said that ""some alleged patriots and  persons of ill will"" quoted him as saying that Venezuela could  not take action on this matter. He said: ""What I said -- and I  said so as minister of foreign affairs in about 1976 -- was that  Venezuela should keep clearly in mind that it is a small country  and should understand that this is what it is. It is better for  Venezuela to keep clearly in mind that it is an efficient and  productive country with political skills -- because political  skill is also one of our assets -- and that it has the  literature and the rhetorical skills of a large country. It is  very expensive to be a large country. Venezuela is not big  enough to be that.""    He received a telephone call from someone very close to him  who apparently congratulated him on his appointment. The  minister purred into his phone, ""That's a two-edged compliment  that you are paying me.""    [Pimentel] Are you afraid of ""burning out"" in the Ministry  of  Interior Relations?    [Escovar] When I entered the Office of the Attorney General,  they said something like that. None of the people who called me  to pass on their greetings did so to congratulate me but rather  to express their condolences and to wish me luck. Neither did  public opinion expect much. I crossed the border between  skepticism and a certain amount of hope in November 1989, when I  began to visit hospitals. This was something different. However,  clearly enough, there are always jealous people and pessimists.  They are not always the same people, but they exist. They used  to say that visiting hospitals was not the job of the attorney  general.    They said the same thing when I began by winning certain  cases, not only the Carlos Andres Perez case on 11 March but  also other, previous cases. I knew at the time that Carlos  Andres Perez had called a very important businessman in Caracas  and told him that what I had presented in court was nonsense and  that the basis of my case was merely press clippings. He said:  ""That is very difficult."" A friend told me on 18 April 1993:  ""Anyhow, I wish you success in that job, but this country is not  yet ready for that."" Almost one month later, on 20 May, the CSJ  [Supreme Court of Justice] made a favorable finding on the  previous judgment against Carlos Andres Perez, who was then  president.    [Pimentel] Are we a country of pessimists?    [Escovar] I am used to that kind of pessimism. However, in  the ministry I am going to do the same thing and I have no doubt  that I will be successful. I am going to have many difficulties,  which already have begun, like the skepticism of the people.  Friends tell me: ""Why did you leave your job as a lawyer  handling cases before the UN, with a salary of $14,000 a month  and with so many privileges, to come back and get involved in  this mess? You should have gone away and waited for a future  opportunity."" But standing aside and waiting for the right  opportunity is like a man with new shoes who does not put them  on so that the soles will not wear out. If I speak up, I speak  up, as I did in the Office of the Attorney General. Everything  is very difficult now in Venezuela because we are still standing  on a mountain of rubble. That is what we have inherited, and we  have to work on that. There is nothing else to do.""    Biographic Details    Escovar Salom's biography states that he was the youngest  parliamentarian in Latin America in 1948 (when he was 21). He  was the youngest senator in 1958 (when he was 31) and the  youngest cabinet minister in 1964 (when he was 38). Since then  he began work in the executive branch of the government as  minister of justice. He was secretary general of the Office of  the President of the Republic (1974-75) and minister of foreign  affairs (1975-77) during the first term of President Carlos  Andres Perez. Then he was Venezuelan ambassador to France  (1986-89). Until February 1994 he was attorney general.    Now, as minister of interior relations, he is a member of  the  cabinet of President Rafael Caldera. His experience as one of  the drafters of the national constitution (of 1961) now in  effect and as titular professor of constitutional law seems to  him to be a good reason for expressing the view that  constitutional reform should be the result of a broad and also  harmonious consensus, because the constitution of 1961 ""got away  from us."" He said: ""Because we wanted to draft a good  constitution in the sense of stability we moved too far toward  rigidity.""    He suggests that reform should be oriented more toward the  way in which the national government functions, toward the  organic part of the constitution, and toward seeking  alternatives to political crises which end up in coups d'etat.  He firmly believes that the idea of holding a referendum to  recall a president is not a bad one. Everything depends on the  electorate's being clearly prepared to deal with the situations  which come up. He is not opposed to a dissolution of Congress.  He said: ""In democratic countries this is a power which the  serving prime minister does not make use of every day. Except in  very serious situations, I consider that the electorate should  be consulted.""     "

Entitled ""Transcend MFN [Most Favored  Nation] Status -- Trade With China and U.S. Interest,"" the book  is co-edited by James Roderick Lilley, former U.S. assistant  secretary of defense and former U.S. ambassador to China, and  Wendell L. Willkie II, former acting deputy secretary of  commerce. Its chief authors include Dave Lampton, president of  the All-American Committee for U.S.-Chinese Relations.    The book reviews the complicated economic, strategic, and  human rights issues facing U.S. decision-makers today. In  addition to their speeches today, the editors and authors  stressed in the book that the United States should see further  in handling U.S.-Chinese relations. The resolution of human  rights and trade issues should be separated. They indicated  that almost all countries in the world, regardless of their  human rights conditions, enjoy MFN status granted by the United  States. If the the United States were to apply MFN status as a  weapon with which to threaten China, this would run counter to  U.S. interests.    It Does Not Pay for the United States To Upset China    Democrat Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs  Committee, wrote a preface to the book in which he discusses the  importance of U.S.-Chinese relations from four angles. In the  preface, Hamilton indicates that political stability in China is  in line with U.S. interests, whereas upsetting the Chinese  Government or dividing China is not in U.S. interests. A  Chinese Government that has rallying force, is highly efficient,  and is concerned with the well-being of its people is in line  with U.S. interests because in this case the international  community does not have to provide the 1.2 billion Chinese  people with clothing, food, housing, transportation, employment,  and medical services and care.    Economically, China's economic development has improved the  people's material life, and at the same time has promoted  gradual political democratization. All these changes are in  line with U.S. interests. The United States should offer a  helping hand to China in its economic modernization and reform;  in turn, the United States will benefit. The Memorandum of  Understanding on Market Access signed between the United States  and China, the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights  Protection, and the consideration in accepting China's  application to restore its GATT membership, are all useful  apparatuses to guarantee mutual benefit and interest in  U.S.-Chinese economic relations.    From the angle of security, a militarily powerful China that  does not pose a threat to regional peace is in line with U.S.  interests. The best way to prevent a tense situation in the  region and to control the arms race is to unfold multilateral  regional security talks aimed at increasing transparency,  establishing mutual trust, and encouraging military restraint.  In addition, the United States needs to adopt a cooperative  attitude with China in controling the proliferation of  biochemical and guided-missile weapons and in limiting nuclear  tests.    From a diplomatic angle, a China that continues to work hard  with the United States and other countries to resolve  complicated world issues in the wake of the Cold War is in line  with U.S. interests. China is one of the five permanent members  of the UN Security Council. That China should make positive  contributions to the resolution of international problems is far  better than otherwise, and better still than creating additional  trouble for the international community. To promote global  peace and stability, to prevent the further worsening of  nature's ecological environment, and to crack down on drug  production and trafficking, the United States should win China's  support as best it can.    The Old, Amended Act Is Out of Date    In the preface, Hamilton also indicates: From a long-range  view, U.S. decision-makers should not cancel China's MFN status.  The Jackson-Vanek amendment, which sets out guidance on  granting MFN status, and the practice of extending MFN status  conditionally, were policies and measures formulated in  different times which aimed to achieve different policy goals.  Time has passed and circumstances have changed. What U.S.  political leaders should consider today is transcending China's  MFN status and formulating a sound policy capable of protecting  and promoting U.S. national interests.    In the book, Lampton, president of the All-American  Committee  for U.S.-Chinese Relations, reviews the importance of  U.S.-Chinese relations, and indicates the reasons for the  difficult situation the U.S. Government faces on the issue of  human rights. He said: The United States must acknowledge the  tremendous social and political changes underway in China. If  the United States hopes to promote its value concepts  effectively, it should add fuel to China's engine, not try to  shut off the fuel pump. However, should the United States  regard China's MFN status as some kind of hostage, it will never  control the direction of development in the situation. This  being the case, the United States should formulate a realistic,  sustained, and constructive policy toward China.    Directing his remarks at some people in the U.S. Government  and Congress who say there is need to selectively sanction  China's state-owned enterprises, Lampton indicates that the  practice of sanctioning or selectively sanctioning China's  state- owned enterprises would be wrong and would not work  because the U.S. Customs would find it very difficult to tell  which products are those of state-owned enterprises and which  are not. Furthermore, the raw materials and semifinished goods  of many of China's state- owned enterprises are supplied by  enterprises in the private sector of the economy or by  foreign-funded enterprises. If the United States were to  partially cancel China's MFN status, this would lead inevitably  to the Chinese side's taking retaliatory action in trade. Then  where would the United States find new markets for its wheat,  aircraft, electronics, telecommunications, and power-generating  equipment?!    It Is Wise To Talk Less About Human Rights From Now On    In the book, James Roderick Lilley, former assistant  secretary of defense and currently director of Chinese Studies  at the American Enterprise Institute, indicates that the United  States has been deeply involved in Asian affairs for a long  time, thus guaranteeing peace and security in Asia. The greater  the pressure the Clinton administration places on China  concerning the human rights issue, the tougher will be the  Chinese stance and the smaller the concessions it will make.  Should China's MFN status be cancelled, the United States will  pay a very high price in international issues, and the  foundation for peaceful cooperation and competition between the  United States and China will be jeopardized.    Ambassador Lilley indicates that in the Asian Conference on  Human Rights held in Bangkok in March 1993, 38 out of 39  countries were for the human rights position of China and  Indonesia. If the United Sates were to cancel China's MFN  status, this move would compel the Asian countries to lean  toward China and to keep their distance from the United States;  consequently, U.S. influence in Asia would be reduced and the  fruits of U.S. diplomatic efforts over the years would go down  the drain. Should such a scenario surface, it would be tragic.  This being the case, if the Clinton administration does not  want to cancel China's MFN status, it should stop its all-too-  frequent verbal condemnation of China. Furthermore, it should  not overemphasize the human rights issue from now on.     "

The SEF and the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC] held an urgent meeting to discuss the letter.  They decided that the investigation results provided by  Communist China were not acceptable because they failed to  provide reasonable answers to some doubts raised by the victims'  families and our relevant departments.    The MAC authorized the SEF to reply in a letter today to  express the hope that the mainland authorities will send us all  information, including records of the investigation, and to once  again express a strong demand that a special meeting between the  SEF and the ARATS be held in Hong Kong on 27 April as scheduled.    The MAC also said: If Communist China does not provide a  reasonable explanation, the MAC will when necessary release the  report compiled by our investigating group and compare it with  the one compiled by Communist China. Here is Liu Yu-mei's  report:    [Begin recording] After newspapers in Hong Kong carried  detailed stories about the Chientao Lake incident, the ARATS  informed the SEF in a written message on 22 April and provided a  relatively concrete report. In the letter, the SEF said: Wu  Li-hong [Wu Lihong], Hu Chih-han [Hu Zhihan], and Yu Ai-chun [Yu  Aijun] plotted as early as last year to rob tourists on Chientao  Lake by using a motorboat. On 31 March, they climbed aboard the  Haijui [Hairui] tourist boat and committed the crimes of  robbery, murder, and arson which caused 32 deaths.    The letter pointed out: After a 17-day investigation, the  case was brought to light. The police retrieved $5,250, 154,000  new Taiwan dollars, a video camera, six cameras, eight rings,  one jade bracelet, and two Rolex watches.    The SEF was not satisfied with the report. SEF Deputy  Secretary General Shih Chi-ping said that the information  revealed by the ARATS was only partial in nature. He expressed  his hope that the mainland will provide more detailed facts and  that it will promptly answer in clear terms whether the two  parties will hold special cross-strait consultations on this  case.    [Shih] It is our hope that the ARATS will provide us with  more detailed information so that we can have a better  understanding of this case. We also hope that they will give us  a clear answer as soon as possible concerning the request stated  in our previous letter.    [Liu] Shih Chi-ping said that the MAC and the SEF will  respond to the ARATS' letter in the near future. This is Liu  Yu-mei reporting from the SEF. [end recording]     "

He called for lifting the  weapons embargo to Bosnia and denounced the behavior of the  forces that have been dealing with this problem but have not  been serious about finding a solution to it. He described the  crisis as a bad omen for the international community.    In a lecture he delivered today before the Royal British  Institute for Foreign Affairs (Chatham House), Musa said that  more complicated problems will arise in Central and Eastern  Europe if no solution is found to the Bosnian problem. He  criticized the international community's behavior on this issue  and condemned racial and sectarian discrimination in Bosnia.    'Amr Musa reiterated Egypt's stance, which calls for lifting  the embargo on weapons to Bosnia, noting that the Serbs are  getting weapons from Belgrade. He said that Egypt is ready to  provide troops within the framework of a relevant UN resolution.  He added: We in Egypt feel disappointed with the contradictory  actions of the international community in Bosnia. He stressed  the need to respect human rights there, adding that what is  happening in Bosnia is a test for the new world order.    In his lecture, which was attended by a number of Arab  ambassadors, the British ambassador in Egypt, and a number of  Middle East experts, the foreign minister referred to his visit  to South Africa. He said that South Africa is now in the stage  of change and that the nineties are important to all of us. He  added: The change taking place now has positive and negative  aspects. A new stage has also started in the Middle East  following the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. He said: We are  seeking to achieve a permanent settlement based on guaranteeing  the inalienable and political rights of everyone in the region  and are looking toward the post-settlement stage to achieve  development and prosperity. He noted that the achievement of  these objectives will come through cooperation between all  countries of the region.    Musa added that Egypt will continue its efforts to give  impetus to the peace process in the region, achieve peaceful  coexistence between all parties, and reach a just solution that  guarantees all the political rights of the parties involved. He  emphasized that the stage following the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli agreement will require more efforts,  especially as there are still obstacles to peace.    He explained that Egypt is seeking to achieve an Israeli  withdrawal from the territories occupied in 1967, guarantee  security for all countries, and establish peaceful and normal  relations with Israel. He said: If all this is done, then the  Middle East region will be completely different.    The foreign minister said: Egypt has proposed the  establishment of a forum for the Mediterranean basin countries  to achieve cooperation between them and ensure that the Middle  East region will be completely free from weapons of mass  destruction on condition that all countries, including Israel,  comply. Then the economic growth desired by all countries in  the region will be achieved and the area will benefit from the  available resources and thus ensure a better future for their  peoples.    'Amr Musa, who is currently paying a visit to Britain, went  on to say that Egypt's objective is to ensure that the Middle  East is not isolated from the world but is interacting with its  peoples. He said: While the region is now preoccupied with the  peace process, it is also looking toward ending all the problems  surrounding it, such as the one in Bosnia. He stressed that the  situation in Bosnia does not differ much from the former state  of the Cold War. He added: The threat to peace in Bosnia and  the Balkans also is a threat to the Middle East and the  Mediterranean basin. We must open the doors for interaction  between the cultures of Europe, the Arab region, and the  Mediterranean basin. He said: We do not want to go back to the  Cold War era with all its challenges, hatreds, and  confrontations.    Musa noted that Egypt is interested in solving the problems  in Yemen, Sudan, and Iraq because his country is part of the  region, knows its responsibilities regarding these problems, and  earnestly seeks to achieve stability in the area. He pointed  out that as far as Yemen is concerned, Egypt seeks to contain  the current differences and crisis there.    Referring to the British policy, which he said he noted in  his current talks with senior British officials, Musa said that  Britain also wants to help achieve stability in the Middle East.  He also noted that Egypt is interested in steering the  Israeli-Palestinian talks in the right direction to achieve the  desired objectives. He pointed out that the confidence-building  process between the Arabs and Israel has already started but it  requires time. It also must come from both sides, not just from  the Arabs. Israel must work in that direction, too, he added.    Musa stressed that the peace process in the region is still  just beginning, since the negotiations between Israel and  Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon still remain. He noted that the Arab  boycott of Israel will be lifted, but at the appropriate time.    Musa noted that Egypt is concerned about the developments in  Algeria. He hoped that stability will be achieved in Algeria,  adding that the Algerian people are capable of establishing  stability. He noted that what is happening in Algeria does not  worry Egypt alone but all the countries in the region, the Arab  and Islamic worlds, and Europe. He urged helping Algeria emerge  from its current crisis.    Turning to Egyptian-Sudanese relations, Musa noted that  there  is a difference between the two governments over the two  countries' policies. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the  partitioning of Sudan.    On relations with Iran, Musa said that Egypt is concerned  with security in the Gulf and the need to prevent attempts to  export the Iranian revolution to other countries in the region.  He added: With the exception of these points, there is no  political antagonism between us and Iran. He called for Iran to  change the policies it follows regarding the Arab region.    Concerning the issue of Jerusalem, Musa said that it will be  part of the negotiations to be held at a later stage between  Israel and the Palestinians. He added: There is no reason to  object to the principle of negotiations over Jerusalem or  dividing it. The whole issue, he added, is negotiable between  the Palestinians and Israelis. He stressed that Jerusalem will  remain one city [madinah wahidah] and its status will be  discussed at a later stage in the negotiations.    Regarding the question of Iraq, Musa said that this issue is  very complicated. He added: There is only one key to the  crisis with Kuwait, namely, that Iraq recognizes Kuwait and that  the UN Security Council resolutions on this subject be  implemented. He stressed that Egypt does not accept the  partitioning of Iraq or anything that may jeopardize its  sovereignty and territorial integrity.    Concerning the situation in Lebanon, Musa said that things  are improving there and that the Lebanese Government is  extending its authority over Lebanese territory. He stressed  that Egypt is concerned with Lebanon's sovereignty and stability.    Regarding Lebanese-Syrian negotiations, Musa said that there  is a framework for negotiations and there are Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 425. He hoped that stability will be  restored in Lebanon and that the country will return its former  stability.     "

The Arab  countries should reconsider their stance on Iraq based on  accurate, logical, rational, and long-term calculations to serve  the Arab nation's interests, and even the interests of the  neighboring countries that have been subjected to aggression  from the current Iraqi regime.    After more than three years since the Gulf War, which led to  the collapse of the old Arab system without bringing down the  Iraqi regime, and in view of the failure of all efforts to  establish a new system capable of assimilating Arab and  international changes, it is necessary for the Arab world to  look for other ways to bring the Iraqi regime back into the  fold. The Arab world should not leave Iraq in its isolation at  the mercy of the international forces, primarily the United  States and Britain, which seek to use the current situation for  their own interests.    What happened at the UN Security Council recently indicates  that the international alliance, which was opposed to Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait and also encouraged Saddam Husayn and  provided him with weapons and nuclear capability that made him  the bully of the Gulf, has been beset by clear rifts. These  rifts appeared in the differences among the Security Council  members over the statement that it releases periodically on the  extent of Iraq's compliance with Resolution 715 on subjecting  its military resources to international supervision, which is a  condition for lifting international sanctions.    France, Russia, and the PRC believe that there is a need to  note in the statement the ""progress"" Iraq made in destroying  banned arms instead of issuing the usual arbitrary statement on  which the United States and Britain insist, a statement that  maintains that Iraq has not complied with all the necessary  conditions to lift the sanctions. By insisting on this usual  statement the United States and Britain seek to achieve goals to  entrench the current division of the Arab world, a division that  will only increase Iranian influence and deepen suspicions and  fragmentation within the Gulf Cooperation Council itself.    The United States usually uses the stick and carrot in its  dealings, even with North Korea, but it only uses the stick with  Iraq. France and Russia believe that ""encouraging"" Iraq by  giving it time to watch its behavior and note its progress will  motivate it to cooperate in all areas, notably recognition of  the state of Kuwait.    It is strange indeed that when foreign countries are seeking  to ""normalize"" ties with Iraq, the Arab countries, which are  racing to normalize ties with Israel, find no justification to  even consider reaching a minimum level of normalization with  Iraq.

The Boeing 737 Southern  Airlines passenger plane, No. B2542, landed at the Chiang  Kai-shek airport at 1156 GMT under escort by our Air Force  aircraft. There were 131 passengers and eight crew members on  board the plane, which was on a scheduled flight from Fuzhou to  Guangzhou. .    According to preliminary reports, the plane was hijacked by  a 36-year-old man (Chou Wen-chiang), using a carving knife and a  flash light. The airport police have taken him from the plane  for investigation. It was initially determined that there were  no accomplices.    During the interrogation, (Chou Wen-chiang) said he was born  in [words indistinct] in 1958 and was a resident of Guangdong's  Lien County. He has a heart ailment [words indistinct]. He  said he hijacked the plane because he was dissatisfied with his  low pay of only a few dozen yuan a month, and he received a  compensation of only 8,000 yuan after his elder sister was  killed by an unlicensed driver.    According to the Ministry of Defense spokesman, the plane,  which was hijacked at 1920, gave the signal at 1924 that it had  been hijacked. While our military and radar placed the plane  under close surveillance, two F5-E fighter jets took off from  the Chiayi Airport to intercept it. The fighters intercepted  the plane at 1939 and guided it to a safe landing at the Chiang  Kai-shek Airport at 1956.    President Li Teng-hui and other ranking government  officials,  upon learning the news at a return banquet given by [words  indistinct] president at the Grand Hotel, immediately instructed  units concerned to handle the case according to established  procedures.    Meanwhile, Minister Wu Po-hsiung, chairman of the Executive  Yuan panel in charge of affairs about hijacking, indicated that  the case will be handled according to the principle that the  hijacker and the plane will be handled separately. He said the  plane, after being routinely checked, will be allowed to fly to  its original destination, but the hijacker will be turned over  to judicial authorities for handling. He reiterated that while  the government is firmly against any plane hijacking and will  strictly punish any hijackers, relevant Chinese communist  authorities should strengthen their security checks to forestall  any hijacking attempts. He added that the hijacker will be  repatriated after the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF] has  consultated the Association of Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS] and reached a common understanding with the  latter. He said the hijacker will never be be allowed to stay  in Taiwan.    As usual, the SEF has immediately notified ARATS on the  procedures that will be taken for the repatriation of the  hijacker.

In  accordance with a secret military plan Athens has drawn up, that  country has already deployed 60 percent of its military forces  against Turkey.    Greece's plan was finalized after aging Andreas Papandreou,  who is known for his harsh statements against Turkey, came to  power. Consequently, the Greek Armed Forces have completely  changed their defense strategy. The Greek Government decided  that Greece is confronted with a threat not from the former  Soviet Union in the north, but from Turkey on the eastern side  of the Aegean Sea. As such, many of the military units in  northern Greece have been transferred to Western Thrace. The  Greek defense line was also reestablished beginning on the  western side of the Maritsa River and extending to the Greek  islands in the Aegean Sea, which are very close to Turkey. Two  infantry divisions on Bulgaria's border and two armored brigades  and an infantry brigade have taken up positions along Turkey's  border.    Furthermore, support units have been organized for the  border  between Turkey and Greece. Thessaloniki has been selected as  their headquarters. According to the information we have  received, they are made up of one infantry brigade, one armored  brigade, one commando regiment, and one paratroop regiment. The  units that will move into action in the Aegean Sea in the event  of a war have been reinforced with a naval infantry brigade, a  commando regiment, and a paratroop regiment.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Andreas Papandrou and his son,  Yeoryios Papandreou, have been secretly working on a plan in the  diplomatic field to involve the European Union in a possible war  between Turkey and Greece.    Ataman: ""No Concession on 12 Miles""    One of YENI GUNAYDIN's correspondents has asked Turkish  Foreign Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman to comment on a report  we published a few days ago on Greece's warmongering  initiatives. He said: ""It seems that Greece has finalized its  plan to extend its territorial waters to 12 miles.""    Kilercioglu: ""Greece is Making an Effort""    Ahmet Dokulmez, one of the Prosperity Party members on the  National Assembly Foreign Relations Committee, has warned that  an effort is being made to place Turkey in a difficult position  in international forums. Calling for measures to counter that  eventuality, he said: ""We are economically weak and in need of  funds. Nevertheless, we have to adopt a hardline policy because  that is the approach the Western countries understand.""    Former Minister of State Orhan Kilercioglu reacted as  follows: ""That would be regarded as a cause for war. I do not  believe that the Greeks will do anything so crazy.  Nevertheless, preparations have to be made; we have to be  prepared. Greece is making an effort in that direction.""     "

In the first nine months of last year, two-way trade  amounted  to RM [Malaysian ringgit] 6.5 billion. Although statistics for  the whole of 1993 are still not available, last year's total  trade between the two nations may well surpass the previous  year's figures.    In 1992, Malaysia's imports from Britain totalled RM4.14  billion. Its exports were RM2.55 billion.    Malaysia buys electrical equipment, power generators and  heavy industrial machinery from Britain. Malaysia on the other  hand, sells primary commodities, machinery, telecommunication  equipment, garments and apparel, accessories and sawn timber to  Britain.    Statistics show that bilateral trade between Britain and  Malaysia has been particularly strong in the past four to five  years reaching its peak in 1991 with total trade surpassing  RM4.4 million.    During the same period, British investments in Malaysia have  also increased significantly to almost RM900 million in 1990  compared to RM750 million in 1989.    Following stiff competition from other foreign investors,  particularly Japanese, Taiwanese as well as American, British  investors have taken a back seat -- resulting in a downtrend in  investments since 1991.    British investments in Malaysia dropped to below RM300  million in 1992. Nevertheless, Britain remained the largest  European investor in Malaysia.    The current trade figures between the two countries are  indeed a far cry from the days when Malaysia launched the ""Buy  British Last"" policy in October 1981.    Although officials maintained that trade to and from Britain  was not really affected during the period, there was only  marginal increase in total trade.    For instance, bilateral trade was barely above RM2 billion  in  1981, 1982 and 1983.    This was because the private sector continued to purchase  British goods as they were priced competitively amidst the  depreciating pound sterling.    The ""Buy British Last"" policy was introduced following  accumulative ""irritants"" that the country faced in its relations  with Britain and British companies.    The breaking point was when the British Government announced  a substantial increase in student fees which severely affected  more than 15,000 Malaysian students in Britain.    Other factors which had triggered the policy included the  failure of British companies to comply with the requirement of  the National Economic Policy and the landing rights for Malaysia  Airlines (MAS).    The policy called for all British contracts to be vetted  thoroughly by the Prime Minister's Department together with the  second choice non-British bidder.    Realising that the policy had caused British companies  countless lucrative government contracts, the then British  premier Margaret Thatcher personally intervened to patch things  up.     "

Tu Chu-sheng, director of the ministry's North American  Affairs Department, made the call during a public hearing on  Taipei- Washington-Beijing ties sponsored by several private  groups here.    Tu said Taipei-Washington relations should be separated from  American relations with Mainland China.    ""We have never intervened in Washington-Beijing relations,""  Tu said. ""We hope both Beijing and Washington would never  promote their bilateral ties at the expense of our national  interests.""    Taiwan also hopes the US Government will pragmatically face  the reality that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are now  ruled by two different governments which exercise full  jurisdiction over their own territories, Tu said. ""We hope the  US can handle its relations with Taipei and Beijing separately.""    He further said it has been Taiwan's goal to push the US  Government to treat the two sides of the Taiwan Strait equally  before China's reunification.    US President Bill Clinton announced Thursday he will renew  Mainland China's ""most-favored-nation"" (MFN) trade status and  sever the link between trade and human rights.    Tu said Clinton's decision marks a turning point in the  improvement of Washington-Beijing relations. However, it  remains unclear whether the Clinton administration will become  more flexible in handling its ties with Taiwan, he noted.    Recent public speeches by US Secretary of State Warren  Christopher show no signs that the Clinton administration is  ready to make any major change in the so-called ""one China""  policy which the US has upheld since it recognized Beijing in  1979, Tu said.    He continued that Taipei-Washington relations have remained  steady under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law  defining American ties with Taiwan in the absence of diplomatic  relations.    However, Tu said, the current unofficial links cannot  effectively reflect close substantive relations between the ROC  and the US. America is Taiwan's top export market, while the ROC  is America's sixth largest trade partner.    The ROC Government has attached great importance to its  relations with the US, Tu said, adding Taiwan will use its  political and economic clout to further strengthen relations  with America.    Taipei hopes the US will continue to sell it defensive arms  and support its bid to join the United Nations and other  international organizations, Tu said. ""We also hope the US will  agree to change the title of our representative office in its  territory to one that can better represent Taiwan,"" he added.    Taiwan's representative office is now called the  Coordination  Council for North American Affairs.     "

If the land cuts its share of HWWA's basic  funding, the Federal Government may follow suit.    Kantzenbach's worries are well-founded. In Hamburg's Office  for Science and Research, which has jurisdiction over HWWA, it  is said that the Institute ""is included in the austerity  considerations."" Nothing is final yet, and Kantzenbach hopes for  something definite from the HWWA advisory board meeting in June.  Its chairman, Hamburg's science senator, goes in for large-scale  savings: The university's personnel costs alone are to drop by 7  or 8 million German marks [DM], which amounts to 10 or 15  percent per sector.    If the land cuts the subsidy to HWWA, the Federal Government  will probably also lower its contribution so that the 50:50  financing is preserved. It could even get worse. It is being  pointed out by the Federal Economics Ministry (BMWi) that even  today, one-fourth of HWWA researchers do not work in science,  but rather for the information center. If the importance of  research in the plan is receding, one ""must examine"" whether the  general agreement between the Federal Government and laender on  joint research funding, according to Article 91b of the Basic  Law, still applies to HWWA. Spelled out: Bonn might withdraw  completely and leave the fate of the renowned HWWA to the  Hanseatic city.    The Hamburg Institute Holds Second Place in Basic Funding    This year, the institute receives DM9.96 million each from  the Federal Government and the land. Only the IfW in Kiel  receives more; all other large economic research institutes must  make do with fewer funds.    Kantzenbach, who has been heading the HWWA since 1989, is  known to any economics student who has even scratched the  surface on the theory of competition. In his dissertation the  Hannoverian, born 1931, proclaimed the thesis that competition  is fiercest among a given group of competitors who manufacture  similar products and have an overview of the market. Economists  call that: ""broad oligopoly with limited product homogeneity and  market transparency.""    In 1967, Kantzenbach became a professor at the University of  Frankfurt. There the SPD [Social Democratic Party]  member--elected as representative of the liberal wing of  professors and teaching assistants--held the office of president  from 1971 to 1975. Subsequently he moved to the University of  Hamburg. Following tradition, he remained a professor there even  after assuming office at the HWWA.    As a member of the Commission on Monopoly (1974 to 1986) and  its chairman (as of 1979), Kantzenbach criticized the megafusion  of Daimler and AEG, as well as the merger of Daimler and MBB.    For over a year now, the HWWA has had a scientific advisory  board composed of five professors, thus fulfilling an old demand  by the Scientific Council. Presidents of other institutes long  opposed the additional tutelage; now all six economic research  institutes have an advisory council. Kantzenbach makes the best  of it: The advisory board meetings ""are interesting for me  personally,"" and the research departments are forced ""to think  about themselves.""    One of the first pieces of advice by the external scientists  was to establish a new research group for ""regulation,  industrial economics, and competition."" It was occasioned by the  reports on the situation of competition in the new laender  prepared for the economics ministry. Competition specialist  Kantzenbach summarizes tersely the essence of the observations:  With the exception of local markets, such as for newspapers and  sugar, competition in Germany ""in no way was intensified"" by  unification.    In early May, the institute will devote a conference to  Germany as a business location, because this ""political slogan""  now stands for a number of economic problems, says Kantzenbach.  In addition to short-term foreign exchange rate problems, it  concerns investment incentives, profitability, research and  development, and employment. The moderate wage agreements,  ""economically tenable,"" must be differentiated more according to  quality, sectors and regions. But tax policy must then balance  social hardships.    Political ""crash programs"" cannot achieve the link-up with  high technology. Instead of conducting ""industrial policy par  excellence"" as in the case of Transrapid, the state should put  more funds into the basic research of institutes and  universities. The ""miserable"" training conditions of students  also need urgent improvement.    The HWWA research departments, ""Economy, Money, and Public  Finances"" as well as ""Economic Structure and Economic Order,""  are nationally oriented. Four of a total of six departments deal  with international issues: ""World Economy,"" ""Economic and  Financial Relations Between Industrial Countries,"" ""Development  Policy and Integration of Developing Countries,"" as well as  ""Economic Systems and Relations of East European Countries.""    Banks above all work with the HWWA index for raw material  prices. On a daily basis, researchers update the index to the  latest stock market quotations and use it to compute prior work  [costs] and the terms of trade.    The Hamburg institute reports regularly to the BMWi on the  economic situation in the Baltic states as well as St.  Petersburg and Koenigsberg [Kaliningrad]. Information on these  regions encountered lively interest, especially in enterprises.    The HWWA earns annually DM325,000 by this commission--a  small  contribution to the total budget which amounted to DM20.3  million in 1993. Personnel costs alone were DM16.2 million. In  addition to the basic funding, the HWWA had additional revenues  of DM2.1 million through commissioned work. Three-fourths of the  reports were ordered by public authorities, among them the BMWi  alone for DM1.47 million.    If one measures the outside funds ratio against the overall  budget, it amounts to only 10.3 percent. But according to  Kantzenbach's figures, the research budget plus proportionate  costs for administration amounts to only DM9.5 million. Computed  on this basis, the share earned by 53 scientists through expert  opinions increases to 22 percent.    Of 221 Staff Members 130 Work for the Info Center    The remainder of the budget funds, about DM9 million, goes  to  the HWWA Information Center which employs 130 of a total of 221  HWWA staff members. The library houses over a million volumes.  Last year 72,300 people utilized this scientific resource. In  addition, there is the press documentation which stores 17.3  million articles. One of the Info center's tasks is also  advising enterprises. For that, fees of about DM400,000 were  collected in 1993.    The collection of press clippings and books was the  institute's original task when it was founded in 1908 as the  central department of the Colonial Institute in Hamburg. In the  Weimar Republic, it was given the name of ""Hamburg's World  Economy Archive"" (HWWA). After 1945 it also turned to more  practical research; as of 1970 this was expressed in the new  name, ""HWWA Institute for Economic Research-Hamburg.""    The institute publishes research results regularly in the  periodicals WIRTSCHAFTSDIENST (monthly), INTERECONOMICS  (bimonthly), and FINANZIERUNG UND ENTWICKLUNG (quarterly).  KONJUNKTUR VON MORGEN appears every two weeks.    To provide the institute with more flexibility, the Hamburg  senate and the BMWi in 1991 wanted to turn the HWWA agency into  a [registered] association. All other economic research  institutes are organized under this private legal form, with the  exception of the university institute, IfW. The staff violently  opposed the plans. They feared deterioration of their working  conditions; furthermore, the institute even as ""e.V.""  [registered association] would not be granted additional rights.  The protest was successful, and the HWWA remained an agency.     "

They described it as one of the greatest  events in spying operations so far.    In the wake of the disclosure of this news, U.S. President  Bill Clinton announced that he has ordered an enquiry and  investigation in order to speedily clarify the details of such  an event.    The subject of espionage and the reason why Russia and  America, under the conditions when the Cold War has already  ended, are trying to get informed of one another's secrets, have  drawn the attention of the world people.    At the end of the Cold War the heads of the CIA and the  Russian intelligence organization, KGB, in their speeches, had  dismissed continuation of the past policies that arose from  mutual distrust and proposed cooperation in various fields. But  facts now show that both countries still lack trust toward the  other. For this reason they continue to make use of their spy  organizations for acquiring secret information on the actions  and decisions adopted by the opposing country.    America is now trying to acquire precise information on  Russian policies in various parts of the world, especially in  the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union and  possibly to create grounds for its political influence in them.  In this regard one may refer to the murder of a CIA official in  Georgia last year. That event roused Moscow's anger, vis-a-vis  America.    It appears that spying measures of America, in order to  penetrate Russia and the newly-independent republics, have led  to the fact that Russia's spy organization too pursues its  operations to counter the rival's designs. However, it often  happens that spy organizations, based on their facilities,  penetrate sensitive administrative and intelligence centers of  the opposing country. Of course such an act, based on  undermining the prestige of one of these two states, may bring  sharp reactions in its wake.    In connection with the disclosure of the recent spying  episode, it appears that Mr. Clinton is extremely wrathful and  it is probable that he may adopt fresh decisions on U.S.-Russian  diplomatic ties. Inflection of this blow on the Clinton  Administration will compel Washington to have a closer survey of  the rulers in Moscow and to adopt caution in its ties. But  despite this one cannot stress the point that America will also  reassess its policies on supporting the reformists and checking  the ultra-nationalists. This is because in such case America  will have to ready itself for return to the Cold War era and  intense rivalry between the CIA and the KGB.     "

Indeed, this was a highly symbolic  gesture because that region is the stronghold of the Islamic  activists.    Since his arrival at the Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Affairs  Ministry], Alain Juppe had not had the opportunity to see the  splendors of Egyptian archaeology... Would he visit Upper  Egypt? Yes, he dared to do so to set a good example, reassure  the tourists, but primarily to reassure the Egyptian population.  Juppe had set aside two days in his timetable for a private  visit: Luxor, Aswan, Sinai. It was a direct response to the  Muslim fundamentalists.    Alain Juppe described Franco-Egyptian relations as  ""excellent."" ""The fundamentalist violence is not capable of  affecting our bilateral relations. In 1993, the total value of  commercial transactions between the two countries was more than  6 billion French francs [Fr]. Every year, Fr460 million is  granted in annual aid. France's financial contribution will not  be suspended,"" the minister stated.    The attack on the Semiramis hotel, which took place on the  eve of President Mubarak's visit to Paris last November, and the  machine-gun attack on Austrian tourists at Christmas in downtown  Cairo during Francois Mitterrand's semiprivate visit did not  discourage Alain Juppe from visiting Egypt. The avowed  objective of this visit was: ""To plan a meeting of several  foreign ministers from countries bordering on the Mediterranean  to strengthen cooperation in the framework of the five-plus-five  dialogue."" This agreement was signed in 1990 among the southern  European countries: France, Italy, Spain, Malta, and Portugal,  and those of the Arab Maghreb. The work was suspended because of  the conflict with Libya and is therefore now being revived with  the choice of a new partner: Egypt.    According to Alain Juppe's spokesman, a summit will be held  in June. It will be preceded by meetings of experts and  intellectuals from the Mediterranean countries. Eyes will be  turned toward Algeria, which must not be allowed to topple. All  the neighboring countries would then be contaminated. The  mistakes made in Algeria must be avoided with Egypt. There will  therefore be no statements about indivisible democracy, but no  anti-Islamic propaganda either... The language of moderation is  being spoken. This is also the aim of Alain Juppe's visit.    Two ambitious projects are on the agenda: The increase in  French-speaking courses in Egyptian universities and the  creation of bilingual classes in high schools. The ""Juppe plan""  is to penetrate the middle classes, promote dual cultures, and  create new youth movements capable of overcoming those who are  preaching a closed society and a policy of isolation by the  indigenous cultures.

Robaina and Asamoah today held a one-hour-plus meeting  during  which they exchanged ideas on the world situation, and in  particular, their respective nations.    The foreign minister from the Caribbean nation arrived  yesterday in this capital as part of a two-week tour of the  continent that also includes Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and  Namibia, in that order.    During their official conversations, Robaina offered an  overall outlook on his country's economic and political  situation, as well as the changes being implemented in the wake  of the Soviet Union's demise and the stepping up of the blockade  imposed on the island by the United States more than three  decades ago.    In this regard, he explained that his government has opened  doors to foreign investment under Washington's relentless  persecution to hamper these negotiations.    The visitor indicated that more than 100 foreign companies  are established on Cuban territory and one of 1994's priorities  is to promote Latin American and Caribbean investments.    When referring to the conflict with the United States, the  Cuban diplomat ruled out improved relations, although he  remarked that as time goes by more and more sectors of U.S.  society oppose the blockade.    Robaina expressed his appreciation for Ghana's position with  regard to the Caribbean island in diverse international forums  and particularly at the United Nations.    Meanwhile, Asamoah emphasized that this support, besides  being based on friendship, is a matter of principle at a time  when there is an attempt to force Cuba to change its political  system.    We do not want the small nations to be pressured by the  Western powers, stressed the African minister. It is very  clear, he said, that the West tries to control the Third World  through the UN Security Council, demonstrating the absence of  consistency in this body.    To conclude, he expressed his satisfaction for being able to  count on good friends such as Cuba.    The Cuban minister arrived in Accra on a two-day official  visit accompanied by Alberto Rodriguez Arufe, coordinator of the  Cuban Communist Party's Central Committee International  Relations Department and by other Foreign Ministry officials.    During today's visit the Cuban delegation laid a wreath at  the Kwame Nkruman monument, father of Ghana's independence. The  wreath was received by Daniel Anam, president of the ruling  party National Democratic Congress, and by its general secretary  Huudu Yahaya.    Before travelling to Angola, Robaina met with Ghanaian  President Jerry Rawlings. With a population of over 15 million  people, Ghana, a former British colony, is Cuba's first trading  partner in Africa.     "

Main  Threat to Russia Is Inside its Borders""]    [Text] A three-day scientific-practical conference  ""Security of the Individual, Society, State, and Russia's  Special Services"" ended yesterday. Its outcome was summed up at  a news briefing at the central club of the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. Taking part in it were  Vladimir Rubanov, deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council;  Vladimir Volokh, deputy head of the Federal Emigration Service  of Russia; Yuriy Stsepinskiy, deputy head of the FCS analytical  directorate; and Petr Dmitriyev, scientific director of Moscow  State University. The news briefing was hosted by Aleksandr  Mikhaylov, head of the FCS Public Relations Center (PRC).    In the course of the conference, its more than 800  participants heard 98 reports and addresses. The main attention  was paid to a new conception of Russia's security system and a  doctrine enabling it. As Yuriy Stsepinskiy stated, ""the main  threat to Russia is inside its borders."" Asked by journalists  if fragmenting the Russian Ministry of Security may weaken the  country's security, Vladimir Rubanov replied that the  effectiveness of measures taken had been proven by world  practice. In the opinion of Aleksandr Mikhaylov, however, the  operation of new subdivisions, in connection with the  reorganization, should be efficiently coordinated.    Vladimir Volokh dwelled upon the problems of forced  emigration. According to Federal Emigration Service [FES]  information, about 2 million forced emigrants from CIS republics  and another 500,000 from developing countries have entered  Russia in the past three years. In his opinion, it had been long  necessary to pass a law on emigration, otherwise Russia's FES  would ""choke.""    According to Petr Dmitriyev, actions by FCS operatives have  virtually no legal basis. Therefore, he thought, their  activities should be regulated by a law ""On Special Services""  whose draft is in the works.    Aleksandr Mikhaylov, in his turn, briefed journalists on the  results of a snap poll of the conference participants. It was  found during the poll that 66 percent of the respondents are  satisfied with the activity of the counterintelligence service,  and 18 percent are not. At the same time, 74 percent of the  polled think that the fight against corruption and smuggling is  not being waged at the appropriate level.    The PRC head also gave your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent  some details about the incident involving North Korean diplomats  held last week by FCS officers as they tried to smuggle from  Russia two rockets (Mr. Mikhaylov did not specify what sort of  rockets). In his words, Russia and the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea are not interested in further publicizing this  affair because it concerns more than relations between two  countries. This also finds confirmation in the categorical  refusal of DPRK Embassy personnel to give any comments in this  regard.     "

Qian Qichen, vice  premier of the State Council and concurrently minister of  foreign affairs, was invited to answer reporters' questions on  the international situation and China's foreign policy.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified XINHUA reporter] I am a  XINHUA reporter. I wish to ask Minister Qian: In Detroit the  day before yesterday, U.S. President Cinton expressed  disappointment over the results of Secretary of State  Christopher's visit to China. What is your view in this regard?  What is your estimation of the possibility of the U.S. granting  China most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment? Thanks.    [Qian Qichen] Concerning Secretary of State Christopher's  visit, I am also somewhat disappointed. Because it could have  made more achievements [cheng guo] as was expected. However,  now through this visit, we have reached a number of agreements.  We have still made some achievements, but the achievements are  not as many as expected. Meanwhile, regarding the MFN treatment  I think it should be said that if it can be maintained, it will  be good news to both China and the United States; otherwise, it  will be bad news for both countries.    [Unidentified reporter] My question is that following the  announcement of the joint communique of the Chinese and French  Governments, relations between the two countries have been  normalized. Not long ago, the French parliamentary speaker  visited China and it was learned that the French premier will  visit China next month. I wish to ask Vice Premier Qian what do  you think is the outlook for relations between China and France?    [Qian Qichen] In the Sino-French Joint Communique on  resuming normal relations between the two countries released on  12 January this year, the French Government promised that in the  future it will not plan to approve French enterprises' taking  part in arming Taiwan. The meaning is quite clear. Later, I  made an official visit to France. An important part of which  was to make preparations for Premier Balladur's visit to China.  Therefore, I am convinced that Premier Balladur's visit to  China is a major event in relations between the two countries.  It will have an important bearing on promoting bilateral  relations, including economic and trade relations. The visit  will take place in early April. [An international reporter  starts to ask question but is cut off by an unidentified  moderator] [end recording]    Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also answered reporters'  questions on Sino-British Relations and relations between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait.

The Royal Government  of Cambodia [RGC] has no intention whatsoever of continuing the  war. I will support Samdech Krompreah [Norodom Ranariddh] in his  efforts to implement our king's initiative to woo the Khmer  Rouge into settling the problem peacefully. Since all manner of  attempts and all (?discussions) between Samdech Krompreah and  H.E. Khieu Samphan have failed, however, and since the people  and the KRAF [Khmer Royal Armed Forces] have continued to suffer  from further attacks, Samdech Krompreah and I have decided to  launch the attacks to take control of Anlung Veng, Pailin, An  Seh, and other areas. If we do not destroy the bases in Pailin  and Anlung Veng and other places, the Cambodian people can never  live in peace. This is because the Khmer Rouge have used all  those bases to attack them and the KRAF.    I would also like to say that the RGC is duty-bound to  implement Article 1 of the Constitution, which stipulates  clearly that the Kingdom of Cambodia is an indivisible state.  We have the task of controlling Cambodia totally, according to  the Constitution. We have resorted to offensives only after the  talks between Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and the Khmer  Rouge became unproductive. We can no longer let Cambodia remain  divided. According to the Constitution, the royal government  has to control the entire kingdom. Therefore, the attacks on  Anlung Veng, Pailin, or other places do not constitute a  violation of anybody's territory or border. They are the tasks  carried out by the RGC in compliance with the Constitution.  Moreover, our policy is to use military measures to enter into  a political dialogue.    Samdech Krompreah and I are of the same opinion that if the  Khmer Rouge continue to enjoy their military, economic,  political, psychological, and diplomatic support, its leaders  will not soften their political stances, no matter what. So the  attack on Pailin is to isolate the Khmer Rouge and to soften its  political stance while the government leaves the door open for  political dialogue to achieve national reconciliation.    We continue to implement, not just accept, His Majesty's  initiative. The Khmer Rouge has to fulfill the three necessary  tasks while the royal government implements the two others.  First, the Khmer Rouge has to stop firing on and destroying  property; second, it has to surrender its troops to the royal  government; and third, it has to hand over the regions under its  control to the government. As for the government, it should  fulfill two tasks: first, it should agree to include the Khmer  Rouge troops in the KRAF; second, it should allow acceptable  Khmer Rouge personages to hold some ministerial or advisory  posts.    Samdech Krompreah and I are prepared to hold political  discussion with H.E. [His Excellency] Khieu Samphan. The RGC  wants to cease hostilities in compliance with His Majesty's  initiative. Especially on this new year occasion, we want to  have an unconditional and general cease-fire throughout the  Kingdom of Cambodia so as to allow people to enjoy the new year  celebration. The KRAF, police, and people, as well as the Khmer  Rouge troops, all want to be happy on this occasion. If  Democratic Kampuchea agrees to a general cease- fire, the KRAF  have no reason whatsoever to launch attacks. Taking this  opportunity, I would like to appeal, in case the Khmer Rouge  leaders disagree, to the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea  officers and soldiers to lay their arms aside and come in to  enjoy popular games with the people and the KRAF. This is a  very good opportunity for reconciliation.    Now, I want to talk a bit about the plan to develop Pailin.  We have not only attacked and occupied Pailin militarily, but  we should also develop it in line with other regions throughout  the country. We need to transform Pailin into an administrative  region. The RGC plans to request that the National Assembly  authorize the designation of Pailin as a town with a structure  equal to that of a province. The government has already set up  a group of delegates with the duty of organizing this area as a  development zone.    Taking this opportunity, I would like to appeal to the  people  who have been forced out of the Pailin region by the Khmer Rouge  into Thailand or other areas to return. If they return, we will  hand their homes or land back to them. We want to give priority  to those forced by the Khmer Rouge to follow them. When they  return, we will allow them to own homes legally as other people  do.    [Summary from poor reception] I want to talk a bit about  relations with Thailand. Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut,  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, presented  this issue to the Kingdom of Thailand on 8 April. As for  myself, I will make an urgent visit to Bangkok on 16 April.  That will be an urgent working visit to solve not only the  Cambodian-Thai border problem at Pailin, but also the issue of  security along the common border. I wish to emphasize that  while I am there, I will not discuss the issue of establishing  the boundary between the two countries because the  Thai-Cambodian border, except for the maritime border, has been  recognized since His Majesty's Sangkum Reas Niyum era. There  have already been maps and proper arrangements. The purpose of  my next trip is to settle the problems between Thailand and  Cambodia concerning the control of the security situation and  the relations of good neighborliness. This is to turn the  common border into a border of peace, friendship, and  cooperation. I will first make clear with the Kingdom of  Thailand that the Khmer Rouge office near the Royal Palace in  Phnom Penh does not mean that Cambodia is separated into two  different countries. Some Thai leaders have said that the Khmer  Rouge has not been outlawed yet because its representatives are  still in Phnom Penh. I would like to underline that legally,  there is only the royal government, which is the result of the  UN-sponsored elections that the royal Thai government has  already recognized. There is no other legitimate force on  Cambodian soil other than the RGC. As for the Khmer Rouge  office in Phnom Penh, it only represents a political liaison  among Cambodians. This issue is purely an internal affair. The  RGC also wants to keep dialogue through the Phnom Penh Khmer  Rouge office with the aim of seeking a political solution.  Nonetheless, we would like to specify to the entire world not  to consider the Khmer Rouge office in Phnom Penh proof of  Cambodia's division into two. This is the first point I want to  clarify to my counterpart in Bangkok.    Second, we want to implement the Cambodian Government  statement that all contracts previously concluded by Thai  companies with the Khmer Rouge will be recognized. I will urge  those companies to do business with the RGC, because the trade  will have a bright future and be legal. The RGC will not  tolerate any violation of Cambodian laws, policy, or economy.    I hope that my statement will not (?upset) the Thai side.  This is done with the intention of settling problems and  avoiding creation of new ones, and is also forewords to Bangkok.  Anyway, we still have a lot of problems to discuss if the visit  is to take place after this new year celebration.     "

[Pawlak] I think one must always seek ways of expanding  cooperation. The trade deficit with our biggest trade partner,  Germany, has been causing us problems lately. Balanced  cooperation is very important to us, and we hope the necessary  balance will be achieved not through restrictions, but through  new forms of cooperation.    [Heller] In Brussels, you suggested a ""Partnership for  Development"" as a parallel to Partnership for Peace. What do  you expect from the Germans?    [Pawlak] Above all, partner-like relations and an active  search for common interests. Balanced advantages on both sides  help overcome obstacles and bring the two countries' economies  closer together. In this way, Poland's maneuvering space in the  process of rapprochement between our countries also becomes  bigger. On the other hand, as soon as a greater imbalance  occurs, problems begin.    [Heller] Apart from a trade deficit, the Polish statistics  also reveal an increase in the Polish National Bank's foreign  currency reserves. If every German who visited Poland last year  had spent 100 German marks, the deficit would have been quickly  paid off.    [Pawlak] I trust the European Union's [EU] statistics, and  these show a clear deficit. But that can be compensated by a  reasonable level of trade between border areas. However, it is  an oversimplification to suggest that everyone who crosses our  border should spend so many marks. Instead, we should  concentrate on those enterprises that actually determine the  economic situation. Specific consideration and activity can  easily form the nucleus of our economic cooperation. Therefore,  this cooperation is useful because it permits direct contacts  between any people, and thus creates a climate of practical  cooperation.    [Heller] It is a well-known fact that as head of the Polish  Government, you drive a Polonez car. During your visit here  have you shown an interest in other makes of car?    [Pawlak] I am really an auto engineer. I was interested in  cars long before I was interested in politics. My side trip to  Stuttgart will also be a reminder of my first long trip to  Germany. Generally speaking, we are interested in cooperation,  especially the kind of cooperation that involves investments on  Polish territory. Investments by large significant firms, such  as Volkswagen in Poznan, show that it is worth investing in  Poland. I think a similar investment by Mercedes is also  feasible. We are concerned about creating new jobs, and already  have tried-and-tested contacts that make it easier to sell  Polish products on third markets.    [Heller] Waiting times on the German-Polish border are  getting longer and longer because of the increased goods and  personal traffic. Can Poland afford to be so difficult to enter?    [Pawlak] If that were merely a Polish-German problem, we  would have surely solved it already. But we are dealing with a  peripheral EU border, as well as heavy transit traffic toward  the East. In the immediate future we will concentrate on  developing two transit routes -- the  Swiecko-Poznan-Warsaw-Terespol route, which continues via Minsk  to Moscow; and the Wroclaw-Katowice-Krakow route, which connects  Saxony and Ukraine. Accordingly, as far as goods traffic is  concerned, we are going to expand the border crossing points at  Swiecko (Frankfurt-Oder) and Zgorzelec (Goerlitz), and later the  one at Olszyna (Forst). The modern terminal in Swiecko should  be ready this year. But there is also visible progress at those  crossing points used for local border traffic. The  modernization of the Warsaw-Berlin railroad line should also be  completed this year. Despite all the economic problems, these  projects are very important for us.    [Heller] German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel wants to offer  the Baltic countries association agreements with the EU similar  to the one Poland has already concluded. How does Poland view  this matter?    [Pawlak] Poland wants to play an active role in this part of  Europe. The inclusion of the Baltic countries in the European  integration process is of major significance to us. Following  the admission of Austria, Norway, Sweden, and Finland to the EU,  general interest in the Balkan region will increase, and Poland  will lie in the center of this new EU zone.    [Heller] Will the treaty on good-neighborly relations with  Lithuania also contain a guarantee that Lithuania will receive  support in its efforts to join the EU?    [Pawlak] The treaty with Lithuania concerns our mutual  relations, and has nothing to do with multilateral agreements.  It is the last link in the chain of basic treaties with all our  neighbors. There were a few problems with assessing our common  past, but these have been overcome.    [Heller] Do you fear the emergence of a new Berlin-Moscow  axis? How else can one explain Sejm speaker Jozef Oleksy's  proposal to expand the ""Weimar Triangle"" by including Russia in  it?    [Pawlak] If one looks at the map, one sees that Warsaw lies  on the line between Berlin and Moscow, and it seems quite normal  to me that we are interested in being included in these  contacts. There are exciting prospects here, especially in the  economic sphere, for example the gas pipeline that will lead  from Russia to Germany via Poland. Such enterprises show that  one must seek concrete new solutions, without adhering to  symbols. The problems that have to be solved lie in the  economic, legal, and financial spheres.    [Heller] Do you think it really lies in Poland's interests  to expand a structure like the ""Weimar Triangle,"" that joins  Warsaw to Bonn, by including other partners in it?    [Pawlak] I will let others deal with such purely political  concepts. I am interested in practical aspects. We have so  many problems that we can employ a really large number of people  in solving them. Political contacts are important, but lasting  foundations are laid by means of economic cooperation and  interpersonal contacts.    [Heller] Your voters expect a lot of changes in Poland.  Other people fear the opposite, a return to the old  relationships. What has changed since your Peasant Party and  the Democratic Left Alliance took over the government?    [Pawlak] Our economic performance for the first quarter of  1994 is very significant. Inflation has reached its lowest  point in seven years, and output has risen by 10 percent. That  shows that the resolutions we adopted at the end of 1983 are  correct. The first decision we made was to concentrate on the  economy and give up political rhetoric. The second decision was  to concentrate social aid on those groups of people with the  lowest incomes. That led to an increase in income tax. At the  same time, we introduced tax concessions for investments.    [Heller] These changes represent a shift in emphasis rather  than an adjustment of policy.    [Pawlak] Basically, we have drawn conclusions from the  development of recent years. We want an evolutionary  development, without shocks and sudden changes. It is also  important for us to expand the social framework of the reforms  by easing the burdens and supporting the lowest income groups.  In addition, we want to include the broadest possible  cross-section of society in the process of change. Only in this  way will it be possible to implement the changes in a democratic  way. My government's third concern is to rationalize the use of  the resources at our disposal. An example is the draft law on  the duty to invite tenders when spending public funds. All in  all, our objectives are democracy, a social market economy, and  a respectable position for Poland in the family of free peoples.     "

Kozyrev, who arrived Wednesday for a three-day visit, told  his Chinese counterpart Qian Qichen that the strengthening of  bilateral relations would remain a ""top priority"" and that he  hoped Chinese President Jiang Zemin could visit Moscow for a  summit later this year.    The two foreign ministers met for more than two hours of  ""sincere and cordial"" talks on bilateral and international  issues, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said, adding that  one hour of the talks was held in private.    No details were given of their closed-door session.    Relations between the two neighbours would not suffer as the  result of ""political changes in Russia's domestic situation,""  Kozyrev was quoted as saying.    According to the spokesman, Qian said high-level contacts  over the past year, including the visit here by President Boris  Yeltsin in December, had lent ""great impetus"" to the development  of Sino-Russian relations, particularly economic and trade links.    Bilateral trade last year soared 30 percent from 1992 to 7.7  billion dollars, with border exchanges alone accounting for 2.5  billion dollars.    Following their talks, Kozyrev and Qian signed an agreement  for regular consultations on the establishment of ""transit  ports"" along their 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) common border.  About 20 such ports are currently in operation.    The spokesman did not say if the two foreign ministers had  discussed the possibilty of visa restrictions to stem the flood  of people crossing the border daily.    Some 2.5 million people crossed the border in 1993 and  Kozyrev admitted before leaving Moscow that the number of  Chinese in Russia had become ""a very serious problem.""    Kozyrev was quoted as telling Qian that Moscow's military  policy was strictly ""defensive"" and he reiterated Russia's  commitment to a bilateral agreement pledging non-use of nuclear  weapons against each other.    After the Sino-Soviet rift that developed at the beginning  of  the 1960s, the two communist giants officially reconciled in  1989 during a visit to China by Mikhail Gorbachev. Since  Yeltsin became president of Russia in 1991 following the  collapse of the Soviet Union, Moscow and Beijing have enjoyed  close military cooperation.    While the two foreign ministers discussed cooperation in  various areas, the spokesman said they had not specifically  touched on military issues.    Kozryev also voiced hopes that Russia would be able to  participate in several large-scale construction projects in  China, including the massive Three Gorges hydroelectric dam  being built on the Yangtze River.    Qian said he would welcome Russian cooperation, the  spokesman  said.    Kozyrev is due to hold talks with Jiang on Friday before  leaving for a tour of the southern Chinese special economic zone  of Shenzhen.     "

Following the  official friendship visit to Singapore by party General  Secretary Do Muoi and Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, the official  visit to Vietnam by the Singaporean Prime Minister is a new,  important event asserting the common aspiration of the two  countries' leaders in strengthening the bilateral relations of  friendship and cooperation, thereby contributing to restoring  peace and stability and promoting cooperation and development in  the Southeast Asian region.    We share Singapore's pleasure with its great achievements in  national construction. During the past 30 years, through  various creative development programs, the Singaporean  Government and people have led the small country, with a sparse  population and minimal natural resources, to advance to a  developmental peak and become a world renowned economic, trade,  and financial center.    In 1993, Singapore attained 9.8 percent economic growth  compared with 5.6 percent in 1992. The electronic industries  increased by 25 percent and the vessel building industry by 18.8  percent; about 6.4 million tourists visited the country last  year, increasing national income by 6.9 percent. Singapore's  per capita income now reaches $18,000 [as heard].    Vietnam and Singapore are close friends who have maintained  diplomatic relations since 1973. Since Singapore lifted its  trade embargo on Vietnam in 1991, Vietnam-Singapore economic  and trade cooperation has developed vigorously. Today,  Singapore is one of Vietnam's biggest trade partners. The  two-way trade value in 1993 reached $1.4 billion compared with  $110 million in 1980. Up to January this year, Singapore has 54  projects in Vietnam with an investment capital of $431 million.  In this, it leads the ASEAN countries and is ranked sixth among  foreign investors in Vietnam. Various bilateral agreements on  civil aviation, shipping, sea transportation, trade, investment  insurance, and protection of the environment are being  satisfactorily implemented.    We sincerely thank the Singaporean Government for attaching  importance to promoting relations with Vietnam, especially in  the trade and economic domains. We appreciate Singapore's  efforts in sharing with Vietnam its rich experiences in economic  management and national development.    During his official visit to Singapore in October last year,  General Secretary Do Muoi asserted that Vietnam and Singapore  have many firm bases for strengthening bilateral relations. The  Vietnamese and Singaporean peoples share the same spirit of  maintaining national independence, promoting self-reliance, and  upholding the national characteristics. They also share a  common wish to develop the general trend of peace, stability,  and development in the region and the world.    We are confident that the official friendship visit to  Vietnam by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong will significantly  contribute to promoting mutual understanding and trust and  expanding the multifaceted cooperation between Vietnam and  Singapore.

Trade  and economic ties between Vietnam and ASEAN countries have  rapidly increased. In 1992, two-way trade between Vietnam and  the Indonesia reached $220 million. It was $158 million with  Thailand, $100 million with Malaysia, $1.2 billion with  Singapore, and $50 million with the Philippines.    By the end of 1993, about 100 projects for ASEAN countries  with invested capital of hundreds of millions of dollar were  licensed in Vietnam. ASEAN investment in Vietnam has increased  10 times as against 1990, now accounting for 10 percent of the  total foreign investment in Vietnam. More than 30 agreements on  economic, scientific and technical, trade, payment, credit,  aviation, and navigation have been signed between ASEAN  countries and Vietnam.    In late July last year, the State Committee for Foreign  Investment of Vietnam signed an agreement of cooperation with a  prime company of Brunei which will see the latter invests in  major projects in Vietnam. In late 1991 and early 1992, the  Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet visited all six ASEAN  member countries. This helped the region to have a better  understanding about the current reform in this country.    In visiting Vietnam, all leaders of ASEAN member countries  demonstrated sympathy with the problems and difficulties Vietnam  has been confronting, and promised to share experiences with the  Vietnamese in national development.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai of Thailand is committed to  create favorable conditions for further multi-sided cooperation  between Vietnam and his country. President Fidel Ramos of the  Philippines has assured Vietnamese National Assembly chairman  Nong Duc Manh that the Philippines has always been Vietnam's  friend, and hoped that bilateral ties would be further  developed. It is the common voice of leaders and people of  ASEAN member countries.    Most recently, during his visit to Vietnam, the ASEAN  secretary general, Mr. Ajit Singh, informed Vietnam of the  decision by ASEAN Secretariat to allow Vietnam to participate  and observe in various programs in science, technology,  environment, culture, information, public health, tourism, and  development sources. Mr. Ajit Singh said the secretariat will  send senior officials to Vietnam to exchange views on concrete  issues of ASEAN's concern.    These developments show how much bilateral and multi-sided  cooperation between Vietnam and ASEAN member countries has been  increasing. At the recent foreign ministerial conference held  in Singapore by ASEAN, ASEAN countries appreciated Vietnam's  achievements in its renovation process, and welcomed Vietnam's  participation in a forum on regional security. Relations  between Vietnam and ASEAN has created a new atmosphere in  Southeast Asia.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed once declared that  he would be glad to contribute to national reconstruction and  economic development in Indochina, with the confidence that  Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia would be stable and developed. It  would contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in the  region.     "

Johan  Burger, chief of Negotiation Strategy in the South African  Police Force's Community Relations Department, by Andriette  Stofberg: ""Col. Johan Burger Is Not Afraid To Speak His Mind:  Police Force Must Be Demilitarized Soon""; place and date not  given]    [Text] ""Today we bravely say things which would have been  unthinkable a few years ago. I believe that it is to our  advantage that this has become possible.""    Colonel Johan Burger does not seem like such a ""liberal""  police man. Sitting behind his desk in Pretoria, he looks just  like any other very ordinary policeman.    It is only that this chief of negotiation strategy within  the  Community Relations Department has quietly acquired a reputation  within and outside the police force as someone who is not afraid  to say things which used to be better left unsaid.    When in 1971, as a very young policeman, he was hunting  terrorists far away in the Caprivi strip, he did not have too  much to say. He did not even ask questions. Besides, like so  many other policemen there, he did not even know who or what  SWAPO [South-West African People's Organization] was.    ""We did not receive any political training. We were not  politically aware. We were only taught that we were there to  shoot terrorists. We did not know what they stood for. We only  knew that they were in the process of causing some kind of drama  or other.""    Then came the disturbances of 1976. The small seed, which  would lead to his starting to ask questions, was sowed. He was a  member of the riot squads. ""I imagined myself in the shoes of  the black men, and wondered how I would have felt if Afrikaans  had been forced upon me.""    In 1982, when he was riding around in Owambo ""with a Casspir  and a gun,"" he started asking questions in earnest.    About such things as why the police force had moved so far  away from its traditional role of a doctrine of ""search and take  into custody,"" after having so successfully made the military  ""search and destroy"" doctrine of a semimilitary organization its  own.    One of the results of these questions was a Master of  Strategic Studies dissertation last year at UNISA [University of  South Africa] about the role of the police in counterinsurgency  in Namibia.    He believes that it is necessary for the police force to  become demilitarized as soon as possible and that it must once  again become a civilian police force. The military character of  the police force has developed over many years--first through  participation in two world wars and then in the  counterinsurgency war along the border.    ""I believe that we should have withdrawn sooner as the  struggle became more military in character. Of course, the  police force has a role to play in counterinsurgency actions.  But there comes a point when the involvement of the military  becomes so great that they should play the primary role. Then  the police force must stand back.""    ""What has happened in our country is that instead of the  police force standing back, we joined. Sometimes we were more  soldiers than the soldiers themselves.""    ""This inherently created problems for us. Take a policeman  who had returned from the border and had to come to police the  townships, can you imagine what his approach was? After all, he  had been conditioned like a soldier.""    ""Now we must change our own approach to our own culture. And  this is hard to accept for many policemen--given the pride we  have in our history. However, the question remains: was it good  for us to have become militarily involved to such an extent? Is  this the right kind of background to have for normal policing  work?""    ""We have been trained like a semimilitary organization. In  addition to the fact that South Africa has never had a culture  of human rights in its constitution or in any other laws, we did  not have this in the police force either. We are the product of  our own society.""    ""Now that society is changing, we must recognize that we  must  do the same thing. We are already in the process of implementing  major changes. An international team of experts is helping us to  adjust our training, with a particular emphasis on the new  community policing approach, and also because we need a better  under standing of negotiating tactics to defuse situations--that  the guys should not be so quick to turn to violence.""    Like any other people in the country, policemen must find  their bearings within the changes which are taking place in the  national and other arenas.    As part of his job, Col. Burger has developed a consequence  leap model which he uses in informational sessions to try to  explain to policemen all over the country how the national  negotiations affect the Police force.    ""It says to the guys on the other side of the negotiation  process that there will stil be a South Africa, there will still  be a police force, there will still be a structure, there will  still be laws. Things will just look a little different. You  have to make a psychological leap to that point from where you  are now. Then things will not seem so confusing to you and you  will large ly lose your fear of the future.""    ""Of course, you will still be uncertain because nobody can  see into the future. But you have to realize that it will be  incredibly difficult for you, if not impossible, to be  physically a policeman in the new South Africa if  psychologically you have remained behind in the old South  Africa.""    He talks about the major confidence crisis which exists  between the police and primarily the black community.    ""Take such factors as the so-called apartheid heritage.  Nobody argues about it anymore: apartheid had certain negative  consequences and the police force was not untouched by them. We  have had a certain power approach within the police force. I do  not mean all policemen, but in many cases policemen did not have  any interest in the community, especially not the black  community.""    ""We simply used the approach that this is what the law said,  the law was rigidly enforced and we did not tolerate any  opposition. Good relations were not important to us. What was  important was to enforce the law as it stood.""    ""Opposition to this also hardened the policemen's  disposition. Later on, we no longer had any sympathy for the  victims of cer tain laws--however unfair they may have  been--because for us it was a question of doing a job that had  to be done.""    The hardening of feelings on both sides between the  community  and the police force led to alienation. After February 1990,  however, the police began to realize that they had to reach out  to heal the alienation.    ""But this goes together with the legitimacy of the  government. As long as we do not have a legitimate government,  the police force cannot be legitimate.""    ""Legitimacy is defined by the whole population of a nation.  The police force is currently not legitimate because today's  government, of which we are an extension, only represents part  of the population. If the body is dead, there is no way an arm  can be alive.""    ""We are trying, through the community policing approach, to  achieve a greater degree of acceptance. But this is only  secondary. All these positive things will not mean a thing until  the government itself, the primary source, has achieved  legitimacy.""     "

Raphel, during the  U.S. senate foreign policy panel hearing on South Asian affairs.  The season of reason seems to have just dawned on Washington  politics. The American flip-flop on strategic issues, especially  issues concerning the sub-continent never ceases to amaze policy  watchers. India is one day a primitive, human rights abuser and  becomes a non-cooperative nuclear nation another day, all thanks  to the benevolence and quirkiness of Washington ditherers. Till  yesterday, President Bill Clinton was testing his writing skills  on the Punjab issue and trying his vocal chords on the Kashmir  absurdities. As if to prove the promptness of his administration  in dealing with strategic issues with immediacy, his staff was  very prompt in responding to dubious organisations and painted  India as a country of primitive inhabitants bent upon killing  each other. Today, suddenly, the Clinton administration comes  across precious evidence that India is a very big country, that  there is a thriving democracy which has over a long period of  time evolved democratic institutions and is in the process of  addressing human rights abuses and adhering to international  human rights standards. One is certain many Indian hearts swell  with pride at hearing such pious outpourings by the greatest  democracy on earth. But what explains for the American policy of  yesterday? Did policy makers in Washington not realise that  India with its continental dimensions, inhabited by different  ethnic, religious and language groups, surrounded on one side by  a country bent upon stoking the fires of terrorism and  separatism, remain incident-free, trouble-free and  violence-free? Why has it taken the Yanks so long to realise  that the Government of India was doing its best to come to grips  with an extremely volatile situation in a manner that at the  same time did not lead to much loss of life? Why did it not  recognise that the thousands of humans who sacrificed their  lives to bring peace to the Punjab were policemen, who became  common fodder to the terrorist bullets? Should a developing  country spend enormous amounts of money and hire American  lobbyists to open the eyes of lords in Washington to see home  truths about India? It is pathetic to see a super power which is  so indecisive. One only hopes that it does not chance upon some  new evidence, suitable to its needs, and change its policy  tomorrow. The loser would not be India, for, international  community knows by now, the human rights record of India. It is  the United States of America that will lose its face. In its own  self-interest, the United States needs to evolve a realistic,  long-term strategy for the sub-continent.     "

As a group of Russian journalists accompanying Kozyrev were  told by Mikhail Belyy, director of the 1st Asian Department of  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, in  Moscow it is thought that the development of relations with  China is in keeping with Russia's basic national interests. The  parties' positions ""are close or overlapping"" with regard to  many international issues. In particular, Moscow and Beijing  hold similar views concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear  weapons on the Korean peninsula. But, as the diplomat put it,  there are ""nuances"": China is categorically against the  application of international sanctions against the DPRK while  Russia sees them as an extremely undesirable but possible  measure.    SEGODNYA commentary. In terms of foreign policy China  emphatically practices nonintervention in the internal affairs  of other countries, actively resists attempts at intervention in  its own, and avoids becoming involved in international  conflicts. Thus, for example, Beijing, a permanent member of the  UN Security Council, showed no interest in regulation in  Yugoslavia, and Spain took its place in the ""Yugoslav Five.""    It is very important to Russia that the PRC strives to  maintain stability on its northern borders, particularly in the  Central Asian region, and also that Beijing is concerned about  possible disturbances within the Russian Federation. China is  refraining from short-term ""advantageous"" actions involving an  active struggle for political influence in Central Asia, from  attempts to crowd Russia out of this region, from encouragement  of separatist tendencies within the Russian Federation itself,  and also from support of opposition forces in the political  battle at the federal level. All this predetermines the limited  nature of political contradictions between Russia and China and  the possibilities of cooperation of the two countries as  guarantors of stability in the vast border region. This is why a  drastic change in the current pragmatic leadership in Beijing  would not be in Russia's interests, since any other leadership  would focus primarily on nationalism, which would lead to an  aggravation of the situation in the border regions and relations  with Russia as a whole.    Trade between the Russian Federation and the PRC is  developing at rapid rates. In 1993 its volume reached $7.2  billion, and Russia has an active balance of $2 billion. China  occupies second place after the FRG in Russia's trade turnover.  But there is also the Russian clearing indebtedness from  commercial credit granted by China during 1990-1991.    But the exchange remains unequivalent: Russian fertilizer,  metal, and machines--for extremely poor-quality Chinese goods of  light industry and the food industry. Such a practice is  encouraged by the Chinese not only at the provincial but also at  the governmental level through the publication of the  corresponding statutes. The volume of ""shuttle"" trade, according  to Chinese figures, was $614 million. The Russians consider  shuttle operations to be a negative aspect since they contribute  to the outflow of hard currency from Russia.    Moreover, the fixed exchange rate of the Swiss franc (this  is  the currency in which the mutual settlements are transacted) is  artificially reduced with respect to the Chinese yuan (1.8  francs per yuan, while the black market rate is 0.1 francs per  yuan).    Weapons are one of the most profitable items of Russian  exports to China. As an example Mikhail Belyy mentioned the sale  of two SU-27 squadron fighters and the S-300 antiaircraft  missile complex (delivery volume not specified).    It is known from other sources that Beijing also purchased  two SU-31 squadron interceptors and an unestablished number of  T-72 tanks, and they are also showing an interest in Russian  missile targeting systems. The British weekly JANE'S DEFENSE  WEEKLY reported another delivery of SN-27's; the representative  of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on  the publication. There have been reports that the Chinese are  conducting negotiations for the purchase of the Varyag aircraft  carrier which is under construction. Taking into account China's  claims to the Spratly archipelago and its desire to dominate in  the South China Sea, such a transaction can hardly contribute to  maintaining stability in Southeast Asia.    The diplomat noted that weapons trade with China is a  ""completely normal phenomenon"" and when engaging in it Russia is  guided by a number of principles, namely: not to harm its own  security, nonproliferation of nuclear technologies, and  transparency.    Mikhail Belyy denies the existence of territorial problems  in  Russian-Chinese relations. In his assessment, border  negotiations are proceeding successfully enough. An agreement on  the eastern section of the border was signed in May 1991.  Demarcation work was begun on this section in May of last year.  The Kazakhstan segment of the Western section was finally agreed  upon a couple of days ago. ""There is nothing crucial or  explosive about this issue,"" the diplomat noted.    At the same time he admitted that there were problems with  maintaining border procedures.    The number of border violations by China on the eastern  section tripled during the past year. Contraband operations and  poaching in Russian waters have become widespread (in May 1993,  as we know, a unilateral Russian moratorium on pollack fishing  took effect in the central part of the Sea of Okhotsk).    Local Russian authorities are also disturbed by the  demographic situation in the border regions of the Far East. We  have no precise information on this. The estimates of the number  of Chinese now living in the Far East range from 300,000 to 1  million, and the overall number of Chinese citizens living  permanently (frequently illegally) in Russia amounts 2 million,  and in Moscow--50,000. The number of Chinese reported to be  living in certain regions of the Far East exceeds the number of  local residents. Thus in Partizanskiy Rayon of Maritime Kray,  according to the results of a special surprise inspection, the  ratio was 14,000 to 7,000. The crime situation on the border is  getting worse; it was for this reason that the crossing point  from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe, where Minister Kozyrev recently  visited, was closed.    During the course of the negotiations, Mikhail Belyy stated,  it is intended to sign a bilateral agreement on border crossing  points so as ""to make the process controlled."" At the present  time 21 crossing points have been opened on the Russian-Chinese  border, 19 of which are in operation. What with the  unprecedented growth of border trade, border and customs  officials are unable to keep up with their work. For example,  last year the border was crossed by a total of 2.5 million  people. The Russians, in Belyy's words, adhere to the principle  ""better fewer but better."" On 29 October of last year on  Russia's initiative an international agreement on visa  conditions was signed. As for crime, there is an agreement on  legal assistance between Russia and China, Mikhail Belyy stated,  which the Chinese propose to augment with an agreement on  turning over criminals. At one time it was the Chinese who  refused to include the corresponding articles in the agreement  on legal assistance.    Russia's position on the Taiwan problem is determined by the  president's edict of 15 September 1992: Relations with the  island will be conducted exclusively on an unofficial, nonstate  level. These, Belyy stated, are the ""rules of the game which the  entire world follows."" In the recent past, he said, there has  been a ""naive euphoria,"" largely from the Russian side. But it  is with extreme caution that capital is invested in Taiwanese  business. The volume of Russian-Taiwanese trade now, the  diplomat reported, is about $500 million.     "

[Campbell] There has always been a need to boost exports.  Argentina has a closed economy.    [Boragni] How can this trend be turned around?    [Campbell] We need a cultural change. There are very  concrete cases that point to the ongoing reversal of this trend.  I am referring to relations between Argentina and Brazil, in  which bilateral trade rose from $1 billion yearly to $6 billion.    [Boragni] Does the trade deficit constitute a source of  concern for the government?    [Campbell] It depends on how we analyze it. From the  viewpoint of imports, they are composed to a great extent of  capital goods. This means that investments are being made in the  country. But it is also true that we have to boost exports.    [Boragni] Are you thinking about instruments for export  promotion?    [Campbell] Those of us who work at the Foreign Ministry do  not design instruments. That is incumbent upon the Economy  Ministry. We work at trade promotion through the Argentine  Export Foundation.    [Boragni] Are you not concerned about the 26 percent drop in  commodity exports in January?    [Campbell] Under no circumstances would I draw conclusions  based on the results of only one month. Concerning January's  exports in particular, the largest importer of Argentine  commodities was Brazil. Exports to Brazil have grown  considerably.    [Boragni] Is not January's $585.6 million trade deficit a  cause for concern when we compare it with January 1993's deficit  of $136.6 million?    [Campbell] The trade deficit is, undoubtedly, weighty, but I  reiterate that it is not worrisome from the standpoint of  imports. As long as the exchange rate remains stable, there will  be an inflow of capital.    [Boragni] Is it not incompatible to contemplate joining  NAFTA  when the United States and Canada are Argentina's competitors  with regard to agricultural products?    [Campbell] One must bear in mind that when countries sit at  the negotiating table, they discuss all these questions.  Compromise always comes later.    [Boragni] While at the beginning it was said that Argentina  would try to join NAFTA through Mercosur [Common Market of the  South], now everybody talks about unilateral negotiations with  the United States.    [Campbell] At the beginning, we devised the so-called ""Four  Plus One"" strategy, which led to the beginning of talks between  Mercosur and the United States. Nevertheless, this does not  prevent any country from negotiating on an individual basis.    [Boragni] NAFTA offers a huge market but also entails keen  competition.    [Campbell] Argentina has been making headway in its trade  standards. When a country wants to compete, it can do so.     "

In a speech to a Chinese media delegation representing  Chinese media organizations, President Mubarak said that recent  international developments, both in the Middle East and in East  Asia, have brought attention to the vital importance of joint  consultations between Egypt and China for the purpose of  objectively evaluating these developments and seeking just and  reasonable solutions from all parties, which would support peace  and security throughout the world.    More Profound Mutual Understanding With Asia    President Mubarak said: ""Egypt is an African nation, but it  is also an Asia nation by virtue of the fact that it is located  on the crossroads of three major continents. For this reason,  Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a large number of the  Islamic nations and peoples in Asia impel Egyptian policy to  become increasingly interested in achieving more profound ties  of mutual understanding with the Asian continent.""    The President added: ""The economic and political importance  of the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, and the degree to  which they have come to participate in the world's production  and international trade, leads us to predict that the next  century will be the century of the Asian continent.""    The President went on to say: ""In light of the traditional  ties of friendship between Egypt and most of the nations and  peoples of Asia, Egyptian policy is one of pursuing active  diplomacy with most of the nations of that continent as well as  participating with other nations in the search for solutions to  problems which may appear from time to time."" [passage omitted]    Deep-Rooted Relations    In response to a question concerning the goal and  significance of his anticipated visit to China, President  Mubarak said: ""Relations between Egypt and China are both  historical and political. With regard to the historical  dimension, Egypt was the first Arab and African nation to  recognize the People's Republic of China.""    ""With regard to the political dimension, the anchor of these  relations has been a deep-rooted friendship based on  cooperation, mutual consultation, and coordination regarding the  various Arab and world issues, due to the major role played by  China in the world arena and due to the importance of Egypt  among the Arab and African nations in the Middle East and  Africa.""    The president said: ""Egyptian-Chinese relations are nearly  40  years old. This has been a fertile period, full of developments  in the world arena in most of the continents of the world and in  the relations of the superpowers, after the profound and radical  changes that have taken place in the balance of power that had  been stable since World War II.""    Appraisal of the Situation    The president continued: ""There is no doubt that the leaders  of both China and Egypt have their own particular views and  assessments of the nature of these changes and their likely  effects on the issues of international and regional security and  stability in the world as well as issues such as disarmament,  etc.""    He added: ""Recent international developments in the Middle  East and East Asia have brought attention to the special  importance of having mutual consultations between the two  nations for the purpose of coming up with an objective appraisal  [of the situation] and seeking just and reasonable solutions  from all parties which would support peace and security  throughout the world.""    President Mubarak then replied to a question from the  Chinese  media delegation concerning his appraisal of the current  situation with regard to Egyptian-Chinese relations and ways  that would lead to strengthening ties of cooperation between  Egypt and China during the period of important changes the world  community is witnessing at the current time:    Mutual Trust    ""Egyptian-Chinese relations are characterized by a special  nature that makes them different from bilateral relations that  we have with many other friendly nations. In addition to the  ancient historical tradition that each of the two nations has,  as well as the great degree of mutual trust that has existed  between the peoples and leaders of the two nations over a period  of dozens of years, cooperation between the two countries has  been achieved in many areas of joint action in economic,  cultural, scientific, and other fields.""    ""Also, there have been many levels of cooperation between  the  official agencies and parliamentary, party, and labor union  organizations. This has created a common basis for mutual  understanding between the two peoples, which has greatly  strengthened the firm ties of friendship on the highest levels  that exist between Cairo and Beijing.""    President Mubarak continued: ""Naturally, if our political  relations have reached this degree of trust and this height, we  aspire to have our economic cooperation and trade reach these  world levels also, taking into consideration the great leap  achieved by the Chinese economy in growth and prosperity and the  important steps achieved in the Egyptian economy in recent  years.""    Trade    ""These two factors should lead to an opening of broad  horizons and possibilities for the expansion of trade between  Egypt and China, to an increase in their share of the world's  trade, benefiting the peoples of the two friendly nations, and  to benefits being gained from the great technological and  industrial progress which has been achieved by China in recent  years.""    Experience in Economic Reform    Concerning a question about the aspects of similarity  between  Egypt's and China's experience with economic reform and what the  results have been of these experiments in terms of great  achievements and expertise gained, which could be utilized for  the mutual benefit of the two nations, President Mubarak said:  ""Egypt, as a developing country, which in the early sixties  adopted the idea of central planning for its economy, has faced  big problems and taken on many burdens as a result of the  numerous armed conflicts that have taken place in the Middle  East and has had difficulties in connection with developing the  necessary infrastructure for economic development and increasing  its rates of growth. In addition to this, in Egypt we have  experienced a continual increase in our population, which has  been higher than the rates of our economic growth and which has  been disportionate to the nation's natural and economic  resources.""    ""In view of these problems, in the early eighties Egypt  initiated a comprehensive review of its economic plans and  programs, bearing in mind the requirements of modern economic  thought and the application of reform programs in a manner that  would be in accordance with our particular circumstances and  social conditions and the needs of our citizens in Egypt.""    The president went on to say: ""With the application of two  five-year plans since 1982 and the beginning of the third plan  in 1992, the reaping of the fruits of the monetary, fiscal, and  structural reform in the Egyptian economy, and the following of  policies of economic liberalization and privatization in  accordance with the circumstances of Egyptian society by  choosing the method of gradual development rather than that of a  sudden leap, we have been able to restore to the Egyptian  economy a large measure of its activity, vitality, and ability  to produce, export, and provide employment opportunities for  thousands of young people.""    Diagnosis and Cure    President Mubarak said: ""The problems are still not over.  However, the diagnosis has been accurate and the cure has not  been a sudden one. Signs of health and strength have begun to  appear again in the Egyptian economy in the fields of industry,  agriculture, urban and rural development, and raising the level  of services.    ""There is no doubt that the achievement of stability in  Egypt  and in the Middle East would provide the climate necessary for  pushing forward the wheel of economic progress and attracting  investment.""    Similarity in the Two Experiments    President Mubarak said: ""We find a considerable degree of  similarity between the Chinese and Egyptian experiments in the  area of economic reform, in spite of the peculiarities of each  one. The transition from a policy of central planning to that of  adopting market mechanisms, giving free rein to individual  initiative, and having private enterprises, in addition to the  important role played by community ownership, are among the  common denominators of the two experiments.""    President Mubarak added: ""The nature of the experiment in  economic reform in each of the two countries--that is, the  experiment that took into consideration the special social  circumstances of the two peoples in Egypt and China, or what we  call the `social dimension of the process of economic  development'--was one of the more obvious aspects of similarity  when it came to correcting the path of the economy and adapting  it to the new economic circumstances which prevail in the world.    ""Also, the development of the public sector, the creation of  free trade zones, the policy of encouraging foreign investments,  and the development of small industries are features of the  Chinese experiment that are similar to the models we are  following, on a smaller scale, of course, in our experiment in  economic reform in Egypt.""    President Mubarak asserted: ""Both the Egyptian and Chinese  experiments are the result of the nature of the circumstances of  economic development in Egypt and China, and are not merely a  blind response to some plans or advice that might not  necessarily be appropriate for the distinctive features of the  two economic experiments.""    Egypt's Ties to Asia    In response to a question concerning the general principles  of Egypt's foreign policy and its policy toward the continent of  Asia, President Mubarak said: ""Egypt, as you know, is an African  nation, but it is also an Asian nation by virtue of its location  on the crossroads of the three great continents of Asia, Africa,  and Europe. Furthermore, a part of Egypt's territory--Sinai--is  in the continent of Asia.""    He added: ""The areas of Egypt's contemporary political  influence, as well as the realms of Egypt's activity throughout  the course of history, have been basically Africa and Asia due  to Egypt's relations with the Arab peoples and nations starting  many centuries ago and continuing till the present day.    ""Egypt's ties to the Arab nations in Asia are not merely  attributable to cultural and historical ties, but are also  attributable to well-known vital economic interests, since the  Egyptian economy is affected both directly and indirectly by the  circumstances of the thousands of expatriate Egyptian workers in  the Gulf nations.    ""The developments experienced by the Gulf area since the  beginning of the eighties have confirmed to what great degree  the security situation in the Gulf affects the security of the  Arab world and consequently the security of Egypt, and this was  clearly shown during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran  and the Gulf war in 1990.""    Cultural and Religious Ties    President Mubarak continued: ""In addition to this, we of  Egypt have cultural and religious ties to a large number of the  Islamic nations and peoples in Asia, and this has impelled  Egyptian policy to be oriented toward dedicating a large part of  its concerns and activities to strengthening the bonds of mutual  understanding between us.    ""We cannot ignore the economic and political importance of  the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, ties that have reached  the point where they account for nearly half of the world's  production and international trade. This leads us to predict  that the 21st century will truly be the century of the continent  of Asia, which is witnessing the appearance of large economic  blocs.    ""Because of all these objective considerations and in light  of the traditional relations of friendship that have linked  Egypt to most of the nations and peoples of Asia for a long  time, Egyptian policy is pursuing an active diplomacy with most  of the nations of the [Asian] continent on the political,  economic, and cultural levels. For the sake of achieving  security and stability in this continent, which is inhabited by  most of the world's population, Egypt is exchanging visits and  delegations with these nations and is following their  developments with great interest, and is participating along  with other nations and organizations of the international  community in the search for solutions to the problems that may  appear from time to time.""

The committee held eight hearings from July 1993 to February  this year, to prepare the long report which is entitled:  ""Sino-British Relations Around 1997."" At the hearings, many  people of insight criticized Patten and the British Government's  policy on the Hong Kong issue, called for setting sights on  overall Sino-British relations and for cooperation with China,  and opposed confrontation. However, ignoring the facts, the  report asserts that Patten's constitutional reform package does  not violate the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the ""Basic Law,""  and the agreements reached between Chinese and British foreign  ministers; and holds that Patten was correct in unilaterally  announcing his constitutional reform package in October 1992  without consulting China beforehand. The report states the  committee supports the British Government in continuing to do  things in its own way and in submitting the entire political  reform package to the Hong Kong Legislative Council for  examination. The report says: Given the current deadlock, it  is impossible to win China's cooperation by revising the reform  package. On the contrary, such an act will only draw opposition  from a sizable number of people on the Hong Kong Legislative  Council, impair the Hong Kong Government's prestige, and may  jeopardize Hong Kong's stability and economic order. For this  reason, the committee ""supports the foreign secretary in  refusing to strike a deal with China,"" and says the Hong Kong  governor should submit ""as soon as possible"" the entire bill to  the legislative council for examination.    Without the least reason, the report blames China for the  slow progress in Sino-British Joint Liaison Group talks,  claiming that, if China continues to obstruct the group from  holding further talks, the Hong Kong Government will have no  choice but to submit the necessary legislation to the  legislative council so Hong Kong's laws can be revised and made  regionally-oriented before sovereignty is transferred to China.    Moreover, in the ""political and foreign relations"" section,  the report suggests relations between the British Parliament and  Taiwan's Legislative Yuan be strengthened; and urges the British  Government to re-examine the status of Taiwan's office in  Britain and to relax restrictions on it. The report also  encourages Britain to discuss the so-called Tibet human rights  issue, blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs.    Observers here have pointed out that, at a time when  Sino-British relations are already in a very difficult state  because of Britain's perverse acts over the Hong Kong issue, the  British Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee report  will inevitably create more adverse effects on relations between  the two countries; therefore, the report should attract people's  attention.

This was stated in a joint declaration on Estonian President  Lennart Meri's visit to China issued today. President Meri left  Shenzhen for home late tonight at the end of his seven-day  official visit to China.    During the visit, Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier  Li Peng had held separate talks with the Estonian president on  the current state and the prospects of bilateral relations and  other issues of common interest.    ""The mutually-beneficial cooperation between the People's  Republic of China and the Republic of Estonia is progressing  smoothly,"" the declaration says.    China and Estonia reaffirm their desire to develop relations  on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial  integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in each  other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit and  peaceful coexistence, the declaration notes.    The two parties will promote the activities of the official  missions accredited to them, in accordance with the provisions  of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna  Convention on Consular Relations, the declaration says.    The Estonian Government ""recognizes that the Government of  the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government of  China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.  It affirms that it will not establish government relations of  any form with Taiwan,"" it says.    China respects the independence, sovereignty and territorial  integrity of Estonia.    China and Estonia also consider it essential to help  establish relations between social institutions, commercial  structures and cultural organizations.    ""In order to promote the continuous development of bilateral  relations, officials of the two foreign ministries will hold  political consultations on bilateral relations as well as on  regional and international issues of mutual interest.""    The declaration states that China and Estonia are ready to  strengthen their cooperation within the United Nations and other  international organizations in accordance with the UN Charter  and universally-recognized norms of international law.    ""The two parties express their opposition to every type of  international terrorism activity and their readiness to  cooperate in fighting against international terrorism, organized  crime and the smuggling of arms, narcotics, artifacts of  historical value and works of art,"" it says.    The two parties point out that each state has the right to  choose a social and economic system and path of development as  appropriate to its interests and heritage. ""differences in these  areas should not be an obstacle to maintaining and developing  normal relations between states.""    In conclusion, the declaration stresses that the two parties  affirm that the declaration is not directed against any third  state and that it does not affect the rights and obligations of  the parties deriving from the existing bilateral and  multilateral treaties they have concluded with other states.

Hundreds of Palestinian faithful were victims of this  massacre while praying at dawn on Friday last week during the  month of Ramadan. This crime is a manifestation of the constant  violations the Muslim Palestinian people are being subjected to.  It also brings to mind the Dayr Yasin massacre and other  methods of killing and oppressing Palestinians, which reveal  Israel's true morality.    This crime, which has shaken humanity's conscience, is a  warning to the Palestinian people not to feel at ease with their  enemies, not to give in to the imposed existing reality, and to  continue their struggle until victory. This horrible crime  exemplifies the inability of the Israeli enemy to stop the  intifadah. It also shows that the Israeli enemy is upset about  the heroism and steadfastness of the Palestinian people and the  stone-throwing generation, and wants to take revenge for the  Muslims' persistence in bearing sacrifices in order to maintain  the state of jihad and reject capitulation as 'Arafat and his  followers are doing.    The Israeli entity is fully responsible for this crime.  Those who protect this entity, including the forces of  arrogance, are also jointly responsible because they continue to  support this entity fully. The Muslim nations and peoples must  shoulder their responsibilities toward what the Palestinians are  being subjected to, such as humiliation and aggression, by  putting pressure on those with decision-making influence,  providing moral and material support for the Palestinian  people's jihad, demanding protection for the Palestinian  civilians through any means, and boosting morale in the Islamic  world to continue Muslim resistance to the status quo policy  which forces them to accept the legitimacy of the usurping  entity in Palestine.    The Iraqi people, who are also being subjected to the policy  of extreme oppression by Saddam's murderous regime, share the  sorrows of their brothers in Palestine over this tragedy. The  belief in sacrifice is the correct course for regaining one's  rights. The Iraqi people also believe that the foolishness of  Saddam Husayn and his regime in Iraq are in part responsible for  the current disintegration and weakness of the Islamic  countries' stands and duties toward the holy cause in Palestine.    We extend our condolences to all the aggrieved families and  share the sorrows of the struggling Muslim Palestinian people.  We believe that the souls of the innocent victims and the blood  of the wounded in the sacred al-Ibrahimi Mosque will be the fuel  that will feed the flames of the Palestinian intifadah and  revolution and consume the Israeli designs. We call on God the  Almighty to take the hand of the Muslims, lead them to their  dignified status, and make them triumph over their enemies.     "

Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin yesterday met with the premier and  apparently discussed with him plans for the lower house's work  on the budget and economic course.    Similar ""working"" negotiations with Boris Yeltsin, according  to Ivan Rybkin, concerned the address the president intends to  make in the Federal Assembly at a joint session of its houses on  18 February. Rybkin refused to disclose its specific  propositions.    Rybkin ""relates calmly"" to the president's address to  parliament, in which the latter is accused of violating  constitutional norms, in particular in electing the Duma  speaker. ""We have developed normal working relations with Boris  Nikolayevich,"" Rybkin stated.    Indeed, during his first few weeks in the high post the  speaker has distanced himself a little from the communist  majority in the Duma to which he owes his election. Intensive  talks with the president and the premier will apparently have a  greater impact on Rybkin's position than his party affiliation.  The meetings with the premier are especially important: Rybkin  can become the most active supporter of the new government's  economic initiatives in the Duma.    The speaker displayed ""party indiscipline,"" which is  becoming  increasingly characteristic of him, when he supported the  candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora for the post of Duma apparatus  chief. The leaders of the Russian Federation Communist Party,  the Democratic Party of Russia, and other factions of communist  orientation rejected that proposal, saying the Vladimir  Podoprigora, being chairman of the Federation Council's Foreign  Relations Committee, cannot be chief of apparatus in another  house. In spite of the obvious juridical nonsense, however, the  Duma speaker continued to insist on the Russia's Choice  candidacy.    No preliminary agenda for the State Duma plenary session,  which is due on 4 February, has been defined yet. Faction  leaders practically unanimously sent the declaration on the  succession of the Federal Assembly to be reworked. As Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin stated yesterday, ""before the draft reaches  the stage of discussion at the session, it will undergo  substantial changes."" According to Rybkin, the document will be  executed as a declaration without any political, let alone  scandalous, implications.    Members of the Duma Council failed to reach agreement on the  issue of amnesty timed to coincide with the adoption of the new  constitution. Fearing that any decision on the number and  nature of crimes falling under the amnesty will cause censure in  various parts of society, the faction leaders decided to  postpone the discussion of the edict indefinitely. The same sad  fate befell the Criminal Code, which was originally to be  discussed as a package with the amnesty law.     "

Aleksandr Mikhaylov, chief of the FCS Public Relations Center,  would not give any details, pointing out that doing so before an  indictment is handed down would be premature. Ironically, soon  before it caught the BND agent, the Russian counterintelligence  service had exposed a spy who worked for the British MI6  service; at the time it immediately revealed some details about  him -- for instance, that he was an employee of a Russian  military-industrial company. This fact has suggested that the  German spy caught in the FCS net is more important than the  British one.    This theory was also confirmed by report, which was made  public a bit later, about a telephone conversation between Horst  Schmidtbauer, state minister at the FRG federal chancellor's  office, and Anatoliy Safonov, FCS deputy director, to discuss  matters concerning the arrest of the German intelligence  service's agent. According to INTERFAX, the FCS representative  said that the arrest of the German agent does not have any  political bottom-line.    But why has the German side raised the question about the  possible political bottom-line of a basically run-of-the-mill  spy drama? Information received by NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA from  competent sources suggests that it was forced to do so.    It turned out that the press reported about the BND agent's  arrest at a time when BND President Konrad Porzner was in  Moscow. Mr. Porzner was invited to the Russian capital by FCS  chiefs to discuss matters regarding the cooperation between the  two countries' special services in areas where their interests  coincide: the struggle against organized crime, international  terrorism, activity in crisis areas.    As soon as the news about the exposed German spy was made  public, Mr. Porzner was forced to suspend the talks and  immediately leave for home -- to clarify the situation. To all  appearances, it is this embarrassing situation that has forced  the Germans to make ""additional references.""    The incident was not discussed by the chiefs of the FCS and  the BND. Officials at the Russian special service hope,  however, that the emergency will not thwart the already  established and fairly fruitful cooperation of the two special  services, a cooperation that nonetheless does not rule out  classical intelligence activity against each other.    The arrest of a BND agent against the backdrop of the German  special service chief's visit to Moscow may have occurred by  chance. On the other hand, the FCS presumably had information  about the spy long enough to expose him some time earlier. In  this event, the goings-on have reminded us once again that  intelligence and counterintelligence services have always  maintained a special relationship that could scarcely be called  a friendly one.

For us, a  peaceful solution to the conflict is of prime importance. There  are at present two proposals for achieving peace in  Nagorno-Karabakh: The CSCE proposal and the Russian proposal.  Armenia has accepted both and what is more, we have convinced  the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities to accept them too. But do not  believe it was an easy task.    [Luzzani] Why?    [Papazyan] Because neither proposal guarantees protection  for  the Karabakh population following the peace agreement, and it  goes without saying that the documents do not talk about the  enclave's ""independence.""    [Luzzani] Both proposals speak about withdrawal of troops.  Is Karabakh willing to withdraw from the occupied Azerbaijani  territory?    [Papazyan] One should put that question to Karabakh's  authorities, but I believe that if they accepted the proposals  it is because they are willing to withdraw their troops.  Azerbaijan will also have to withdraw its troops from northern  Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Government has, however, rejected  both proposals.    [Luzzani] Is there practically no possibility of a  cease-fire?    [Papazyan] I would not say so. Azerbaijan is also steeped in  a critical situation and sooner or later will have to accept  that the solution will not be found through military  intervention. There will come a moment when it will have to  accept the CSCE's proposal since it does not want Russian troops  to return to its territory. Ideally, international troops should  be used to ensure that peace will not be broken. Russia will  not be able to oppose this.    [Luzzani] How are relations between Armenia and Iran at  present?    [Papazyan] Our relations are those of good neighbors. There  are some problems because the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has  spread to its boarders and Iran does not like that at all. Iran  is also interested in a peaceful solution.    [Luzzani] And with Turkey?    [Papazyan] We do not have diplomatic relations with Turkey,  which totally closed its border with Armenia and it openly  promotes Azerbaijani interests.    [Luzzani] Does Russia continue to be Armenia's leading  partner?    [Papazyan] Russia is enmeshed in a very serious economic  crisis. Armenia is Moscow's ally, but the Russian Government  finds it difficult to provide aid to its allies. Moreover, we  have very good relations with the EC, the United States,  Argentina. Our foreign policy is orientated towards a balanced  opening.    [Luzzani] And with the other former Soviet Republics?    [Papazyan] Relations with the Ukraine are not as deep as  they  should be because Kiev is in an even worse situation than  Moscow. We have very good relations with republics in Central  Asia, especially with Turkmenistan. From the economic  standpoint, I would say our main partners are Russia first,  followed by Turkmenistan, with Iran in third place.     "

Bulger]    [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National  Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as  a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs  director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a  discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa,  to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade  Centre in Kempton Park.    The document outlines South Africa's likely international  orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting  itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise  co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern  African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation  of the African continent in the world economy and would join the  Organisation of African Unity.    ""Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after  apartheid will benefit the entire region,"" the document says. ""A  democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic  ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to  become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the  sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a  movement to create a new form of economic interaction in  southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and  interdependence.""    South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution  mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also  take part in discussions about the United Nations and would  support efforts to ""democratise"" that body by giving  traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence.    The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in  promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would  actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of  this goal.    An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic  community of the Middle East and follow international law and  practice in its relations with Asian countries. Relations with  the European Community would be emphasised as well as bilateral  relations with individual European countries.    Diplomatic ties would also be established with Cuba. ""We  believe that Cuba's right to self-determination is important in  the maintenance of international norms and principles,"" the  document says.    It notes its concern at the failure to finalise the Uruguay  Round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT) and says this could lead to damaging protectionism among  the northern countries.    On the UN, the document says: ""We support endeavours to  democratise the UN. This entails reviewing the brief of both the  General Assembly and the Security Council.""    On security, the document says South Africa will sign the  Geneva Convention and protocols and will be committed to  resolving disputes peacefully.    South Africa would actively support non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    South Africa would return to the Commonwealth.    A new foreign service would be established independent of  party political considerations. ""We will immediately take steps  to ensure that, within a reasonable period, the diplomatic corps  will be fally representative of South Africa's people,"" the  document notes.     "

""We welcome French enterprises to compete in China on a fair  footing,"" Tong Jiemin, deputy director general for European  affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Co-operation, told Business Weekly.    Tong pointed to the ""vast potential"" of bilateral  collaboration in such fields as nuclear power, transportation,  telecommunications, chemicals and agriculture.    He added that prospects are good for joint development  between medium- and small-sized enterprises in both countries.    Tong's remarks followed last week's Sino-French joint  communique restoring traditionally friendly relations on the  basis of the principles guiding the establishment of diplomatic  relations.    ""Our two economies complement each other very well and their  cooperation had its heyday in the late 1980s,"" Tong said.    But such ties suffered a severe setback when France decided  to sell weapons to Taiwan.    Now the French Government has vowed ""not to authorize any  French enterprises to participate in arming Taiwan.""    Last week's joint communique said French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur will visit China soon.    Tong said France became China's fourth largest trading  partner in the European Union (European Community) last year,  when bilateral trade in the first 11 months increased to $2.47  billion.    At the same time China's trade with Western Europe hit $24.1  billion, up 50.5 percent over 1992.    China imported $13.9 billion worth of goods, up 46.2  percent,  suffering a deficit of more than $3 billion.    Tong said Western Europe, in the wide sense of including the  five Nordic countries, Austria and Switzerland, had surpassed  the United States as China's third largest overseas trading  partner, behind Hong Kong (and Macao) and Japan.    Germany, Italy, Britain and France rank among China's top 10  trading partners.    Germany took the lead as its trade with China from January  to  November last year soared 64.3 percent to $8.3 billion. China's  imports grew 63 percent to $5 billion and exports surged 66.3  percent to $3.3 billion.    Germany's lead in trade with China was cemented last year  when Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China and clinched export  contracts worth several billion deutchmarks, including contracts  for the Guangzhou Subway Project.    ""Western Europe, as a whole, is a big and well-integrated  market, which has a sound prospect for cooperating with China,""  Tong said.    From 1978 to June 1993 Western European countries committed  $5.7 billion to 2,146 projects in China. About $2.25 billion of  the pledged investment has been used.    During the past 15 years, Western Europe has promised to  provide China with $11.7 billion in loans, or more than  one-third of the $31.4 billion foreign governments have loaned  to China.    Tong said $10.9 billion had been promised in contracts by  Western European companies, of which $10 billion has been used.     "

Last year alone, Turkey received a total of 1,017 main battle tanks - almost as much as the entire holdings of the British army - from the US and Germany, while Greece took delivery of 725, the study shows. Figures on the two countries' arms imports were extrapolated by researchers in Britain, the US and Germany from the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms, which has been tracking the weapons trade since the beginning of 1992. They indicate that total deliveries to Greece and Turkey in 1992-93 from Germany and the US included 2,822 tanks, 1,084 armoured combat vehicles, 303 large calibre artillery systems, 28 attack helicopters and 14 warships. The statistics were compiled by the British American Security Information Council and the Berlin Information Centre for Transatlantic Security. Both are independent lobby groups that promote disarmament. A spokesman for the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research, another arms trade watchdog, said its researches also pointed to a heavy flow of armaments to Greece and Turkey. Most of the deliveries were made free of charge under a programme known as Cascade, under which the smaller Nato countries can receive weapons from allies who are obliged to slash their arsenals under arms control agreement. Even though much of the equipment being transferred is secondhand, it represents a huge improvement over existing Greek and Turkish stocks. Most of the tanks involved have been US-built M-60s or German Leopards, both of which carry much more sophisticated electronic equipment than the M-48 which has been a mainstay of both armies until recently. During the cold war period, the leading Nato members worked energetically behind the scenes to put some limit on the intensity of Greek-Turkish rivalry, but this effort has now slackened. An initiative to promote confidence-building measures among the countries of southeastern Europe - launched in Vienna under the aegis of the Helsinki process - was quietly abandoned after one meeting in March, diplomats say. Greece and Turkey now find themselves sympathising with opposite sides in former Yugoslavia, with Turkey one of the strongest supporters of Bosnia's Moslem leadership and Greece a traditional friend of the Serbs. Relations between Athens and Ankara have deteriorated in recent days following allegations in the Turkish media that supporters of the Kurdish insurgency which has claimed around 12,000 lives in eastern Turkey were trained in Greece. Without directly blaming the Greek government, the Turkish authorities have pointedly drawn the attention of several western governments to these reports. The Greek government has angrily rejected the allegations, and the Athens media have quoted a Kurdish prisoner in Turkey as saying, in a message smuggled out of jail, that his account of training in Greece was extracted under duress.

""There are so many doubts that have yet to be cleared up  about the disaster,"" Huang said in a press briefing held at  Chiang Kai-shek International Airport. The briefing was  attended by some 150 foreign and local reporters, as well as  relatives of the Taiwan victims.    The deaths occurred March 31 on Lake Qiandao, or Thousand  Island lake, in the coastal Province of Zhejiang. The bodies  were found one piled on top of another, most of them burned  beyond recognition, in the lower-deck cabin of a cruise boat.    Huang listed several challenges to Beijing's claim that the  deaths are accidental, and not the result of a robbery.    --The cruise was first reported missing at 5 p.m. on March  31  and was found on fire at 8 a.m. the next day. How could the  searchers fail for 15 hours to find the burning boat, and how  could the fire last for so long?    -- Why were the 32 victims found in the lower-deck cabin?  Why didn't the four crew members, reported to be excellent  swimmers, or any on the other victims jump off the boat to  escape the fire?    -- Why were only the upper parts of the bodies charred while  their lower parts remained roughly intact?    -- Why were only a few personal belongings of the victims  found, and not all the belongings they were known to be carrying?    -- Why were autopsies performed on the bodies without the  prior approval of the relatives?    -- Why did Beijing bar the relatives from taking pictures of  the ship and reject their request to take the bodies back to  Taiwan?    -- Why didn't the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan  Straits, which is authorized to handle exchanges with Taiwan,  immediately inform its Taiwan counterpart, the Straits Exchange  Foundation, about the incident? Why did Beijing refuse to allow  the SEF to provide humanitarian assistance to the relatives on  the mainland?    -- Why did Beijing bar reporters from approaching the site  and from interviewing the relatives?    While calling on international human rights organizations to  show more concern about the incident, Huang said that Beijing's  failure to clear up doubts about it would be tantamount to  confessing its disregard for human life.    He said that Taiwan will change its policy towards the  mainland, pending the results of Beijing's investigation.    Huang also noted that the fifth round of cross-strait  technical talks, scheduled to be held later this month in  Taipei, will be postponed until the Lake Qiandao tragedy is  properly resolved.     "

[Bayramov] Relations between Iran and Turkmenistan are  broadening day by day and this is a source of much pleasure to  us. As you are aware, last October the president of the Islamic  Republic of Iran, Hashemi-Rafsanjani, visited Turkmenistan and  the officials of the two countries discussed numerous issues.  The visit by President Niyazov is a follow-up to the agreements  reached during that visit and it is being viewed as extremely  important. President Niyazov is scheduled to visit Esfahan,  Shiraz, Kish, Gonbad-e Kavus in addition to Tehran.    We believe this will be an opportunity for the Turkmen  President to view the economic issues and capabilities of Iran  at close quarters and this would benefit both countries.    I have just taken over this assignment and now that I am in  close contact with Iran I feel that the understanding between  the officials of the two sides is much stronger. In my opinion,  both countries are keen on the progress of their respective  countries and nations. The former Soviet Union kept the Iranian  and Turkmen nations segregated for a long time but after  independence, the two countries have become closer to one  another and this is a source of much pride and joy to us. The  fact that the Iranian officials express their affection for us  and consider us a friendly fraternal country gives us immense  happiness.    [KEYHAN] What is the level of economic and commercial ties  between Iran and Turkmenistan?    [Bayramov] At present Iran has some centers for the sale of  its goods in Turkmenistan, which has been warmly welcomed by the  Turkmen people. These centers will be expanded in the future.  Of course, we are not going to content ourselves with trade  only. It has been decided that factories will be jointly set up  by the two countries in Turkmenistan with Iranian and Turkish  investment. Products from these factories will be for domestic  consumption as well as for export by Turkmenistan.    The relevant ministers regularly exchange visits and study  the conditions and feasibility of the projects. For example,  Turkmenistan has very rich mines that yield construction stones  and Iran is able to set up factories to polish these stones and  to prepare them for decorative use.    These stones can be used in Turkmenistan and can be valuable  exports as well. Numerous other factories will be set up in  Turkmenistan and Iran will provide the technology and machinery  for these factories.    At present the Tejen-Sarakhs railroad is under construction  and is a joint project. Agreements on other projects are  expected to be signed between the two sides during the course of  President Niyazov's visit. In our opinion the agreements of the  two countries that are on paper are not of consequence but it is  the follow-up and practical measures that will be implemented.    [KEYHAN] In view of the travels of citizens of the two  countries, what measures have been envisaged by the Turkmenistan  Government for providing facilities for Iranian passengers?    [Bayramov] We respect passengers who come to our country  with noble ideas and objectives and we believe in providing them  with all possible facilities. If their objectives can prove  effective and beneficial for the interests of the two countries,  such as setting up factories, or for trade and so on, we welcome  them especially. Our country is still young but wishes to have  relations with all countries. I stress that if one does not  interfere in our internal affairs, one is free to travel to our  country.    The majority of the Iranians travelling to Turkmenistan have  sincere and noble intentions and only come to get acquainted  with our country and to meet their relatives. Others come to  set up factories and for business purposes and we welcome them  wholeheartedly.    [KEYHAN] What steps have been taken to abolish visa  restrictions between the two countries?    [Bayramov] Talks are in progress on the subject and visa  requirements will be waived.    [KEYHAN] What is the nature of the relations between  Turkmenistan and the Western countries?    [Bayramov] As I said earlier, Turkmenistan's border is open  to every country. We will enter no political bloc. We want to  have reciprocal relations with every country, just as we have  with Iran. Numerous political and economic delegations regularly  visit Turkmenistan from France, Germany, Canada, the United  States, Italy, Argentina, and Japan. We are not a closed  country. Relations with these countries have led to some  valuable industrial and economic agreements. We grasp the hand  of every country that comes to us with noble and pure intentions.    [KEYHAN] Have your warm and close relations with Iran  affected your relations with other countries?    [Bayramov] No country has the right to interfere in this  issue. Similarly, no country can question why we have close  relations with, say, Iran. This has had no impact on our  relations with other countries.    [KEYHAN] Do you have relations with Saudi Arabia and Israel  as well?    [Bayramov] We have no embassy in Israel. As I stated  earlier, if a country comes with noble intentions and with plans  and projects to benefit both sides, we will study them on  condition that their intentions are sincere and positive. We  have relations with Saudi Arabia but we have no embassy there  yet.    [KEYHAN] What kind of economic and cultural relations do you  have with Turkey?    [Bayramov] As with Iran, we have cordial fraternal relations  with Turkey. We have set up factories with Turkey's  collaboration and we have bilateral commercial relations. Our  students study at cultural and university centers in Turkey.    [KEYHAN] Do you have any particular pattern in mind for the  political administration of your country?    [Bayramov] We copy no country's system. We are independent  and we have our own distinct national policy. We do not emulate  the model of any particular country. From every country with  which we have relations, we adapt things as we see fit to the  conditions in our country.    [KEYHAN] Since Turkmenistan joined organizations such as the  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and the Caspian Sea  Organization after becoming independent, how do you see the  future of such cooperation?    [Bayramov] We attach immense importance to regional  cooperation, especially economically. Such cooperation  certainly benefits all regional countries. If we can get gas to  transit through Iran and export it to the world, it will benefit  everyone, including Iran. If we expand the communication routes  among regional countries, it would certainly benefit them all.  If the Turkmen railroad is extended to join Iran's, we can link  ourselves with Pakistan, Turkey, and Afghanistan. We believe  that organizations for regional cooperation such as the ECO and  the Caspian Sea Organization will bring immense benefits to the  newly independent countries such as Turkmenistan, Tajikistan,  Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.    [KEYHAN] How are your relations with Russia? To what extent  has economic and cultural dependence on Moscow been eliminated?    [Bayramov] We do not depend on Russia. We have not severed  our links with it; we have cordial economic and commercial  relations with all the newly independent countries of the former  Soviet Union. But we cannot tell Russia what to do and they  cannot tell us either. It makes no difference to us whether a  country is big or small. We may feel overwhelmed by larger  countries in the same way that we feel no sense that smaller  countries are great.    [KEYHAN] What is your opinion of the political adversity in  Tajikistan? Does it have any fallout effect on your country?    [Bayramov] In our opinion, events in Tajikistan are a purely  internal affair and no country has the right to interfere. We  believe the Tajiks should solve their problems themselves.     "

0,FT923-6967 ,"FT923-6967 _AN-CHUBJAE6FT 920820   FT  20 AUG 92 / Serbs renew 'ethnic cleansing' policy      By JUDY DEMPSEY and ROGER MATTHEWS      LONDON, WASHINGTON   MORE than 200,000 people could be forced to flee northern Bosnia because of a renewed wave of Serb-inspired terror and intimidation, officials from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said yesterday. The upsurge in 'ethnic cleansing' in the north of the former Yugoslav republic coincided with a US report concluding that Bosnia's Serbs have largely attained their goal of carving a greater Serbia out of Bosnia-Hercegovina. The report, drawn up by two staff members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who travelled in the region between August 7 and 14, estimates 35,000 people have died in Bosnia, with Moslems bearing the heaviest toll of nearly five months of bloodshed. It suggests 20,000 or more deaths occurred during forced evacuation of Moslem villages. Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the committee, said he was deeply disturbed by the account, the first US congressional report 'to document the full extent of the horrors associated with the ethnic cleansing campaign being carried out by Serbs against the Moslem population of Bosnia-Hercegovina'. The report found that in some Serbian-run camps 'prisoners have been systematically beaten and starved'. In some locations there was evidence of 'organised killing'. The authors assert that 'systematic defects' at the UN and the State Department contributed to the slow international response to the crisis. As early as June, reports of atrocities were reaching Washington from US diplomats, the authors say. 'The UN apparently did nothing in response to the July 3 memo (noting the existence of camps) and the State Department did nothing to follow up on the information it was receiving from its missions.' According to their evidence, paramilitary groups from Serbia operate with impunity in Bosnia-Hercegovina and are among the most sadistic forces there. 'We believe the death toll associated with the forcible removal of the Moslem village population of Bosnia-Hercegovina far exceeds the death tolls from the bombardment of cities or from killings in prison camps,' they say. 'Unfortunately, this most lethal aspect of ethnic cleansing has received the least amount of public attention.' In the light of the report, western diplomats said a decision by Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, announced on Tuesday night, to place Serb-controlled heavy artillery pieces located around the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo under UN supervision, was 'too little too late'. A Washington official said, meanwhile, the US had received word that Serbs might be willing to empty detention centres in Bosnia-Hercegovina if the international community took responsibility for the inmates. But this presented a dilemma. 'If you do help, you are assisting in ethnic cleansing,' the official said. 'Is it in the interests of the international community to make it easy to drive these people out?' Weekend 'Chetniks' on the warpath, Page 2  The Financial Times   London Page 16  "
0,FT934-951 ,"FT934-951 _AN-DLVCCAB2FT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Chief executive hails gamble that paid off      By ROBERT CORZINE   The consensus at the London headquarters of British Gas yesterday was that the gamble of placing the company's future in the hands of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the government had paid off. Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive officer, said he 'felt totally vindicated in having sought a broader MMC review' than proposed by the government. He said the decisions by Mr Michael Heseltine not to break up the company and to remove the company's mainly residential monopoly by 1998 would 'move us forward towards longer-term regulatory stability and a balance of interests between consumers, shareholders and employees'. Fears of a competitive free-for-all in which British Gas would be left as a supplier of last resort to unprofitable customers were swept away by Mr Heseltine's insistence that all gas suppliers take on social obligations to groups such as the disabled and elderly. The seasonal display of goodwill at British Gas even extended to Ofgas, the industry regulator. British Gas's senior management had engaged in a war of words for much of the past 18 months with Mr James McKinnon, the previous Ofgas director. Relations with his successor, Ms Clare Spottiswoode, have clearly improved. Both sides said yesterday they would work closely to iron out details of British Gas's corporate restructuring and preparations for greater competition. Unresolved issues which will impinge heavily on British Gas's profitability include the question of whether the formula for the maximum price rise allowed should be relaxed. It is set at the retail prices index minus 5 percentage points, a level which British Gas says was appropriate for an integrated company with a secure monopoly, not one facing a big restructuring and early competition. Changes in British Gas's corporate culture clearly influenced the thinking of Ofgas and the government. Ms Spottiswoode said the rejection of the MMC's recommendation of divestment was due in large part to 'rapid changes' in the company's culture. In his statement Mr Heseltine welcomed the corporate restructuring announced last week. It will result in British Gas abandoning its traditional regional structure in favour of five business units. These will focus on: Gas transportation and storage. Public gas supply to mainly residential customers. Contract trading with large commercial users. Installation and servicing of gas central heating. Retailing. The recent appointment as chairman of Mr Richard Giordano, the highly regarded former chairman and chief executive of British Oxygen, also sent a signal to the government and the City that British Gas was moving quickly towards a more commercial culture. The speed and enthusiasm with which that culture permeates the company will be a big factor in preparing the company for future competition. It is likely to be complicated by the company's need for a cost-cutting programme. The DTI decision to opt for early competition puts additional pressure on British Gas to develop non-regulated businesses, including its worldwide oil and gas exploration and production division and Global Gas, which oversees international distribution and power-generation projects.

Regions Combat Moscow and Bad Weather""]    [Text] The changing weather of May meant continuous  troubles for the organizers of the ""Federalism And Interethnic  Relations in Modern Russia"" conference that ended in the ""Forest  Vistas"" [Lesnyye Dali] guest house near Moscow Saturday. First,  owing to the sudden spell of cool weather and other state  affairs, Ivan Rybkin and Sergey Filatov could not make it to the  conference. Second, the participants in the conference, whom the  inclement weather drove under the roof of the main building of  the guest house, started to show marked boredom by the end of  the first day and started to slip away.    Even despite the absence of the heads of the State Duma and  the President's Staff, however, it was full house during the  first plenary sitting, with Sergey Shakhray, who had not been  permitted to quit [as vice premier] the day before, appearing on  the panel apparently as an attraction. The vice premier, who  presented a paper [doklad] on the problems of federalism in  Russia, expressed the conviction that the main problem is a  contradiction between the ethnic and territorial principle of  the state's construction (the ""asymmetrical"" nature of the  federation), and he once again lauded the treaty with Tataria  [Tatarstan] whose model, in Shakhray's words, is quite  applicable in Crimea, the Dniester Region, and Karabakh. The  vice premier also complained that market relations in conditions  of weakness of federal authorities increase regional  disproportions, and declared for regulation of prices of energy  and shipping by rail.    Shakhray's speech provided the point of departure for the  conference participants, who had come, according to its  organizers, from 66 federation components. Remarkably, the  number of critics of the ""May Theses"" [Shakhray's keynote  address, paralleled with Lenin's ""April Theses""] was greater  than of those who went along with them. For example, Ramazan  Abdulatipov, Federation Council vice speaker, deemed the signing  of separate agreements with federation components to be  incorrect, while delegates from the republics did not like the  idea of a gradual transition to a territorial structure of the  federation.    Despite the cool weather outside the window, especially  heated debates flared up during the second day of work at the  sittings of the sections and ""roundtables."" In the course of  the discussion the participants divided in two big distinct  groups: representatives of the republics, who demolished the  new Constitution, which should never have been passed in a  referendum, and those who were demanding that the Federation  Treaty be religiously observed and suggested that separate  agreements be signed with all who would like to sign them.  Delegates of the krays and oblasts (supported by Moscow  politicians and academics) tried to persuade the ""republicans""  not to hurt ethnic Russians, to give up the idea of sovereignty  and remake their constitutions as Moscow is asking for. At the  end, everyone remained of the same opinion, agreeing only that  the State Duma, 40 percent of whose members are Muscovites,  cannot reflect the regions' interests adequately.     "

The SEF delegation will be headed by SEF Deputy Secretary  General Hsu Hui-you; and its members will consist of SEF  officials, crime experts, and representatives of families of the  victims, totally about 20 people.    The SEF indicated that the date of departure for Hangzhou  was  determined on the basis of the views of relevant experts and  families of the victims and after assessing the situation. It  hoped that ARATS would provide the delegation with the relevant  information and make arrangements for personnel who handled the  case and those who performed the autopsies on the victims to  explain the incident to the delegation. The SEF added that the  delegation will also visit Chunan County to (?inspect) the boat,  the Haijui [Hairui], and will interview relevant personnel to  have a thorough understanding of the case.    Meanwhile, according to Hong Kong's pro-Chinese communist  paper, WEN WEI PO, Chinese communist Vice Premier Chu Jung-chi  [Zhu Rongji], who is now visiting Chekiang [Zhejiang] on an  inspection tour, has visited Chientao Lake to study the case as  well as the measures the local authorities have taken to deal  with problems arising from the case. The paper said that Chu  has also instructed the local authorities to do a good job in  receiving the SEF personnel and the victims' families.    The report also indicated that Chu Jung-chi's inquiry about  the case shows that the CPC Central Committee attaches great  importance to the SEF personnel's arrival in Hangzhou, and that  it also shows that the CPC Central Committee is unwilling to see  the boat incident undermine the developing cross-strait  relations.    News reports from Peking [Beijing] also indicated that  high-ranking Chinese communist authorities hoped that a lesson  could be learned from the Chientao Lake incident, and that they  have decided to set up a group to handle Taiwan-related  contingencies. It is reported that the group members will  include principal ARATS officials, and that the Chinese  communist authorities hoped this new organ will be able to  handle Taiwan-related contingencies efficiently and openly.    Commenting on the Hong Kong report that the CPC Central  Committee has decided to set up a group to handle cross-strait  contingencies, SEF Deputy Secretary General Shih Chi-ping  indicated yesterday that the report, if confirmed, shows that  Chinese communist authorities concerned have made a thorough  self-examination after the boat incident.    Shih added that, in principle, the SEF agreed that a group  should be set up to handle Taiwan-related contingencies as  reported by the Hong Kong paper.     "

The two sides observed that the resumption of  the work of the commission (the 18th Bulgarian-Korean commission  was held in 1989), will improve bilateral trade and economic  relations and sci-technical cooperation, the chairmen of the two  sides of the commission -- Bulgarian Deputy Trade Minister Kiril  Velev and the deputy chairman of the Foreign Economic Relations  Committee of the DPRK Ku Bo Te [spelling of name as received] --  told a press conference.    An agreement was reached to cover Bulgaria's  4-million-transferable-ruble surplus in bilateral commercial  exchange by the end of 1995 with the import of raw materials and  consumer goods, Mr. Velev said. Mr. Te said that the Government  of the DPRK gives priority to foreign trade and to promoting and  developing trade and economic relations with Bulgaria.    Ms. Antoaneta Dincheva, expert at the ""Countries in  Transition"" Department at the Ministry of Trade, told BTA that  Bulgaria and the DPRK effected their payments in convertible  currency at the current international prices on the main  commodity exchanges. In June 1993 the two countries signed an  Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation in order to wind up  reciprocal payments in transferable rubles and granted each  other most-favoured-nation status. The DPRK is interested in  the export of raw materials for the Bulgarian silk industry, in  the import of machines and equipment for the light and food  processing industries, in cooperation in the production of  electric and I.C.E. [internal-combustion-engined] lift trucks,  as well as in the setting up in the DPRK of a joint enterprise  for the production of fireproof bricks. In the field of  agriculture the two sides showed interest in the exchange of  genetic material of animal and plant origin and the Bulgarian  side showed interest in importing silkworm grain [as received].    According to data of the Ministry of Trade, in 1993  bilateral  commercial exchange amounted to U.S.$6,343,100, which is  approximately 65 percent up from 1992 (U.S.$3,856,000). In 1991  this figure was U.S.$2,201,000. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK  totalled U.S.$4,282,100 and imports from the DPRK  U.S.$2,061,000. Last year the DPRK remained second among  Bulgaria's partners of the former socialist countries in Asia,  following China. Bulgarian exports to the DPRK comprise mainly  base metals, textile materials, machines and equipment,  transport devices, mineral and chemical products, and the  structure of Bulgarian imports from the DPRK is dominated by  textile raw materials, foodstuffs, cement products, plaster,  ceramics, glass, instruments, etc. In the first three months of  1994 commercial exchange between Bulgaria and the DPRK exceeded  U.S.$1,018,800.    The delegation of the DPRK had meetings at the Ministry of  Industry, the Agricultural Academy and with Deputy Prime  Minister and Minister of Trade Valentin Karabashev. The next  joint Bulgarian-Korean commission is scheduled to be held in  1995 in Pyongyang.     "

We have a certain number of  questions interesting those taking part in the forum and I would  like to ask them.    The first question concerns regional tensions centered  around  Iran. What will be the policy of the Islamic Republic toward  the territories occupied by Kurdish people in Iraq and Turkey?  Second, what do you think about the development of ethnic  conflicts in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and what  is the Islamic Republic's attitude concerning these conflicts?  This is the first question summing up the various interventions  from the participants to the forum.    [Unidentified moderator] Your Excellency, Mr. President. My  first question is regarding relations between Iran and its  neighbors, in particular the territories in Iraq and Turkey  inhabited by Kurds. The second question is on the policy of the  Islamic Republic of Iran toward differences in the states of the  former Soviet Union?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] On Iran's neighbors. Our principled  policy is to have peaceful and friendly cooperation with them.  And should issues occur, the principle is to solve them through  negotiation and debate. Regarding Iraq and Kordestan, naturally  our declared policy is to respect Iraq's territorial integrity.  Territorial integrity must be maintained. The Kurds in Turkey  and Iraq will be members of these countries. However, it is of  course possible in these countries to give them rights, as a  nationality, with their own consent.    Regarding the states which have separated from the former  Soviet Union. Unfortunately, difference have occurred in some  places. Our policy is to help them solve the differences. Our  advice to others, even Russia, is not to interfere in these  countries. In a country where people have been liberated after  70 years, it is natural to have various forms of demands and for  differences to occur. Others should help solve the problems  properly, not interfere, and not weaken the independence of the  country.    [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. If I may, I will ask  two other questions -- one about an issue of great concerns to  Europeans, namely Bosnia. As we all know, there are armed  Muslims opposing Serbs in several regiosn of Bosnia, there is a  war. How do you see Iran's role? What role can Iran play in  this situation? Is it a purely diplomatic role? Could it be a  support for these combatants taking the form of arms supplies?  Or coudl we envisage a direct intervention? What is your  country's position on this worrying Bosnian conflict?    [Moderator] Your Excellency Mr. President. Thank you for the  answers, and now I must ask another question. My first question  is about Bosnia. As you know, a group of Muslims live in this  country and are in conflict with the Serbs. What is the policy  of the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding these Muslims? Does  Iran have a purely political role or a role in providing arms to  the Muslims? Are the other means of aid provided by the Islamic  Republic a form of direct interference, or do they come under  the category of ordinary aid?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Regarding Bosnia. Unfortunately, there  has been a tragic situation there. The hands of the majority of  the people of this country have been tied, but a minority, the  Serbs, have been allowed to commit aggression. That is, they  can have a direct link with the former Yugoslavia, which  supports them. Our policy is to end the war, with the help of  the United Nations and you, the powerful European countries and  neighbors, and through peaceful ways and negotiations. If the  war is to continue, despite the intentions and wishes of all  sincere individuals, the present situation will have to change.  If you, the United Nations and others, feel unable to end the  war, you should allow the innocent party to have defensive  capabilities.    Of course, we have until now acted according to the UN  policy. Our aid has been very clear. It was financial, fuel,  and humanitarian. We proposed to send a peacekeeping force,  because it has been said that the peacekeeping force there is  weak. In the future we shall try to progress with the UN  policy. But we firmly ask everyone to have a just policy. Do  not allow the violation of a peoples' right. This would create  a center of aggravation and disease in the Balkan region, and  this would be difficult to cure in the future.    [Moderator] Thank you, Mr. President for your reply. One of  the gentlemen at the session wishes to ask you a question.    [J.P. Carteron, not further identified, in French] Mr.  President, I would like to ask you a very important question for  us here. Iran's relations with France and Switzerland are not  good. Serious court cases provoking a violent dispute are  currently under way. Your deputy foreign Minister, Mahmoud  Va'ezi, was recently received by French President Francois  Mitterrand. This is obviously a gesture by both sides. Does  this represent a coming together? At last, Mr. President, I  would like you to tell us, how do you see the means to improve  your relations with France and Switzerland on a very specific  plan?    [Moderator] Mr. President, my question is considered very  important here. My question concerns France's and Switzerland's  relations with Iran, which are not at all good. Recently Iran's  Deputy Foreign Minister Va'ezi was in France, where he met  Francois Mitterrand, and apparently some measures were taken. In  your excellency's opinion, what are the significant factors  contributing to the improvement of Iran's relations with France  and Switzerland, and what suggestions can you make in that  respect?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] Very well. It is possible to speak in  length about that, but our time is short here. I think if our  friends in France try not to be influenced by the false  propaganda which is waged against Iranian policies, then we can  quite easily expand our cooperation. The political intent  toward further cooperation exists in Iran. [passage omitted]    [Dumas] Thank you, Mr. President. Could I ask you now a  question about a worrying issue -- Algeria? As you know, the  Islamic Salvation Front, the FIS, is openly fighting the  authorities in Algeria. What attitude does Iran want and what  attitude can it adopt concerning this situation? I sum up: Can  Iran be a mere observer, a mediator, or is it actively  supporting the FIS?    [Moderator] Thank you, Your Excellency Mr. President. My  other question is regarding Algeria. As you know,  fundamentalist Muslims, the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], are  virtually at war with the Algerian Government. I would like to  know, what is the policy of the Islamic Republic here? Has  there only been advice or has there been help by the Islamic  Republic for these groups?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] The Algerian issue must be important  for  you, as well. An unfortunate event occurred in Algeria and the  vote of a nation's majority was not respected. I think it must  be one of the most bitter problems for the champions of  democracy. We think the solution in Algeria lies in respect for  people's vote. I think we have been blamed because we spoke our  views frankly and without hesitation. There has been no other  interference on our behalf in the Algerian issue.    Our advice to you, as well as the people and Government of  Algeria, is that we should come out of this. There is no other  way except respect for people's vote. We are not at all happy  with the destruction and the killings in this Muslim country.  We are surprised that you, the champions of democracy, fail to  see this very clear situation. I wish you would also answer  this question of mine. [passage omitted]     "

There is no reason to say that the Marist  priest and the Assumptionist nun were killed primarily because  they were members of religious orders or because they were  French citizens. But the relentless logic of the  Islamists--which is the same as that in Sudan or  Egypt--invariably calls for attacking minorities, whether  civilian or religious. This double murder constitutes a new test  for relations between Christians and Muslims. And also for  Islam, whose image is distorted by this new violation of the  state of ""dhimmitude"" [Muslim toleration of religious  minorities], which obligates the faithful to respect the weaker  members of society--women and children--and priests as holy men.    There are still 30,000 Catholics in Algeria.[.sup]1[/]  Faced with the rise of fundamentalism, the Christian communities  of North Africa are having to deal with a moral dilemma, as  evidenced by the synod of African bishops that has just been  held in Rome (see page 14 [not reproduced]). They must  simultaneously avoid exposing themselves and being made  ""martyrs"" by the FIS on the one hand and, on the other, preserve  the future and concrete friendships with moderate Muslims who  are repelled by that Islamism. ""It is necessary to stay because  among us, it is a matter of loyalty,"" said Archbishop Tessier of  Algiers before the murders on Sunday. And he added: ""We have  been with them during colonization and since independence. We  remain with them in their anxieties.""    The Christian churches have often been criticized for their  naiveness in wanting to continue a dialogue with Islam at all  costs, even when the latter was becoming more aggressive, even  toward Christians and the Vatican. But rather than ""naiveness,""  it is opposition that one must speak of today. There is an  intransigent line of thinking that is inspired by events in  Algeria, Egypt, and Sudan and hostile to the political  statements of radical Islam. It is demanding as many rights for  Christians in Islamic lands as Muslims enjoy in Christian lands,  and its basis is the demand for ""reciprocity"" that was mentioned  by the pope in Casablanca in 1985. But there is also resistance  by a moderate group that advocates cooperation between  Christians and Muslims in a multifaith and, at the moment,  peaceful context, as is the case in Senegal, Mali, and even  Libya.    If dialogue is still possible with all sincere Muslims who  condemn terrorism and violence, and they are by far the most  numerous and the most reduced to silence, good will in only one  direction is not enough. It no longer seems capable of saving  anyone, religious or not, in Algeria today.  Footnote    1. Algeria has four Catholic dioceses (Algiers, Oran,  Constantine, and Laghouati), 170 priests, 100 monks, and about  350 nuns, most of whom are involved in educational and social  work.     "

The Presidential and Executive Councils of the united Iraqi  National Congress, INC, held their sixth joint meeting in the  INC headquarters in the city of Salah-al-Din from 1-6 February  1994.    The meeting was inaugurated by a Koranic recitation. The  chairman of the Executive Council then read a report on the  INC's activities during 1993 and the agenda of the meeting was  approved. The agenda includes a review of recent developments  inside Iraq and on the regional and international levels with  regard to the Iraqi issue. The conferees studied the report  presented by the chairman of the Executive Council.    In light of this, the following committees were formed to  discuss matters in detail:    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee; the International  Affairs Committee; the Financial Committee; the Administration  and Organizational Committee; and the 1994 Plan Committee.    The Arab and Islamic Relations Committee discussed ways to  promote the INC's relations with the neighborly states, the Arab  states, and the Islamic world to serve the cause of the Iraqi  people and to confront dictatorship in Iraq. The committee made  many recommendations in this regard.    The International Affairs Committee dealt with developments  in the issue in terms of international organizations and foreign  countries. The committee recommended that the INC exert efforts  to ensure the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions  706 and 712, which call for providing food and medicine to the  Iraqi people to alleviate their suffering provided that the  dictatorial regime is deprived of the flow of funds.    The conferees studied the new international efforts to  implement the UN resolutions, particularly UN Security Council  Resolution 688, which call for ending repression and coercion  against the Iraqi people. The conferees underscored the need to  protect human rights and called for an expansion of the no-fly  zone to cover the whole of Iraq and establish a safehaven in the  south. They also noted that the international community is  becoming firmer vis-a-vis the dictatorial regime of Saddam  Husayn and is supporting trends to set up a national democratic  alternative in Iraq that respects the will of the Arab and  Kurdish people to choose the form of their future government in  Iraq.    The Financial, Administrative, and Organizational Committees  studied financial, administrative, and organizational affairs.  The committees' reports tackled financial, administrative, and  organizational matters. The conferees discussed these issues  and made the appropriate decisions.    The conferees also made the necessary decisions and took  measures to activate the constitutional consultative council.    The committee charged with charting the 1994 plan stressed  the need to continue the conference's program and working plans  to confront the dictatorial regime and establish a democratic  alternative.    The plan touches on the principal issues in the struggle  against dictatorship, especially the political aspect. It is  aimed at implementing the conference's political statement by:  emphasizing the democratic, national alternative that we seek  to achieve; by entrenching the democratic experience in  Kurdistan; by showing concern for the unity of Iraq, which is  being threatened by the course followed by the dictatorial  regime and by the regime's continuation; by emphasizing the  importance of strengthening Arab-Kurdish brotherhood and  guaranteeing administrative and cultural national rights to the  Turkomans and Assyrians; and by seeking to create a democratic,  pluralistic, federal Iraq that strengthens the country's unity.    The plan also emphasizes the need to employ regional and  international sympathy for our people to help enact the  international resolutions and serve the struggle against  dictatorship. The plan also emphasizes our reliance on our  people's administration to establish an alternative of their  choice.    The plan is also aimed at strengthening the conference's  initiatives on the Arab, Islamic, and international levels to  win greater attention from the world in support of the Iraqi  cause.    On the subject of human rights, we stress the need to draft  a  comprehensive plan to activate and implement UN Security Council  Resolution 688. This includes the dispatch of UN observers to  monitor human rights violations in Iraq, the stationing of UN  guards in all parts of Iraq, the confrontation of all acts of  suppression practiced by the regime, and the end of the domestic  embargo imposed on liberated Kurdistan and other areas in the  south. Iraqi Kurdistan must be exempted from the international  embargo in order to alleviate the people's suffering and to help  ensure the success of democracy in the region. We must do  everything possible to stop the regime from continuing the  policy of drying up the marshlands and displacing its Arab  Shiite inhabitants. We also demand that Saddam and his gang be  brought before an international court in accordance with the  bill of indictment, which was prepared by the INC and presented  to the United Nations and other international organizations.    In the field of the media, the plan stresses the need to  adopt a policy, both inside and outside, to implement the  political directives of the conference, develop media agencies,  and provide the necessary funds and supplies for them.    The conferees also decided to consider all the papers  presented by the specialized committees, after they are  approved, as part of the 1994 plan.    The joint meeting of the two councils was briefed on certain  aspects and results of the field action. The competent agencies  in the conference have chartered the plan for the field action  for 1994.    The problems, programs, and action plan were discussed with  a sense of great responsibility. Constructive and practical  decisions and recommendations were reached in a democratic  fashion, which confirms the existence of common convictions in  all areas.    The conferees were apprised of the outcome of the meeting  held in Ankara by the foreign ministers of Syria, Iran, and  Turkey. They welcomed the ministers' statement the the internal  siege clamped on Iraqi Kurdistan and southern Iraq must be  lifted, and that electrical services must be restored to Dahuk.  They also welcomed the ministers' reiteration that Iraqi  people must be allowed to determine their future by free will.  In the same vein, the conferees would like to assert that the  continued survival of Saddam Husayn's regime poses a real threat  to the country's unity. We Iraqis, are the most concerned for  the unity of our people and homeland, the conferees noted.    The conferees underlined their eagerness and constant  efforts  to establish a democratic Iraq that would promote regional  security and stability, contribute to the establishment of good  relations with neighboring countries, and foster the economic  growth of the peoples of the region.    The conferees hailed the third anniversary of the glorious  popular uprising of March 1991, which expressed the people's  will against dictatorship and constituted a popular referendum  demanding the ousting of the regime. They glorified the martyrs  of the uprising and the anniversary of the heroic feats forged  by the uprising's heroes. They also pledged to the martyrs to  continue the struggle until the achievement of their objective  of toppling dictatorship.    While condemning the regime's repressive and criminal  practices, the joint meeting of the INC's Presidential Council  and Executive Council commends the steadfastness and sacrifices  of the glorious Iraqi people. In the same vein, they hail the  Kurdish people's resistance, as demonstrated in their efforts to  safeguard their democratic experiment, as well as the gains they  have made for the whole of Iraq. The conferees also commend our  people's steadfastness and resistance in southern and central  Iraq and the rest of Iraq. They urge military personnel and  Ba'thists to abandon the tyrant, to join the people's ranks in  struggle, and to step up this struggle on all levels in order to  topple dictatorship and set up a patriotic and democratic regime.    And say: Work righteousness: Soon will God observe your  work, and His Apostle, and the believers.

0,FT944-11321 ,"FT944-11321 _AN-EKGC8AC8FT 941107   FT  07 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Era's end in Beijing   How Messers Boris Yeltsin and Victor Chernomyrdin must envy the Chinese their annual rate of inflation of 27 per cent. Nevertheless, this rise in Chinese prices is important, not just for its direct effects, but also for what it reveals about the fissures within Chinese politics. With people positioning themselves for life after Deng Xiaoping, these are unlikely to be closed. This is the disturbing message from this year's FT survey of China, published today. Mr Deng's stroke of genius was to approach the collapsing state-socialist economy just as invaders used to treat China's Great Wall. He went round it. The results may not be quite as stellar as official figures suggest, but the country has made more economic progress in a decade and a half than in centuries. The government, albeit corrupt and dictatorial, has provided reasonable political stability, while encouraging economic initiative. The consequences have been astounding. Big problems remain, however, partly because reform has been so carefully circumscribed. As competition has become stronger, swathes of the old economy are failing to compete. More than 40 per cent of the older state enterprises, which still generate close to half of industrial output, are making losses this year. Yet 1994 is far from a year of recession, notwithstanding hitherto unsuccessful efforts to curb inflation. On the contrary, the economy is expected to grow by 11 per cent. Relations between Beijing and local government is the other big challenge to reformers. As the economy has expanded, particularly along the coast, Beijing has found it increasingly difficult either to obtain the revenue it needs or to control spending, particularly on investment. Its solution has been the printing press. Direct and indirect borrowing from the central bank has been equal to about a third of total budgetary revenues in recent years. In consequence, the ratio of broad money to national income has climbed to over 100 per cent. This monetary time-bomb threatens grave economic and political damage. China cannot afford a flight from money. What is needed is a push for effective reform of the fiscal system, social welfare (still largely provided by state enterprises), finance and the central bank itself. Reformers know very well what is needed. But recently progress has become decidedly slow. So great is the release of energy in China that continued rapid economic progress remains the most likely outcome. In the absence of Deng's authority, however, bitter struggles for power are likely to emerge within Beijing, between it and the provinces, and between competitive and less competitive parts of the economy. Outsiders are largely spectators. But they can encourage China to play a responsible part in international arrangements. The country should, for example, be helped into the new World Trade Organisation, in return for a commitment to further liberalisation. In the longer term, only the emergence of a prosperous middle-class in an open economy is likely to produce a China with which the world can be comfortable.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

As the Constitutional Court considered, the provision of the  law on leading place of Buddhism is up to the spirit of the  Constitution about the unity of the Mongolian society, national  security, and has just a declarative and symbolic character,  concerning the provision on ban of organizational spreading of  religion from outside, the judges considered that this also does  not contradict both the country's main law and international  rights and duties of Mongolia.    But the Constitutional Court gave a commentary to this  decision, stating that this provision applies only to  reactionary religions and currents.    As far as the provisions of the law, by which a ban is  imposed on spreading, propagating of religions outside church,  except Buddhism, Islam, Shamanism, and also on organization of  any religious actions on the Mongolian territory by foreign  citizens arrived in the country not on the church line, are  concerned, the constitutional judges recognized these provisions  as not corresponding to both the country's Constitution and  international agreements.    The chairman at the court session, after passing a verdict  of  the court, officially addressed the foreign citizens present at  the court examination, gave explanations on some decisions, drew  their attention to the fact that this is not the last word, the  verdict of the Constitutional Court will be considered by the  Mongolian parliament, it was said about a possibility of  revision by law-makers of some provisions, on which the  complaints were made.    The law on relations of the state and church, which was  adopted at the end of 1993, has aroused arguments not only in  the Mongolian society, but, in all probability, had an  international repercussions. Participation of many foreign  citizens in the court examination, who represented in the main  the representatives of Christian churches, and some of whom  arrived in Mongolia specially on this occasion, is indicative of  this fact.    It has become known from the reliable sources that the  ambassador of Great Britain to Mongolia at his recent meeting at  the Mongolian parliament paid attention to the fact that  consequences of this law would affect not only mutual relations  between Mongolia and England, but also the international arena,  as this restricts the human rights and liberties.

0,FT932-5895 ,"FT932-5895 _AN-DFBBWAGWFT 930601   FT  01 JUN 93 / Sharp rise in job fears among professionals and managers      By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff   FEAR OF unemployment among professional and managerial employees has increased sharply during the past few weeks, according to the second of a monthly series of Mori surveys published exclusively in the Financial Times today. Four out of 10 of people in social groups A and B now say they are worried that they might lose their jobs within the next 12 months. In April, only 28 per cent of ABs said they feared losing their jobs. Overall, 43 per cent of workers in Britain are worried that they might lose their jobs during the year, compared with 41 per cent last month. As well as the marked loss of confidence among those in professional and managerial jobs, there was also a significant increase in fear of job loss among part-time workers and employees with mortgages. Workers appear to have become more anxious about losing their jobs in spite of unexpected falls in unemployment in each of the past three months. In April, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit dropped by 1,400 to 2.9m, or 10.5 per cent of the workforce. Mr David Martin, a director of Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay and conditions group which commissioned the survey, said the latest results of the IRS/Mori index showed that 'fear of redundancy and job loss remains a potent threat to confidence and therefore to the reality of sustained economic recovery'. The 41 per cent of ABs who this month said they were 'very or fairly concerned' about the possibility of becoming unemployed during the next 12 months compares with the 47 per cent of skilled manual and craft workers who fear unemployment. The figures for social groups other than ABs have changed little since the survey was last conducted. However, among part-time workers - 80 per cent of whom are women - 41 per cent now say they are very or fairly concerned about job loss, compared with 33 per cent last month. Among mortgage payers, 40 per cent were very or fairly concerned last month and 45 per cent this month. Social group A takes in professionals such as doctors, solicitors and architects, senior civil servants and senior business executives and managers. Group B includes bank managers, university lecturers, middle managers in business and heads of local government departments. The toll taken by the recession of service-sector jobs, plus companies thinning out levels of management, have heightened anxieties among ABs. The survey shows a correlation between levels of general economic optimism and strength of concern about individual job loss. However, it is impossible to tell whether individuals are depressed about their personal prospects because they are pessimistic about the economy, or whether their views on the economy follow fears for their jobs. Mori interviewed 982 adults aged 18 and over in full-time or part-time work, face to face in their homes, across 147 constituency sampling points throughout Britain on May 20-24.

This realisation has been bolstered by its banishment by the US from the Anzus defence pact, and awareness that its once close links with Britain are fading as the UK becomes more deeply involved in the European Community. Much to its surprise, it continues to be regarded as a Pacific power by many of its smaller island neighbours. In part, this is historic: following the First World War it became a colonial power itself as Western Samoa, a German Pacific territory, was ceded to its control. Many Pacific Island leaders studied in New Zealand schools and universities, fostering links that remain strong to this day. Relations with France, the region's last remaining colonial power, remain uneasy because of French nuclear tests. The Fijian coup caused a rift which is healing under a new National government. Turbulence often marks relations with states such as Samoa, although these tend to centre on migration problems, particularly New Zealand's treatment of overstayers. Recent New Zealand governments have run into friction over aid matters, as they seek to earmark donations to causes that are seen as of economic value to the island nations. The five cyclones that devastated many of the nations in the past 18 months, however, have shown the deep links with New Zealand in a generous outpouring of aid by both the government and individuals. More Samoans now live in Auckland than in Western Samoa. Remittances from migrants working and living in New Zealand to relatives are an important part in sustaining some island economies. New Zealand has always been a trading nation. For over a century it has supplied foodstuffs to French territories such as Tahiti and New Caledonia. These commercial links led the Bank of New Zealand to become the main retail bank in most of these territories. The bank's financial problems from 1987 forced it to sell these subsidiaries to Australian banks. Today the Pacific, including Papua New Guinea, remains a significant market for New Zealand products. This includes meat - the area takes 5 per cent of all meat exports - and fresh vegetables. New Zealand places a considerable effort in diplomatic relations with these often highly sensitive small states. These efforts seem to be successful: despite occasional problems, New Zealand is warmly regarded as its smaller size makes it less threatening to tiny nations. As a result, New Zealand is set to win an increasing share of trade with these countries.  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

He noted: ""Relations between Thailand and  Vietnam are currently the best they have been since the  establishment of relations between the two countries.""    The two countries will have to make joint efforts, however,  to solve the remaining problem of fishing in overlapping  territorial waters. The SRV foreign minister revealed that  officials from all provinces concerned must also sit down  together to work out a solution. He said: ""The sea is still not  calm in this area because foreign trawlers regularly encroach on  our waters. I feel that this problem must be solved quickly and  a new order must be worked out. We must join hands and trust  each other in the name of our mutual interests.""    Nguyen Manh Cam disclosed that the Vietnamese side has  sought  cooperation from the Thai side in tackling the sea dispute since  July 1993, but the problem still persists and has led to the  capture of illegal fishing trawlers. He said: ""We have been  waiting for a reply from the Thai side.""    Nguyen Manh Cam said the two countries have already held two  meetings on the problem of the overlapping area, and Vietnam is  looking forward to the next meeting. The date and venue of this  meeting have not been fixed.    He said: ""Vietnam has some experience in this regard. We  worked together with Malaysia to establish the joint development  zone many years ago. The problem can be solved if the two sides  have strong determination and good intentions toward each other.  Both sides stand to profit. In fact, we should hold bilateral  negotiations before inviting any third party to join.""    Asked about cooperation between the two countries in the  international arena, Nguyen Manh Cam replied that Vietnam,  Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia are working together under the  framework of the Mekong River Committee. A working group has  been set up to draft a basic agreement. He said: ""The working  group has reached agreement on major principles. Only small  issues are being discussed. We can solve the problems. Our  policy is that we must respect the interests of all countries,  particularly riparian states in the lower basin. Regional  interests must also be considered. The amount of Mekong River  water used by each country will certainly affect the others.""    The foreign minister said his country has to rely on water  from the Mekong River during the dry season to prevent the  inflow of seawater into the southern delta region.    During the one-hour interview, the SRV foreign minister  anticipated further improvement in relations and contacts  between Thailand and Vietnam provided the two countries  understand each other and work for their common interests.    Nguyen Manh Cam said: ""We can view Vietnam and Thailand as  economic competitors. Speaking optimistically, however,  competition brings incentives for further economic development.  It is good for all countries to compete rather than oppose each  other. I believe that we should join hands in the interest of  our countries.""     "

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea has been hailed in Athens as a vindication of its long-standing argument that it has the right to extend its territorial waters from 6 miles to 12. Turkey has said that any such move by Athens would turn the Aegean into a 'Greek lake' and would be resisted by force. Greece says it has no plans to extend its territorial waters, but it will not renounce the right to do so. An opinion poll published this week showed that 79 per cent of Turks would support war if Greece declared a 12-mile limit. The quarrel dates from an offshore oil strike west of the Greek island of Thasos more than 20 years ago. The Athens government rejects Turkish proposals for joint oil exploration in the Aegean. The Cape St George, a US cruiser equipped with the latest electronic surveillance devices, was yesterday tracking Turkish warships and Greek aircraft across the Aegean. President Bill Clinton has written to the leaders of both countries urging them to show restraint and avoid the risk of clashes. Mr Mumtaz Soysal, the Turkish foreign minister, said Ankara has assured Mr Clinton that it had taken all possible measures to avoid a clash. Mr Soysal met Mr Karolos Papoulis, his Greek counterpart, in The Hague this week, but there was little sign of a change in positions. Turkey wants across-the-board negotiations on all the issues which it says are in dispute. Greece says the only issue that needs discussing is that of seabed mineral rights, which it wants settled by international arbitration. Relations between Athens and Ankara have also been worsened by the war in former Yugoslavia, where Turkey supports the Bosnian Moslems while Greece has traditional links with the Serbs. Turkey was the only European member of Nato to support the US withdrawal from the arms embargo against Bosnia. Recently, Turkey gave a new thrust to the old antagonisms by accusing Greece of harbouring guerrillas from the separatist Kurdistan Workers party (PKK) fighting in eastern Turkey. The US Navy, in this year's annual intelligence report, described the Greek-Turkish standoff as one of the 'most worrisome situations developing in Europe and the most dangerous to Nato as an institution'. The report says tension in the Aegean has also been stoked by supplies to both countries of new and secondhand ships from other Nato countries. Diplomats said they were alarmed that a hot-line between the two countries, set up after they came close to war in 1987, had ceased to function. Turkey is conducting its manoeuvres this week in international waters in the northern Aegean. About 100 miles to the south, the Greek navy is in charge of a Nato exercise held every year involving ships and aircraft from the US, France, Italy, Spain and the UK.

A Cooling Has Become Apparent in  Lithuanian-Russian Relations""]    [Text] Vilnius -- Relations between Vilnius and Moscow,  which only recently were almost a model of good-neighborliness,  have started to cool appreciably of late. At a routine briefing  A. Slezevicius, the republic's prime minister, voiced regret  that several of his letters to V. Chernomyrdin, leader of the  Russian Government, have gone unanswered. Moreover, according  to the premier, Russian economic policy in respect of Lithuania  is becoming increasingly aggressive.    All this has obliged A. Brazauskas, president of the  republic, to send his own message to Boris Yeltsin.  Lithuanian-Russian relations were also discussed at a session  of the Coordinating Council on Foreign Policy. The decisions  adopted there were evidently quite serious, since the Lithuanian  head of government declared that ""Lithuania will take  appropriate measures if Russia does not alter its decision  regulating exports and imports. One of these measures could be  to restrict the transit of electricity to Kaliningrad Oblast.""    What has prompted Lithuania's leaders not only to ""avoid  kisses"" but even to threaten to ""throw stones""? In the opinion  of certain Russian Embassy staffers in Lithuania -- an opinion  which coincides, incidentally, with that of the republic  government's apparatus staffers -- the stumbling block is  Kaliningrad Oblast, the Russian enclave on the Baltic coast. In  signing the treaty on trade and economic cooperation back in  November last year, the Russian premier stipulated, in exchange  for most-favored-nation status in trade, a number of measures  providing for Kaliningrad Oblast's life-support system to be  facilitated. It was a question, in particular, of simplifying  the fiscal-customs regulations on the border of Lithuania and of  preferential transit across its territory for Russian freight.  Today, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes,  nothing real has been done in this area. Moreover, the  Lithuanian side does not conceal its reluctance to reach  agreement on organizing Russian military transit on the basis of  a bilateral agreement, intending to define its regulations only  in internal documents.    The two states' diplomats are also failing to find a common  language in questions of delimiting the border.    ""Unfortunately, it has not been possible to reach any  compromises,"" Deputy Foreign Minister V. Domarkas declared after  returning from the latest round of talks on this question. The  sea border is the stumbling block. In the Russian side's  opinion, Lithuania is proposing a solution which runs counter to  the UN Law of the Sea Convention. The Lithuanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs takes a different stand: Various international  documents propose different methods for determining the position  of a sea border, he believes, and the contracting parties single  out paragraphs which are advantageous to themselves.    It can be assumed that the diametrically opposite  interpretation of international documents is mainly influenced  not by the sides' competence or even by the experience of the  participants in the talks. The main reason is the perfectly  understandable desire to gain possession of the quite  significant oil fields located on disputed regions of the  seabed. In our restless times people do not reach agreement  quickly where there is a smell of oil....     "

Allende, who is on an official visit to Spain, said the two  countries have different points of view on certain issues. She  told PRENSA LATINA that ""the important thing is, however, the  attitude one takes to solve problems and overcome difficulties.""    During her stay in Madrid, the deputy foreign minister held  meetings with high-ranking officials from the Spanish Foreign  Ministry, with whom she discussed issues such as progress at the  bilateral commissions on scientific and cultural exchange and  technical and industrial assistance.    Regarding an upcoming trip by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina, following an invitation from his Spanish colleague,  Javier Solana, Allende said the visit will serve to develop  further the ties with Spain, one of the Caribbean island's main  commercial partners.    Allende said ""we are working to strengthen our ties, and  there is nothing keeping us from doing so, based on, of course,  the principles of mutual respect and noninterference.""    The diplomat addressed the importance the local press had  given her visit to the Iberian nation, which she sees as proof  of the interest there is in her country. She regretted,  however, the appearance of information she termed manipulative  in certain newspapers which she considers prestigious.    To illustrate her statement, she mentioned an article  published yesterday in an EL PAIS issue. The article reported a  meeting she held with a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official,  during which they discussed Spanish claims for the release of  several people imprisoned in Cuba.    Allende said ""I am concerned that they highlighted [words  indistinct] minimal time and attention, which by no means  constitutes the essence of Spanish-Cuban relations.""    She also criticized a report carried yesterday in the Madrid  daily EL MUNDO that listed recommendations Economy Minister  Carlos Solchaga allegedly made to the Cuban Government upon  returning from a trip to the Caribbean nation last year.    The Spanish Foreign Ministry flatly denied the reports  today,  stating that the newspaper's article ""seriously twisted the  content and meaning of the original document.""    According to EL MUNDO, Solchaga presented a ""secret  document""  to authorities in Havana in which Spain listed several  recommendations for an economic solution to the island's  economic crisis.    In commenting on the possible economic formulas, Solchaga  said ""Cuba receives visitors [word indistinct] recommendations  regarding measures to overcome the current economic crisis, but  it is the government--as the most interested party in resolving  the crisis--who must decide on which measures to adopt.""    In answering a question from reporters during a news  conference in Madrid, Allende said the U.S. blockade against  Cuba is illegal. She added it violates international laws and  contradicts basic premises of a market economy, which depends on  the ability to trade, to establish a business and to navigate  freely.    She also admitted that since the beginning of Bill Clinton's  administration, Washington is using less aggressive language  toward the island but void of any indication of a change in U.S.  policy.

In other words,  technical and economic cooperation is exchanged for  denuclearization and signing of the Non-Proliferation Treaty  [NPT].    Ukraine has started dismantling the 1,800 nuclear heads on  its territory. In exchange for this, the former Soviet republic  will also receive financial support from the United States.  However, cooperation with the EU goes even further than this.    The objective is to continue the denuclearization process in  Ukraine. Should this process come to a halt, then European  cooperation would also stop.    The European ministers in Kiev also insisted on  normalization  of relations with Russia and on compliance with all the  conditions of the IMF and the World Bank -- two institutions  that Ukrainian President Kravchuk visited last week in  Washington.    The relations between Ukraine and Russia are not very good.  In January, Kiev agreed with Moscow on the dismantling of  nuclear warheads in exchange for enriched uranium for Ukrainian  plants. Recently, President Kravchuk indicated that  denuclearization is underway as agreed. He made it clear that  dismantling of nuclear warheads would be conditional on gas  deliveries from Moscow. This month, Moscow suspended its gas  exports to Ukraine.    During a press conference following the negotiations,  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Zlenko told the international press  that when parliamentary activities resume (after the 27 March  elections), the Ukrainian Parliament would ratify the  Nonproliferation Treaty.    EU Commissioner van den Broek indicated that the success of  the cooperation agreement will ""largely depend on the success of  the economic reforms in Ukraine. If Ukraine benefits from the  macroeconomic conditions, foreign investors will be convinced.""    Belgian Foreign Minister Claes pointed out that the  cooperation agreement provided for import restrictions on, among  other things, Ukrainian steel and aluminium -- there are 70,000  posts at stake in the European steel sector -- as well as an  antidumping clause. ""There will be rules for both partners.  Ukraine and Europe will benefit from the treaty. The contract  is not based on full reciprocity: Ukraine has the advantage,""  Claes added.    Claes said that ""the priority was to establish a stable  monetary system in Ukraine to enable foreign investments.""    On Friday, the Ukrainian president confirmed to the troika  that he expects to gather the requested majority (and the  requested quorum) in Parliament to ratify the Nonproliferation  Treaty, Claes added.

This is one of the first trips abroad by the Pentagon chief.  At the end of last year, when Perry was offered the post of  secretary of defense to replace Les Aspin, who had resigned,  evil tongues maintained that the candidate was good in every  respect -- an experienced leader, an expert in high  technologies, and a successful entrepreneur -- but not a  politician. In Kiev, Alma-Ata [Almaty], Minsk, and,  particularly, Moscow, Perry will have to demonstrate his  qualities as a political leader.    The Pentagon chief is coming to Moscow literally a couple of  days after the Vladivostok meeting between U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev -- which gives grounds for assuming that they are  connected not only in time but in aims. In addition to tackling  questions of bilateral cooperation between the United States and  Russia in the military sphere, Perry must demonstrate that  Washington's policy in support of democratic transformations in  Russia has not changed, despite the friction which has arisen  recently, and that the partnership will be continued.    On the eve of his trip the secretary spoke at the George  Washington University. He emphasized that ""all the major  powers, including those friendly to the United States, have  their own interests, which sometimes run counter to  Washington's. We cannot expect Russia or any other great power  to act against its own national interests."" At the same time in  relations between states there must not be even a hint of  jealousy of others' successes. The defense secretary once again  made a high assessment of Russia's contribution to settling the  crisis in the Balkans and, in particular, to removing the Serb  artillery from positions around Sarajevo.    Speaking of the main aims of U.S. policy toward Russia,  Perry  outlined to some extent the range of problems which he intends  to touch on in Moscow -- guarantees of security and of the  prevention of the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the  maintenance of regional stability in the region, including the  states of the former Warsaw Pact.    Special attention will evidently be devoted to Russia's  attitude to the NATO ""Partnership [sotrudnichestvo] for Peace""  program, which Moscow is in no hurry to subscribe to, although  it has declared its readiness. As has been learned from  informed sources, the problem of recycling radioactive elements  will be discussed in the talks -- a problem which, in the  Russian leadership's opinion, can be resolved only with all  possible international assistance.    Moscow's offer of broader cooperation might meet with  understanding on the part of the U.S. secretary, who believes  that closer relations with Moscow not only help to advance  democracy in Russia but also contribute to better understanding  of what is happening there, on those immense expanses.    IZVESTIYA was told at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that the  program has not yet been finalized, and it is too soon to say  anything specific about the visit.     "

The Republic of Macedonia, an independent country and a  member of the United Nations, is deeply interested in  constructing relations and cooperation with all its neighbors on  the basis of good neighborliness and in the interest of peace  and stability in the region. In that sense, we are interested  in a broader development of relations and cooperation with the  neighboring Republic of Greece, which is of multifold interest  to both sides.    For that sake, we are encouraged to do our best to create  conditions for the normalization of our mutual relations in a  principled way and on the basis of equality, as a lasting  interest for both countries, and of a larger significance.    On this occasion, I would like to reiterate our readiness to  sign an agreement with your country guaranteeing the existing  borders between the two countries. If necessary, we are ready  to accept the United Nations or the European Union as guarantors  of this agreement.    We support the idea of resuming a dialogue between our two  countries as soon as possible, without any previous conditions,  on the mutual relations and questions of dissent between us,  including the use of the symbols, the name, and so on. That  dialogue should continue within the framework of the United  Nations and with the mediation of Mr. Cyrus Vance. We are ready  to involve all necessary efforts to reach adequate and mutually  acceptable solutions to the existing problems. Moreover, we  highly appreciate the engagement of the European Union, as well  as the promptness of other international factors, in finding the  best solutions within the framework of the mentioned dialogue.  Therefore, I extend a proposal for a meeting between the  foreign ministers of our two countries in one of the European  capitals, which will function as a dialogue between the two  countries.    Mr. Prime Minister, I would particularly like to express our  concern about the situation created after the measures  undertaken by your government on 16 February this year in  relation to our country. The sustenance and the continuation of  this situation will cause undesired consequences for the peace  and stability in this part of the Balkans, which will  undoubtedly lead us to turn to the Security Council. Moreover,  due to the European dimension of the problem, the engagement of  the CSCE will be indispensable.    I firmly believe that, due to the seriousness of all these  issues and the responsibility we are bearing, a way for their  fast settlement will be found, on a principled and lasting  basis, and in the interests of our two countries and peoples.    With respect,    Kiro Gligorov     "

Tel Aviv and Ankara officials will hold talks on the most  important regional and international issues and the expansion  and strengthening of relations between the Zionist regime and  Turkey during his visit.    The high-ranking mutual visits between Ankara and Tel Aviv  have significantly promoted their bilateral political relations.  They have also promoted their relations on issues relating to  trade, defense, and security. Turkey and the Zionist regime  have reached agreements on free trade, improving bilateral trade  relations, cooperation in the defense industry, improving  relations in tourism, and supplying water from the Manavgat  River to occupied Palestine. The main objective of Peres' visit  to Ankara can be described as reaching a final agreement on the  two countries' plan to supply water to Israel from the Manavgat  River, which is on Turkey's Mediterranean coastline.    One of the main reasons why Tel Aviv wants to improve its  relations with Ankara is the Zionist regime's need for the water  of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Manavgat Rivers in Turkey.  According to the Zionist regime's leading officials, Tel Aviv  can solve the water problem, which stops many Jews resettling in  the occupied land, that is, if that regime can have itself  accepted as a country that shares the region's water resources  with Ankara's support. The Zionist regime's officials are  convinced that Turkey, as a NATO country and a close U.S. ally  in the region, can make a significant contribution to the effort  to step up the pace of the talks on the so-called Middle East  peace plan. That will help the Zionist regime, which still  occupies Jerusalem, to remain and increase its strength in the  region.    That Islamic movements in Turkey and the region are  gradually  gaining strength must not be overlooked. Obviously, it has made  Turkey and Israel uneasy. The recent victory achieved by the  Prosperity Party in the local elections in Turkey is a clear  sign of the strength the Islamic movement has gained in that  country. The issue of Islamic movements has always been a  priority in the talks held between Turkey and Israel.  Undoubtedly, the issue will have priority in the talks that  Shim'on Peres will have in Ankara.    Considering all that, Peres' visit to Turkey can be  described  as a new step to promote bilateral relations and draw the  policies of the two sides closer. The objection of the Islamic  people in Turkey, which is an Islamic country, to the  improvement of Ankara's relations with the Zionist regime has  worried the two sides. Both have identified the psychological  obstacle. But officials of the two countries continue to  promote their relations as much as possible. Political  observers in the region have assessed the demonstrations held by  thousands of Islamic people in Turkey against the United States  and the Zionist regime on the eve of Peres' visit to Ankara as a  warning against Tel Aviv's expansionist and hegemonist policies  in the region.

An overflow crowd of 50 civic leaders and residents of Saratoga Ranch, a  predominantly upper middle-class subdivision west of the San Fernando Valley,  attended a meeting near the Freemans' residence, which was the target of an  apparent hate crime Aug. 29 for the second time in three years.    ""When the community comes together like this and not only expresses outrage but  bands together to watch out for one another, it can prevent this kind of thing  from happening again,"" said Mary Krasn, an assistant director of the  Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, which organized the meeting.    ""If neighbors come out, it can show support and make them less vulnerable to  this kind of attack,"" Krasn said. The meeting drew a larger than expected  crowd, forcing the group to move outside from a neighbor's living room.    An estimated $30,000 damage was caused by the intruders, who slashed chairs,  overturned kitchen appliances and spray-painted swastikas and racial epithets  at the residence of the retired real-estate broker.    No arrests have been made and investigators have no leads in the case, Los  Angeles County sheriff's Detective Imon Mills said earlier Thursday. The case  was referred this week for investigation to the Los Angeles County Human  Relations Commission by Supervisor Mike Antonovich.    There was a similar incident at the Freeman residence in October, 1987, in  which property was damaged and racial epithets were spray-painted, Mills said.    In yet another incident July 2, the Agoura Hills residence of a family of  Middle Eastern descent was broken into and vandalized, its walls spray-painted  with illegible writing. That attack, Mills said Thursday, appeared to be  unrelated to the Freeman case.    ""I came because I was so offended by it and I felt it was necessary to stand up  and show support,"" Roni Birkner of Agoura said Thursday.    Freeman told the crowd of supporters that he would neither leave the  neighborhood nor change his lifestyle. ""Being free has a price to pay,"" he  said, referring to his surname.    The Rev. David Hunting of Agoura Community Church brought the Freemans a  condolence card signed by members of his congregation.

Matilda Freeman said before the meeting that her family's anguish over the  attack had been eased by an outpouring of community support, including help  with cleaning up their house and the establishment of a reward fund, which  contains $3,000.

0,FT942-6585 ,"FT942-6585 _AN-EE3BUAASFT 940530   FT  30 MAY 94 / Honecker: hardline keeper of the Wall      By Our Foreign Staff   Erich Honecker, the former East German leader who personified the intransigence of hardline communists of the 1980s, died yesterday of cancer in his exile in the Chilean capital, Santiago. He was 81. Honecker, a miner's son who spent years in a Nazi jail, opposed many of the liberal reforms in Eastern Europe in the Gorbachev era. But, in 1989, he could only watch helplessly as the communist state he helped to build since the second world war was swept away in a popular tide that led to German reunification. He flew to exile in Chile early last year after the collapse of a trial in which he was charged with responsibility for the death of 13 East Germans killed trying to cross the border to the west. Hockecker was reviled by many as Politburo member responsible for building the Berlin Wall in 1961. German television brought almost hourly updates during his trial and accompanied him on his aircraft to Santiago. Fascination with the man, by then pale and wizened, faded away only after he retired to the seclusion of his daughter's house - a world away from his life's violent political struggles. Honecker was born into a left-wing family in the mining state of Saarland. Both his parents were communists and he distributed party pamphlets at the age of eight. He joined the party, studied in Moscow, was arrested by the Gestapo - as events and political schooling cast him in a tough and resilient mould. Walter Ulbricht brought Honecker into the party's central committee after the second world war. Long regarded as Ulbricht's 'crown prince,' he took charge of military and state security. The top job fell to him in 1971 after Ulbricht resisted Moscow's efforts to reach an accord with Bonn. Few East Germans expected much from the stern-faced Honecker, who had a reputation for orthodoxy and was a notoriously bad speaker. But the early Honecker years, until about 1975, were seen in retrospect by many as East Germany's most prosperous years. Relations between the two Germanies improved as Willy Brandt, West Germany's Social Democratic chancellor, sought to improve ties. Honecker pursued a twin-track policy of sealing off the East German people from West Germany while seeking recognition and financial help from West German politicians and business leaders. This policy, aimed at solidifying the communist state, was capped by the visit to East Germany in December 1981 by Mr Helmut Schmidt, the then West German chancellor. Throughout the mid-1980s Honecker longed to crown his political career with a visit to Bonn. He finally made an official visit in 1987. But Honecker found himself increasingly isolated as the Soviet Union and other East European states struggled to adapt to pressures for economic and political reforms. After the Berlin Wall came down, Honecker was spirited to Moscow only to find himself spurned there and eventually extradited back to Germany for his abortive trial. 'Honecker failed in his political goals,' a German government spokesman commented yesterday. 'His policies caused pain to countless people in Germany.'   Countries:-  CLZ  Chile, South America.

Negroponte, a 28-year Foreign Service veteran, served as U.S. ambassador to  Honduras from 1981 through 1985, when the CIA was secretly funding the Contras.    Mexico's leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment, which  has not been formally announced. But Bush Administration officials said they  are confident that the Mexican government of President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari will accept the nomination.      Can Reject Nomination    Under diplomatic practice, the White House notifies other governments in  advance of its choices for ambassadors. The foreign government can reject the  nomination, but rejection would be considered an unusual diplomatic slap.    Meanwhile, Bush's choice as assistant secretary of state for Latin America,  Democratic political consultant Bernard Aronson, ran into objections from  several Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,  congressional aides said.    The two senior Republicans on the panel, Sens. Jesse Helms (R-N. C.) and  Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.), both expressed concern about Aronson's appointment  to Secretary of State James A. Baker III, the aides said. Helms questioned the  appointment of a Democrat to the post, and Lugar expressed concern that Aronson  had no experience with the economic issues facing South America, they said.    The aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block  Aronson's nomination but that the former aide to President Jimmy Carter will  face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings.    Negroponte created controversy in Honduras as a vigorous proponent of the  then-secret Contra effort; and Honduran opposition leaders, who said he acted  as though he were the governor of a colony, dubbed him Washington's ""proconsul""  in the country.    But he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the Ronald Reagan  Administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support  for its policy in Central America, associates said.    Negroponte was most recently a deputy to Lt. Gen. Colin L. Powell, President  Reagan's last national security adviser, and had been an aide to Henry A.  Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, during  the Vietnam war in 1970-73.    He has also worked on negotiations with Mexico on environmental and  tuna-fishing issues.    ""He's one of the smartest operators in the business,"" a former aide said. ""He's  very good at working the bureaucracy.""    State Department officials said that they had expected Mexican leftists to  register complaints about the appointment because of Negroponte's support of  the Contras but that they are confident that Salinas' government will not  object formally.    ""They will blow a little steam off in the press, but I don't think the Mexican  government would dream of rejecting him,"" one official said. ""They don't want  to get relations with the Bush Administration off on that footing.""    Negroponte, 49, will succeed Charles Pilliod, an Ohio industrialist.

Hurd said: ""We could possibly  agree on broad cooperation"" on the oil exploration the Kelpers  want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters  surrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on  12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting  last week in London.    As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new  basis for the position the British will champion late this month  or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some  form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed.  Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the  United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic  prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands  despite Argentine protests.    Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which  ideally  represented exchanging information. British sources announced  that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means  that London ""is willing to accept the participation of Argentine  companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and  repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports."" A similar message  was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter  Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a  meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia.    Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd  will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations  with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with  Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires.  The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate  with Argentina ""if necessary"" and are moving ahead -- full steam  -- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal  Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order  to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required  legal or tax framework.    Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for  negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are  closely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to  collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil  companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even  though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is  oil.    Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign  Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession,  recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the  Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf.    YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro  quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that  Acenolaza based himself ""on outdated information"" and that YPF  is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the  Malvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to  CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary.  The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret.    Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be  proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive  seismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil  or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable.     "

In this regard the members of the aforementioned gangs  were arrested and 91 kg of opium and morphine were seized.    The Greater Tehran Police Precinct Public Relations Office  reports: Following the efforts of the personnel of the  antinarcotics campaign office of the Greater Tehran Police  Precinct in identifying narcotics procurement and distribution  gangs and the struggles against smugglers, which they carried  out in the city of Tehran, the agents clashed with a gang whose  members had brought large quantities of narcotics directly into  Tehran from a province in the eastern part of the country using  heavy vehicles and advanced and clever stashing techniques.    After investigations were done, all the members of this gang  were identified and it was also determined that its leaders were  not local but were from Zahedan. After continuous surveillance,  police agents placed one of their safe houses under observation  and then they succeeded in arresting an individual named Halim  in the Nezamabad area of Tehran. After being taken to the police  station and interrogated the defendant admitted that he had been  engaged in narcotics procurement and distribution working with  three other people named Reza, Nasir, and Shokrollah, also from  Zahedan, who were staying in safe houses in Tehran at that time.    The agents therefore immediately went into action and  arrested the aforementioned individuals at the aforementioned  house, located in [?Punak]. They also seized 61 kg of opium and  1 kg of morphine.    In this regard a file was prepared and turned over to the  proper authorities along with the arrested defendants. This  report also adds that after seizing 27 kg of opium from a gang  importing narcotics into Tehran from the cities of Kerman and  Esfahan, agents set out to completely destroy this gang. After  obtaining a court order they were sent to the municipalities of  Kerman and Esfahan and succeeded in identifying and arresting  the people associated with this gang. They confiscated a side  arm from the defendants, named 'Abbas and Qasem.    These individuals admitted that the weapon belonged to the  Esfahan police, that they were being sought for buying 70 kg of  opium, and that they stole the side arm from this municipality's  police agents during a false transaction.    In this regard a file was prepared and all the arrested  individuals were turned over to the judicial authorities.    According to this report, following reports received from  the  Hezbollah nation that an individual named Jabbar had formed a  gang and was engaged in extensive narcotics procurement and  distribution, using heavy vehicles and trailers to bring opium  into Tehran from the nation's eastern provinces, agents of the  Greater Tehran Antinarcotics Campaign Office began an extensive  investigation in this regard and were able to identify and  arrest one of the gang members, named Ahmad. In a search of his  house they obtained 2 kg of opium. Following his confessions,  agents were able to arrest three more members of this gang.     "
0,FT933-2704 ,"FT933-2704 _AN-DIQB4ACWFT 930917   FT  17 SEP 93 / Management: Curbing the office pest      By LUCY KELLAWAY   European companies can no longer ignore the problem of sexual harassment. Governments, trade unions, employers' bodies, industrial tribunals, the press, equal opportunities groups and countless victims have made sure of that. The latest initiative comes from the European Commission, which has just published a booklet* explaining how to construct a policy aimed at stamping out sexual harassment. It is based on the Commission's code of practice, published two years ago. The code consists of a two-pronged - it includes measures to prevent harassment from occurring in the first place and measures to find ways of tackling it once it has happened. It urges companies to: Issue a statement spelling out what counts as harassment, making it clear that such behaviour is unacceptable and describing a procedure through which employees can complain. Make sure that employees know about the policy. Place responsibility on managers to make sure harassment does not occur in their areas. Provide training for managers and for staff processing complaints. Set up formal and informal channels for dealing with complaints. Designate someone to give advice and assistance. Make sure cases are investigated quickly and by a committee set up for the purpose. Mete out suitable disciplinary measures to guilty parties. Slowly, companies are beginning to realise something needs to be done. The telephone lines have been increasingly busy at the UK's Equal Opportunities Commission, which runs a service advising employers on how to combat harassment. In 1990, an average of one employer a week used the service. By last year, the EOC was receiving about two inquiries a day and the numbers are rising. A similar picture emerges from recent research by Industrial Relations Services, the pay and conditions research group. It found that a third of British employers had a policy to deal with sexual harassment and a further third were considering introducing one. However, the mere existence of a policy does not mean it is having any impact. Indeed, it seems many companies have policies which fall short of the EC's guidelines. A recent survey by the Industrial Society shows that more than a fifth of UK employees do not know if their organisation has a sexual harassment policy or not. The EC booklet says companies without a policy are open to litigation from employees who have been the victims of harassment. Agnes Hubert, head of the European Commission's equal opportunities unit, says a policy may also save companies money. 'Organisations should think seriously about the cumulative cost of replacing staff affected, paying sick leave to employees who miss work because of stress, and the implications of reduced productivity - all expensive drains on morale and efficiency', she says. The priority attached to the issue varies in different countries. The report is peppered with best practice examples from the Netherlands, where many organisations have gone beyond the guidelines by instituting training and setting up external complaints commissions. *How to Combat Sexual Harassment at Work, available from Commission of the European Communities, 8 Storey's Gate, London, SW1P 3AT.

Tang Shubei, executive vice-president of ARATS, and Chiao  Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of SEF, made the  remarks at a press conference right after their meeting here  this afternoon. It was the second meeting between the two side  since Chiao Jen-ho arrived here Monday. Zou Zhekai, vice  president and secretary general of ARATS, was also in attendance.    The name of the document, or the declaration, has not been  decided yet, the said.    The document will consist of two major aspects: first,  important understanding reached between the two organs during  this talk, including ""to continue to insist on the  non-governmental nature of the discussions and that neither side  should force upon the other its political viewpoints in  discussions of such issues as the repatriation of plane  hijackers""; secondly, visible progress in discussion of the  issues of the repatriation of hijackers, the treatment of  maritime fishing disputes, and repatriation of other personnel  who have crossed the straits in violation of relevant  regulations.    Both sides regarded their meeting as being harmonious and  frank and sad that the gap between them is shortening after  exchange of views.    Deputy secretary generals of the two organizations will team  up two working groups and start to discuss concerned details  tomorrow.    Tang reiterated that the possibility of signing a  non-governmental agreement in the future to guarantee the  investment on both sides is not excluded.    The premise for realizing such an agreement is that Taiwan  must open its market for manufactured or partially manufactured  goods of the mainland, cancel restrictions on Taiwan  businessmen's investment on the mainland and open its labor  market, Tang pointed out.    He suggested that the two organs should discuss, as soon as  possible, such issues as the rights and interests of Taiwan  investors on the mainland and related issues, scientific and  technological exchanges and the sponsoring of non-governmental  economic fairs.    Economic exchange and cooperation has become an important  content of the relations between the two sides across the Taiwan  Straits, Tang noted.    The investment of Taiwan entrepreneurs on the mainland  played  a positive role in contributing to the economic prosperity of  the mainland and the trade between the two sides reached a new  level last year, he said.    In 1993, Taiwan's surplus with the United States declined,  and its trade deficit with Japan continued to rise. However,  its trade retained a rather large surplus last year. Tang  pointed out that this had much to do with the soaring trade  between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits.    Other sides agree that cultural and educational exchanges  between the two sides across the Taiwan Straits should be  broadened in principle.    ARATS will organize visits to the island by the mainlands  news media officials, senior journalists and students this year,  Tang aid.    At the same time, ARATS is ready to receive mass media  officials and senior journalists and students from Taiwan, he  said.     "

Three bases are supposed to be set up:  in Tbilisi in Vaziani region (Military-Air forces), in  Akhalkalaki (Motor-infantry brigade) and in Batumi  (Motor-infantry brigade). Batumi's base will have its branch  offices in Sukhumi, Poti and Gudauta. The bases will be  established from those Russian troops which located now in  Transcaucasia. They are mostly infantry troops, aircraft,  planes SU-25 and bombing aviation. It should be noticed that  Russian military bases are set up in Georgian regions  neighbouring with Turkey which are inhabited by Armenians and  Adzhars.    Military ships of the Black Sea fleet will be placed in  Poti.  The bases will be established till July 1 1994. Their goal is  to safeguard the security of Russia and Caucasian countries  which enter Collective Security Pact.    The troops located in Georgia will be led by Commandant of  the group of Russian troops in the Caucasia General Fedor Reut  excluding 345th landing regiment. This regiment is under the  control of Russian Defense Minister.    In the times of the USSR a corps consisting of three  motor-infantry divisions, units of 40th air army and units of  the 19th army was located on the territory of Georgia.    As far as the 4 point of the agreement (on equipment of  Georgian armed forces with Russian technique) concerns, the  Russian President Yeltsin said that one can not speak about  military equipment until the problems concerning ethnic  minorities of Abkhaz and South Osets are left unsolved.    According to Foreign Minister Kozyrev, the agreement can  stimulate the achievement of political settlement of the  situation in Abkhaz and South Osetia.    However, on February 4 Deputy Chairman of Abkhaz mass media  Yuriy Vorontsov said that Georgian government set South Osetia  and Abkhaz outside of Georgia.    Minister of Foreign Relations of South Osetia, Urusmak  Jioyev  stated that Russia tries to settle Georgian problems by military  way. He recalled recent developments in Western Georgia when  ""Russian troops seized the whole regions and the supporters of  Zviad Gamsakhurdia committed the genocydis"".    Deputy Chairman of mass media of South Osetia, Valeriy  Khubulov said that republic step aside from Georgia and joined  the Northern Osetia. ""We want to live together with the Northern  Osetia"", he stressed.    At the same time political and social movements of the  nations of the North Caucasus (excluding Inghush) came out  against the conclusion of Russian-Georgian treaty. According to  the opinion of the leadership of the Confederation of the  Caucasian Nations, Russia decided to back Georgia to strengthen  its positions on the Black Sea and the Caucasus. This Moscow's  policy will lead to the fact that Russia will lose its positions  in the North Caucasus which is isolated from Russia. The  officials of the North Caucasus say that the more Russia tries  to preserve the integrity of Georgia the more the nations of the  North Caucasus step aside from it.    The day before Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia, Russian  State Duma came out against conclusion of the treaty with  Georgia. According to majority deputies, if Moscow establishes  close relations with Tbilisi it will lose the North Caucasus.     "

A Montclair man's bus didn't show as scheduled downtown at 3:30 p.m. In fact,  it didn't show at all -- a clear test of the RTD's new guarantee of a free ride  for anyone whose bus is 15 minutes late.    The next bus on the line pulled up at City Hall at 3:50. The man asked the  driver to stamp his monthly pass, entitling him to a freebie.    The driver said: ""I'm not late, I'm on time. I don't have to stamp anything.""    Two other passengers told the Montclair man they had been caught in the same  vicious circle on other days.    What gives? RTD spokesman Anthony Greno said the driver was technically  correct. But any such passenger can receive compensation by phoning RTD  Customer Relations at 972-6235.    Or taking the bus over to RTD headquarters.

Once the decision was known, Deputy Rodolfo Becerril  Straffon, president of the chamber's Foreign Relations  Commission, cited the importance of Salinas' trip to Havana.  The trip will occur ""at a time when U.S. congressmen want to  intensify the blockade"" against the island, the deputy explained.    The media have viewed this statement as a clear allusion to  U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, the author of the U.S. law  which bears his name and which two years ago intensified the  economic blockade the United States imposed against Cuba more  than 30 years ago.    Torricelli has just concluded a visit to Mexico where he was  bitterly criticized by all Mexican political sectors because of  his desire to supervise the federal elections that will take  place in this country in August.    Becerril said ""this (visit by Salinas to Cuba) is a  demonstration of Mexican solidarity with the Cuban people and  the norms that guide Mexico's foreign policy."" The legislator  called for the elimination of customs that hurt Latin American  economies.    During the session, the deputy announced the deputies of the  governing Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] have decided  to donate one day's salary to Cuba, and ""this money will be used  to buy oil."" The deputies of the opposition's Party of the  Democratic Revolution have joined the PRI deputies in this  decision.    Three days ago in his request to obtain permission to travel  from the legislative body, Salinas cited the respectful  diplomatic relations Mexico and Cuba maintain as well as the  profound ties of affinity between the two nations.    During that session, Salinas said the ties with the island  have produced an international agenda of cooperation that  demonstrates the importance of existing links.    Salinas also said that since 1975, all Mexican presidents in  office have visited Havana, something that has contributed to an  intense and fruitful political dialogue at the highest level  between the two neighboring nations. The Mexican presidents who  have visited Cuba are: Luis Echeverria (1970-76), Jose Lopez  Portillo (1976-82), and Miguel de la Madrid (1982-86).    Salinas also recalled that Cuban Chief of State Fidel Castro  has been in Mexico on three occasions during the current Salinas  administration (at the presidential inauguration in 1988, a  summit meeting of the Group of Three in Cozumel in 1991, and the  first conference of Iberian-American presidents in Guadalajara  that same year).    Castro's trip in December 1988 for the Salinas presidential  inauguration was the Cuban leader's first trip to Mexico in 32  years. In 1956, he had left from the Mexican port of Tuxpan  with 82 men to renew the Cuban people's armed struggle, which  culminated with the victory of the revolution on 1 January 1959.    The illustration presented at Mexico's National Congress  explained that the presence of the Mexican president in Cuba  will serve to further promote bilateral ties, analyze the agenda  between the two countries, and explore new ways of diversifying  and strengthening existing ties.

I believe the answer to this question will be the linchpin  of  political action in the near future, and for years to come. In  order for the answer to the question to be efficacious, I  believe AKHBAR AL-YAWM, in cooperation with a research  organization, should hold a conference in which Egypt's  scientists and political and intellectual leaders take part in  adopting a ""strategic Egyptian plan"" for facing the coming  challenge. The plan would include a method for managing the  ""coming peace struggle"" primarily in Egyptian, and, secondarily,  in Arab terms. Every party to the conflict has its own vision of  the post-peace phase.    Israel: Israel sees, in this peace, the second  phase of Israel's evolution. The first phase was the  establishment of the state itself; it was established, and  expanded gradually, to enter into the phase of hegemony over the  region. This was proclaimed by Ben-Gurion in the 1950s, to be a  regulation for all the Israeli leaders who came after him, doves  and hawks alike. Ben-Gurion said, ""Peace is essential for Jewish  genius to gain control over Arab money and Arab labor, in order  for this genius to put both (money and labor) to the best use.""  Israel began early to initiate studies, research, and projects  preparatory to the peace phase. Israeli espionage agencies and  research institutions specialized in studying and gathering  information about Arab capabilities in all areas. I may mention  one interesting incident that occurred at the book fair.  Specialized national councils exhibited volumes containing  Egyptian scientists' views on internal Egyptian affairs, on  housing, agriculture, Nile water, and livestock, in addition to  issues of extremism and deviance. The Embassy of Israel alone  bought more than one copy of each volume, to make use of them in  post-peace planning.    Israel keeps silent about ""cooperation in the context of  peace,"" as well as about its maneuvers in international finance  organizations. Despite that, some studies on the Israeli concept  of peace have emerged from the realm of secrecy. There was--one  of countless examples--the outcome of an economic conference  held at the University of Tel Aviv entitled ""Economic  Cooperation in the Middle East, From a Dream to Reality."" Hayyim  Ben-Shahar urged this and included it in a book published in  London in 1989, called Economic Cooperation in the Middle  East. In the view of that conference:    Israel suffers from a water shortage, and the water  surpluses  of the Nile River, the Litani River in Lebanon, and al-Yarmuk  River [in Jordan] are being lost to evaporation. The conference  view was of Israel's ""need"" to benefit from these waters.    The conference proposed the extension of the Tapline to  Haifa; this junction would be 40 percent cheaper than traversing  the Suez Canal.    They speak of developing Arab-on-Arab wars, and linking them  to the Israeli arms trade.    Israel has submitted several Middle East development  projects  to the World Bank, on condition that they involve more than one  country in the region, with Jewish ""genius"" being the key point  of each. The projects included water transport, electricity  transport, the establishment of ports, the extension of  railroads, and a network of roads linking Israel and the Arab  states.    Israel's problem is that the pivotal Israel philosophy in  regional cooperation is hegemony.    The Oil Arabs: After Saddam's invasion of Kuwait  and the fact that some Arab countries supported the invasion,  and the PLO's support for that cruel attack, there was a radical  change, and a 180 degree turn in the minds of the ""oil Arabs.""  They renounced Arabism; they renounced the Palestinian cause;  they imagined that Israel was closer to them and easier to take  than their ""treacherous Arab neighbor."" Israel, they imagined,  was a powerful country, capable of offering them help and  protection against the perfidiousness of friends and brothers.  With the encouragement of the United States, they secretly  rushed to Israel to sign trade deals and get their sick treated  in Israeli hospitals. The Israeli press has even begun to call  Hadassah Hospital the Rich Arab Patients Hospital. Israel has  respected the Arabs' wish for secrey in their visits and  cooperation. Then there was the Gaza-Jericho agreement,  dispensing even with the fig leaf, with the beginning of a phase  of openness and pride in the agreement and visits to Israel. We  began to read, in Gulf newspapers, about the need to nullify the  Arab boycott of Israel at all its levels. Trade with Israel has  begun in many Gulf countries, and all this has begun even before  a comprehensive peace or the return of the occupied Arab land.  The thing that defies human understanding is that one  ""revolutionary"" Arab country, rejects the Gaza-Jericho agreement  and Camp David and all forms of negotiations with the Israeli  ""enemy."" This country got Israel to produce water pipes for one  of its huge water projects, and oil pipelines too; Israeli  factories are working night and day to meet that country's needs.    The Palestinians: I was utterly surprised at the  Palestinians' ebullient feelings about 'Arafat's outstretched  hand and Rabin's hesitant one at the White House festivities for  the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord. Then the Palestinians  began a free-for-all to announce Palestinian-Israeli cooperation  to the Israeli media. ""Combatant"" Palestinian leaders thrust  themselves in front of Israeli television cameras to talk about  ""the friendly Israeli people."" I felt that the Palestinians and  the Israelis were speaking one language in which I was not  fluent--which I did not even understand; that they were on the  same side, against the Egyptian concept of peace. Our peace, in  the opinion of Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah, is a cold peace, while the  Israelis and Palestinians have a torrid peace! As if what has  happened over the last half century was a mere tempest in a  teacup; as if we had just been meddling in someone else's  business all that time. I was even more surprised when I heard  one of the leaders of the Palestinian ""struggle"" use an  expression that nauseated me, saying that ""Israel is an  honorable enemy; the Arabs are treacherous friends.""    The Syrians: Some of them believe the Syrian  presence in Lebanon is far more important and beneficial than  the Syrian presence on the Golan, because the Golan--as one of  them put it--is a desolate area, whereas Lebanon is Syria's true  outlet to the Mediterranean Sea; thus any peace accord requiring  the Syrians to stay out of Lebanon would be unacceptable, even  if it liberated the Golan.    This is a brief look at Israel's dreams, and of the Arab  political circus, which gives special importance to writer  Ibrahim Sa'dah's big question: What will be Egypt's position if  Israel realizes its dreams of a new ""warm"" peace with all the  Arabs, as distinct from the ""cold"" peace with Egypt?    Yes, Egypt.    Egypt today is demanding a correction in the Arabs' course,  their attention to detail, and some understanding on the part of  those who are rushing blindly toward Israel. Only Egypt will  stand by the Arabs; only Egypt will stand against Israeli  hegemony in the region; only Egypt will turn hegemony into  cooperation between partners. Hence my proposal at the beginning  of this article, about the need for the questioner to hold a  scientific conference in which we would call upon Egyptian  genius to set us an Egyptian strategy for managing the coming  peace struggle.    Yes, through that conference we would get a plan for  rebuilding this region on new bases, or, in other words, a  ""strategy for thwarting Israel's plan for hegemony,"" especially  as Egypt has intellectual, human, geographical, and material  resources greater than Israel's, and these scattered resources  must be gathered into a single order so that we need not fear  cooperation with Israel. This proposal could be submitted to the  Arab nation at an Arab summit, as Prof. Ibrahim Sa'dah asked. We  would commit ourselves to it and then, subsequently, enter into  regional cooperation with Israel--after it has withdrawn from  the occupied territories.    I give warning that without a plan, and Arab solidarity with  it, and commitment to it, then Israeli dominance is on the  way--no doubt about it.     "

Love your job? Part of the reason may be your genes, a study  suggests.    By studying identical twins who grew up in different families, researchers  found evidence that genes influence a worker's satisfaction with his job.    That may be part of the reason some people seem happy no matter what they do,  while others have trouble finding a satisfying job, said industrial  psychologist Richard Arvey.    The findings do not suggest that people who dislike their jobs are genetically  doomed to unhappiness at work. The apparent genetic impact is quite modest, and  like other genetic influences it may be modifiable by environment, Arvey said  in a recent telephone interview.    The study is presented in April's issue of the Journal of Applied Psychology by  Arvey, a professor at the Industrial Relations Center of the University of  Minnesota's Carlson School of Management, and university colleagues Lauren  Abraham, Thomas Bouchard, Jr. and Nancy Segal.    Arvey said the study does not prove genetic influence over job satisfaction,  but only supports the idea. He also noted that the study was small, and urged  caution in applying the results to the general population.      Link to Previous Research    Two scientists who have studied genetic influence on personality commented that  the new findings fit in with previous research.    John Loehlin of the University of Texas at Austin said other research suggests  genetic influence on personality and temperament, and an effect on job  satisfaction appears plausible.    Richard Rose of Indiana University in Bloomington said Finnish studies of twins  have found evidence that genes may influence a person's job choice,  satisfaction with life, and frequency of changing jobs for such reasons as  dissatisfaction or being fired.    But psychologist Leon Kamin of Northeastern University, who has analyzed  nature-vs.-nurture research, said he is skeptical.    Kamin said previous studies showed that twins reared apart tend to grow up in  similar family environments, which he said could explain such similarities as  degree of job satisfaction.    The new study focused on 34 pairs of identical twins who had been separated at  an average age of less than 6 months. They were not reunited until about age  32, on average. Twenty-five of the pairs were female.    Each twin completed a 20-item questionnaire about satisfaction with the ""major  job"" in his or her life.    Arvey said the job list was diverse, including research chemist, coal miner,  assembly line worker, computer analyst, machinist, nurse and financial planner.  Seventeen women said being a housewife was their major job.    Comparing jobs held by each member of twin pairs, researchers found evidence  that twins tended to hold jobs with similar degrees of mental complexity,  physical demands and physical coordination requirements.      Personality Factor    That finding supports the notion that genes also affect which jobs people seek,  researchers said.    But analysts contend that it does not explain the apparent genetic influence on  job satisfaction.    Arvey said there are several possible ways genes could influence happiness in  the workplace. Affecting personality is a ""very likely mechanism,"" he said.    Alternatively, genes may influence what people pay attention to on the job,  such as supervision, he said, or they may affect what people want out of a job.

He said, ""in the wake of the  15th anniversary of the Islamic revolution, Iran is faced with  the task of revitalizing its economy. The ROK is a very suitable  economic partner that Iran presently needs.""    The Islamic government was established in Iran after the  Islamic revolutionary forces led by late Ayatollah Khomeini  overthrew the Pahlavi Dynasty in 1979. Iran has been suffering  economic difficulties that increased with the aftermath of the  eight-year-long war with Iraq and last year's drop in oil prices.    [Pak Kyong-a] Relations between the ROK and Iran were  estranged for a short time after the Islamic revolution....    [Zabihollah Now-Forsati] Iran and the ROK established  diplomatic relations in 1962. Their relations became estranged  to such an extent that the ambassadorship was downgraded to the  level of charge d'affairs in 1981 when the war was going on  between Iran and Iraq. Their relations, however, have been  normalized since 1989. At present, Iran's trust in the ROK  people is so high that the Iranian Embassy here issues visas to  ROK people within only 24 hours.    [Pak] What is the reason for the increased trust in the ROK  people?    [Now-Forsati] A number of foreign enterprises left Iran in  succession during its past war with Iraq. However, ROK  enterprises remained in Iran and kept their working sites even  at the risk of death and wounds. The Iranian people never forget  the favor they receive from others.    [Pak] What do you think is the reason that the ROK should  attach importance to expanding economic cooperation with Iran?    [Now-Forsati] First, Iran, with a population of 60  million, is an excellent market for various kinds of consumer  goods. Moreover, Iran founded an organization for economic  cooperation with central Asian countries that separated from the  former Soviet Union and became independent states. Iran is  leading this organization. Therefore, the ROK can have easy  access to the central Asian markets with Iran as a  stepping-stone. Second, the ROK can secure the source of stable  oil supply based on amicable relations with Iran. Third, only  Iran has become the nation where rich experiences of the ROK  enterprises can be put to practical use in the Middle East.    [Pak] What is the degree of Iran's present economic exchange  with the ROK?    [Now-Forsati] The volume of annual trade between Iran and  the ROK reaches $2 billion. ROK enterprises, including Daewoo,  Daelim, Samsung, Ssangyong, Sinhwa, and Hyundai, are engaged in  the construction of roads, an oil pipeline, power stations, and  chemical and textile plants, throughout Iran.    [Pak] What is the position of Iran on the peace negotiations  between Israel and Palestine?    [Now-Forsati] We are opposed to such changes as seen  today. The PLO does not reflect the will of all the Palestinian  people. [end Now-Forsati]    Ambassador Now-Forsati said that it is curious that just as  the price of land in Seoul's Tehran Street has increased  exorbitantly, that of Tehran's Seoul Street has also drastically  increased.

While China's understanding  of North Korea and its aid to the latter are indispensable for  North Korea that is now beset with the nuclear issue and food  shortages, China's maintenance of its influence on North Korea  is an important card for China to play in diplomatic  negotiations with Western nations, especially the United States.  China-North Korea relations, that were once chilled by the  establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South  Korea, are now moving toward improvement because of the  coincidence of their interests and their policies on the  ""nuclear"" issue and the complex international situation.    At one time, North Korea went so far as to criticize China  as  a revisionist and betrayer, but their relations appear to have  normalized completely. As South Korean Ambassador to China  Whang Pyung-tae explicitly stated in Seoul on 2 February,  China-North Korea relations have improved substantially.    A visit by Whang Chang-yop, secretary of the Workers' Party  of Korea (chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly Foreign  Affairs Committee) to China from mid-January to late January  illustrated their improved relations. Mr. Whang was the  highest-ranking North Korean official to visit China since  August 1993, when China and South Korea established diplomatic  relations. According to an informed source, Mr. Whang visited  China in response to President Kim Il-song's intention to  rebuild friendly relations with China.    At a meeting with Mr. Whang and his entourage, General  Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed the ""friendship forged with  blood."" This expression is a barometer to gauge the  friendliness of relations between the two countries and the  expression has not been used since China and South Korea  established diplomatic relations.    There are two reasons North Korea has decided to improve  relations with China. First, China has persistently opposed any  pressure or sanctions on North Korea. North Korea has no reason  to see the Chinese attitude as negative.    Second, North Korea, which has been beset with economic  stagnation and sluggish growth in food production, is in a  situation where it is badly in need of China's aid. South  Korean Ambassador Whang made it clear that ""China is not asking  North Korea to pay its imports from China in foreign currency as  it has done in the past"" out of consideration to North Korea.    According to the same source, North Korea is expected to  strongly ask China for food aid and it is highly possible that  President Kim Il-song and his son Secretary Kim Chong-il will  visit China this year.    As for the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear  development, China believes that North Korea has no capability  to develop nuclear weapons even if it intends to do so. China  also considers the issue a very important agenda item in  dialogue with Japan, the United States, and South Korea. It is  unclear how much influence China holds over North Korea, but it  is true that China is giving a great deal of consideration to  North Korea in an attempt to secure its influence over North  Korea. As an example, General Secretary Jiang Zemin has  decided to defer his planned visit to South Korea despite South  Korea's strong wish for his early visit.     "

0,FT941-16418 ,"FT941-16418 _AN-EAKC0AADFT 940111   FT  11 JAN 94 / Ukraine agrees to removal of nuclear missiles: 'Hopeful and historic' deal to go before Kiev parliament in the spring      By JUREK MARTIN and JOHN LLOYD      BRUSSELS, MOSCOW   The US, Russia and Ukraine have reached agreement on the removal of all former Soviet nuclear missiles from Ukrainian territory, President Bill Clinton announced last night. The US president will stop briefly in Kiev tomorrow night to talk to President Leonid Kravchuk, who will then join Mr Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday to initial the agreement. An ebullient Mr Clinton described the settlement as 'hopeful and historic' and, along with the Nato summit's endorsement yesterday of closer co-operation with former Warsaw Pact nations, as 'two breakthroughs for peace'. He was speaking in Brussels at the end of the first day of a summit otherwise overshadowed by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, over which Mr Clinton warned European allies yesterday that Nato must be ready to carry out threats of military action or risk the credibility of the alliance. On the Ukraine missiles deal, the president was confident that Mr Kravchuk could carry the Ukrainian parliament with him, but this remains a big stumbling block. Last year the legislature added sufficient conditions and demands to an earlier agreement to render it unacceptable to the US. Mr Kravchuk will submit this agreement, together with the Start and Nuclear non-proliferation treaties already approved, to the new parliament after elections in March. The deal, if agreed there, would remove one of the largest sources of potential instability in the former Soviet Union. However, in Kiev last night officials urged caution, suggesting that the final terms of the accord had yet to be determined. Mr Kravchuk has a history of appearing to agree on key issues with Russia, then revising the terms of the agreement later. Relations between Ukraine and Russia worsened last year after an agreement in principle on the handing over to Russia of the Black Sea Fleet was later repudiated by Mr Kravchuk. Both Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, his secretary of state, argued that Ukraine would benefit from the missiles agreement - not only in the form of financial payments from the US, but also because its territorial integrity had now been guaranteed by the US and Russia, its powerful neighbour. The agreement enables Mr Clinton to claim a substantial foreign policy victory in a field - nuclear non-proliferation - to which he has accorded high priority. Kazakhstan and Belarus, the other two former Soviet republics with nuclear missiles, have already given them up. US officials said the 'framework' agreement to deactivate nearly 1,800 warheads and 175 intercontinental ballistic missiles now based in Ukraine - all aimed at the US - could see the first transfers of warheads to Russia begin in the spring. The process is expected to take seven years. Ukraine will receive 'somewhat more' than the Dollars 175m (Pounds 118m) already on offer from the Nunn-Lugar programme which helps states dismantle their nuclear capabilities. Additionally the US will buy enriched uranium extracted from the missiles under the existing Dollars 12bn, 20-year understanding with Russia. It will then be reprocessed and resold on a commercial basis.

However, Kim warned that the  United States is mistaken if it thinks that through pressure and  coercion it can bring the DPRK to its knees.    The above was said by DPRK President Kim Il-song in an  exclusive interview with PRENSA LATINA at the Government Palace.    In a lengthy two-hour interview, Kim Il-song talked about  the  tense situation currently experienced in the DPRK, its relations  with China and other countries, foreign investments, and the  prospects for the country's reunification. Kim also spoke  fondly of the DPRK's relations with Cuba and President Fidel  Castro.    In Pyongyang, one can sense calm. The tall and modern  buildings and wide avenues welcome a sunny spring.    Taking care of the flowers, the April Festival, and the  celebrations to mark the 82d birthday of the ""great leader,"" as  the Koreans call Kim Il-song, mark the spirit of these days in  Pyongyang.    One does not get a sense of a war-like atmosphere in some  areas of the Korean countryside. The peasants work the land,  grow rice, and the industries continue operating.    An energetic and calm speaker, the president greets us in  the  august dignity of the Great Hall of the Government Palace. Kim  Il-song answers our questions openly and very lucidly.    ""We have no intentions, nor are we capable of producing  nuclear weapons. We do not need to produce them, and even if we  did produce one or two, that would make no sense [eso no tendria  ningun sentido]. Our government invariably makes efforts to  ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" Kim said.    Kim explained that this problem began with the introduction  of nuclear weapons in South Korea by the United States. The  United States deployed a large number of these weapons to  maintain the southern part of the country under its control, to  confront our country, and to implement its aggressive strategy  in the Asia-Pacific region.    Kim Il-song believes the nuclear problem on the Korean  peninsula began with the hostile U.S. policy toward his country,  and, therefore, it must be resolved in bilateral negotiations.    Considering that in recent years the Cold War ended  worldwide  and North and South Korea have signed nonaggression agreements  and a joint declaration on denuclearization of the peninsula,  there is no justification for the United States to continue  maintaining its nuclear arms in the South, the president pointed  out.    The veteran Korean leader led the anti-Japanese struggle in  the 1930's, which culminated with the antifascist victory after  the monumental battles of 1945.    Years later, from 1950 to 1953, he confronted the invasion  of  Korean territory by the United States and its allies. Fierce  battles were waged and the country was virtually destroyed. The  38th Parallel and Panmunjom became fixed in the memory of  humanity through persistent anticommunist propaganda that  depicted U.S. citizens as defenders of noble ideals.    Later, the reconstruction of the country began under the  leadership of Kim Il-song. Cities were rebuilt, including  Pyongyang, which had been razed. Industry was constructed and  agriculture reestablished.    Today Korea is a country of 23 million inhabitants which has  eradicated poverty.    That same man, who has a great deal of history in his  background, now explains that ""in order to not lose the control  they now have over South Korea and to crush our republic, the  North Americans are seeking another pretext and spreading  groundless nuclear insinuations to intentionally worsen the  situation."" South Korean authorities have joined this nuclear  scandal and are acting hysterically to provoke a new war.    The United States has distorted what was agreed with us, he  said. It provoked the break in the talks and, by mobilizing  international organizations to exert pressure on Korea, it  worsened the situation to the extreme, he added.    Kim Il-song firmly stated that pressure and coercion can  never be the method to resolve problems.    The United States is mistaken if it thinks that through  pressure and coercion it can bring our people to their knees,  because they value independence as they value their own lives.    If it becomes obstinate in pressuring our republic, we will  be forced to adopt legitimate self-defense measures to safeguard  the nation's dignity and sovereignty.    During the interview, the paramount Korean leader  reiterated that the unwavering position of Democratic Korea is  to resolve the nuclear problem through dialogue. Whether it can  be resolved through peaceful means depends entirely on the  United States, which must cease its clumsy international  pressure against our republic and adopt a trustworthy position,  he added.    International organizations should not support the unjust  demands of this power (the United States); instead, they should  endorse solutions to the problem, Kim Il-song stressed.    Foreign Relations    Korea wants to maintain good relations with its neighbors.  With China, relations are good; with Japan, they are hostile.  The traditional friendship between Korea and China continues to  develop. The Japanese Government has maintained unalterable  hostility, and if an unexpected incident takes place here, it  would not bode well for Japan, he said.    When dealing with international relations, the paramount  leader of the DPRK confirmed that his government's foreign  policy is based on the ideals of independence, peace, and  friendship. He said Korea hopes to foster cooperation with  socialist and nonaligned nations and to establish links with  capitalist nations that respect its sovereignty.    Korea opposes all types of domination and submission, and it  attributes a great deal of importance to linking itself  peacefully to nearby nations, ""some of which, he indicated, get  along well with us, while others do not."" With China we have  good relations.'' Korea and China are neighbors, separated by  rivers, and their peoples are beloved comrades in arms and  brothers who struggle for a common cause. Resolutely united,  they have struggled and shed their blood in the fight against  imperialism. They have been supporting and cooperating with  each other in their efforts for socialism.'' [quotation marks as  received]    The president explained that the traditional friendship  between Korea and China continues to develop in the political,  economic, and cultural fields because of joint efforts of the  two nations' government parties and peoples.    In terms of Japan, he indicated that, on the contrary,  normal  relations have not been established between the two nations  because the Japanese Government has maintained a policy of  unalterable hostility. In recent times, it has played into the  hands of the United States in its conspiracy against Korea,  thereby undermining the resolution of the nuclear problem on the  peninsula. It is attempting to realize its dirty political and  military ambitions. He warned: ""If the situation worsens here  and an unexpected event takes place, this would not bode well  for Japan. The Japanese Government should look at the reality  of the situation and act with moderation.""    As for economic relations with other countries, he  explained that they are being expanded and developed not only  through trade but also through other means such as joint  administration and cooperation, which helps build the economy  and follows the trend of international economic cooperation.    He said that a foreign investment law and other laws have  been established in the DPRK to encourage foreign investment in  the republic. All of these measures are based on the principles  of complete equality and mutual benefit, protection of the  foreign businesses, and safeguard of the foreign businesses'  legitimate rights and interests.    Kim Il-song explained that the Rajin-Sonbong zone has been  created as a center for free trade and a free economy, where a  better environment and better conditions for investors are  promoted. It is located on the border with China and Russia. It  has great potential because of its advantageous economic and  geographic conditions. Many countries want to invest in the  Rajin-Sonbong zone, and the government of the republic has its  doors open to foreign investors, he indicated.    The Reunification of Korea    Our people face great difficulties and obstacles for the  reunification of the fatherland, but the prospect is viewed  optimistically, President Kim Il-song said.    The paramount leader of the DPRK explained that every effort  is being made to undertake at all costs this historic task in  the 1990's.    Last year, the ""10-Point Program of the Great Pannational  Unity for the Reunification of the Fatherland"" was presented.  It unanimously reflects the aspirations of all fellow  countrymen in the North, South, and overseas to achieve  reintegration and national prosperity, above differences of  ideology and regime.    Nevertheless, he said, the South Korean authorities ignored  that aspiration of the entire nation, following a path of  submission to foreign forces and of confrontation with the  North. The current ""power"" in South Korea is a servile and a  turncoat power, which faithfully follows the foreign forces.    The president indicated his people face great difficulties  in  their struggle for the reunification of the fatherland, but they  are optimistic about the prospects for this task. ""The forces in  favor of reunification irreversibly will overcome and defeat the  separatists.""    The so-called Korean war began on 25 June 1950 when South  Korean Army troops launched, with the support of the United  States, an invasion into the northern region of the peninsula  where the DPRK was established in 1945, after having defeated  the fascist Japanese Army. The response by the North was strong  and the North's military units occupied Seoul.    The United States directly involved itself in the conflict  to  save its about-to-be-defeated allies. Three years of war went  by. This aggressor, the Yankee army, suffered 405,998  casualties; the puppet South Korean Army suffered 1.1 million  casualties; and countries that were allies of the United States  in this war suffered more than 30,000 casualties. Much of North  Korea was virtually destroyed. The war ended on 27 July 1953.  The United States was unable to occupy the North. The country  remained divided. Forty years have gone by since the war ended.  The North has been totally reconstructed and prosperity is  tangible.    President Kim Il-song continued: Now, considering that there  are ideologic differences and different social regimes in the  North and South, we have drawn a more rational path for the  reunification of the fatherland. Our proposal is to unite in a  confederated state that features two regimes and two governments.    He said this proposal is fair and realistic and permits an  expeditious reunification of the country in an independent and  peaceful way, without either side defeating the other. After  its reunification, Korea will function as a neutral nation  without becoming a satellite of any other nation and without  participating in any military alliance or political bloc.    Total Support and Solidarity for the Cuban People    The Korean president expressed high esteem, total support,  and firm solidarity with the Cuban people who are honorably  fulfilling the strategic tasks of the ""special peacetime period.""    From the very start of the interview, the veteran leader,  who  for more than 60 years has worked for the national liberation of  his nation, asked about President Fidel Castro and Revolutionary  Armed Forces Minister Raul Castro, both of whom he characterized  as brothers-in-arms and for whom he expressed high regards.    ""Even today--he indicated--I recall our 1986 encounter with  Fidel Castro, which took place in Pyongyang. It was the first  historically significant meeting, which we had been both  pursuing for some time. We were able to talk for several hours  in a climate of camaraderie. The leaders of the two countries  were able to review diverse issues of common interest, including  the possibility of increasing and promoting relations of  friendship and cooperation.""    That visit left an unforgettable and profound impression on  both nations, and from then on our relations attained new  momentum.    The DPRK and Cuba are separated by oceans and continents,  and  yet their respective peoples retain friendly ties as if they  were neighbors. This is the friendly pugnacity of brothers of  similar mettle who are struggling against imperialism and for  the victory of socialism. Our friendship is genuine and solid  because it is based on revolutionary principles and moral  camaraderie, Kim Il-song stated.    He stipulated: ""Complex and unexpected events have appeared  on the international scene, and yet the links of friendship and  cooperation between both nations continue to develop without  changes in accordance with what was agreed upon during the two  leaders' meetings. These ties remain steadfast amid this  traumatic historical phase, which is decisive for the future of  socialism. [no closing quotation marks as received]    In reference to the critical times the island is facing, Kim  Il-song pointed out that the Cuban people are firmly defending  their role as the vanguard of socialism in the Western  Hemisphere amid difficult conditions under which the  imperialists are relentlessly pursuing all sorts of schemes to  isolate and destroy it.    In this respect, he indicated: ""Our people have high regard  and express their total support, as well as their firm  solidarity, for our Cuban brothers who are honorably carrying  out the strategic tasks of the special period during times of  peace, and who are singularly united around the Communist Party  led by Comrade Fidel Castro. [no closing quotation marks as  received]    In the future, the Korean people will do everything within  their power to bolster relations with their Cuban brothers.    Kim Il-song concluded the interview by sending friendly  greetings to the Cuban people and expressing his hope for  greater successes in the struggle to safeguard the independence,  sovereignty, and development of socialism.

Aleksandrov: ""Russia Is Again Being Taught  How To Live""]    [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has made  a statement in Congress which as so far failed to attract the  attention in our country which it undoubtedly deserves.    The statement is about Russia and its relations with the  countries of nearby foreign parts. Acknowledging that the  concern expressed by Moscow over the position of the 25 million  Russian-speaking citizens living outside Russia in the countries  of the former Union should not be considered ""unnatural,"" the  secretary of state nonetheless made it extremely clear that  concern is one thing but attempts to resolve effectively the  many problems which the Russian-speaking population are  encountering in the Baltic states, for instance, is something  quite different. These attempts, it emerges from Christopher's  statements, cannot be made except with the consent and even the  authorization of international institutes and forums and best of  all with the agreement of the United States itself.    There is no denying that what Moscow undertakes should, as  Christopher notes, accord with the letter and spirit of  international laws. But another of the secretary of state's  important premises cannot fail to give rise to dispute and keen  doubt: Even in those situations where a request is made to  Moscow by those countries of the former Union ""where Russian  troops are deployed and the request is for help in safeguarding  and preserving peace, Russia cannot respond unilateral to such  requests but only in some kind of cooperation with the United  Nations or, for instance, the CSCE,"" Christopher stated.  Russians, the chief U.S. diplomat repeated, have the right to  appeal to adjacent states ""to be concerned for the position of  Russian-speaking citizens and to display generosity with regard  to them but the United States will resolutely oppose Moscow's  adoption of any powerful steps in this direction.""    A detail of some importance: Christopher made his statement  in response to President Yeltsin's recent speech to Russian  parliament. The speech spoke clearly enough of Russia's right  to involve itself actively in the development of the situation  in the former Union with a view to ensuring stability and the  protection of Russians. The secretary of state commented with  some scorn on these passages in the Russian president's speech,  describing them as something aimed primarily at ""a domestic  audience.""    This speech, Christopher reported, is still being studied in  Washington but Washington is prepared to issue a warning right  now to Moscow on how it should behave. In the most unequivocal  terms.    In my view in the warnings which are now being heard from  Washington it is easy to discern an attempt by the Clinton  administration to preserve the status to which Russia has been  reduced in recent years, particularly by virtue of the chaos,  lack of thought, and often simply shortsightedness of our  diplomats' actions. The status which Washington automatically  guarantees Washington its own absolute superpowerdom on the  world arena probably suits the United States completely. It can  hardly suit Russia, nor should it.    Everything is the way it was before. Is that not so?    It seems to me that Foreign Minister Kozyrev should have a  serious talk about this with Christopher when they meet 14 March  in Vladivostok, where the secretary of state is going as part of  his Far East tour.

[Weizman] A negotiating process never continues in the same  way as it began. It is natural for certain problems to arise in  time. The problems that emerged in the aftermath of the  agreement signed with the Palestinians can be summarized under  the following three headings: The boundaries of Jericho which  will be granted autonomous status, control over entries and  exits from the area, and the disagreements within the PLO.    [Ipek] In your opinion, can Turkey play a role in the Middle  East peace process?    [Weizman] Yes, definitely. I would like to tell you that I  have been in office for eight months. During this period, I  received invitations from many countries, but I postponed almost  all of them. I am conducting my first official visit to Turkey,  because Turkey is an important and large country in the region.  It also has a large population; and moreover, it is Muslim. It  is a democratic and secular country. It has common borders with  Iran, Iraq, and Syria, in addition to the former Soviet  republics. There is no need to explain in length the importance  of Turkey, which is a part of the Balkans and has two important  straits. Turkey and Palestine [as heard] share a common  foundation because of these characteristics. Turkey, which is  an important power in the Middle East, can be influential in the  peace process. It can influence the PLO and Syrian President  Hafiz al-Asad. Turkey can play an extremely important role for  peace, and it is doing so.    [Ipek] Various international issues were also discussed  during the talks. Within this framework, can you comment on the  tragic situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Armenian attacks  against Azerbaijan?    [Weizman] Various international issues were raised with Mr.  Demirel. We discussed the newly independent republics and the  developments in Russia. It is not clear what developments will  take place in Russia. These must be closely followed. I hope  the developments will pursue a democratic path. We did not  discuss Armenian attacks with the Turkish president. The  situation in former Yugoslavia, however, and the tragic  developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular, were  discussed. The international community, the United Nations, and  NATO must do something to halt this course, which caused the  death of some 200,000 people. Mr. Demirel is concerned about  the developments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I would not like to  speak on his behalf, but I think he believes that this stems  largely from the fact that the world remains a spectator to the  tragedy in Bosnia and the weakness of the United Nations.    [Ipek] Lastly, what in your opinion is the future of  Turkish-Israeli relations?    [Weizman] I am very pleased with the warmth we encountered  in Ankara. The talks were extremely constructive and were held  in full understanding. There is an important future for  bilateral economic cooperation. I believe that during the 24  hours I spent with Mr. Demirel, we created a brand new beginning  for the relations between the two countries. There is a  beautiful and bright sun in Ankara. I believe that the future  of bilateral relations is as bright as this sun.     "

Before the vote, Mahony spoke personally to many of the workers, arguing that  unionization was not necessary because improvements in working conditions had  been made. After the vote, the archbishop accused textile union organizers of  using ""confrontational methods"" and said some cemetery workers had been  threatened and intimidated.    Mahony maintained that, despite his stand, he remains a labor sympathizer. But  relationships between the archdiocese and local labor leaders grew strained.  Last summer Mahony decided that he would not address the annual Labor Day  breakfast of the Catholic Labor Institute, breaking with years of tradition.

Members of the agreement expressed satisfaction at the  cooperation between the two countries. In the joint communique  released by the two countries, emphasis was placed on stopping  the atrocities being committed on the people of Kashmir and on  respecting human rights. They emphasized that the Kashmir issue  be resolved according to the UN resolution. This communique  strongly demanded that efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue be  accelerated.

The joint communique from Iran and Pakistan is proof of past  relations between the two countries.

The Indian atrocities in  Kashmir, the massacre of Muslims in Bosnia, and the Jewish  aggression against the Muslims in Palestine are problems which  we can resolve by working together.    Wherever the Muslims live now, there are economic and social  problems. The non-Muslims also have a monopoly over trade and  commerce. From the perspective of resources, Muslims are not  behind in any country; however, the disagreements and minor  scuffles among the Pakistani nations, as well as the unnecessary  confrontation, have stopped Islam from making an important place  for itself in the world. Even today, if Muslim nations cooperate  with each other in economic and social areas, no power in the  world can insult them.    It is our misfortune that we have to depend on non-Muslims  to  obtain modern technology. If we sign mutual agreements for  exchange of technology, then we will not have to look at anyone  else.    Iran, after the 1979 Islamic revolution, started to use its  own resources. Soon after this revolution, the imperialists  forced a war on Iran. Still, after this long war, Iran managed  to keep its economic and social conditions under control. All  this happened because of its strong faith, which was helped by  the grace of Allah. Imam Khomeini once said that neither the  United States nor communism were superpowers; only God is the  superpower. If we trust someone else, then our faith is weak. In  light of Imam Khomeini's statement, Iran confronted a major  superpower, which influenced politics worldwide.    It is a welcome development that the Muslim nations are also  changing slowly, and that an atmosphere of mutual cooperation is  increasing. This will help us to at least escape the control of  foreigners. Relations between Pakistan and Iran for the last  half century have prepared Pakistan to openly trust the Iranian  Government and the people there. The people of Pakistan declare  Iran their second home; similarly, our brothers in Iran consider  Pakistan their second home. We pray the agreements made between  the two countries will last until the end of the world, and that  friendly relations between the governments and the people of  Iran and Pakistan will never end.

Forty persons, including scholars and  officials from Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Iran, and Turkey, as well  as Chinese scholars, officials, and entrepreneurs, attended the  meeting. To help the reader understand the relevant situation,  we now introduce below the gist of the speeches, made by Xu Dan,  deputy director of the China Contemporary International  Relations Institute; the important statements made by  (Kasianov), director, and (Aleinov), deputy director, of  Kazakhstan's Strategic Research Institute, which is directly  under the president; as well as the papers read out at the  meeting by Zhao Chunguang [6392 4783 0342] of Mongolia's  Northeast Asia Institute:    I. China's Reform, Opening Up to the Outside World, Economic  Situation    China's reform and opening up to the outside world has been  going on for 15 years. It has caused fundamental changes in  China's socioeconomic features, and has caused us to find the  path of building socialism with China's characteristics. With  Deng Xiaoping's important speech while inspecting the south in  1992 as the starting point, in China's economic development and  its reform and opening lup to the outside world, there has  appeared a vigorous momentum with the following characteristics:    First, China's economy has entered a new long period of  high-speed growth. Last year's Gross National Product (GNP)  was 12.8 percent higher than that of the year before, and  industrial production grew 20.8 percent. It was the year with  the biggest growth since China's opening up to the outside  world. In agriculture, a bumper harvest was wrested--a 3.7  percent increase over that of the year before last. In the first  half of this year, the GNP grew 13.9 percent compared with that  of the same period last year, and the gross value of industrial  output grew 25.1 percent. In agriculture this year, summer grain  set a high-output record. This momentum of high-speed growth did  not happen by chance: It rests on the foundation of the results  obtained by the three-year economic readjustment began in 1989.  In this period there were bumper agricultural harvests in  successive years, there was a big improvement in the capacity  for supplying energy and raw materials, there were successive  years of a surplus in foreign trade, there was a big increase in  saving deposits, and successes were obtained in all economic  reforms. In addition, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on his  southern tour at the right time and the holding of the 14th CPC  Congress gave China's economic development a looser and more  comfortable policy and environment.    Second, a major breakthrough was achieved in China's  economic reform. Last year's 14th CPC Congress proposed  that the goal of China's economic reform be to establish a  socialist economic system. This is a complex piece of social  systems engineering, and its main parts are: 1) Accelerate the  pace of economic reform and estalish a modernized enterprise  system, so that the enterprises truly establish a modernized  enterprise system, so that the pace of price reform and  establish a unified open, orderly competitive market system; 2)  accelerate the transformation of government functions and  establish a macro regulation and control system that meets the  demand of socialist markets; and 3) accelerate economic  legislation and establish a legal system that meets the needs of  the socialist market economy.    Third, China's opening up to the outside world has  entered a new historical stage. In the past it was mainly  the southeast coastal region that was opened up to the outside  world; now the opening up has expanded to riverine and border  cities and to interior provincial capitals and cities, forming a  new pattern in which from east to west, from south to north,  with provincial capitals as the center, the opening up to the  outside world radiates to surrounding areas in all directions.  In 1992 China's import and export trade totaled $165.6 billion,  a 22 percent increase over that of the year before. Foreign  businessmen invested $1.116 billion in China; 470,000 of the  three kinds of enterprises were approved for registration,  exceeding the total for the past dozen or so years. In the first  half of this year, China's import and export trade totaled  $77.81 billion, a 13.4 percent increase over that of the same  period last year. This shows that China's political stability,  social stability, and economic development filled with vitality  have made foreign investors better understand that China is an  ideal place for investment.    Currently, in China's economy, while there has been rapid  growth, there have also appeared some fairly prominent problems,  which are mainly manifested in: First, the scale of investment  in fixed assets is too large, and there are too many newly built  or rebuilt projects, causing a drop in macro investment results.  Second, the financial and banking situation is fairly grim, and  the contradiction between low financial income and high  financial outgo has added to the difficulty of an imbalance  between financial income and outgo. Third, the restraining  factor of ""bottlenecks"" is prominent, that is, there is an  overall strain on transport and communication, and the supply of  raw materials does not meet the demand. The shortage of funds  adversely affects the normal production and business activities  of many enterprises. Fourth, price rises are too high, and the  pressure of inflation has increased. The Chinese government's  policy for solving these problems is not, as in the pst, to  adopt overall retrenchment, but rather, is, through deepening  reform, changing mechanisms, optimizing structure, and improving  returns, to ensure and promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy  development of the national economy.    II. The Situation After Central Asian Countries Became  Independent and the International Effect    The countries of Central Asia have been independent or more  than a year, and in most of them the situation is fairly stable;  based on our observations, the factors causing this stability  are many-sided. First, these countries have powerful leaders.  Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan have  swiftly put into practice the presidential system, and the  leaders enjoy fairly high prestige in their own countries;  constitutions have been formulated, and the ""democratic system""  under the leadership of a president has been put on a legal  basis. Second, for economic reform a policy of steady progress  has been adopted, and ""shock therapy"" is not practiced. While  reforming, each country has put into practice a social security  system, thereby alleviating the difficulties in life encountered  by urban and rural residents in the course of reform, and  ensuring social stability. Third, each country has put in  practice a policy of nationality harmony; in formulating this  policy, the government, in the country's economic and political  life, takes into consideration the balancing of interests among  the nationalities and the maintaining of a harmonious  coexistence of the nationalities. Fourth, a religious policy  suited to the national condition has been put into practice. The  people of Central Asia have now obtained the freedom of  religious belief. Religions can be freely propagated in Central  Asian countries, but the government of each country clearly  stipulates that religious forces cannot participate in  governmental and political affairs, and cannot adversely affect  the political stability of the country. Because of the above  conditions, the situation in the past more than one year has  basically been one of stable development. However, the Central  Asian countries are in a transitional period in which there is a  turn in the situation, their economic difficulties are quite  serious, and politically there are many latent factors for  instability. Continued stability and development in the future  will depend on great efforts by the governments of these  countries.    After becoming independent, the Central Asian countries are  daily enhancing and expanding their international position and  influence, and Central Asia is becoming a region of interest and  action by the international community. This is also determined  by many factors: 1) Central Asia is located in that part of the  world that binds together the European and Asian continents; it  is the link between East and West, and its geographical position  is extremely important.  2) Central Asia is a ""treasure house of natural resources""; here  there are abundant petroleum, natural gas, nonferrous metals,  and other mineral resources. Some countries abound in cotton,  and people call them ""white gold countries."" 3) Surrounding  Central Asia are some important countries with diferent social  systems and different ideologies and religious beliefs. The  Central Asian countries are building closer contacts and  developing relations of friendship with these countries, thereby  playing an important role in balancing the various forces. 4)  The economic level of Central Asia is that of the developing  countries, and it is an important force in the international  community for maintaining peace and promoting justice.    III. Prospects for Cooperation Between China and Central  Asian Countries    Central Asia is a close neighbor of China's, and there are  three Central Asian countries that border China; they are linked  by common mountains and rivers, and the nationalities cross  borders. As early as before the year 2000 or so, there will be a  ""Silk Road"" that will directly link China and Central Asia. The  Chinese government has rapidly established formal diplomatic  relations with these countries, and has invited their leaders to  visit China; has established a basis on the five principles of  peaceful coexistence to develop relationships of equality and  mutual benefit, good neighborliness and friendship; and has  signed in many fields documents for carrying out contacts and  cooperation. In many aspects there is an identity of interests  between China and the Central Asian countries, and there could  be a further deepening of cooperation and a wider development of  relations.    A. In the political aspect, the identity of goals  between the Central Asian countries and China gives hope for  maintaining peaceful, stable internal and international  environments. This is because the Central Asian countries  now face many arduous tasks: politically, they must consolidte  independence; economically, they must overcome the serious  difficulties encountered after independence; internally, they  must give impetus to reform, open up to the outside world, and  ensure the tranquil life of all people in the country. All of  this must be done under conditions of international peace. China  is deepening its reform and expanding its opening up to the  outside world. Therefore, with China's and Central Asia's  security interests being identical, they can cooperate hand in  hand, both striving for the long-term security of their own  lands and working in common to create world peace and a rational  new order.    B. In the economic aspect, the complementary nature of  China and the Central Asian countries is very large, and the  potential for them in this respect is far from being  displayed. The superiority of the Central Asian countries  lies in their abundant natural resources, a certain industrial  base, and a gradually forming vast market. Their weak point is  that they have a one-product economy, and they must import from  abroad articles for use in industry and articles for daily use,  and must import foreign capital and technology to develop  processing industries and to exploit natural resources. At the  same time Central Asia is an inland region; it lacks seaports,  and its land communication depends on enhancement of its  cooperation with surrounding neighbor countries. Because it has  had more than 10 years of successful reform and opening up to  the outside world, China has established a diversified industry  with complete categories. It has a very strong capability in its  processing industries, and it can export large amounts of light  industry and textile, electronic, and daily-use products. Its  building, mining, agricultural and plantation technologies have  entered the world ranks, and it possesses the conditions for  wider economic cooperation. The economic and trade cooperation  between China and Central Asia is just beginning, and it may be  conjectured that there are vast prospects for its development.  China is accelerating its opening up to the outside world and  its construction of its western inland and border regions, with  the focus on developing the infrastructure for communication and  transportation. In the next three years China will invest 8  billion yuan in newly building or rebuilding the railroad  network in its northwest region. From now until the year 2000,  China will build some trunk lines of a high-grade national  highway that will crisscross the country east, west, south, and  north. This will be advantageous to China's internal unblocked  transportation, and will be even more convenient for enhancing  its cooperation with neighboring countries. China and Central  Asia also have more conditions to put into effect a joint  communication network, thereby causing the renewal of the Silk  Road to become a reality.    C. In international affairs, China and the Central  Asian countries have many common points. We belong to the  developing countries and our fundamental interests are  identical. The contacts, talks, and meetings of leaders of our  countries prove that, on many major international issues, the  Central Asian countries and China have identical views and  positions and have similar stands. The position and role of  Central Asian countries in international affairs are growing  daily, and the relations of cooperation in foreign affairs  between China and the Central Asian countries are becoming  closer and closer. In the new structure of the pluralistic  world, China and the Central Asian countries both qualify to  become active participants in establishing a just and rational  new international order.    In brief, China and the Central Asian countries in political  affairs should become models of countries with different social  systems coexisting in peace for long periods of time and being  good neighbors and friends; in culture, science and technology  should become friends who learn from each other and who advance  together; and in international affairs should become positive  forces for maintaining peace and stability and for extablishing  a just, rational new world order.

Vladimir Petrovich, certain differences have  emerged between Russia and its Western partners. What do you  think, is this a result of the Zhirinovskiy factor? Or is it a  question of deeper, fundamental changes in our foreign policy?    [Lukin] Well, in the first place I would not dramatize, or  globalize the Zhirinovskiy factor. What is the Zhirinovskiy  factor? Sometimes a politician here only has to start squealing  like a piglet or screaming like a woman in labor, and some  factors or other start appearing. We are talking about one of  the factions, not a majority faction. The statement adopted by  the State Duma on Yugoslavia was not a statement proposed by the  Liberal Democrats. So we are talking about the mood of the  Russian people, and as an expression of this mood, the mood in  the Duma itself, not in one faction, but in many, practically  the overwhelming majority of factions. This is the mood of our  public, which consists of this, that what is needed is  international efforts to eliminate this crisis, and in this we  differ radically from the Liberal Democrats, they are needed not  by way of using violence -- violence will entail further  violence, not stop violence. [passage omitted]    [Lukin] I was speaking to the well-known U.S. politician and  diplomat James Collins yesterday, at his request, and he  admitted that the process is under way, that both the Serbs and  Muslims are surrendering their artillery, that is, the process  of disarmament is really under way.    [Kalyagin] So you think force will not be used by NATO?    [Lukin] I cannot think that, because there could be two  alternatives here. The alternative of genuine interest on the  part of NATO and the Western countries in Sarajevo not being  shelled -- this is a legitimate interest -- and the alternative  of looking for any pretext, which is unfortunately being whipped  up by some of the Muslim leaders, to intervene at any price and  foist their own understanding and their own solution to this  matter. Just look at what happened with the so-called mortar  bomb at the Sarajevo market. This is really very similar to the  Reichstag fire, it was as though it was done to order  immediately prior to the foreign ministers' conference, the day  before.    [Kalyagin] And if the bombing still goes ahead? What could  that lead to? What do you think?    [Lukin] If that happens, it could lead to very bad  consequences in terms of Russia's relations, our trust in the  countries of the West. You see, there are two kinds of  relations -- relations between partners, and relations with a  boss. When a decision is made first, and then the other side is  informed of the decision that has already been made, that is  relations with a boss. Relations between partners mean that  first of all there is very careful and serious discussion of the  issues, and then a joint, considered decision is made. That is  what I am in favor of.

Audrey Freedman, an economist with the Conference Board in New York, said that  organized labor must recognize that wage-oriented demands will not be met in an  era of global competition, and unions therefore must meet the needs of other  workers in other ways.    ""If I were a labor leader -- which I never would be because I'm a woman -- I  would be figuring out what it is that unorganized service workers and clerical  workers really need,"" she said.

Mr. Pelletreau, a politician considered familiar with the  affairs of Iran and that of the Middle East, during yesterday's  press conference, by using such terms as Iran's ambitions for  seeking regional domination and the use of terrorist approaches,  tried to announce to other regional countries, through the mass  media, the U.S. leaders' message of friendship and loyalty in  defending the regional countries against the likely threat of  Iran.    Of course, the U.S. under secretary of State for Middle  Eastern affairs, in line with the task entrusted to him, also  did not leave the point unsaid that his country continues to  call for pressure and economic sanctions against Iran by the  U.S.'s allies in Europe and other pro-Western countries. He  stressed that the U.S. believes that this trend should continue  until such time as Iran alters its policies and turns into a  good neighbor in the Persian Gulf.    What the U.S. under secretary of state has said is neither  new nor a new development in the U.S.'s outlook toward Iran,  since, according to political analysts, it is not the first time  that U.S. leaders are explaining their policies with respect to  the Islamic Republic of Iran; they have done so on various  occasions and under certain specific conditions in the past as  well.    Despite this, Mr. Robert Pelletreau's explicit remarks in  Abu  Dhabi, in an overall assessment should be considered as  indicative of the sensitivity U.S. leaders have always shown  over the determining role of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the  Persian Gulf region; a region that is extremely vital for the  U.S. and its regional interests.    It is beyond doubt that seasoned American politicians are  well aware of the reality that the Islamic Republic of Iran has  achieved substantial progress in its political, economic, and  cultural ties with its neighbors, especially in Central Asia and  in the Persian Gulf region. Obviously these ties have not been  shaped on the basis of Iran's fear in the region, rather, as has  been clearly stated by the leaders of those countries, these  ties are selective and are aimed at realizing joint bilateral  interests with deep understanding of the need for the  enhancement of regional ties for preserving peace and stability  in the region.    Therefore, it is not unusual to see that the U.S. leaders,  by  using such terms as domination, threat for the region, or by  warning the neighbors not to have close ties with Iran, try to  justify the sale of more arms to the regional countries. Mr.  Pelletreau also seems to have a short memory as, during his  remarks in Abu Dhabi, he overlooked the point that, in his  earlier report in March 1994, which was submitted to the Foreign  Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives  following the failure of U.S. efforts to isolate Iran on the  international scene, he had described the Iranian Government as  a permanent reality, adding that he was prepared to hold talks  with Iranian officials on disputed issues.

They were also much discussed at Mr. Kebich's  meeting with professors of institutes of higher education in  Minsk, which was held at the Belarusian State University on 12  May. The present stage of the implementation of the  above-mentioned agreement was assessed by the prime minister in  the following way:    ""Nine articles out of 12 are already in force. The most  essential article of this agreement concerns the lifting of  custom duties, quotas, and tariffs. Practically, it means that  prices for imported Russian goods will be lowered by about 25-30  percent. Consequently, this leads to a decrease in production  costs and to a possibility of falling retail prices. However,  it is undesirable to decrease retail prices today. Why?  Because even at current prices, a great flood of goods  (especially foodstuffs) outside of Belarus exists. Therefore,  our task is, while preserving the same retail prices, to  increase wages. This is a more proper way, and we will follow  it.""    ""With regard to other articles of the agreement, I should  say  that we need to bring some legislative acts in line with  legislative acts of the Russian Federation. However, I will  tell you honestly: During our talks with the Russian leadership,  one could sense an underlying sentiment: `We will wait and see  who will become your president...' The document signed by Oleg  Soskovets, Russia's first deputy prime minister, specifies the  term. Nine articles come in force before 31 July. Note that  this term was chosen not accidentally... Let us say  straightforwardly: If the presidential elections are a bust,  this may prevent the union from being formed.""    In general, during the meeting, Mr. Kebich frequently  accentuated the delicacy of relations with our eastern neighbor  and their tendency to fluctuations due to seemingly  insignificant factors:    ""There was a mention of our victory over Moscow regiments  near Orsha in 1514, and Russia cut off its gas supplies. This  was not accidental. We still owe debts to Russia for gas -- but  gas supplies continue... There was a mention of Belarusian  claims to Bransk and Smolensk Oblasts, for Vilnius region -- and  we received the next warning: `We will halt gas supplies if you  do not start paying.' Politics know no trifles. One has to be  very careful about politics and assess the situation very  accurately.""    Understandably, Mr. Kebich himself has never made any such  statements on the victory near Orsha or some territorial claims.  Apparently, he had in mind statements and actions by the  Belarusian Popular Front...    The prime minister firmly cut himself off from the radical  ideas of both the ""right"" and the ""left."" He promised  stability, consequence, and continual progress after his victory  in the elections.     "
0,FT922-8324 ,"FT922-8324 _AN-CENCNAADFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (4): Coming in from the cold - Foreign Policy      By STEPHEN FIDLER   PRESIDENT Carlos Menem's love of the grand gesture makes him, on occasions, a diplomat's nightmare. The examples are legion. Rather than downgrade subtly the quality of the Argentine delegation to the Non-Aligned Movement, as a diplomat might have advised, he pulls Argentina out with a grand fanfare. Rather than wait for an invitation to visit Britain, which would certainly have been forthcoming in time, he announces, through the medium of the FT, a plan to pay a visit to the UK in 1992, an election year and the 10th anniversary of the Falklands war. (The visit seems likely to take place in 1993.) In contrast to the awkward reaction of most Latin American governments to the crisis in the Gulf, Mr Menem sends two warships to support the US-led coalition. He also followed the hard US line on Cuba, breaking ranks with the rest of Latin America. Mr Menem is telling the world that Argentina is a changed country; that the 60 years of isolationism which marked Argentina's foreign policy is over. He is seeking to bury Argentina's reputation as an unreliable player on the world's diplomatic stage. Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, argues that 'Argentina's internal and its international policies are a unity'. In other words, a democratic, open economy requires a different foreign policy from a closed economy run by a dictator. The wide-ranging manifestations of this policy include: Alignments: Argentina has aligned itself more closely to the west. This was initially seen as a pro-Washington tilt to policy, an interpretation disliked in both Washington and Buenos Aires. More recently, there has been emphasis on relations with Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of external trade compared with 15 per cent in the US. Family ties with Europe are strong - more than 1m Argentines are also citizens of EC countries. International agreements: Argentina has professed an intention to comply with a wide range of these that it had previously refused to sign. In April President Menem signed a decree placing strict controls on the export of sensitive materials. The government has signed agreements with Brazil on nuclear inspection, and with Brazil and Chile on banning nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The nuclear safeguards laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have been adopted. The government has made a commitment to the US to abandon the Condor missile project, expressed a desire to join the Missile Technology Control Regime and committed itself to nuclear non-proliferation and the Tlatelolco treaty which banks nuclear weapons in Latin America. It has also signed treaties on international investment protection. Despite all this, many of these commitments have yet to be ratified by the Argentine Congress. Furthermore, there will remain some doubts about the ability of the government to force compliance on the military of some of these agreements. Nonetheless, the reaction from Washington has been positive. The US has said that some 20 Skyhawk jets are available to the Argentine air force, the first indication of US willingness to combat aircraft to Argentina since the Falklands War. Relations with neighbouring countries: Argentina has eased historically tense relations with Brazil and Chile. This has a strong economic motive. The government is intent on economic integration with Brazil, the key to which is Mercosur, a customs union of the two economies with Uruguay and Paraguay. That is scheduled to begin in 1995, though its implementation may be delayed. The hope is that Chile will join the group once Brazil's economic problems abate. But there is little doubt that the excitement in Argentina over integration with Brazil is not matched in Brazil. There are also some worries that Mercosur may restrict Argentina's ability to act unilaterally over trade matters, for example, in discussing a free trade agreement with the US. However, given the openness of the Argentine and the Chilean economies, and the growing outward orientation of Brazil, further economic integration appears inevitable with or without agreements among governments. Companies from the three countries are already discussing mergers and joint venture agreements, and Chilean companies have already been buyers (of two power stations) in the Argentine privatisation programme. Relations with the UK: Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Britain in July 1990. These had been broken with the invasion of the Falkland Islands 10 years ago. That was also the key to improving relations with the European Community. With the issue of sovereignty under a so-called umbrella - meaning both sides retain their claim to sovereignty - fairly cordial discussions between London and Buenos Aires have moved ahead on the practical issues of fishing rights and aviation. There has been less progress on the more difficult issue of oil exploration rights. Mr Guido di Tella, the Argentine foreign minister, has also said that the desires of the islanders will be taken into account in a settlement, a statement viewed as constructive in London. While Britain retains a garrison of 2,000 men on the islands that the Argentines know as the Malvinas, Argentina must be considered now neither to have the intent nor the military capability to invade. Thus the only risk to the 2,100 islanders is the small one of an attack by some maverick force. The Argentines have not given up on their claim to the islands, however, and the war remains a traumatic experience over which they still agonise. Since there is little chance of the British parliament cutting a deal over sovereignty over the heads of the islanders, the Argentine government appears to have embarked on a longer-term strategy of reducing the islanders' fear of things Argentine. If this is so, policy towards the Falklands fits neatly with the rest of Argentine foreign policy: to convince the world that Argentina is now a democratic, stable and reliable member of the community of nations.

Can we call it a  crisis now? Here is our commentator Aleksey Sokolov's view.    [Sokolov] Indeed, there are quite a few reports in the press  on this. A lightweight diplomatic scandal is brewing between  Moscow and Washington -- this is how IZVESTIYA, for instance,  has headlined one of its articles. The article is about the  possible negative consequences of the former U.S. President  Nixon's visit to Russia, where, unfortunately enough, he had a  meeting with the opposition before meeting the head of state and  those who represent the administration.    The article's author does not rule out the emergence of new  and substantial friction in the relations between Moscow and  Washington.    State Duma speaker Ivan Rybkin did mention the rough patches  that have recently been affecting the relations between the two  countries during his recent visit to Washington.    Incidentally, I have so far failed to come across the word  crisis, evidently because, when all is said and done, there is  no crisis as such between Russia and the United States. It is  more likely that other aspects do exist here -- it is simply  that Moscow and Washington have begun to regard each other from  more realistic positions. There is no doubt that Russia's  vigorous diplomatic initiative in Bosnia took America by  surprise. To detract from its undoubted impact, a jealous White  House wheeled out the Ames' spy affair. Pleasantries were  exchanged -- the Russian and American residents were expelled  from Washington and Moscow. The United States began to fan up  the spy hysteria in every possible way here. The halting of U.S.  assistance to Russia was even mentioned.    Nevertheless, let me reiterate that there are no grounds to  speak of a crisis in the Russian-American relations. It simply  looks like the United States, which has adopted the unofficial  title of the only superpower and which has recently gotten used  to Moscow behaving in a certain predictable pattern on the  international arena and to its role as a younger brother, as it  were, has suddenly discovered that despite its own family  difficulties, this brother has become stronger and more  confident and that it intends its role in international affairs  to be completely independent.    It is as though the United States has forgotten that in view  of objective reasons, such as the size of its territory and the  presence of nuclear weapons, Russia itself was, is, and will be  a world power, with a voice and interests of its own.    No, it is not a matter of returning to the times of the Cold  War. Russia is no longer ideologically hostile to the West --  but, having said that, it does have inalienable national  interests with which, judging by everything, the United States  will have to reckon in the nearest future.    As for America's interests, these can at times continue to  coincide with the Russian interests or not, as the case may be,  and if the latter is the case, rough patches are possible.  However, the essence of the mutual relations between Russia and  America ought to remain invariable. As Ivan Rybkin noted in  Washington, partnership and cooperation in the name of peace and  concord in the world represent the constant features of  Russian-American relations.     "

The dynamic economic development of countries associated in the  Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opens the way for the  formation of a dominant center of world economy in this region  in the near future.    The foreign policy of the Slovak Republic in 1993 proceeded  from this realization. Its main objective was to establish  prerequisites for the development and a higher level of  Slovakia's bilateral relations with major Asian countries  (Japan, PRC, India, Republic of Korea, and the ASEAN countries),  with emphasis being placed on the creation of suitable  conditions for the expansion of economic cooperation and the  influx of capital investments to Slovakia.    The independent Slovak Republic is a new entity in the  international arena, one that is unknown to many Asian  countries. Therefore, our activities at various levels were also  aimed at creating a truthful image of the Slovak Republic, its  foreign policy, economic orientation, and internal development  among representatives of the Asian countries.    The entrepreneurial circles of Asian countries need a  political signal to launch their activities in another country.  In the endeavor to improve the Slovak Republic's bilateral  relations with individual Asian countries and promote the  activity of their entrepreneurial circles in Slovakia, we made  use of the opportunity to organize visits at the level of the  minister of foreign affairs, the ministers of other government  departments, and at the parliamentary level to the countries of  primary interest, as well as visits by representatives of these  countries to Slovakia.    The foreign affairs minister of the Slovak Republic visited  the Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Japan and the region of the  Middle and Far East was also the destination of parliamentary  delegations, the minister of economy, and representatives of  financial, banking, and entrepreneurial circles.    Visits by Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar to the PRC and  India  are being prepared and should take place in 1994.    With a view to establishing suitable conditions for the  expansion of economic cooperation and the influx of capital  investments to Slovakia, we have been trying to update and  complete the existing contractual basis, particularly in the  sphere of agreements of economic nature (agreements on the  protection and support of investments and on the prevention of  double taxation). The Ministry of Foreign Affairs initiated  with the Ministry of Finance, which acts as the coordinator of  this type of agreements, the expeditious signing of these  agreements with the Republic of Korea and Thailand. We are  waiting for the Japanese side's response to our draft of an  agreement on the support and protection of investments. A trade  agreement with the PRC is ready to be signed. Cooperation with  Australia developed in interaction with our expatriates [living  in Australia].    Some positive results have been achieved in relations with  Japan, the country of the Slovak Republic's primary interest in  the region:    -- the Slovak Republic was granted benefits under the  General  System of Customs Preferences (GSP) (April 1993),    -- an agreement was concluded on succession to the agreement  on a $200 million loan in support of restructuring the economy  of the former CSFR, of which $70 million are for the Slovak  Republic (January 1993),    -- discussions took place on the provision of a Japanese  government loan (of approximately $200 million) to finance the  construction of ecologically compatible sources of heat and  electricity for the Presov-Kosice area, as well as on a $33  million loan in support of small and medium-sized businesses.  It is expected that both loans will be granted,    -- cooperation between Japanese firms and Slovnaft  Bratislava, Tesla Prievidza, and other companies in establishing  joint ventures is developing.    A more effective realization of our plans in Asia would be  aided by the completion of the network of the Slovak Republic's  representative missions in the region, including the selection  of high-quality staff and the appointment of ambassadors.    Overall, it is possible to state that the implementation of  the Slovak Republic's foreign policy plans laid down for the  Asian region in 1993 was successful, considering the  possibilities available to us. The realized contacts with  representatives of countries of our primary interest in the  region, along with the general foreign political activities,  contributed to the presentation of Slovakia as a stable and  reliable partner, to the development of bilateral cooperation,  to greater interest in Slovakia among Asian businessmen and  investors, and, in a wider context, to reinforcing Slovakia's  international prestige. Important political and economic  contacts were established, including the export of special  products to designated countries.    The present level of the Slovak Republic's bilateral  relations with major Asian countries and their interest in  Slovakia establish good prerequisites for their further  development and diversification in 1994.       2.5 Relations with Middle Eastern and African States    In the first half of 1993, main attention was paid to laying  the foundations for a network of representative missions,  establishing material and technical conditions for the operation  of individual offices, and to the practical implementation of  dividing the property of the former CSFR. We have succeeding in  securing that our embassies are at least minimally staffed. In  view of the economic potentials of the Slovak Republic, steps  have been taken to establish representative missions in only the  most important countries of the region.    In the political sphere, we have achieved diplomatic  recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations with  practically all Arab countries, with the exception of Saudi  Arabia and Bahrain. Of the 46 states of sub-Saharan Africa, 18  countries have recognized the Slovak Republic thus far, most of  which are the more important countries of the region.    We have been developing relations with the countries of the  Middle East and Africa in the context of the present foreign  policy priorities and with a view to asserting our economic and  commercial interests in this region. The realization of tasks  associated with recovering the Slovak Republic's claims, which  we register in a number of countries of this region, is in its  initial stage. The Ministry of Finance is acting as the  coordinator of this task. Several meetings of heads of  government departments were held but it is necessary, in the  interest of boosting our economic relations, to continue  developing a regular political dialogue and to intensify  contacts at government level. Toward the end of the year, we  therefore prepared a visit by the minister of foreign affairs of  the Slovak Republic to Israel, which will take place in January  1994. We also regard as important the establishment of contacts  with Egypt, which is one of the most influential states in the  region and, at the same time, our traditional partner.  Analogous agreements with other countries are in the  preparatory stage and we are also establishing contacts in the  sphere of culture and the arts.    2.6. Relations with the States of Latin America    The Slovak Republic's entry into the awareness of the  political and economic circles in the countries of Latin America  was complicated, to a certain extent, by these circles'  perception of the Slovak Republic as the initiator of the  breakup of the CSFR and by the problems faced by the  representative missions of the Slovak Republic in this region,  particularly in the first months of the year, with regard to the  competent presentation of the new statehood. The development of  the Slovak Republic's relations with the countries of Latin  America is also adversely influenced by the fact that there is  no ambassador of the Slovak Republic operating at any  representative mission of the Slovak Republic in Latin America  or accredited to any country of Latin America.    One of the consequences of the tendency to concentrate all  resources of the Slovak foreign service on the European region  is the low level of diversification of our external relations.    It is possible to state that Slovak foreign political and  commercial activities vis-a-vis Latin America as a whole, as  well as vis-a-vis individual countries, have led to the  establishment of basic contacts, which, in the period to come,  could create realistic conditions for more intensive political,  economic, and commercial cooperation.    The highest level of relations has been achieved in our  relations with Mexico, a contribution to which was made by the  visit paid by the minister of foreign affairs of the Slovak  Republic to Mexico in October 1993. An honorary consulate in  Guadalajara was opened on this occasion.    In the second half of the year, political dialogue with  Brazil and Uruguay started to develop more dynamically.  Bilateral activities have established realistic prerequisites  for the realization of a visit by the minister of foreign  affairs to these countries. Argentina and Chile have declared  their interest in more intensive cooperation. The realization  of a visit by the minister of foreign affairs of the Slovak  Republic to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay would raise  the qualitative level of the Slovak Republic's relations with  the aforementioned countries and, consequently, with the entire  territory of Latin America.    The opening of honorary consulates in Brazil and Argentina  is  in the final phase of preparations. Negotiations on the  conclusion of trade agreements with Cuba and Brazil are about to  be wound up.    The building of a network of the Slovak Republic's  representative missions in Latin America has not been completed  this year and a certain makeshift arrangement persists in this  area. A possible further restriction of our diplomatic  representation in the Latin American region would reduce the  volume of our political activities and cause a decline of  commercial and economic cooperation.    3. Cultural Activities Abroad    Cultural activities abroad are presently one of the key  elements in creating Slovakia's image in the world. Therefore,  they should become an integral part of the strategy of asserting  the foreign political interests of our state.    Following the division of the premises of CSFR  representative missions and Cultural and Information Centers, a  vacuum in the sphere of culture and information came about,  which is felt also by institutions and citizens in the countries  of their operation. It is expected of us that we follow up on  the positive traditions of our cultural activities as soon as  possible. Therefore, our efforts in 1993 were aimed, on the one  hand, at establishing comprehensive relations in the spheres of  education, science, and culture and, on the other, at reviving  the activity of Slovak cultural centers. The Ministry of  Foreign Affairs has worked out a concept for building cultural  centers abroad, which should be put into practice in the years  to come. Four Slovak cultural centers were in operation in 1993  -- in Budapest, Sofia, Warsaw, and Bucharest. The cultural  center in Budapest, in particular, is an example of the active  and positive influence of culture on bilateral relations, even  in a tense political situation such as prevails in relations  with Hungary.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been active in preparing  cultural agreements with individual countries that show interest  in such cooperation and in expanding the possibilities for  cultural, educational, and scientific exchanges. With a number  of countries (such as Spain, Greece, Republic of South Africa,  some Arab states, and the states of Latin America), we have been  developing more intensive relations in these areas than in the  political or economic spheres.    Societies of friendship with Slovakia operate in a number of  countries, which also contributes to mutual knowledge and  understanding and helps establish a good atmosphere in mutual  relations (this applies, for example, to the Scandinavian  countries).    4. The International Legal Dimension of Foreign Policy    4.1 Sphere of International Law    The priority task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Slovak Republic in the sphere of international law in 1993 was  to secure the process of the Slovak Republic's succession to  contractual documents, to which the CSFR had been a party on 31  December 1992. The basic condition of talks on the Slovak  Republic's succession to bilateral international treaties was  the attainment of agreement on which treaties would remain valid  without modification, which would be modified, and which would  expire without substitution.    Talks on succession to bilateral agreements have been wound  up with Poland, Austria, Russia, Slovenia, Romania, Japan,  Finland, and Norway. Talks with France, Canada, Switzerland,  Turkey, Hungary, Bulgaria, Ukraine, and Luxembourg have been  initiated. Talks with the FRG concerning the FRG's succession  to treaties concluded by the former GDR are in a preparatory  stage.    With regard to succession to multilateral contractual  documents, succession to conventions concluded within the  framework of the UN, UNESCO, the International Labor  Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the  International Organization for Intellectual Property, the The  Hague Conference for International Private Law, as well as  conventions in the sphere of international humanitarian law  deposited in Switzerland has been comprehensively notified  [notifikovana]. The Council of Europe has recognized a  comprehensive succession to conventions concluded within the  framework of this organization, the contracting party to which  had been the CSFR.    The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, within the  framework of its powers, has confirmed the Slovak Republic's  succession to international documents concerning the claims and  financial liabilities of the former CSFR.    Another task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Slovak  Republic in 1993 was the preparation of bilateral political  treaties with Italy, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia. All these  treaties have been signed in the course of the year. The Treaty  on Good Neighborly Relations and Friendly Cooperation between  the Slovak Republic and Ukraine and the Treaty between the  Slovak Republic and Italy on Friendship and Cooperation were  ratified by the National Council of the Slovak Republic in  November 1993. Prerequisites exist for all the aforesaid  treaties to go into effect in 1994.    In the course of the year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  the Slovak Republic participated in the preparation of  presidential and governmental contractual documents that were  coordinated by other government departments. This concerns, in  particular, the readmission agreements with Poland, Ukraine, and  Romania [concerning the deportation of illegal immigrants], the  treaty on state borders with Ukraine, treaties on the prevention  of double taxation, on the support and protection of  investments, and on trade and payments, treaties concerning road  transport and aviation, and the like. In cooperation with other  government departments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Slovak Republic also participated in the preparation of the  Slovak Republic's accession to the Council of Europe Anti-Doping  Convention, to the European Convention on Archaeological  Heritage, to the European Charter on Sports, or to the European  Convention Against Spectators' Improper Conduct at Sports  Events. In cooperation with the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic  participated in the signing of the General Convention on  Climatic Changes and the Convention on Biological Diversity. In  the process of preparation of international treaties by other  government departments, the International Law Section of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic attends to  their formal legal aspect and to their conformity with the norms  of international contractual law.    One serious issue to which Slovak diplomacy has been forced  to pay increased attention from the first days of the Slovak  Republic's independence, and to which it must still pay  increased attention, are the problems concerning the  Gabcikovo-Nagymaros system of hydroelectric power projects. The  two sides have agreed to submit the dispute to the International  Court of Justice, the United Nations' supreme judicial body. A  special department for the International Court of Justice has  been set up at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The conclusion  of a special agreement was officially announced on 2 July 1993,  which initiated the court proceedings. A team of highly  experienced and distinguished foreign legal experts has been set  up to defend the interests of the Slovak Republic in this legal  suit. In spite of the ongoing court proceedings, the Slovak  Republic allows for the possibility of the settlement of the  dispute on the basis of a joint agreement.    4.2 Consular Sphere    In the first year of existence of the independent Slovak  Republic, basic attributes [atributy] were laid at the Consular  Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak  Republic for a professional consular service. Basic norms  governing the execution of consular activities were drafted and  finetuned in this period -- the Consular Order and procedures  for its enactment, documents that are essential to secure a  uniform execution of consular activities at the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs and at representative missions of the Slovak  Republic abroad.    Based on the foreign policy interests of the Slovak  Republic,  the main principles and orientation of visa policy were drawn up  in 1993 (and approved by Slovak Government resolution No. 732),  on the basis of which proposals for the modification of visa  relations with specific states were initiated in the course of  the year. The proposals were submitted with a view to  preserving good political and economic relations as well as in  the interest of developing commercial activities with specific  states.    Proposals for a modification of visa relations concerned the  following states: South Korea, Israel, Iran, Chile, Argentina,  Cyprus, Slovenia, Croatia, Russian Federation, Belarus, Ukraine,  Lithuania, Estonia, Hungarian Republic, and Romania.  Negotiations with some of these states have already been  concluded, as a result of which new agreements on visa-free  travel have been signed (Cyprus, Slovenia) or are expected to be  signed in the near future (Croatia). Negotiations with the  Hungarian Republic, Lithuania, and Estonia have also been  concluded and proposals for the conclusion of agreements on  visa-free travel have been submitted to the leadership of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Government of the Slovak  Republic for approval. Negotiations with the other states  continue.    A document concerning the establishment of a network of  honorary consulates of the Slovak Republic abroad was drawn up  in 1993 and submitted to the Government of the Slovak Republic.  Last year the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak  Republic started building this network, in particular, in  advanced countries, as well as in third world countries where  the Slovak Republic does not maintain a representative mission  and where good prospects exist, in view of traditions and actual  potentials, for the development of cooperation in trade,  tourism, and other areas. In addition to the two previous  honorary consulates (Calgary and Limassol), in 1993 an honorary  consulate was established in Guadalajara (Mexico) and nine more  honorary consulates have been approved: Hamburg, Bombay,  Calcutta, Drammen, Alexandria, Mestre in Italy, Barcelona,  Vaduz, and Port Said. These consulates have not yet commenced  their activity because they still require the other side's  approval. In the course of December, proposals for the  establishment of additional honorary consulates were submitted  (Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Reykjavik).    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic has  on  record specific candidates for the post of honorary consuls.  The selection is made in cooperation with the relevant  representative mission.     "

The facts of the case, concocted by Congressman Wolf,  member of the U.S. House of Representatives, state that in 1991,  ""China's Beijing No. One Prison was exporting goods to the  United States"". This case has finally been vindicated by the  facts.    On 27 March 1991, Representative Wolf and others visited the  Beijing No. One Prison. When they toured the prison's sock  workshop, Wolf attempted to take away without permission several  pairs of semifinished socks on the table, but he was stopped  then and there by the prison staff. After the tour, the warden  gave each and every visitor five pair of socks as souvenirs. A  few days later, however, Wolf, through the media outside China,  without grounds, accused the Beijing prison of exporting socks  it produced to the United States. Testifying to the U.S. Senate  Committee on Foreign Relations after he returned to the United  States, Wolf brazenly accused China, displaying the five pairs  of socks given to him as gift, and claimed they were ""proof""  that China was exporting goods made by inmates in reformatories  to the United States. Although China made an immediate  clarification and explained the real situation on many  occasions, Wolf still disregarded the basic facts and continued  his totally groundless charges on many other occasions. Thus,  the ""case of the Beijing prison's sock exports"" suddenly created  a hue and cry in the U.S. Congress and in the media, creating a  very bad impression of China.    Two years later, in March 1993, the U.S. Embassy in China  submitted a request to the relevant Chinese authorities to send  some officials to visit the Beijing No. One Prison, and the  authorities made arrangements for three officials of the U.S.  Embassy in China to visit the prison on 30 March 1993. During  the visit, the officials conducted a detailed investigation of  the matter regarding Wolf's accusation that the prison was  exporting inmate-produced socks to the United States. The  officials then reported the results of their investigation to  the U.S. Government. Later, Wolf again spread the lies he  created and attacked China, without grounds, at another news  conference held in the United States in the summer of 1993. The  Chinese authorities time and again urged the United States to  publicize the results of the investigation conducted by the  embassy officials. On 13 December 1993, the U.S. Government  publicized the results of the investigation in the FEDERAL  REGISTER, and thus the factory was vindicated.    An official of the relevant Chinese authorities pointed out,  with regard to products produced by reformatories, the policy of  the Chinese Government is clear: Reformatory-operated  businesses do not have the right to carry out economic and trade  activities with foreign countries or to conduct import-export  business. China has been strictly abiding by the ""Memorandum of  Understanding on Banning the Import and Export of  Prison-Produced Products"" ever since it was signed by China and  the United States. Facts are the most convincing proof.     "
0,FT934-5543 ,"FT934-5543 _AN-DLACFAISFT 931129   FT  29 NOV 93 / Mahathir row with Keating intensifies      By KIERAN COOKE      KUALA LUMPUR   Blunt-talking Australian politicians have often ruffled the sensitivities of neighbouring governments in southeast Asia. But, now, just as Australia is making a big push to become more interlinked with the dynamic economies of the region, the country's straight-talking prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, has provoked a row with Malaysia. Mr Keating has been critical of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's non-appearance at the recent Apec summit, and Malaysia struck back at the weekend. Dr Mahathir had said that he did not attend the summit because certain countries, mainly the US and Australia, were trying to railroad Apec into becoming a organisation structured along the lines of the European Union. 'Please don't ask me any more questions about Dr Mahathir,' Mr Keating said to the Australian press corps. 'I couldn't care less, frankly, whether he comes or not. I am sick of. . . questions about Dr Mahathir. . . Apec is bigger than all of us. . . Australia, the US, Malaysia, Dr Mahathir and any other recalcitrants.' At the weekend, Mr Mohamad Rachmat, Malaysia's information minister, announced that Malaysia would be banning Australian-made TV programmes and advertising material and that Malaysia's state-controlled broadcasting service would be reporting only negative news about Australia. 'This,' he said, 'is to tell the Australian government and media that what was said by Keating was not only an insult to our prime minister but also to the Malaysian people and to the country.' He insisted that Mr Keating publicly apologise. Dr Mahathir, himself not averse to the occasional undiplomatic verbal thrust, said that he was disappointed with Mr Keating but chose to lay most of the blame on the Australian media: 'Some newspapers made me out to be a difficult person and very unpopular and that Malaysia was about to burst into racial violence.' Australia's claim to be part of Asia was meaningless. 'How', he asked, 'can Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack manners? It is difficult for us to love Australia.' While the Malaysian media and political opposition also joined in the war of words, the row will probably be resolved by diplomacy. Mr Keating, due for an official visit to Malaysia next year, has made closer relations with southeast Asia the central point of his government's economic and foreign policy. 'For the first time,' says Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, 'Australia is paying more attention to its geography than its history.' Australian exports to the region have been growing rapidly. Two-way trade with Malaysia rose more than 30 per cent in 1992-93 to ADollars 2.3bn (Dollars 1.6bn), with Australia showing a healthy surplus. Australian investors are involved in several big projects in Malaysia, particularly in the mining and petrochemical sectors. But Australia's relations with its Asian neighbours are never easy. Relations with Indonesia have only recently improved. A few years Malaysia took offence over an Australian TV series which depicted life in an Australian embassy. Kuala Lumpur said the series was modelled on Malaysia and was very insulting. 'It's a clash of styles' says a Malaysian academic who studied in Australia. 'Australia's politicians and its press can say anything they want. We have to be a lot more careful about what we talk about. Australians are going to find life very difficult as Asians.'

Goyoaga]    [Text] According to Lower House Foreign Relations Committee  chairman Florencio Acenolaza, the existence of oil around the  Malvinas has not been proven and if any were to be found, the  amount would be so small and the difficulties of exploitation so  extraordinary that it would not be commercially viable.    The existence of oil in the Malvinas has been a source of  conflict between Argentina and Britain. The UK (as published by  the Herald) recently announced a major oil industry impact study  but the Argentine deputy denounces the existence of oil as ""a  lie and a political maneuver to manipulate Argentina when  discussing fisheries or sovereignty. This (manipulation) is not  only encouraged by the Foreign Office but also by people in this  country who wish to change current Argentine policy.""    Acenolaza believes that the existing oil basins are all  under  Argentine territorial jurisdiction and exploitation conditions  are the most difficult in the world -- so difficult that oil  prices would be as high as $50 per barrel when world prices are  under 15.    ""The existence of oil is an invention of British authorities  as a strategy to gain a better position when discussing  fisheries or sovereignty. It is untrue and a blatant lie that  there is oil in the Malvinas. The UK is manipulating  information aimed at confusing public opinion over the real  possibility of finding oil in the islands.""    Deputy Acenolaza, himself a geologist, underlines that  former  state oil company YPF had prospected in the Malvinas and the  existence of oil could not be proven. On this subject, YPF  spokesman Juan Carlos Ferrari declined comment, explaining that  the company ""does not have or give any information regarding oil  in the Malvinas."" He also added that in 1933 a member of the  Foreign Office had said that there was no oil in Saudi Arabia.    ""Geologists know that geological conditions to certify the  existence of oil-fields in the Malvinas do not exist. Both  islands are made of Paleozoic rock, which lack the natural raw  material to generate hydrocarbons. The stratographic base, made  of crystalline rocks, has a natural incapacity to hold  hydrocarbons. It is equally impossible with the quartz or sandy  rocks which make up the greater part of the territory.""    The deputy also underlined that in the South Atlantic and  the  British exclusion zone there are two oil basins dating back to  Jurassic times, which correspond to the geological formation of  the Patagonian oil basins.    He recognizes the existence of three oil basins with  insignificant amounts of oil. The ""Cuenca de Malvinas"" basin to  the southwest of the islands was surveyed by a concession which  discovered oil and gas only in two wells (Ciclon XI and Salmon  XII) but in such small quantities that it did not justify  exploitation. The geological information of the ""Banco Burwood""  basin to the Northwest is reportedly so limited that no  guarantee for the existence of hydrocarbons can be given. In  the third basin -- ""Cuenca de San Julian"" -- the sedimentary  depths hardly reach 2,500 meters and the existence of  ""generating rocks"" for oil has not been proven.    According to the deputy, the barometric and weather  conditions of the three basins together with the low price of  oil make the possibilities of finding oil in the Malvinas  irrelevant.     "

John Morrell & Co. on Monday imposed a contract cutting the wages of 2,000  workers by up to 18% at its strife-torn meatpacking plant.    The union said it would not strike despite a near-unanimous vote against the  contract, which one leader said destroyed 50 years of bargaining.    The plant has long been a focus of discord, with violent strikes, lawsuits  filed by management and the union and huge fines for safety violations.    The old contract expired Nov. 20, and the company had renewed it on a daily  basis. But on Thursday, Morrell declared that talks with the union had reached  an impasse, allowing it to impose its own contract.      Strike 'Not in Best Interest'    Members of the Food & Commercial Workers union met on Sunday, and ""over  99%"" of those voting rejected the contract, said Jim Lyons, local president.    Lyons said a strike would not be in the best interest of the union because it  could negate back pay awards or unfair labor practice complaints. More than  half the plant's workers are replacements hired during a 1987 strike.    The union said it would file a complaint of unfair labor practices against  Morrell. On Friday, company officials said they had filed a National Labor  Relations Board complaint charging the union with bad-faith bargaining.    The contract cut wages at the plant from $9.75 an hour to $8 an hour. Benefits  and seniority also were cut.    The four-year contract ""virtually destroys 50 years of bargaining"" and will  ruin the standard of living for Morrell workers, Lyons said.    ""It's probably the worst contract that's ever been put forward,"" said Bob  Stuerman, a Morrell employee. ""We were at the top of the heap, and that brings  us down to the bottom.""    The contract is not out of line with the meatpacking industry, said Raoul  Baxter, Morrell executive vice president. ""If we really wanted to punish them,  we would have taken them down to $6, which is the real thing out there,"" he  said.    ""We would hope they would recognize our need to be competitive and make a  recommendation to help us get there,"" company negotiator Brad Johnson said  Sunday night. ""But I see no reason for optimism.""      Award Challenged    More than 200 of the plant's workers are union members who crossed picket lines  thrown up in 1987 by striking workers from Morrell's plant at Sioux City, Iowa.  About 600 union members were called back to work after the strike, and more  than 1,100 replacement workers hired during the strike are on the payroll.    The replacements were making $9.25 an hour before Monday's cut.    In November, an arbitrator ruled that the sympathy strike was legal, that all  strikers should be returned to work and that Morrell owed more than $40 million  in back pay. Morrell has challenged the award in federal court.    Also last year, a federal jury awarded the company $24.6 million in damages for  what the panel decided were three illegal sympathy strikes.    Morrell also is fighting a $4.3-million fine, the largest ever against a single  employer by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

0,FT932-15180 ,"FT932-15180 _AN-DDOCIABAFT 930415   FT  15 APR 93 / US isolation grows over Vietnam      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   THE 'road map' set out by former President George Bush for normalising relations between Vietnam and the US has already led the two countries into a few dead ends and several potholes. The discovery in Moscow of a document apparently showing that Vietnam may have held twice as many US prisoners of war as it ever admitted seems sure to throw another obstacle in the way of their awkward march towards full links. While US policy towards Vietnam is officially under review, it has been widely assumed in Washington - although without any explicit statement from President Bill Clinton himself - that the new administration would not depart dramatically from the Bush road map. This set out a phased progression to lifting the US trade embargo and establishing full dramatic relations in exchange for Vietnam's co-operation on accounting for US servicemen listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war and on the UN sponsored peace process in neighbouring Cambodia. The next phase foreseen in the road map would involve the US lifting its trade embargo against Vietnam, ending its opposition to reinstating the country in the International Monetary Fund and supporting loans by the IMF and the World Bank for basic human needs. The US is growing more and more isolated in its insistence on maintaining an embargo against Vietnam. Other western nations, which have until now held back out of deference to the US from helping Vietnam back into the IMF, now seem increasingly inclined to press ahead willy nilly. A support group led by France stands ready to provide a bridging loan to pay off Vietnam's arrears to the IMF of around Dollars 140m (Pounds 92m). Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, has made it clear he feels Hanoi's economic policies would already qualify it for normal IMF financing, allowing it to repay this bridging loan. This, in turn, would pave the way for World Bank infrastructure lending which Vietnam sorely needs. The support group had been expected to meet during the IMF's spring meetings later this month. Until the prisoners of war document surfaced in Moscow this week, Fund officials had expected the Clinton administration to signal its acceptance of Vietnam's reinstatement by lifting the embargo. Such a move now appears, in the short term at least, to be politically impossible for Mr Clinton: whether or not the Moscow document is authentic - and the Vietnamese are not alone in crying 'forgery' - it has the ring of truth to a substantial body of US opinion, which is unlikely ever to be reconciled to the probability that no MIAs are still held in Vietnam. Opinion in the Senate, however, is increasingly shifting towards the view that the best way of ensuring progress on MIA issues, as well as on other US concerns such as human rights violations in Vietnam, is to establish closer relations. Senator Claiborne Pell, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, and Senator Richard Lugar, his Republican opposite number, wrote together last month to urge Mr Clinton to lift the embargo. 'We believe that an aggressive and enlightened bilateral and multilateral dialogue with Vietnam will eventually result in democratic change in Vietnam and achieve a more complete resolution of the POW/MIA issue,' they wrote.

Part of the Seimas building is rented for  the head of state.    Brazauskas has spent more than one year in this office.  He arrived here when he was elected chairman of the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in January 1990. After  the elections in the fall of 1992 Brazauskas became chairman of  the Seimas and acting President of the Lithuanian Republic,  which brought him back to this office. On 14 February 1993,  receiving 60 percent of the votes in the election, Brazauskas  took the post of President of Lithuania.    [Pyadyshev] Russia's relations with the Baltic republics are  far from happy. Against this general background there is more  tranquility and realism in Russian-Lithuanian affairs. The  fundamental issues of mutual relations were already settled last  year.    The surface layer of Russian-Lithuanian relations is,  however, fragile. There was a recent flare-up because of delay  in implementation of the agreement on trade and economic  relations. You, Mr. President, are complaining that you have  been unsuccessful in trying to get a call through to the  Kremlin. You sent a message to the Russian President about this.  Your displeasure flowed over into your speech in the  parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.    [Brazauskas] The evening before my visit to Strasbourg,  where  I spoke in the parliament of the Council of Europe, I talked by  telephone with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a  constructive conversation. I also exchanged messages with  President Boris Yeltsin. I think that there are possibilities of  eliminating those difficulties in our relations that have  appeared recently.    Overall the present state of relations between Lithuania and  Russia, despite the existing difficulties, can be described as  good. They are developing in the direction outlined by the 29  July 1991 treaty and the 30 August 1993 Joint Declaration of the  Presidents of Russia and Lithuania.    The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to  Lithuania, during which a whole package of 10 agreements was  signed, was also very important. One of the main agreements was  the trade and economic agreement on most favored nation status.  Unfortunately, it has not gone into effect yet. Lithuania has  fulfilled its treaty obligations; now it is Russia's turn. It is  mutually disadvantageous and unprofitable that, even though the  treaty has been signed, the name of Lithuania is not found in  the long list of more than 130 countries with which Russia  carries on free trade and trade on a most favored nation basis.  In my opinion, there is no future in that kind of economic  pressure.    [Pyadyshev] Moscow has its own reason for this. You were  exactly right that the agreements signed constitute a package  and thus should be realized as a package, in an integrated  manner. As I understand it, what they are waiting for from the  Lithuanian side is a solution to issues related to the vitality  of Kaliningrad Oblast, above all the question of transit travel.    [Brazauskas] It is natural that Russia wants to serve some  of  its interests related to Kaliningrad Oblast by collaboration  with Lithuania. This includes the movement of people and transit  shipment of various goods and freight across Lithuanian  territory. In addition, most of the electricity and food  consumed in the oblast is produced in Lithuania. We both have an  interest in formalizing these and other areas of collaboration  in agreements and treaties. Thus, many of the 10  Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed on 18 November 1993  concerned Kaliningrad Oblast directly.    In Lithuania you hear arguments about the future status of  Kaliningrad Oblast and revision of the decisions of the Potsdam  Conference fairly often in the press and even in the statements  of some political figures. They question Russian sovereignty  over Kaliningrad Oblast and clearly go beyond scholarly debate.  I can assure you that this is not the position of Lithuania.    However, we are not indifferent to the future political and  economic development of the oblast. I will not deny that we  would like it better if Russia developed this oblast in the  direction of Hong Kong (a free trade-economic zone), and not  like, for example, Gibraltar (a military fortress). We are happy  that at present, despite the well-known troubles with placement  of Russian troops being withdrawn from Europe, both Moscow and  Kaliningrad are more inclined to the first alternative.    Polish President Lech Walesa recently visited Vilnius. He  and  I exchanged opinions about transit traffic to Kaliningrad  Oblast; by land, of course, it goes either through Lithuania or  through Poland. Our opinion was the same: if transit traffic is  carried on in conformity with the laws of the sovereign  countries, following international rules, and if it is  economically beneficial, it can only be welcomed and will prove  advantageous to the corresponding countries. But if we are  talking about uncontrolled transit traffic, about some kind of  corridors (for understandable reasons this word sounds harsh to  the ears of our Polish partners), that is an entirely different  matter. That is unacceptable.    [Pyadyshev] Most of the people in Russia think that in  Lithuania, unlike the situation in some other countries, there  are basically no problems on the state and political levels with  ensuring the rights of the Russian-speaking population.    [Brazauskas] Yes, the postwar demographic, social, and  economic development, finally, plus the historical tolerance in  Lithuanian society, have not created ethnic problems in  Lithuania. We have been able to move to so-called positive  discrimination in relation to ethnic minorities in some fields.  This means that more favorable conditions are created for the  ethnic minorities than for the main people. We intend to hold to  this policy in the future as well.    We have the following demographic ratio: 80 percent  Lithuanians and 9 percent Russians. We do not see any problems.  And what is being done in Latvia and Estonia? I simply cannot  justify the fact that such unacceptable measures for our  democratic world are being adopted there. But on the other hand,  why can't we understand this attitude, when only about half the  people left are Latvians? In general, the question arises: What  is an ethnic minority?    [Pyadyshev] All states, large and small, are equal before  God  and before the U.N. Charter. But we must take account of the  historical fate of each country, its geopolitical status...    [Brazauskas] The history of the Lithuanian state is very  complex, especially the last 200 years since the third partition  of the Rzeczpospolita [Republic] in 1795. Lithuania was a part  of that state, and after that it belonged to Russia. Before this  there were quite complex relations with Poland, with which  Lithuania lived in union for some 200 years. Almost two  centuries as part of the tsarist empire, then the Soviet Union,  with the exception of 20 years. This left its mark.    I remember, not in reproach of course, Mikhail Sergeyevich  Gorbachev, who once said to me: ""Listen, what is this  independence to you? What do you need it for? You've lived  together with this large, great country, and you'll keep on  living that way.""    What does this tell us? Even people on such a high level,  educated, enormously experienced, have difficulty understanding  the mood and spirit of the people. Lithuania is a small country.  We have 3 million Lithuanians in the country, and another 1  million abroad. But our national spirit is not disappearing; it  assists the state formation of this small people to endure its  trials.    In no way do we support national states as pure-blooded  states. We have many nationalities; that is how history  developed. We find a common language with them. There are  misunderstandings, of course, but they are the kind that can be  resolved by normal methods and means. I cannot say that we are  on the frontier. Of course, dealings with Holland, Belgium, and  Austria are a different matter. Relations there have been  developing for hundreds of years.    We are aware of the attention we are receiving, especially  from small states, for example Denmark and the other  Scandinavian countries. Of course, we do not wait with  outstretched hands for someone to rescue us, to prop up our  life. We figure to satisfy 2-5 percent of our needs with  assistance. Everything else we must do ourselves.    [Pyadyshev] After a certain period of silence the United  States and other Western countries have returned to their former  arguments about Russia's imperial ambitions, by which they mean  the interests of present-day Russia in the regions of the former  Soviet Union. One wonders: What is news about that, that Russia  really has its own interests in territories with which it was  joined in the USSR and in which many connecting lines have  remained--economic, political, cultural, and ethnic? It would be  strange if people were talking about the absence of such  interests. Moreover, some are saying, with good grounds, that a  risky situation would be created if Russia were to renounce its  special interests in these regions.    [Brazauskas] I agree with you that there are such interests.  But when a high-ranking Russian official states that the Baltic  countries are the near abroad, that is a different matter. You  cannot stop and leave the field open for each person to  speculate and interpret these interests in his own way. But the  way you put it, I agree.    Lithuania also has interests in Russia. And they are not at  all aggressive. Normal neighborly relations in a very broad  spectrum. Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Mr. Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr.  Pavel Grachev have also sat at this table. In my opinion we  found a common language. We found agreement and discussed  matters.    Of course, over 50 years the economic integration was  enormous, and a policy of deep specialization, large-scale  construction projects, and large enterprises was followed. We  continue to feel this today. Those kinds of interests I  understand.    But you know, when a high official talks about permanent  interests in the Baltic region it leads me to various thoughts.  There are people who are using this for their own ends. The  discussion here must, of course, be carried through to the end.    [Pyadyshev] Apparently you have in mind the RF minister of  foreign affairs' speech at a meeting at the ministry. An uproar  began after that, but explanations were later given.    [Brazauskas] When things are explained ""later,"" it often  fails to achieve the desired end...    [Pyadyshev] It was clarified that the journalist who  attended  the meeting had presented the minister's words inaccurately.    [Brazauskas] Judge for yourself, we get information, perhaps  distorted, but we cannot check it for ourselves. This phrase is  used about us, the ""near abroad."" Basically, what does this  mean, the near abroad? What is understood by this?    [Pyadyshev] I assure you that the Baltic region was not  included in the near abroad at that meeting--and I attended  it--or anywhere else. This term encompasses a very definite  group of countries, which constitute the CIS...    But let us turn to another subject. You mentioned Mikhail  Sergeyevich Gorbachev. How did your relations with him take  shape when you were first secretary of the Central Committee of  the Lithuanian Communist Party?    [Brazauskas] I am not the judge, of course, but it is my  personal impression that he gave in to a rock-hard politburo.  And did not undertake to restructure our life. Something was  always holding him back. But life was already demanding a new  approach, new solutions within the state, and a certain freedom  in the activity of public and even party organizations. Where  did it begin among us? As first secretary I made a firm demand  that party organizations be given autonomy. But the Central  Committee, especially the organizational department, was still  filled with people who longed for the old days, Razumov,  Razumovskiy, Yegor Kuzmich.    They always said that the politburo was a monolith, a  monolith. But this monolith fell into pieces. If we had gone to  a multiparty system it would not have been so dramatic. When our  first rally was organized a shout went up to expel certain  people from the party. Pugo gave me a list then of 10 people who  had expressed their opinions. They sent a commission and  terrorized us for a whole month. ""Why aren't you responding  according to the party line?"" But how can you say that when life  has completely changed? The party leadership did not see this  or, possibly, certain people saw it but were afraid to say it.  Finally we expelled ourselves, and then after that they expelled  us at the politburo.    Incidentally, have you read my book ""Divorce Lithuanian  Style""? In it I tried to present the events of that period as  fully as possible.    [Pyadyshev] How do you see the results of the Brazauskas  presidency by the time it concludes?    [Brazauskas] I have only been president for a year, and of  course, it is very difficult to guess far into the future. Today  we can only engage in fantasy. If we are able to preserve a  consistently working government we will achieve tangible  results. Instability of the executive power produces poor  results. That is my goal. Of course, we cannot avoid the  replacement of certain ministers. But under our Constitution if  more than half of them are replaced then the parliament must  give the government a vote of confidence. We will have to do  that, and we will do it. Therefore I attach great importance to  the work of the government and to work with the government. With  the Cabinet of Ministers. We have very close  ties--consultations, discussions of particular issues. The prime  minister visits me 4-5 times a week. I drop in to his office.  That is a mandatory condition. But I never work for them and I  do not issue any ukases, although I do have certain powers.     "

Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, last month announced his intention to set specific targets for reducing the death toll from the main killer diseases. Saturday's meeting will examine ways of achieving the targets and encouraging healthier lifestyles. Relations between the government and medical profession developed into outright hostility during the battles over the government's National Health Service reforms, which took effect this month. The atmosphere has improved since Mr Major became prime minister, and his decision to invite leading doctors and other health specialists to the Chequers meeting is further evidence of that. The proposed health targets will contribute to a World Health Organisation international programme designed to reduce health inequalities within and between nations by the year 2000. Initiatives are running in Wales and some English cities, but until now there has been no overall programme. Debates about the causes of health inequalities - which many health promotion specialists believe are strongly linked to economic circumstances  -have proved politically controversial in the past. There were indications yesterday that the arguments would be revived by the government's latest plans. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, yesterday circulated a draft of the government's proposals and said they contained no commitment to action by ministers to achieve the targets. 'This document barely acknowledges that people who are poor are more likely to be in poor health, and offers not a single target to reduce the health gap between rich and poor,' he said. The government hopes that its NHS reforms, which have separated the financing of health care from its provision, will encourage purchasing health authorities to determine their populations' health priorities and allocate resources accordingly. Many of the lifestyle issues covered by the government's proposed health targets are related to factors such as diet and smoking habits. Mr Michael O'Connor, director of the Coronary Prevention Group, said the government would be countering its own aims of improving the nation's health if it continued to oppose EC proposals to ban cigarette advertising. The overall health of the British population, measured in terms of mortality rates, is improving but there are still big regional and local variations. Health shortcomings are frequently associated with other social factors such as poor housing and consequently economic circumstances. Although the explanations for health variations are complex, a number of recent studies have argued that there is a powerful link between the quality of health and deprivation. One of them, a study of London in the 1980s, showed that death rates among middle-aged men in the capital's inner-city boroughs were double those of the more affluent outer districts.

0,FT931-6164 ,"FT931-6164 _AN-DCCCKAA9FT 930303   FT  03 MAR 93 / Relations between UK and Iran dip further      By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor   THE sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations between Iran and Britain, caused mainly by the row over the author Mr Salman Rushdie, is threatening to spill over into the commercial field. The decision by Iran this week to begin charging Pounds 504 for visas for UK businessmen visiting Tehran is posing doubts over future trade missions, while the latest British restrictions on the export of sensitive material may spark further Iranian retaliation. Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, was called to the Foreign Office yesterday to be told that the Department of Trade and Industry would not approve licences for items on international lists of banned military or atomic energy equipment. Iran has strenuously denied accusations that it is seeking to build nuclear weapons, but admits it would like to acquire nuclear technology for civil purposes. It also claims its military re-equipment is much smaller than other countries in the region. The Iranian embassy in London said yesterday the decision to charge Pounds 504 for a visa, as against the Pounds 14 it levied previously, was direct retaliation for a similar rise in charges made by Britain last year. British officials insist however that the Pounds 20 charged for a visa in Tehran is in line with other European countries. The change made by Britain was to calculate the visa charge at the free market rate of exchange, instead of the old official rate. This meant that in terms of Iranian rials the cost went up from R1,200 to R50,000. A central economic reform instigated by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani has been to move more of Iran's foreign transactions on to the free market rate of exchange. An Iranian official said the new charge would apply to everyone applying for a visa in London, but there might eventually be exceptions. The decision is causing the London of Chamber of Commerce to reconsider a trade mission to Iran planned for May. Some 15 companies have signed up for the trip with another 25 registered as possible participants. In January, the Energy Industries Council was forced to abandon a similar mission to Iran when approval for visas failed to materialise. UK and Iranian officials say the row over visa charges is distinct from the clash over the death penalty passed by Iran on Mr Salman Rushdie over the publication of his book The Satanic Verses. The British government's decision to give greater publicity to Mr Rushdie's plight has clearly angered the Iranians. In the past fortnight, Ayatollah Ali Sayed Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has thrown his weight behind the fatwa, or religious ruling, against Mr Rushdie and this was later supported by the Iranian parliament. The issue will be given further prominence when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, carries out his promise to meet Mr Rushdie. Iran has been an increasingly attractive market for Britain, with exports up by 20 per cent to Dollars 840m (Pounds 577m) in the first nine months of last year. But with Iran falling further behind in paying letters of credit and oil revenues static, ministers in Tehran have warned of a cut of up to 50 per cent in imports for the financial year beginning March 21.

0,FT921-258 ,"FT921-258 _AN-CC3A2AEOFT 920330   FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Pay issue set high on agenda - Minimum wage sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over expense      By JOHN THORNHILL   THE POLITICAL battle-lines are firmly drawn over Labour's plan to introduce a national minimum wage, but many observers in industry believe much of the debate is sound and fury signifying little. Supporters believe the minimum wage would lead to more equitable distribution of income for the estimated 4.5m employees in the UK paid less than Labour's proposed minimum of Pounds 3.40 an hour. Critics say it is a sure-fire recipe for lost jobs and would lead to an inflationary wage spiral. Mr Michael Howard, employment minister, speaking on a BBC election phone-in radio programme last week, argued that the minimum wage would not succeed in helping those people it was designed to help and might destroy up to 2m jobs if employers sought to maintain pay differentials. 'Is it better for someone to work at Pounds 3.06 an hour or not at all?' he asked one caller. However, a survey published last week by Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay research group, found that most personnel managers seemingly did not share such views and were 'not particularly hostile' to the plan. Of 527 companies surveyed, 41.3 per cent were opposed in principle, 31.5 per cent had no strong opinion and 27.2 per cent supported it. The survey said job losses would 'probably be far more limited than the government predictions would suggest'. Not surprisingly, the trade unions are strongly in favour. Mr Pat Jones, a spokesman for Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, said the suggestion that it would lead to job losses was 'absolute rubbish'. He said: 'The same argument was used before the introduction of the wages council in the 1940s and there was never any evidence to support it.' There is a widespread feeling in the City, at least, that the minimum wage is a sop to the Labour left and may even be quietly abandoned. They point to apparent back-sliding, with the suggestion that its introduction would be deferred for a year. 'The Liberal Democrats are not in favour of the minimum wage and, if you assume we will be in the grey middle-ground of coalitions after the election, then it might be a issue Labour is prepared to give ground on,' says Mr Alun Jones, head of quantitative research at stockbroker UBS Phillips  Drew and co-author of a study of Labour's economic proposals. City analysts say the leisure, textiles, stores, brewing and food manufacturing sectors would be most affected by a minimum wage. Yet the effects of a minimum wage are probably impossible to calculate. It would not immediately compel companies to sack droves of employees; there would be more subtle attempts to adjust recruitment practices, trim working hours, and review the grading structures.

Mark Lawson demanded last week after  somebody fired a small-caliber rifle at a Greyhound bus that was carrying him  and 50 other people between Roanoke and Christiansburg, Va.    That question is being asked with increasing desperation in the wake of 21  reported bus-sniping incidents -- two of which have caused injuries to  passengers -- during the 3-week-old strike by 9,000 Greyhound drivers and other  members of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Locals.    If the polarized history of American labor relations is any judge, no one is  likely to find a satisfactory answer.    Greyhound, echoing generations of employers who view organized labor as a  ""cartel"" that uses strike violence to keep wages artificially high, claims the  shootings are orchestrated by union leaders to discourage ridership.    The Greyhound locals, echoing generations of union leaders who believe much  strike violence is provoked by management, claim the shootings are the work of  a handful of ""fruitcakes,"" as one Los Angeles striker described them.    However, according to the few academics who have studied patterns of strike  violence, there is little reason to be surprised that the Greyhound strike has  grown so nasty. Although no more than 5% to 10% of strikes involve violence to  people or property, according to various estimates, the nature of the Greyhound  strike makes it a virtual breeding ground for an eruption.    The strikers -- unable to slow down the pace of replacement hiring and unable  to draw their employer back to the negotiating table -- suffer from an intense  ""vulnerability"" that classically motivates most strike violence, said Michael  Wallace, an Ohio State University sociology professor who co-authored an  article on strike violence to be published later this year in the American  Journal of Sociology.    Dispassionate observations like Wallace's are rarely part of a strike. Strike  violence seems to defy such analysis because it traditionally takes place in  war-like settings in which the propaganda arms of management and labor struggle  for public sympathy.    Wallace and co-author Don Sherman Grant said strikes become violent because  unions exist in ""ambiguous circumstances."" In contrast to ""outsider"" groups  seeking political recognition, such as 1960s student demonstrators, unions are  ""weak insiders"" -- part of the system but always at risk of losing ground.    Unions, which have won only marginal public acceptance as a vital institution,  cannot afford to employ violence in an offensive manner without ""alienating  allies and sympathizers,"" Wallace and Sherman said. ""However, if their position  within the system weakens to the point that past gains are jeopardized,"" or if  ""the union's very existence is jeopardized,"" violence may be employed by  frustrated union members.    Wallace said the Greyhound strike meets virtually every test of such a  scenario:    * It involves workers who can be relatively easily replaced, as opposed to auto  workers or aerospace machinists, whose training is more extensive and  specialized.    * It involves an employer who has continued operating, the tactic ""most likely  to provoke a violent response."" Greyhound has been hiring permanent  replacements, not merely strikebreakers. As a result strikers may not get their  jobs back unless the National Labor Relations Board upholds an unfair labor  practices complaint. By contrast, the last time Greyhound was struck in 1983,  its owners responded slowly and were forced to shut the system down entirely  for two weeks before gradually resuming operation with replacements.    * The people who pose the most direct threat to the union -- the 1,100  replacement drivers and a far smaller number of union drivers who have crossed  the picket line -- are spread across the country, rather than concentrated at a  single work site. That creates unlimited potential for attacks on isolated  targets.    * The longer a strike is prolonged while the company stays open, the worse the  union's chances look. As the strike entered its fourth week Friday, Greyhound  was showing little enthusiasm for resuming negotiations, and many strikers had  already been forced to seek part-time jobs to support themselves.    * Strikers were on the defensive even before they struck. Their union had  accepted wage cuts of 8% and 23% in the 1983 and 1987 contracts in response to  company pleas that Greyhound could not survive in a deregulated market unless  it cut fares. The current strike came when workers demanded some of the money  back.    * Strikers have suffered the only fatality of the strike. Veteran driver Robert  Waterhouse was killed on the second day of the strike when a bus driven by a  replacement worker pinned him against the wall at a bus depot in Redding. No  criminal charges have yet been filed against the driver.    Neil N. Bernstein, a labor law professor at Washington University in St. Louis,  suggested that the shooting at buses is a last-ditch effort to discourage what  he called ""a stampede"" of picket-line crossing by union drivers.

That's what in my mind makes the whole thing very  troublesome.""    Bernstein said a 1985 Supreme Court ruling allowing union members to resign  from their union during a strike and return to work without having to pay heavy  union fines took away a union's traditional power over its membership. ""The  unions have no legal recourse to save their integrity and their supporters'  jobs,"" he said. ""The only thing they can do is resort to illegal tactics. . . .  It's a clear sign that the system has broken down.""    That Supreme Court ruling is only one of a variety of rulings by courts and the  National Labor Relations Board in the last decade that have weakened the  institutional power of unions. These changes, along with more aggressive  tactics on the part of employers -- including the hiring of replacement workers  instead of temporary strikebreakers -- are responsible for a drastic decrease  in the frequency of strikes. They are also responsible, organized labor leaders  say, for considerable frustration.    Greyhound passengers, many of whom continue to ride the strike-plagued system  because they cannot afford alternatives, have been relatively lucky. Although  many of the shots have pierced bus windows, the only serious injuries occurred  March 11 when glass and bullet fragments hospitalized seven passengers on a bus  near Jacksonville, Fla. So far only one union member has been arrested. He has  been charged with shooting at a bus in Connecticut.    As a brief attempt at renewed negotiations fell apart last week, both sides in  the strike portrayed themselves as victims of intentional violence.    Greyhound executives flatly accused union leaders of sanctioning ""acts of  terrorism,"" ranging from the shootings to nearly 50 bomb threats. Union leaders  accused Greyhound's replacement drivers of running their buses into nearly 50  bus-terminal pickets. Greyhound said it would not talk to union negotiators  until the shooting stopped. Union leaders said they had condemned the violence  and called Greyhound's demand a dishonest justification for the company's  intransigence.    James Fox, professor of criminology at Northeastern University, said union  members who commit violence during strikes ""aren't necessarily violence-prone,  but given the right conditions they can justify violence, the same way we  rationalize it in wartime.    ""Scabs are the enemy. Where the usually violent person is more expressive --  violence makes him feel good, he gets a feeling of control, of power -- this  kind of (strike) violence is instrumental violence.

Robert Bleiweiss, a Calabasas union consultant, said he was offended at the  suggestion made frequently by opponents of unions that unions are particularly  prone to violence.    ""Violence is an integral part of the American psyche,"" he said. ""We talk a good  game about being pacifistic, and nonviolence is very much in the vocabulary.  But when you examine any era in American history, when people want something  passionately enough, they fight for it. It's unfair to say that just labor  unions do this. Violence in America is a cultural thing. We send our children  to movies at age 6 and they learn it's perfectly all right to carry a gun and  use it before the end of the movie.""    Management lobbyists, led by the anti-union National Right to Work Legal  Defense Foundation, have long insisted that changes in federal law are needed  to crack down on strike violence. They have pushed unsuccessfully for a bill  that would make strike violence punishable by laws covering extortion.

Mark Lawson demanded last week after  somebody fired a small-caliber rifle at a Greyhound bus that was carrying him  and 50 other people between Roanoke and Christiansburg, Va.    That question is being asked with increasing desperation in the wake of 21  reported bus-sniping incidents -- two of which have caused injuries to  passengers -- during the 3-week-old strike by 9,000 Greyhound drivers and other  members of the Amalgamated Council of Greyhound Locals.    If the polarized history of American labor relations is any judge, no one is  likely to find a satisfactory answer.    Greyhound, echoing generations of employers who view organized labor as a  ""cartel"" that uses strike violence to keep wages artificially high, claims the  shootings are orchestrated by union leaders to discourage ridership.    The Greyhound locals, echoing generations of union leaders who believe much  strike violence is provoked by management, claim the shootings are the work of  a handful of ""fruitcakes,"" as one Los Angeles striker described them.    However, according to the few academics who have studied patterns of strike  violence, there is little reason to be surprised that the Greyhound strike has  grown so nasty. Although no more than 5% to 10% of strikes involve violence to  people or property, according to various estimates, the nature of the Greyhound  strike makes it a virtual breeding ground for an eruption.    The strikers -- unable to slow down the pace of replacement hiring and unable  to draw their employer back to the negotiating table -- suffer from an intense  ""vulnerability"" that classically motivates most strike violence, said Michael  Wallace, an Ohio State University sociology professor who co-authored an  article on strike violence to be published later this year in the American  Journal of Sociology.    Dispassionate observations like Wallace's are rarely part of a strike. Strike  violence seems to defy such analysis because it traditionally takes place in  war-like settings in which the propaganda arms of management and labor struggle  for public sympathy.    Wallace and co-author Don Sherman Grant said strikes become violent because  unions exist in ""ambiguous circumstances."" In contrast to ""outsider"" groups  seeking political recognition, such as 1960s student demonstrators, unions are  ""weak insiders"" -- part of the system but always at risk of losing ground.    Unions, which have won only marginal public acceptance as a vital institution,  cannot afford to employ violence in an offensive manner without ""alienating  allies and sympathizers,"" Wallace and Sherman said. ""However, if their position  within the system weakens to the point that past gains are jeopardized,"" or if  ""the union's very existence is jeopardized,"" violence may be employed by  frustrated union members.    Wallace said the Greyhound strike meets virtually every test of such a  scenario:    * It involves workers who can be relatively easily replaced, as opposed to auto  workers or aerospace machinists, whose training is more extensive and  specialized.    * It involves an employer who has continued operating, the tactic ""most likely  to provoke a violent response."" Greyhound has been hiring permanent  replacements, not merely strikebreakers. As a result strikers may not get their  jobs back unless the National Labor Relations Board upholds an unfair labor  practices complaint. By contrast, the last time Greyhound was struck in 1983,  its owners responded slowly and were forced to shut the system down entirely  for two weeks before gradually resuming operation with replacements.    * The people who pose the most direct threat to the union -- the 1,100  replacement drivers and a far smaller number of union drivers who have crossed  the picket line -- are spread across the country, rather than concentrated at a  single work site. That creates unlimited potential for attacks on isolated  targets.    * The longer a strike is prolonged while the company stays open, the worse the  union's chances look. As the strike entered its fourth week Friday, Greyhound  was showing little enthusiasm for resuming negotiations, and many strikers had  already been forced to seek part-time jobs to support themselves.    * Strikers were on the defensive even before they struck. Their union had  accepted wage cuts of 8% and 23% in the 1983 and 1987 contracts in response to  company pleas that Greyhound could not survive in a deregulated market unless  it cut fares. The current strike came when workers demanded some of the money  back.    * Strikers have suffered the only fatality of the strike. Veteran driver Robert  Waterhouse was killed on the second day of the strike when a bus driven by a  replacement worker pinned him against the wall at a bus depot in Redding. No  criminal charges have yet been filed against the driver.    Neil N. Bernstein, a labor law professor at Washington University in St. Louis,  suggested that the shooting at buses is a last-ditch effort to discourage what  he called ""a stampede"" of picket-line crossing by union drivers.    ""If it hadn't been for people shooting at buses, you would have had a  substantial amount of (crossing) by now,"" he said. ""That's what's really  holding the strike together. That's what in my mind makes the whole thing very  troublesome.""

Friday's vote -- which may eventually be nullified by a lawsuit filed against  the Archdiocese of Los Angeles by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers  Union -- further embittered relations between organized labor and Archbishop  Roger M.

Mahony announced last week that he was breaking off negotiations with the  textile workers union, which assumed it had won bargaining rights on behalf of  150 cemetery workers through November.    Mahony called a new election after saying he had received petitions from scores  of workers saying they no longer wanted union representation.    Twenty-four voted in favor of maintaining unionization and 92 against in the  Friday election. Twenty-five other workers deposited blank ballots.    ""From our viewpoint, the issue is settled,"" said Bill Rivera, archdiocese  spokesman.    Barbara Mejia, manager of the union's California board, which refused the  archdiocese's request to co-sponsor the second election, said she was not  surprised by the results. She maintained that the church ""controlled"" the  results by forbidding workers to talk about the issue, keeping union  representatives off cemetery grounds and firing several pro-union workers  during the last year.    Cemetery workers began organizing in 1988, saying they wanted higher pay,  better medical benefits and an end to oppressive treatment from supervisors.    The church agreed to hold an election in February, 1989, after the National  Labor Relations Board declined to sponsor a vote, saying it did not have  jurisdiction over religious organizations. After a campaign marked by frequent  threats of violence between pro- and anti-union workers, the union narrowly won  the election, 66 to 62. A three-member panel, with members approved by both  sides, examined allegations of misconduct and concluded last November that the  union had won fairly.    Negotiations on a labor contract between the union and the church did not begin  until last month. Two weeks after they began, Mahony declared them over. He  said the two sides had agreed that the union's representation would last for  only a year, and that he considered the year over.    In response, angry union leaders on Tuesday sued Mahony in Superior Court,  saying the archdiocese is obligated to negotiate with them for a year that  began with last November's arbitration panel decision, not last February's  election.

This disclosure was made today at the Colloquium  on the Drug Traffic, Security, and Human Rights.    Those participating in the event agreed that now that the  Colombian drug trafficker, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, is dead there  will be many others to take his place.    The director of strategic studies at the National Institute  To Combat Drugs, Efren Ortiz Villasenor, commented, ``Much  attention is being paid to the effects of the drug traffic, and  not so much to its causes; however, we must make use of  prevention.''    He declared: ``Education is the most important factor  enabling people to develop a critical capacity, because  conducting campaigns with moralistic or censuring focuses brings  no results.''    He stressed, ``It is no longer a matter of merely fighting  drug consumption and trafficking. Rather, it entails a more  ambitious effort: determining how to achieve a rational control  over them.    ``The drug traffic, attacking the nation's fundamental  values, should be viewed as a national security problem, and all  the necessary resources should be activated to prevent it.''  [passage omitted]    Alejandro Reyes Posada, a researcher from the Institute of  Political Studies and International Relations at the National  University of Colombia, claimed that the illegal status of drugs  ``has created an artificial market with large profits. The more  their trafficking and production are repressed, the greater the  increase in the drug dealers' profits.''    He emphasized that the illegal status of the latter's  activity induces them to protect their interests by using  violence and corrupting civil servants.    He also noted: ``The most dangerous threat to any country's  security insofar as the Mafias are concerned is that they become  associated with big capital, because of the lucrative nature of  the drug trafficking business and its great capacity for  violence. As a result, movements of a fascist type appear.''    He indicated, ``The genuine weapon of societies in their  battle against those groups is the reinforcement of the state,  the law, and justice, as well as of democracy and civilian  society.    ``Involving university students in the discussion and  understanding of the problem is part of an effort to organize  and strengthen societies, so as to prevent the Mafias engaged in  this illicit business from absorbing and destroying them.''    The rector of the University of Guadalajara, Raul Padilla  Lopez, observed: ``In our time, the drug traffic has become a  serious public security problem. It is impossible to disregard  the frequent occasions on which the battle against it has led to  violations of individual guarantees and human rights.''    He added that a global problem such as the one described  demands solutions of an equal magnitude, which do not exempt  nations from a clear commitment to combat it within their  borders. It also requires ``an extensive, pluralistic dialogue  with society.''    The state attorney, Leobardo Larios Guzman, who opened the  meeting representing Governor Carlos Rivera Aceves, claimed that  fighting the drug traffic is not an exclusive function of the  government system, because the whole society, through its  various sectors, is also committed to it, particularly in the  area of prevention.

The  participants include experts from the Ministry of National  Defense, the General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, the Ministry of State Security, and research institutes  specialized in studies of strategy and world issues.    Toward the end of last year, the Ministry of Defense called  meetings in this category on two occasions, with topics  including Sino-U.S. relations, the security of the Nansha  [Spratly] Islands, the election of the new Russian parliament,  and measures for the security of various peripheral countries in  the Asia-Pacific Region.    Based on the discussions at these meetings, this journal has  sorted out an article on Sino-U.S. relations for our readers'  reference.    Since last May, when U.S. President Clinton announced the  extension of MFN status to China for the 1993-94 fiscal year,  Sino-U.S. economic exchanges have deepened and expanded further,  with a rapid increase in U.S. investment in China. At the same  time, U.S. media has given voluminous coverage to ""China's  miraculous economic growth,"" which created a positive climate of  opinion for the Clinton administration to review its China  policy in a comprehensive way and to improve Sino-U.S.  relations. However, since the beginning of the third  quarter, some troubles have surfaced in Sino-U.S. relations.  For example: The U.S. implementation of ""Category II trade  sanctions"" under the pretext of China's having sold M-11  guided-missile technology to Pakistan, the ""Yinhe"" incident, and  the continued U.S. sales of advanced weapons and equipment to  Taiwan.    The United States Tries Hard To Mend Its Relations With China    Reviewing Sino-U.S. relations over the past six months or  so,  it is not difficult to see that the United States has been  getting impatient with waitng for China to make corresponding  concessions in such arenas as human rights and weapon  proliferation. In addition, an all-encompassing and consistent  China policy on the part of the Clinton administration, as well  as a continuous guiding principle in this arena, are not on the  horizon. Thus, it has been impossible to effectively control  the escalation of friction between the two sides, resulting in  greater turbulence in the unstable bilateral relations.    However, the United States has misgivings over the growing  tension in Sino-U.S. relations. This being the case, the  Clinton administration has taken a series of initiatives. For  example, Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for national  security affairs, submitted a comprehensive policy document to  Clinton in mid-September last year, in which he proposed mending  U.S. relations with China.    In Seattle, the Chinese and U.S. heads of state finally  accomplished their first meeting since February 1989.    ""Economic Security Equates With National Security""    The factor prompting the United States to readjust its China  policy lies primarily in the fact that focus of U.S. diplomatic  strategy has shifted to the economy. While summarizing the six  key points in U.S. diplomatic strategy, U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher said: ""Economic security equates with  national security,"" while stressing that the economy is primary  among all diplomatic focal points, and emphasizing the  importance to U.S. economic revival of U.S. participation and  leadership in Asia-Pacific economic operation. He believed that  ""no other area in the world is more important than the East  Asian and Pacific region."" In recent years, bilateral trade  between the United States and the Asia-Pacific region has  increased, with an average annual growth rate of 9.1 percent.  In 1993, the volume of trade between the United States and the  Asia-Pacific region was $344.05 billion, accounting for 52  percent of U.S. general export volume.    Over the past two years, China's economy has enjoyed a high  growth rate, and has become a focus in the world, forcing the  United States to renew its understanding of China, and to show  concern for the ever-expanding U.S. economic interests in China.  At present, the volume of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade approaches  $70 billion. China is an important market for U.S. commercial  aircraft, electronic equipment, and farm produce. In these  three areas alone, 63,000 job opportunities have been created  for the United States.    U.S. Businessmen Urge the U.S. Government To Revise  Its China Policy In the fourth annual survey of the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, 98 percent of those polled believed the  prospects for investment in mainland China to be ""favorable"" or  ""very favorable."" At the same time, 78 percent of U.S.  companies believed that the disputes over MFN status would  jeopardize their commercial activities in China. So we can see  that with the expansion of U.S. investment interests in China,  U.S. businessmen are urging the government to re-examine  Sino-U.S. relations so as to ensure comprehensive U.S.  participation in China's economic development.    Apart from economic considerations, the United States also  is  calling for China's cooperation in handling global and regional  security. In actual fact, because China is one of the countries  having mastery of guided missiles and nuclear technology, the  United States will have to rely on China in its  ""non-proliferation diplomacy."" In particular, viewed from the  angle of Asia-Pacific regional security, China has played a  vitally important role in the UN peace-keeping plan in Cambodia,  easing the tense situation and realizing a nuclear-free Korean  peninsula, and promoting the building of a multilateral security  mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region. At at time when the  United States is attempting to ""take an active part and play a  leading role"" in the Asia-Pacific region, it would be  impractical to reject China's participation and support.    Based on the new principle that ""Sino-U.S. relations are one  of the most important bilateral relationships in the world,"" the  United States has started to establish new focuses in its China  policy, namely: 1) To take the initiative into its own hand to  restore high-level dialogues in various arenas; 2) To take a  practical attitude toward the existence of China as a political  and military power, and establish ""normal military relations""  with China, which are not aimed at any third country, but are  conducive to world peace and stability, especially in the  Asia-Pacific region, as well as regional security; and 3) In  areas where the differences between the two sides are  comparatively great, for example, the human rights issue, the  United States also has stated that it will not proceed from U.S.  value concepts in ""doing business with China,"" but will ""reflect  the commitments made by various countries according to the UN  Charter,"" which shows that from now on, the United States will  exert influence on China by relying more heavily on  ""international criteria.""    The United States Is Worried About the Shaping of the  Sino-Russian Alliance    Since July last year, the new trends in Russia's foreign  policy have placed a renewed stress on the maintenance of the  traditional national interests and sphere of influence. What  worries the United States is that this change in Russia's  foreign policy has taken place under conditions of a malignant  growth of nationalism in Russia. At the same time, the United  States has renewed its worries about the shaping of a  Russia-China alliance, and was anxious about Russian Defense  Minister Grachev's China visit. That being the case, while  thinking of readjusting its policy toward Russia, the United  States acknowledged: ""The importance of China has been  neglected over the past few years,"" and hoped that China would  become a ""friend"" of the United States through so-called  ""contact strategy.""    To summarize, China's rapid economic development and growing  comprehensive national strength, the integration of economic  interests between China and the United States, and the concerns  over Russia are the basic considerations pushing the Clinton  administration to establish the axes of its policy toward China.  Since President Clinton approved the ""Action Memorandum"" set out  by the National Security Council in mid-September last year,  quite a few high-ranking U.S. officials have visited China, one  after another. Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S. President  Clinton met in Seattle in late November last year; in mid-March  this year, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited  China. All this shows that progress has been made recently in  Sino-U.S. relations.    Nevertheless, the improvement in bilateral relations is  confined to elevating the levels of contact and expanding the  areas, pending satisfactory solutions to substantial issues.  During his recent China visit, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher was somewhat relaxed about the linking of MFN status  with human rights conditions; this brought about a silver lining  to the cloud hanging over China's MFN status. However, a  solution to this issue once and for all continues to call for  the two sides' joint efforts. The ups and downs in Sino-U.S.  relations in recent years were related to the readjustment in  U.S. strategic focuses; now that the United States has seen the  importance of the Asia-Pacific region, and has a renewed  understanding of China's role, the Clinton administration has  been active toward China, resulting in a change in Sino-U.S.  relations. In view of this, it is advisable for China to have a  comprehensive, long-range strategy toward the United States, as  well as short-range measures for individual specific issues. To  achieve this end, we make the following suggestions:    Revise the Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques    I. It is necessary to strive for the revision of the  communiques on bilateral relations.    The three existing communiques on Sino-U.S. relations were  signed against the backdrop of the Cold War. The 1982 ""17  August"" Communique already has stood for 12 years, and many of  its contents cannot reflect the new foundation and realities in  Sino-U.S. relations. The problems surfacing in Sino-U.S.  relations in recent years increasingly have revealed the  fragility of bilateral relations founded on ideology. Today, it  is imperative to find a new supporting point. It seems  inevitable that economic cooperation will be the new tie in  relations between the two countries. However, this point  has never been touched on in the three past communiques. This  being the case, a mechanism to standardize disputes is not on  the horizon. For example, this important principle in handling  issues involving economic relations and trade, as well as  political matters, should be written into the new communique.    II. The issue of human rights.    The human rights issue will remain a thorny one in Sino-U.S  relations from now on, and this has a bearing on the MFN status  after 1994. To handle this issue, China may take the following  measures:    1. To adopt a tough stance, fighting tit for tat: China  should adhere to the principle of separating trade and political  issues, while opposing the addition of human rights conditions  to the MFN status. China should do more work in the U.S.  Congress, in the U.S. Government, and among the U.S. public so  as to win the support of more people.    At the same time, China should take full advantage of the  media to indicate the serious human rights issues in the United  States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry should collect materials  about human rights conditions in the United States: racial  discrimination, violence, and murder, for example. These should  be published each year, while a list of Chinese citizens  suffering from violence and unfair treatment in the United  States should be submitted to the U.S. side.    2. To agree to discuss the human rights issue, though it  should not be linked to the MFN status.    We may take into consideration making the international  discussion of the human rights issue regular and institutional.  Discussions can be conducted between governments, as well as  scholars. The issues of human rights in China, as well as in  the United States, can be discussed. According to a U.S. State  Department official, this the minimum requirement of the U.S.  side on the ""human rights"" conditions, the fulfillment of which  will somewhat help the extension of the MFN status.    Releasing Counterrevolutionaries    3. According to the revised penal code, some imprisoned  counterrevolutionaries should be released in all at once. At  present, the definition of ""counterrevolutionary crime"" is  comparatively vague in China's current penal code, and it would  be very difficult for the code to be compare with foreign penal  codes, and to be understood and accepted in the world, so the  code's revision seems imperative. Furthermore, this practice  will enable China to have a law by which to abide when dealing  with issues in this category, as well as sufficient legal  grounds to deal with U.S. ""human rights diplomacy,"" in contrast  to the practice of releasing one or two political prisoners each  year when the United States is set to discuss the extension of  China's MFN status.    4. Further relax restrictions on emigrants: The United  States regards freedom of emigration as one of the basic human  rights. Although China has relaxed its emigration policy on  several occasions, it is still impossible for Chinese citizens  to leave the country freely. ""Human rights"" issues are derived  from such conditions, which then are linked to the issue of the  ""imprisonment of political offenders,"" and used to deal with  China. In Clinton's order to extend MFN status to China last  year, he continued including freedom of emigration as a  prerequisite, while requiring China to ""permit Chinese citizens  to emigrate overseas for political or religious reasons, without  any restriction."" This being the case, we suggest that the  departments concerned further relax restrictions on citizens'  crossing the border, so that legitimate emigrants many enjoy  full freedom, and the United States' additional human rights  condition thus lose its ""legal grounds.""    5. Further reveal the truth concerning U.S. exports of  prison-produced products: Many states in the United States have  prison factories, and the law permits the export of their  products. The United States, however, is making a great fuss  over products turned out by Chinese prisoners. China has failed  to fully expose this unreasonable behavior, and seems to be very  passive. China also should investigate and publish the  conditions under which U.S. prison products are exported.     "

[Yasin] Well, I'm happy about this, when the minister says  so, because this will stop any further deterioration of  relations between Sudan and Great Britain and everybody knows,  you know, the relationship is an old one and is a strong one.  We don't want the relationship to be affected by diplomats  being expelled here and there. It is a heritage and legacy of  long relationship, so I'm really happy that the gist of the  minister's speech will curb any further deterioration of  relations between my country and the United Kingdom.    [Snow] On the other hand, you must be unhappy that it needs  the expulsion of yourself and your British counterpart in the  first place.    [Yasin] Well I'm really sad for being expelled from the  United Kingdom because of the retaliation to what has been done  by my government, but it is known in international practice in a  situation like this, but I thought the British Government would  have thought otherwise by substituting Peter Streams with  somebody else.    [Snow] Let's get to the nub of this, because Peter Streams  is  accused of basically having hammered the human rights issue,  which very many people feel very strongly about. Not just  Britain but many other Western nations in particular, have  voiced their concerns, and surely that, at the end of it, has  made him an unpopular ambassador with you?    [Yasin] Well, in fact he was stressing human rights issues,  but he was very much exaggerating on issues which were only  based on heresay. You know, he doesn't have direct evidence to  condemn my government. He was just a good and observant  listener of people from the opposition and he was making  prejudgments in cases which could not be proved.    [Snow] Well, he was hardly a lone voice. The Amnesty  International has a list of cases of grave concern in Sudan and  of course the civil war itself is thrown up the most awful  realities of human rights abuse.    [Yasin] Well, I must tell you maybe some people are  exceeding  the polls here or there but it was under absolute control of my  government, and my government has opened the doors and all the  avenues for any person from outside to see for himself, and the  archbishop has been given the opportunity to see for himself the  tolerance and freedom for everybody to worship whatever religion  he chooses. The situation in Sudan is, we are not hiding  anything.    [Snow] Is there now a sense of regret that the Islamic  fundamentalism practices that the government indulged in up  until the last year or two have perhaps gone too far?    [Yasin] Well, I can't see any sort of fundamentalist  practices that would be reproached or blamed in Sudan; it is  just an allegation. Sudan is living in a very civilized  situation now. We are far better than any other country in the  continent of Africa or even the Middle East. If you can name  any country better than the Sudan now, I will admit to what you  have said.    [Snow] Ambassador, on that note, thank you very much.     "

[Parliament  Speaker] Petru Lucinschi proposed to examine this issue  reminding that these agreements were examined by the former  parliament and that only 4 votes lacked to their ratification.  That is why the former parliamentary presidium took into  account all economic problems and restrictions caused by Russia  and asked the president to sign all the agreements of joining  the CIS and CIS Economic Union to Moldova's benefit. A number  of 17 deputies have opposed on 8 April the proposal to examine  the agreements. The faction of Peasants and Intellectuals  noticed that the parliamentary regulations are violated.  According to it, the documents to be adopted have to be  presented three days beforehand for their examination. PDAM  [Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova -- ruling party]  representatives and in particular Andrei Diaconu, retorted that  the problem is well known and was examined on August 4th, and  therefore it would not be reasonable to start a new discussion.  Valeriu Matei, from the faction of Peasants and Intellectuals,  stated that the documents have a series of stipulations  contradicting Moldova's current policy and several legislative  documents. Dumitru Motpan, PDAM leader and vice speaker of  parliament, replied that the commissions that should ensure the  fulfillment of the regulations is only being created. He said  that this problem had been examined for two years and the delay  in ratifying the CIS agreements would represent a blockage.  Dumitru Diacov presented the notification of the Parliamentary  Commission of Foreign Relations regarding these documents. He  argued that Moldova should join the CIS and mentioned that seven  of the nine members of the commission were in favor of  ratification, while the other two representing the FPCDM  [Christian- Democratic Popular Front -- opposition] Alliance  and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals opposed it. Premier  Andrei Sangheli made a report noting that the CIS agreements  should be ratified as soon as possible. He added that after the  former parliament rejected them, serious damage was caused to  Moldovan economy. In 1993, this sum amounted to 40 billion  rubles. Sangheli asserted that the government in its 7 April  session agreed to the ratification of the CIS agreements.  During the debates, Vlad Clubreacov, from the FPCDM faction,  mentioned ""the disastrous economic consequences of ratifying the  CIS agreements and the danger to which Moldova's independence is  unjustifiably exposed."" He said that ""it is strictly necessary  that beside the two agreements presented to us, we should have  at our disposal over 200 agreements signed by Moldovan  officials. The agreements are only partial and insufficient  information, which disguise the real purposes of the previous  agreements."" Vasile Nedelciuc, faction of Peasants and  Intellectuals, analyzed several economic articles of the  agreements. He pointed out that Moldova has other alternatives,  including the ones in the West, which could help overcome the  current difficulties. He said that joining the CIS would  negatively influence many areas. One of the consequences is  that the legislation must be adjusted to the conditions of the  CIS economic community. Speaker Petru Lucinschi said that the  decision to join the CIS is not made forever and with new  realities coming in power it could be revised. At present, when  there is no other alternative but the Eastern market, parliament  welcomes the adherence to the CIS.     "

Then came Mr. John  Malott's speech telling India how it should conduct its domestic  and regional policy, which was remarkable not for its content  but its eschewal of a two-year epoch of private diplomacy that  was the best indicator of warming Indo-U.S. relations, and a  return to public postures and rhetoric.    Then came Ms. Robin Raphel's extraordinary remark that the  U.S. no longer believed that the Simla agreement provided a  framework for settling the Kashmir dispute, because very few  discussions had taken place under the agreement in the past 20  years. One could say as much about the border between the U.S.  and Mexico.    We will pass over Ms. Raphel's gaffe on the Instrument of  Accession: A close look at the text of her statement shows that  she was caught unawares and did not realise the full implication  in international law of what she was saying. But only days later  we heard that the Administration intends to withdraw the  Pressler amendment and replace it with a new comprehensive  foreign aid law that will apply the Pressler-type restrictions  to all non-NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) countries and even  those signatories (read China) that are seeking to expand their  nuclear arsenals. India will, of course be included in the first  category.    And, as if our cup of woe was still not full we had to  listen  to Mr. Shattuck, Assistant Secretary of State for Human rights,  who told an Indian newsman that the U.S. disapproved of India's  Human rights record in Kashmir, and did not believe that a  nation's right to put down insurgency excused, let alone  justified, some abrogation of these rights.    At any normal time, such sustained, public arm-twisting,  would have signalled a deliberate decision by the U.S. to  replace cooperation with pressure as the basis of dealing with  India. But are these times normal in the U.S.? Are the postures  it is adopting, not only towards India, but towards China,  Japan, the EEC, and the United Nations on various issues,  sustainable? Above all, do the pronouncements coming out of  Washington reflect carefully worked out foreign policy  positions, or are they products of `Gung Ho activists in the  foreign policy establishment shooting from the hip'?    The truth lies somewhere in between. And this is presenting  New Delhi with a foreign policy dilemma that it may understand  but has, clearly, not been able to resolve. So far New Delhi has  carefully refrained from any public posturing and its  communications with the U.S. have been carried on strictly  within diplomatic channels, (although paraphrased in the press).  The tone of its communications, except on the issue of the  Instrument of Accession, has also been markedly moderate.    This would have been the correct response, had the U.S. got  its foreign policy act together. But if its policy is being made  largely by individuals shooting from the hip, then moderation is  just the wrong attitude to have adopted, for it has made India  appear defensive on issues like Human rights, Kashmir and to a  lesser extent, NPT, and has encouraged activists like Ms. Raphel  and Mr. Shattuck to think that they can push this country  around, a belief that Ms. Raphel has not bothered to hide.    The truth is that just at this moment the U.S. does not have  a clearly articulated foreign policy, except in one or two areas  such as supporting economic reform in Russia, de-nuclearisation  (again mainly in the former Soviet Union), and freer trade. Two  of even these have gone grievously wrong with the elections in  Russia.    Outside these core areas, the Clinton administration has  only  vaguely formed attitudes pushed by public opinion manipulated by  the media, whom Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher has  described somewhat querulously as the aspiring North Star of  American policy.    Thus it does not like Human rights violations; it wants all  countries to sign the NPT, and put their facilities under  fullscope safeguards; it wants a cleaner environment, and it  reserves its right to use bilateral trade pressure to secure  concessions in selected areas of trade, notably intellectual  property rights. It wants global stability, brokered by itself  and the NATO where it feels it more directly threatened, and  according to the U.S. permanent Representative to the U.N., Ms.  Madeleine Albright, by the U.N., which it considers a junior  partner, where it does not.    India could not fail to be at the receiving end of nearly  all  these concerns, despite the fact that it shares most of them,  because any attempt to force one country's views and `solutions'  on another, ends by denying the latter a large part of its  sovereignty. In effect the message being sent to India is `join  us and we will look after you; resist us and we will press down  on and eventually hurt you.'    The choice might have been a real one if these concerns had  reflected deeply felt convictions and not just vague attitudes.  But this is far from being the case. On Human rights no less an  organisation than the American Human Rights Watch has condemned  the Clinton administration of adopting double standards,  pressing for their observance where no other national interest  is involved, and giving them the go by when there is. It has  specifically indicted Mr. Clinton's record in this respect  towards Israel as being worse than Mr. George Bush's.    The U.S. has adopted double standards in a more fundamental  way: In Somalia its helicopter gunships blew away somewhere  between 150 and 300 Somali civilians in a retaliatory attack  designed to kill Aideed, for the killing of a single U.S.  soldier by one of his gunmen. The U.S. spokesman said that in  such an operation there were no innocent bystanders. And when  Mr. Keith Richburg of the Washington Post  investigated the casual killing of a Malaysian CARE worker by a  U.N. patrol while he was out buying his lunch, the U.N. command  said `Guerillas fire from crowds. They use women and children as  human shields. There are bound to be civilian casualties when  U.N. troops fire back in self-defence.' Does that sound familiar  Mr. Shattuck?    On the role of the U.N. as a world policeman, realism, burst  the media's pipe-dream of a new world order when none other than  President Clinton decided to pull U.S. troops out of Somalia  after the killing of 18 soldiers, and to start political talks  with Aideed and the other warlords. Within the U.N. Secretariat,  disillusionment with the forward policies that have been thrust  on the organisation by the rich nations in the heady afterglow  of the Gulf War is complete. There is a total consensus that the  U.N. must not undertake any more military actions under the  mandatory chapter 7 of the U.N. charter, and that even  supervisory or humanitarian actions under chapter 6, will not be  possible if national contingent commanders do not place  themselves unreservedly under the U.N. commandant. Ms. Madeleine  Albright's September dream of U.S.-U.N. partnership is already  light years out of date.    The administration's lack of commitment reflects an even  more  profound lack of interest in the American public. In civilised  drawing rooms from Washington to Cambridge, no one is talking  about foreign policy. What true American liberals are appalled  about is the crime bill that has been rushed through Congress.  Children over 13 will now be treated as adults and can be  sentenced to death mandatorily on as many as 19 (or is it 29)  counts. The passage of this bill has focussed attention as  nothing else could have on the internal social problems of the  country -- the growing racial divide, the violence, crime and  decay in the inner cities; the growing inequalities in health  care, the fact that a large part of the population has grown  poorer in the Eighties and Nineties; the rise in highly educated  white collar unemployment, and the deterioration in the status  of blue collar workers all over the country.    These are Mr. Clinton's real worries, and he has unabashedly  little time to spare for a foreign policy that is no longer  rooted in an acute sense of national insecurity. But the foreign  policy establishment is a leftover of the old days when this was  where the best and the brightest went. Activism is therefore  part of its very blood. But it is now activism without a guiding  beacon, or a steady restraining hand. So every one is shooting  from the hip. New Delhi may choose not to shoot back but it must  show that it has little respect for Washington's cowboys. And,  it must rebuild its relations with China.      "

The bill would be paid at the end of the  embargo decreed by the United Nations after the invasion of  Kuwait on 2 August 1990. ""For the moment, importing Spanish  medical supplies in the amount of 1.45 billion pesetas would be  sufficient to meet our needs,"" said Iraqi Minister of Health  Umid Midhat Mubarak in an interview with this newspaper. ""We are  optimistic with respect to Iraq's future, but now we need our  friends. As the Orientals that we are, we never forget those who  are with us in difficult moments,"" Mubarak added.    Although the UN embargo allows Iraq to import medicines and  other civil goods essential for the population, the prohibition  against oil exports leaves Iraq without the hard currency needed  to pay for such imports. The funds that were frozen in several  Western countries under the embargo--with the exception of those  related to oil and its derivatives, which were transferred into  a UN account--have been slowly unfrozen to pay for exports of  goods of humanitarian nature, and in many cases these funds have  been exhausted.    According to Mubarak, there are more than 1.5 billion  pesetas  still frozen in Spain. The Iraqi Embassy in Spain reduces that  figure to ""some 300 million pesetas,"" belonging to two Iraqi  banks. And Jose Ramon Baranano, assistant director of the  Spanish Foreign Ministry's International Economic Relations  Section, asserts that Iraq ""now has not a single frozen peseta  left in Spain.""    Searching for Formulas    With or without funds, what the Iraqi government suggests is  that Spain ""find formulas, because they do exist, to prevent  suffering by the Iraqi population."" ""We do not want to  manufacture weapons, we want to keep people from dying,"" asserts  the minister of health.    Data compiled by UNICEF are hair-raising: Infant mortality  has tripled; 80 percent of the children are born with less than  normal weight because of the mother's malnutrition. Hospital  occupancy has dropped to approximately 30 percent. ""Without  medical supplies, people do better remaining home."" And of the  200 ambulances existing in 1990, only 37 throughout the country  are in operation. ""We have run out of tires and batteries, and  as one breaks down, we use its parts to fix another.""    The Spanish Government says that it ""understands"" Iraq's  problems, but argues that the Security Council allows no margin  of maneuver whatever, forbidding any type of credit, even if it  is for humanitarian reasons. Diplomatic sources assert: ""We are  complying with UN regulations, and we hope that Iraq continues  to show its willingness to cooperate, as it has been doing  lately, so that the embargo may be lifted the soonest possible.""    Fearing that the United States may veto the lifting of the  embargo even though it may be fulfilling the requirements of UN  resolution 687 (forbidding Iraq to sell oil until the UN  ascertains the dismantling of its mass-destruction arsenal, and  to install an anti-arms warning system), Baghdad meanwhile is  seeking alternatives and is offering ""large future  compensations"" to those enterprises that may take the chance of  ""delivering today and collecting tomorrow.""    ""We have already signed some substantial agreements with  several European enterprises. Spanish companies should not lose  this opportunity to cash in on lucrative profits in a not too  distant future,"" says Umid Midhat Mubarak.     "

Kerry, member of the  External Relations Committee of the Senate of the United States  [title as received], who is here for a visit to Vietnam.    Also present at the reception was Deputy Foreign Minister Le  Mai.    During the reception, Senator Kerry highly appreciated the  results of meetings between U.S. delegations and Vietnamese  senior officials of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and some  offices concerned. He said these meetings were of important  significance aimed at contributing to strengthening the mutual  understanding and promoting the normalization of the  Vietnam-U.S. relations. He noted that on the MIA issue the two  countries had engaged in a process of complete cooperation, and  that cooperation had brought about good results. The Vietnamese  Government and people, he also noted, have tried their best to  cooperate with the U.S. in the search of American servicemen  missing in action in the Vietnam war as well as in the supply of  information on the MIA issue.    For his part, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet appreciated the  positive support of Senator Kerry and many other Americans of  good-will for the normalization of the Vietnam-U.S. relations  for the sake of peace, stability and development in Southeast  Asia, as well as their cooperation in the MIA issue, which, he  said, will contribute to the promotion of their bilateral  relations. The Vietnamese leader reaffirmed that Vietnam's  consistent policy on the MIA issue was to do its best for the  humnitarian purpose. He held that should the MIA issue be  settled well, it would create mutual understanding and trust for  the settlement of other issues relating to the interests of the  two countries.    P.M. Vo Van Kiet asked Mr. Kerry to convey to the U.S.  President Vietnam's viewpoint that it was time for the two  countries to have a new decision on bilateral relations, and the  earlier the Vietnam-U.S. relations are normalized the more  favourable conditions would be created for the development of  the cooperative relations in various fields in conformity with  the interests of the two countries.    The Vietnamese prime minister also asked the U.S. senator to  convey his new year greetings to the U.S. people. Yesterday,  Chairman of the National Assembly Nong Duc Manh also received  Senator Kerry.    Mr Kerry expresed his pleasure over the meeting with the NA  chairman and considered that event very important, ushering in  opportunities for cooperation between the Vietnamese National  Assembly and the U.S. Congress. He thanked Chairman Nong Duc  Manh and the Vietnamese authorities for their hospitality for  him and his party, and said that his Vietnam visits had left him  fine impressions on the land and people of Vietnam.    Speaking to his guests, Chairman Nong Duc Manh expressed his  hope that the results of the visit would contribute to  strengthening the mutual understanding between the two  legislatures and the people of Vietnam and the U.S. Prompted by  the humanitarian spirit and profound sympathies towards families  of Americans missing in action in the Vietnam war, the  Vietnamese National Assembly and people would in their capacity  continue their cooperation with the U.S. side in the settlement  of the MIA issue.

He said: ""I would say there is some preference, based on  public opinion and comments made by President Eduardo Frei, for  studying Chile's incorporation into NAFTA in greater detail but  we are not excluding a free trade agreement with the United  States.""    He explained, however, that the government has not made any  decision and hopes to make it in the next few days. He added:  ""For the time being our main decision is to be flexible, but we  are willing to study other alternatives to choose what is best  for the country.""    Insulza admitted there is a majority opinion favorable to  NAFTA because it is a known agreement, its benefits can be  immediate for Chile, and it is made up of three countries (the  United States, Mexico, and Canada) and not just one. He said:  ""The way labor and environmental issues are dealt with in NAFTA  seem satisfactory to us. In other words, there are favorable  good reasons. But we cannot fail to recognize that a free trade  agreement with the United States has some advantages because it  is more direct, immediate, and adjusted to our own situation.""    He pointed out that the main disadvantage of a bilateral  trade agreement is that a new agreement must be negotiated  subject to conditions and reasons that are not well-defined. He  added: ""The government has not made a decision but from the  opinions given by the majority of government officials one can  deduce that there is a preference for NAFTA.""    Insulza gave a lecture to Eighth Region exporters that was  organized by the Regional Institute of Business Administration,  IRADE, and Prochile entitled: ""Strategy for Internationalizing  Chile and Diplomacy for Development.""    He said Chile will try to form a trade association or free  trade with Mercosur [Common Market of the South], ""to put it in  simple terms,"" because it will open the markets of four  countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay) for us to  increase our exports. He added: ""Argentina and Brazil currently  are our third- and fourth-largest trade partners, respectively,  and there is no reason why they could not be the first and  second due to the size of their markets and their closeness to  us.""    Insulza noted that for Chile, a country with an open economy  and clear foreign trade rules, the ideal would be to have a  multilateral system with clear rules. He indicated that although  that system has not been achieved despite the progress made in  the Uruguay Round, preferential agreements with different  countries, regions, or groups of countries should be created.    He said Latin America and especially South America have  received large quantities of Chilean exports in the last few  years. He said Chile has balanced trade with Argentina of about  $1 billion with a surplus of $7 million favorable to Chile. He  added: ""There is a relative balance with Uruguay, a slight  deficit with Paraguay, and a big deficit of about $600 million  with Brazil.""    Insulza said this situation changes if one studies the  balance of services, which generally is not included in the  statistics; ""if it were, Chile would have a surplus with those  countries.""

In brief statements made before the traditional ""informal  meeting of foreign ministers"" and prior to tomorrow's opening of  the OAS General Assembly, most ministers came out in favor of  maintaining the policy of sanctions against the Haitian coupist  military.    Bolivian Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga, who will  chair the ""ad hoc"" OAS foreign ministers meeting to be held on  Monday to study the Haitian crisis, affirmed that they have  drafted a resolution of consensus that is almost finished. It  is almost certain that a statement will be issued here  ""reaffirming the search for a peaceful solution based on all the  UN and OAS resolutions that have been adopted throughout this  period,"" Aranibar stated.    The Bolivian foreign minister said that, at the 24th OAS  General Assembly being held in this Brazilian coastal city, the  countries of the continent will also condemn ""all illegal acts  that are being committed and the continual and systematic  violation of human rights in Haiti.""    Among the OAS countries, ""there is a deep conviction that a  return to democracy and the return of President (Jean-Bertrand)  Aristide are essential elements for the peaceful solution that  the continent wants,"" Aranibar said. He added that his country  ""is opposed to any armed action."" ""Any decision along those  lines could cause a cure worse that the illness,"" the president  of the ""ad-hoc"" meeting said, adding that ""some new ideas"" are  being studied to reinforce sanctions, ""but nothing spectacular.""    Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, whose country  has not ruled out armed intervention in Haiti to resolve the  crisis following the coup against Aristide in 1991, did not  refer to this point, but indicated that he expects that this  meeting will reiterate the message of the international  community that ""the de facto government must end very soon.""    ""We have already done plenty for this to happen through  cooperation, and we hope that new steps are adopted in the next  few days and weeks,"" added Talbott, even though he did not  specify the types of additional measures he was referring to.    The U.S. representative to the OAS meeting was optimistic  regarding a solution to the Haitian crisis because of the  ""extraordinary solidarity"" Assembly participants have displayed  regarding this problem.    Costa Rican Foreign Affairs Minister Fernando Naranjo, on  the  other hand, said ""there are still certain diplomatic, economic,  and financial actions that can be implemented before thinking of  more extreme measures."" He added, ""I believe that it is still  not time for the use of force; instead, certain additional  sanctions are still required.    The only person to openly admit the possibility of military  intervention in Haiti was Argentine Foreign Relations Minister  Guido di Tella who said his country would back an action of this  sort if it were agreed to and authorized by the UN Security  Council. Nevertheless, Di Tella affirmed that for the time  being, what has to be done is to guarantee the closure of the  border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic in order to  comply with the total embargo imposed by the Security Council,  which went into effect on 21 May.

In this case ""spinning""  has nothing to do with purring contentedly before the open fire,  but everything to do with a public relations (PR) machine which  is overwhelming the press with one-sided information. In this  case about the president's economic plans.    The occasion was the two day G-7 meeting on employment. At  the invitation of President Clinton, the finance, trade and  labor ministers from the seven richest countries had gone to  ""Motown"" to meditate openly and behind closed doors about  fighting unemployment.    This international setpiece was intended to distract  attention from Clinton's problems in Washington. There he is  being pursued by the call for more openness and hearings in the  Whitewater affair. In Detroit and during other events in the  country he could finally concentrate on his policies again. For  a brief moment he was out of the snake pit.    To ensure that the media understood that too, Clinton's PR  machine provided the exclamation points. The U.S. treasury  secretary called Clinton's ideas ""amazing."" The commerce  secretary said he found them ""exciting."" The top economic  advisor spoke of ""remarkable"" plans. Vice President Al Gore  called the conference ""an important turning point in the postwar  dialogue between the United States and other industrialized  countries.""    The rather less exuberant comment by the British  representative that he had been to ""other dull meetings like  this one"" could not temper U.S. enthusiasm. The message was  intended for the U.S. public and not for foreigners who, after  all, do not have votes.    But things went wrong. Clinton's speech on Monday [14 March]  was to have sent out the signal to the masses that the President  is keeping an eye on the interests of the average worker and  unemployed person, despite healthy economic growth. On Monday  morning that seemed to still be working, but the fun was spoiled  a little later by Webster Hubbell. Hubbell is a friend of the  Clintons and a former colleague of Hillary Clinton. On Monday  he resigned as a highly placed member of staff at the justice  department. Hubbell is suspected of charging excessively high,  unjustified bills to his clients while working as a lawyer in  Arkansas.    So Clinton's comments took a back seat. Once again the  President was plagued by questions about his cabinet, scandals,  ethics and the departure of his friends from Washington. A week  earlier Bernard Nussbaum, the top lawyer in the White House and  another friend of the Clintons, had resigned because of  Whitewater. In the morning in Detroit Clinton was still proud of  his policies, in the afternoon in Boston he was back at the  beginning.    And what about the conference itself? The participants  called it a success, of course. They would ""take the comments  with them"" to the G-7 summit in Naples this summer. However,  the ministers reached no conclusions and announced no moves.    In any case the participants have learned one thing. They  have seen with their own eyes what happens in a city plagued by  11 percent unemployment with virtually no social safety net.  Their limousines, escorted by a noisy police escort, shot past  boarded up houses along dilapidated streets. The Detroit-based  car industry may have risen from its slump, but it is robots and  cheap labor elsewhere which does the work.     "

A statement from the session says:    The federal government at its session today examined and  endorsed a report on the working visit by Yugoslav Prime  Minister Kontic to New York between 15 and 19 February this year.    It was concluded that the visit was successful and useful  and  that it took place at a critical time of expiry of NATO  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, which was reflected in the  topics of his meetings and talks. [passage omitted]    The federal government tasked the relevant departments with  drawing up a platform regarding possibilities of developing  Yugoslav-U.S. cooperation under the sanctions and after the  lifting or the alleviation of the sanctions, taking into  consideration concrete initiatives that were put forward by the  American side in the course of Prime Minister Kontic's visit to  New York.    The federal government today examined and endorsed a report  on Yugoslav-U.S. relations under the conditions of crisis on the  territory of former SFRY and the U.S. policy toward the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia. In this regard, the importance of  normalization of bilateral relations with the United States was  emphasized, which was assessed as an important precondition for  the just resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, the lifting of the  UN Security Council sanctions and reintegration of the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia in the international community.    A report on issues relating to cooperation with the  Hague-based International War Crimes Tribunal, which is to try  war crime- perpetrators from the former SFRY, and with a UN  expert commission that was founded to investigate war crimes,  was endorsed. In this connection the federal government  concluded that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had a firm  standpoint as regards prosecuting and punishing all persons who  have committed crimes and have violated international  humanitarian law. All such crimes are also punishable by the  laws of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and therefore our  judicial bodies are duty-bound to examine all relevant documents  charging citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and  persons staying on its territory, and if found guilty prosecute  and punish them. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia also  accepts cooperation with all UN bodies, on this equal basis, not  on the discriminatory basis on which the tribunal was founded,  it was concluded at the session.    A platform for official visits by Yugoslav Foreign Minister  Vladislav Jovanovic to Ghana, Guinea, Nigeria, Benin, and Gabon  by the end of the month has been adopted. Guidelines have also  been adopted for the participation of a Yugoslav delegation at a  festival devoted to Nikola Tesla, which is to be held in  Timisoara, Romania on 11 and 12 March.    The federal government set 20 March as the new deadline for  the completion of final financial reports for last year.    Asim Telacevic has been relieved of his duties as federal  deputy prime minister, because he is taking up a new post.  Prime Minister Kontic appointed Uros Klikovac, hitherto the  chairman of the committee for justice and federal administration  of the Federal Assembly's Chamber of Republics, as the new  federal deputy prime minister.    Vasilije Medenica, hitherto an official in the Federal  Ministry of Transport and Communications, has been appointed  acting federal flights inspector.     "

The 25-page report that the National Assembly intends to  distribute widely at international levels adds that its powerful  northern neighbor's hostility is not limited to the economic,  trade, and financial blockade. It is also manifested in many  other issues that endanger the nation's peace and security.    In this regard, it accuses U.S. leaders of encouraging the  departure of illegal aliens and of encouraging desertion, within  the framework of its hostile policy toward the Caribbean island.    The core of the immigration matters between both nations lie  in the fact that the United States has permanently used them in  the past three decades to discredit Cuba, upholds the statement  prepared by the parliament's Foreign Relations Commission.    During the last fiscal year, 973,977 immigrants arrived to  the United States; 132,173 were admitted as refugees. Of this  total, 0.25 percent were legal immigrants from this nation,  while 2.04 were refugees or illegal immigrants.    According to the Assembly, such small percentages do not  justify the ""out of proportion propaganda"" surrounding the  issue, while it accuses Washington of offering privileged  treatment with clear political nuances to Cubans who arrive  illegally on their territory.    In addition to financial support, after one year they  automatically have a right to residency. ""No other foreign  immigrant is worthy of so many opportunities to reside, work,  and live in the United States,"" the statement indicates.    During the past years, the Havana authorities have tried to  normalize bilateral immigration relations so that these take  place within the law and in an orderly fashion, the statement  underlines.    Nevertheless, the United States continues making political  use of the immigration relations and obstructs our nation's  decisions, it notes.    Evidence of this, it adds, is how many of the so-called raft  people, kidnappers, air pirates, and deserters are received as  heroes in the United States although a visa had been denied to  many of them by the U.S. Interests Office in this capital.    According to the document, in the past border guards have  prevented some of these departures; most of the detainees are  just returned to their homes as they are considered victims of  the propaganda aired by anti-Cuban stations installed in the  United States.    Cuba is most convinced of the need to end to these  irregularities and their negative consequences. This is so not  only for Cuba but also for the United States that with its  actions encourages the crime of aircraft and boat piracy and  kidnapping in violation of bilateral and international rules,  concludes the parliamentary analysis.    The paradox of the immigration phenomena in its propaganda  projection from the United States is that the Cuban policy on  this matter never appears correct, the study concludes.    If Cuba facilitates administrative procedures and speeds up  the endeavors of any citizens to obtain an exit permit,  permanent or temporary, the U.S. Administration delays and  complicates the procedures for the trip to its territory.    If, on the contrary, it prevents the departure of illegal  aliens, Cuba is presented as a virtual jail by propaganda  machinery, and what is even worse, ""if such immigration was  allowed freely it would also be attacked, but with the threat of  military action,"" the document alerts.

This information was confirmed by Foreign Minister  Sergio Abreu who, commenting on another issue, underlined that  Uruguay has not adopted any unilateral position concerning the  common external tariff.    During a briefing before the Senate International Affairs  Committee this afternoon, Abreu pointed out that Uruguay's aim  in convening an extraordinary session of the OAS Permanent  Council is to find the means to prevent a unilateral decision  that may affect the principle of nonintervention and harmonious  relations in the hemisphere.    With regard to Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the  foreign minister stressed that neither negotiations nor the work  of task forces with other member countries have been suspended.  He noted that all negotiations, whether with NAFTA or the EC,  will be undertaken as a group.    Commenting on the situation in Haiti, Abreu said:    [Begin recording] [Abreu] Well, in view of the announcement  made by the U.S. President concerning a possible military  intervention in Haiti, the Uruguayan Government has decided to  convene an extraordinary session of the OAS Permanent Council to  exchange ideas on this situation, and perform what we consider  an act of preventive diplomacy, i.e. to seek the necessary means  and instruments to stave off a unilateral intervention that may  affect the principle of nonintervention and the harmonious  functioning of hemispheric relations.    [Unidentified reporter] Have you already discussed this  issue  with lawmakers?    [Abreu] Exactly, we have informed the International  Relations  Committee about this, in the first place, as it is not only an  issue of prime importance but also pertains to the country's  foreign policy. And above all there is the need to seek a  dialogue that will enable parties to abide by the Governor's  Island agreement on Haiti and to prevent unilateral measures  that may affect what we believe is a principle that must be  respected in a clear way and with no restrictions.    [Reporter] What conclusions have you derived from your  meetings?    [Abreu] Well, we have discussed the Haitian issue with the  Bolivian foreign minister, who presides over the ad hoc group.  He entirely shares our views. We understand that this issue  must be assessed [words indistinct] so that it can then be  submitted to the OAS General Assembly, which will be held in  Belem, Para State, Brazil, at the end of the month. We have  also had a telephone conversation with the Brazilian foreign  minister, who is at present in France, and with the Chilean  foreign minister. We were all of one mind regarding our concern  about and interest in warding off unilateral intervention. We  therefore agreed to discuss this issue at the appropriate forum,  which is the OAS, and above all to start working with a view to  devising a solution which, I repeat, combines the interests of  democracy and also full respect for the principle of  nonintervention.

Gary D. McInnis, 39, was charged in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana with a  single felony count of using intimidation to interfere with housing rights on  account of race. The crime carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and  a $10,000 fine.    Wearing a full beard, his long, brown hair in a ponytail, McInnis appeared  briefly in court before Magistrate Ronald R. Rose, who ordered him held without  bail after concluding he was an escape risk and a danger to others.    ""This is one of the worst allegations of racial animus I have seen,"" said H.  Dean Steward, a federal public defender assigned to represent McInnis. ""This is  the first case of its type for our office in Santa Ana and certainly the first  one for us involving a gunshot.""    McInnis is accused of shooting his neighbor, Oleatha Keller, on Jan. 26 at her  Hesperia home in San Bernardino County. The criminal complaint alleges that  McInnis, who was either drunk or high on drugs at the time, opened fire on  Keller's house because she is black.    Court records state that when San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies arrived  in the neighborhood after the shooting, McInnis yelled racial epithets and  said: ""Hey, come and get me.""    A neighbor told authorities that the day after the shooting, McInnis'  16-year-old son visited him and told him details about the shooting, according  to the complaint. ""My dad took a gun and shot the neighbor's house"" and ""hit a  lady,"" the neighbor quoted the boy as saying.    Subsequent searches of McInnis' home found items suggesting that the incident  was race-related, according to the FBI. Sheriff's deputies said they found  swastikas, insignia of a white supremacist group, signs with racial remarks  written on them, and figurines of blacks and a monkey hanging by their necks  from nooses of rope and chain.    One was the head of a Mr. T doll with sunglasses hanging from a workshop  ceiling, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case. Mr. T is a black TV  actor.    Deputies said McInnis' garage contained military equipment, including a mortar  that had been fired and a non-functional hand grenade. Also confiscated were  two high-powered rifles, two shotguns, a .22-caliber rifle and ammunition.    Court records show that laboratory tests of bullet fragments removed from  Keller's abdomen during surgery came from one of the rifles seized at McInnis'  home. Keller has since recovered.    An FBI spokesman in Los Angeles said that at least half the racial incidents  reported to the bureau involve physical violence and injuries, although  shootings are unusual. The charge against McInnis also is part of a growing  number of reports involving hundreds of race-related crimes.    Last year, the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations alone reported  167 race- related crimes in 1989, a record number and an increase of 75% over  1988. The commission said those incidents resulted in 90 arrests.    Steward said the case against McInnis was first filed as an assault case in San  Bernardino County Municipal Court, but then referred to federal authorities  because of possible violations of Keller's civil rights. Federal agents  arrested McInnis at the Victorville Courthouse on Thursday morning.

What is more, they  tried to send ""all the signals possible"" in order that their  Chilean colleagues might understand that, from this side of the  Andes mountain chain, ""nobody approves of the shows of  affection"" that the Chilean military -- and especially General  Augusto Pinochet, the Army commander in chief -- have lavished  on the former Iron Lady.    Even what the Argentine military labeled an ""accident"" made  the sparks fly. It took place on Saturday, 19 March, on the  very same day that Thatcher arrived on Chilean soil, when it  came to the knowledge of several members of the military that  the plane aboard which the former prime minister was flying to  Chile -- it was coming from Brazil -- had violated Argentine  airspace.    Thatcher was traveling aboard a Lear jet aircraft belonging  to the Chilean Aeronautical Directorate.    The Argentine military simplified the equation, and  concluded  that for them it was a military airplane transporting the  victorious party in the Malvinas war. And to make matters  worse, they were sure that the Chileans had not requested  permission to overfly Argentine territory.    Soon afterwards a new piece of information called this  statement into question. According to another military report,  the Air Regions Command had given the plane the ""okay"" to  overfly our territory.    It was already too late. The ""day Thatcher passed by  Argentina"" triggered off a sort of symbolic revenge. The  Chilean Embassy observed the day of the Air Force on Monday 21  March. By tradition, the chiefs of staff of each of the three  branches of the Armed Forces attend this ceremony.    As a result of a ""talked out decision"" -- as a military  source consulted by CLARIN termed it -- Lieutenant General  Martin Balza, the Army chief of staff, Admiral Enrique Molina  Pico, the Navy chief of staff, and Brigadier General Juan  Paulik, the Air Force chief of staff, agreed to ""boycott"" the  banquet.    The chiefs of staff sent representatives having the rank of  colonel (or equivalent), a position that is three ranks below  the topmost rank of each branch.    Difficult Relations    President Carlos Menem yesterday underscored ""the excellent  relations"" existing between Argentina and the United Kingdom.    The military seemingly share the president's view. Despite  this, Thatcher's trip to Chile showed them that what they call  the ""Chilean military buildup"" is the most bitter pill for them  to swallow. With very little trouble the Argentine military are  able to quickly enumerate all the military equipment purchased  by the Chileans over the last two months:    -- 40 Storm vehicles with anti-tank armament capability,  from Israel.    -- two ships for transporting troops, with a capacity for  300 men each, from the United States.    -- six CASA freighter planes, with a capacity of 24 men  each, from Spain.    And it is said that they are contemplating the purchase of:    -- two frigates from Great Britain.    -- 20 Mirage aircraft from Belgium.    -- New uniforms for the entire Armed Forces personnel that  cannot be detected by infrared equipment.    According to the Argentine military, the above list proves  that the ""regional balance"" is a concept of the past. From this  utterance, there is only a short step to demanding of the  government a speedy reequipping of the Armed Forces.     "
0,FT922-8696 ,"FT922-8696 _AN-CELA7ADGFT 920512   FT  12 MAY 92 / International Company News: Rights issue by Conti seen as turning point in Pirelli saga      By HAIG SIMONIAN      MILAN   THE BATTLE of wills between Pirelli and Continental may reach a turning point following Continental's decision yesterday to propose a DM150m (Dollars 90m) rights issue. Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, still owns 5 per cent of Continental's shares and has call options over 34 per cent more after last year's unsuccessful takeover attempt. Senior executives at Pirelli, which is headed by Mr Marco Tronchetti Provera, said they were waiting to see the terms of Continental's proposed capital increase before deciding their own strategy. The German company's plan must be approved by shareholders on July 3 before going ahead. A top executive said Pirelli did not consider the move, which has been rumoured for some time, as hostile. Relations between the two companies 'were neither positive nor negative' at present. 'I don't think it's against us,' he said. Analysts have suggested that Continental's capital increase may be part of a plan to buy some of Pirelli's businesses which are now for sale. Continental is believed to be particularly interested in Pirelli's Munich-based Metzeler auto components arm. Using cash from a rights issue - part of it possibly coming from Pirelli itself - for the purchase would be a neat turning of the tables for Continental. In September 1990 it faced a takeover proposal by Pirelli which appeared to require it to issue large amounts of debt to finance Pirelli's own plans. Whatever the outcome of the capital increase, both companies are now concentrating on restructuring. Announcing audited net losses of L729bn (Dollars 586m) last year, or L622bn after minority interests, Pirelli said its tyre activities had broken even so far this year. The improvement came largely thanks to heavy cost cutting, which involved the loss of 6,000 jobs and closure of a number of factories. However, the Pirelli executive said earnings had also been helped by 'some slight improvement' in tyre prices. After three years of vicious price wars between manufacturers, 'we've reached a bottom from which we can start to rise', he noted. The company hopes that further cost-saving will return the tyres business to profit in 1992. Pirelli is also advancing with the disposal of its diversified products division, which accounts for around 17 per cent of turnover. Negotiations on selling four of the seven 'business units' into which the division has been split are reaching a second, conclusive, phase. The four business units, which together have turnover of L1,200bn, produce anti-vibration systems, automobile profiles, hoses and assemblies, and power transmissions. Numerous offers had been received for all the businesses by the end-April closing date, and Pirelli executives are now sifting through the bids. The offers will be reduced to a maximum of four for each business unit. Those selected will then be given access to detailed financial information, and be permitted factory visits. All the offers have included indicative prices. However, the Pirelli executive said it would still be some time before the first deal was announced, as the selection would be complex and further clarification was necessary in some cases.

Even though many employers are reporting increased levels of United Way giving  this year, overall pledges are below the goal, officials said.    The agency has set a goal of $20.5 million this year, a 10% increase ever the  1988 pledge total of $18.6 million.    However, at midpoint of the fund-raising campaign, only an estimated 43% of the  goal has been met, according to an agency report.    ""We've witnessed some reductions in the size of companies that have been  traditional United Way campaign supporters,"" said campaign chairman Ronald L.  Merriman, managing partner of Peat Marwick Main & Co.    The United Way helps support 121 organizations in the county, including the  Salvation Army, the American Cancer Society, the Red Cross and other health and  welfare groups.    The agency's primary means of support is through payroll deductions. Officials  said that because of corporate belt-tightening, several companies have fewer  employees from whom to solicit funds.    Particularly hard hit have been computer, communications and aerospace firms,  Merriman said.    Despite the pessimistic prediction, Merriman said that there has been no  falloff among companies that traditionally support the agency and that other  crises such as the Bay Area earthquake have not hindered fund raising.    But this year's campaign carries the familiar baggage of past efforts. Despite  increases in overall giving, the campaign has failed to meet its fund-raising  goal in each of the last four years, falling about $600,000 short last year.    Officials are concerned that county corporations still contribute far less per  capita than in comparable areas.    According to the 1988 Orange County Survey, residents gave just $8.34 per  capita to charity last year -- a 30% decline from 1987 -- compared to a  national average of $18.79.    The United Way also does comparisons, grouping cities according to population  and other factors. Of six similar areas -- Boston, Baltimore, San Diego,  Atlanta and St. Louis -- Orange County ranks last in amount raised per capita.    ""It touches every organization if you have a community that doesn't give, and  wae are not immune to that,"" Merriman said. ""But we tend to forget that this is  an area with a high cost of living, and that is played out in maybe not the  same level of giving as other areas.""    The county has also gained notoriety of late for a less-than-accepting attitude  toward programs aimed at helping the poor.    However, community leaders said they are reluctant to attribute the United  Way's woes to a charity backlash.    ""The United Way funds pretty established things, so I don't think they would  suffer"" from a backlash, said Jean Forbath, chairwoman of the Orange County  Human Relations Commission and executive director of Share Our Selves, a Costa  Mesa-based relief group.    ""Unfortunately, I think it is a reflection of our community becoming more  self-centered and inward-looking,"" she said.    Forbath also said many people may have doubts about the efficiency of  charitable groups, believing that most of the money goes to overhead and not to  the people who most need it.    Fund-raising costs for the United Way are among the lowest of any charity,  spokesman Jeff Rocke said.    He added that 82 cents of every dollar raised goes directly to local agencies  for services.

We hope that this coordination will be enhanced to become an  established and firm framework, not mere seasonal coordination.    [Ahmad] The Syrian foreign minister has stated that the  April  meeting will decide whether the negotiations will resume. Is  this your stance too?    [Al-Hasan] We in Jordan are committed to the peace process  and to any meeting for consultation and coordination in the  sense that I have defined above. We hope this coordination  among the Arab countries will be established to reach a positive  stance that will help to boost the peace process and achieve  substantial progress in the negotiations.    [Ahmad] Will the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre have any effect  on the negotiations when they resume?    [Al-Hasan] The massacre has undoubtedly harmed the peace  process. We hope the international community and the cosponsors  of the Madrid peace conference, most notably the United States,  will pressure Israel to cease its arbitrary practices.    [Ahmad] How tense are Jordanian-Palestinian relations?    [Al-Hasan] Please excuse me from discussing this issue.    [Ahmad] But what is Jordan's stance on the recent  Palestinian  statement about Jordan's reservations over Resolution 904?    [Al-Hasan] Jordan has expressed no reservations about  Resolution 904 but it has its view on the Jerusalem issue. King  Husayn contacted some of his brother Arab leaders in Egypt,  Morocco, Syria, President 'Arafat, and President Clinton before  the resolution was issued, with the aim of obtaining approval  for the entire resolution without American reservations. The  king discussed Jordan's stance on Jerusalem. I have nothing to  add.    [Ahmad] Where have your negotiations with Israel reached?    [Al-Hasan] We approved the joint agenda last September  following the mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel.  The Jordanian-Israeli agenda includes the principal issues,  such as the land, borders, water, and refugees. We are  discussing all the points with the Israeli side but Israel must  agree to tackle the essential issues through which positive  progress can be made in the peace process.    [Ahmad] Does this mean the negotiations will stall if they  don't deal with a solution to some of the essential issues?    [Al-Hasan] The peace process has achieved many positive  things but the essential issues must be tackled so that the  peace process can proceed.    [Ahmad] How do you assess Egyptian-Jordanian relations?    [Al-Hasan] Relations are good and coordination and  consultations are proceeding well. We always seek to strengthen  this coordination. I discussed with my colleague the foreign  minister and with Prime Minister Dr. 'Atif Sidqi several issues  of common interest, including the two countries' higher  committee.    [Ahmad] When will the committee meet?    [Al-Hasan] The date will soon be agreed through diplomatic  channels.    [Ahmad] What about Jordanian-Gulf relations in light of King  Husayn's recent visit to some Gulf countries?    [Al-Hasan] Our relations with Oman are always excellent and  unique. Our relations with fraternal Qatar have reverted to  their normal course. We hope that the positive conditions will  emerge to return Jordanian-Gulf relations to their former state.     "

Of the five republics of former Soviet Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan  is considered to be the most democratic: Is this reputation  deserved?    [Akayev] It is well deserved. All our efforts are  concentrated on achieving this. Kyrgyzstan is founded on the  rule of law and is on the road to democracy. It is also true  that our process of democratization is proceeding at a faster  pace than in other countries in Central Asia. We have more  political parties than in France, and when it comes to freedom  of the press, the Kyrgyzstan's president is criticized more than  President Mitterrand!    [Meyer] Why?    [Akayev] I see three reasons. First, our democratic  traditions. We have always been the nomads of Central Asia, a  lifestyle which favors democracy. For example, our traditional  seat of power, the Council of Judges (Boloush) is elected. The  Kyrgyz are a very ancient people, older than the Kazakhs. We  can be traced back, in ancient Chinese texts, to as early as the  second century.    Another reason is our multi-ethnic structure: One Kyrgyz in  four is European, German, Russian, or another Slav. Finally,  our country has always been open to the outside world (except  during the Soviet era: editor's note). The Silk Road passed  through our land, which allowed us to assimilate traditions of  both the West and the East, and allowed us to quickly adapt to a  market economy; we are culturally prepared!    [Meyer] Why do people here so often hold up Switzerland as a  model of development for Kyrgyzstan?    [Akayev] In terms of state structure, we are closer to the  French model. Our Constitution reflects the French  Constitution, in terms of the separation of powers between the  president, the prime minister, parliament, and prefects. Our  fascination with Switzerland relates to something else.  Kyrgyzstan is like the reflection of Switzerland in Central  Asia. We also live in high mountains, the Ala-Too chain. Lake  Geneva is like our Lake Issyk Kul. Another similarity is that  both our peoples consist of three principal ethnic groups. With  its French-speaking, German-speaking, and Italian-speaking  cantons, Switzerland has been able to create a confederation.  We have 80 ethnic groups, but with three major ones: Kyrgyz,  Russians, and Uzbeks. Our journalists like to taunt me when I  say that Kyrgyzstan will become the Switzerland of Central Asia:  How, they think, can we compare ourselves to this ""little giant""  with its high tech industry and advanced social system? My  answer: By building a state founded on the rule of law!    [Meyer] What do you expect from Europe and what can  Kyrgyzstan offer Europe in return?    [Akayev] I expect a great deal! We already have links with  Europe, with Switzerland and Germany for example, but they are  still fragile. We are the only country in the CIS to have made  the change to a market economy according to the criteria of the  IMF and the World Bank. We are now embarking upon the  renovation of economic structures, which requires investment and  technology transfer. Europe has both of these. I am seeking to  stimulate the interest of your private investors in the  reconstruction and conversion of our industries. In return, we  can offer preferential terms for mining rare metals and raw  materials used in the new technologies and the strategic field.  We also have a natural environment which is perfect for the  development of green tourism.    [Meyer] You are a scientist by training, rather than a  career  politician; does this background lead you to adopt a different  approach to your presidency?    [Akayev] You know Napoleon, when he wanted to reward his  mathematics teacher, Laplace, he made him interior minister.  Shortly afterwards, as Laplace was constantly bothering him with  one little problem after another, the emperor decorated him, at  the same time sending him packing to continue his beloved  studies. I never use my scientific methods in politics. I  prefer to use the experience of previous great politicians whose  memoirs I read, such as de Gaulle, or Eisenhower. The other day  when I was in Moscow at the theater for a performance of ""Fouche  and Talleyrand,"" a very popular play at the moment, I said to  myself: ""I need ministers like that."" When he got up in the  morning, Fouche knew everything which had happened during the  night, even in the Emperor's chamber. But my interior minister  does not even know what is happening inside his ministry. My  finance minister is unable to collect more than 35 percent or 40  percent of the taxes. Fouche collected 200 percent, and without  annoying anybody! After the Great Depression, Roosevelt, who  was advised to form a government of scientists, replied:  ""Scientists are like sugar in your coffee. If there are too  many, it's undrinkable!"" So I try to develop realpolitik.    We Are Trying To Curb Russian Emigration    [Meyer] Is there a risk of ethnic rifts in Kyrgyzstan?    [Akayev] This problem is arising throughout Central Asia.  Our large Russian minorities are emigrating. It is a natural  process. France and Great Britain experienced the same thing in  the 1950's and 1960's, and the return of the Algerian-born  Frenchmen could have had serious consequences in France if there  had not been men like de Gaulle or Pompidou around at that time.  We have had ethnic problems, but so far we have managed to  avoid the worst. The departure of the Russians is one of the  conditions of democratization, but these Russians are also  qualified workers. We are trying to curb their departure.    [Meyer] One of your big problems is corruption. What is the  scope of corruption?    [Akayev] It has always existed, and there is no doubt that  it  is getting worse during this transitional period. We are seeing  some people grow breathtakingly wealthy while the mass is on the  brink of poverty. If we do not manage to halt it, then the  situation could explode. We need more than our forces alone to  fight it. Foreign influence, in the form of joint ventures,  technologies, and new blood, can only be a good thing.    Maintaining the Balance Between China and Russia    [Meyer] What are your relations with China, your big  neighbor  on the other side of the Tian Shan mountains, unknown territory  during the 30 years of Cold War, until 1989.    [Akayev] This question is of crucial importance for all of  Central Asia. As a region, we are flanked by two superpowers.  We see them as two wings to help us take off. Flying on these  two wings is our guarantee of sovereignty. Russia is our main  ally and leading trade partner. I hope we can bequeath this  stability, which is the fruit of our parents' efforts, to our  children. Our Russian cultural and scientific heritage serves  as our opening to the world. Through Russia, we are European,  the children of Montesquieu and Diderot.    For us, however, China is 1,000 km of border and 2,000 years  of common history. The first working school in this country was  Chinese. Via the Silk Route, the Chinese traded their textiles  for our sturdier horses. I pray to God that Russia and China  will always maintain good relations, because that is an  essential condition for our security and the security of all  Eurasia!    [Meyer] During his recent visit, did Chinese Prime Minister  Li Peng ask you to bring under Chinese administration the  Uighurian exile organizations from Xinjian ?    [Akayev] No. We have 24 ethnic organizations. We appreciate  their desire to be different and to maintain their identity, on  a strictly cultural level. Our relations with China are  normalizing, and it cannot put pressure on us.    [Meyer] Do you see the possibility of a rebirth of the  ancient empires of Central Asia, in a confederal or other form?    [Akayev] No. There will be no rebirth of the Turkestan of  old. Uzbeks and Kyrgyzis, for example have the same linguistic  and religious roots, but are very different. Our goals are the  same: To build a democracy based on a market economy. However,  the paths we have chosen are not the same. Another example can  be seen in the fact that the Turkmenistan's president wants to  return to authoritarian methods to establish democracy. We do  not have the same approach. It is impossible to restore  Turkestan under these conditions.    However, there are things which we must recreate together:  The democratic area and the borderless market that existed  1,000 years ago in Central Asia; the free trade of goods and  labor. The wellbeing of the peoples leads to solidarity. Three  presidents, Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, Karimov of Uzbekistan, and  myself, recently signed an agreement to avoid any hindrances to  trade. Finally, we must avoid using the concept of Turkestan as  a political pawn to counterbalance China: Nothing will be done  against China.     "

Whether your legal fight is about a late rent payment to your landlord, a  dispute with the local cleaners who ruined your expensive tuxedo, or an auto  dealer who doesn't agree with your interpretation of a car warranty, spending  money on lawyers and wasting time in court hearings can be frustrating. To all  sides.    If the emotional and financial costs of the battle are wearing thin, it's  probably time you considered mediation, or alternative dispute resolution, as  an option.    Mediation is not for all kinds of legal disputes. It works best when the  financial stakes are not excessive and when the parties know each other or have  some reason, such as a continuing economic relationship, to want to work out a  solution. Landlords and tenants, consumers and merchants, neighbors, family  members (trying to work out a divorce settlement) and small employers and their  employees are groups that may find mediation a good alternative to court.    Even some large corporations are experimenting with mediation as a way to  reduce the extremely high legal expenses associated with complex or highly  charged litigation. Mediators do not reach a decision on their own and then  tell the combatants what they have decided. Mediation is a process in which the  parties to the dispute participate in reaching a decision through consensus. It  is not based on legal precedents, except to the extent a mediator may discuss  how a court might resolve an issue, but it is based on common sense, good  judgment and compromise.    Mediation is usually less expensive than the judicial process and can be used  before or even during the middle of a lawsuit, if all sides agree.

In a ruling that carried no punitive fine but that is likely to cost the  company in terms of public relations, the state on Thursday night ordered  Nordstrom to pay a yet-to-be-determined amount of back wages to all affected  employees and to ""properly compensate"" them in the future for such tasks as  attending employee meetings, making home deliveries and writing thank-you notes  to customers.    The ruling affects workers only in Washington, where the department has the  option of turning its violation report over to county prosecutors or filing its  own lawsuit against Nordstrom.    The state acted in response to a complaint by the United Food and Commercial  Workers Union, which represents 2,000 Nordstrom employees in the Seattle area.  The union, echoing complaints that have surfaced throughout Nordstrom's  30,000-member U.S. work force, alleged that managers coerced employees into not  charging the company for hundreds of hours a year that many of them worked.    Times interviews with numerous employees indicated that Nordstrom's emphasis on  salespeople's ""sales-per-hour"" ratio indirectly encouraged many employees to  voluntarily ""punch out"" before performing some non-sales, customer-service  activities. ""Punching in"" for those hours would lower the sales-per-hour ratio.    Nordstrom officials, who have consistently denied that they have a policy of  ordering off-the-clock work, said in response to the state report that they  will ""fully comply with the law.""

In a ruling that carried no punitive fine but that is likely to cost the  company in terms of public relations, the state on Thursday night ordered  Nordstrom to pay a yet-to-be-determined amount of back wages to all affected  employees and to ""properly compensate"" them in the future for such tasks as  attending employee meetings, making home deliveries and writing thank-you notes  to customers.    The ruling affects workers only in Washington, where the department has the  option of turning its violation report over to county prosecutors or filing its  own lawsuit against Nordstrom.    The state acted in response to a complaint by the United Food and Commercial  Workers Union, which represents 2,000 Nordstrom employees in the Seattle area.  The union, echoing complaints that have surfaced throughout Nordstrom's  30,000-member U.S. work force, alleged that managers coerced employees into not  charging the company for hundreds of hours a year that many of them worked.    Times interviews with numerous employees indicated that Nordstrom's emphasis on  salespeople's ""sales-per-hour"" ratio indirectly encouraged many employees to  voluntarily ""punch out"" before performing some non-sales, customer-service  activities. ""Punching in"" for those hours would lower the sales-per-hour ratio.    Nordstrom officials, who have consistently denied that they have a policy of  ordering off-the-clock work, said in response to the state report that they  will ""fully comply with the law.""

The candidature of both Mexico's President Carlos Salinas and Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's finance minister, may split the Latin American vote and help their rivals. The differences over Latin America's choice follows competition over leadership of the trade issue in South America. This may be felt more strongly in Brasilia than in Mexico City. Brazilian officials have watched with discomfort as Mexico, after securing the North American Free Trade Agreement with the US and Canada, have signed free trade accords with South American governments. The latest, the Group of Three accord with Colombia and Venezuela, was signed last week. Brazil has responded with its own proposal for a South American free trade zone but the attraction has been limited by Brazil's economic instability. Put baldly, the Brazilian view is that Mexico has abrogated its right to speak for Latin America and the rest of the developing world by signing up to Nafta. In the more diplomatic language of a finance ministry official, Mr Ricupero could provide a 'third way' between the choices of the EU and Nafta trade blocs. A Brazilian foreign office spokesman insisted that Brazil believed Mr Ricupero remained a strong candidate. Mexico's foreign ministry argues that Mr Salinas' record as president of Mexico, strong commitment to free trade, and apparent support from most of Latin America, the US and Canada makes him by far the stronger of the two regional candidates - and the only one with a chance of winning. Mr Manuel Tello, Mexico's foreign minister, firmly denies that the rift between Mexico and Brazil reflected a wider struggle for Latin American leadership. He says the two candidates should be judged on individual merit. Mr Tello made little secret of his disappointment that Brazil has not backed down. Mr Tello said Mr Celso Amorim, Brazil's foreign minister, told him on May 30 that Brazil would reconsider proposing Mr Ricupero if Mr Salinas chose to run and that Mr Amorim had said the Mexican president's candidacy was 'a very good idea'. Brazilian officials denied this version, however. According to them, Mr Amorim told his Mexican counterpart and Mr Salinas on May 30 that countries would need to 'examine the situation' if a president - meaning Mr Salinas - became a candidate. This was, they say, diplomatic language and never intended as an indication that Mr Ricupero's candidacy could be withdrawn. In the absence of President Itamar Franco of Brazil, the Latin American participants of the Ibero-American Summit last week in Colombia backed the Salinas candidacy. According to Mr Tello, President Carlos Menem of Argentina first proposed that the heads of state should endorse Mr Salinas, arguing that the chance of an important international position for a Latin American should not be missed. Brazil's anger led to an embarrassing about-turn by Buenos Aires and Argentina issued a diplomatic letter stressing its support for Mr Ricupero. Mr Hugo Herrera Vegas, undersecretary at Argentina's foreign ministry, said: 'It was all a misunderstanding. It has been clarified. It was a mistake. These are the dangers of high level diplomacy, the diplomacy of chefs d'etat, which have their advantages as well as disadvantages.'

At the same time, he did not  rule out that there have been instances of radioactive  components being smuggled out. ""Yes, such attempts have been  made, and we have informed the public that we have put a stop to  them,"" he said. ""However, no enriched uranium or plutonium  (apparently used to manufacture arms) has been taken out of  Russia.""    Asked about the possibility of a leakage from former Soviet  republics following the collapse of the USSR, none of the  participants in the conversation could be equally certain. The  KRIM-TASS correspondent requested a meeting with  counterintelligence nuclear experts in connection with the noise  raised by Western media around the false allegations that Russia  helped North Korea develop a nuclear bomb and that Russian  mafia-style groups have control over the nuclear potential of  Russia itself.    Regarding the apprehensions recently expressed by FBI  Director Louis Freeh that ""nuclear materials can be smuggled out  of Russia into the United States for the purposes of terrorism""  or that in Russia's black market ""components of nuclear weapons  and highly enriched nuclear materials suitable for the  manufacture of weapons are being offered for sale,"" the  counterintelligence experts said unanimously: ""None of the  world's special services has detected any leakage of any  components used in the production of nuclear weapons. And even  Freeh himself could not cite any specific examples. We would  only thank anyone who could tell us specific facts, since this  is a matter directly affecting the security of our country.""  ""All these conjectures directly affect us counterintelligence  men. Indeed, the export of strategic uranium and plutonium and  also of nuclear components allegedly taking place cannot occur  behind the back of the Federal Counterintelligence Service,"" the  KRIM-TASS correspondent was told by a high-ranking official of  the Russian Federation's Federal Counterintelligence Service.  ""Therefore, experts of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  have deemed it necessary to provide a few explanations.""    ""As for the problem of so-called assistance to North Korea  in  creating its own nuclear bomb, be it with technology or with  experts, various officials of our country have repeatedly  declared our loyalty to the international agreements.  Cooperation in this field has been conducted exclusively for  peaceful purposes and under the supervision of the International  Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA],"" said an operational worker of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service who at the end of 1992  took part in measures to detain a group of Russian nuclear  experts trying to fly to North Korea. ""Thus far we have  successfully thwarted all such attempts to `recruit' people with  secret information in the said field, making use of the  difficult economic situation of our country, and all attempts by  secret services, including those of North Korea, to extract  information from nuclear facilities and to steal nuclear  technologies.""    ""Summing up the conversation with experts from the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Aleksandr Mikhaylov told the  KRIM-TASS correspondent that attempts to accuse Russia of being  incapable of controlling the nonproliferation of its nuclear  weapons, technology and materials are obviously being made in  pursuit of political aims. They are aimed at preparing public  opinion in the West for the idea of establishing political  control over Russian nuclear weapons.""     "

The actions taken by the  Taiwan authorities have cast a shadow over relations and  contacts between the two sides and have made more and more  people on the island worried and dissatisfied. People of many  trades and professions hold that the Taiwan authorities' actions  are not appropriate and that the suspension of exchanges and  contacts with the mainland will hurt Taiwan the most.    Taiwan's tourist business will suffer seriously due to  ""boycotting travel to the mainland."" Taiwan's ""Mainland Affairs  Commission"" decided to boycott travel to the mainland by the  people starting 1 May and the tourist services would have to  assume economic losses due to the decision. People of related  trades pointed out that travel to the mainland account for a big  proportion of Taiwan's tourist business. In Taibei [Taipei]  City alone, there are some 100 travel services handling travels  to the mainland. April and May are peak months for travel to the  mainland with 15,000 to 18,000 travelers each month. The travel  services will suffer at least 100 million New Taiwan dollars'  economic losses due to the halt of travel to the mainland.  People of Taiwan's tourist business pointed out that in the  past seven years, Taiwanese visited the mainland some 6 million  times. The number is unprecedented and the people's visits are  practical exchanges between the two sides. Travel and contacts  between the two sides of the strait must not stop because of  this singular ""Qiandao Lake incident.""    People in business circles also hold that the two sides of  the strait have already established close contacts and that the  retrogression of economic exchanges and trade between the two  sides will bring very big harm and loss to Taiwan's businessmen.  Huang Zhaofu [Huang Chao-fu], secretary general of Taiwan's  ""Industrial Association for Relations Between the Two Sides of  the Strait,"" said: Many Taiwan businessmen told the association  that economic and trade activities must not be influenced by the  ""Qiandao Lake incident."" Taiwan businessmen's interests are  mixed together with the mainland's interests, and we should make  no distinction between what are one's own and what are other  people's interests. Using the ""Qiandao Lake incident"" to create  a big display will only hurt the interests of Taiwan's  businessmen and cannot stop the tide of Taiwan businessmen's  investment on the mainland and economic exchanges and trade  between the two sides of the strait.    The temporary halt of cultural exchanges was also opposed by  people of cultural circles. Many people of the cultural circles  pointed out that cultural exchanges between the two sides of the  strait are favorable to Taiwan's absorbing the mainland's  advantages in culture, science and technology and are conducive  to Taiwan's cultural development. To stop cultural exchanges  between the two sides because of this singular incident will  hurt understanding and link established gradually through  cultural exchanges.    Taiwan's news media also pointed out that some people on the  island are using the ""Qiandao Lake incident"" to instigate Taiwan  compatriots' anti-mainland sentiments and advocate ""Taiwan  independence."" They are both inadvisable. The Taiwan  authorities' ""boycotting measures"" are to seize on an incident  to exaggerate matters and will hurt both sides, especially the  people in Taiwan.     "

The main signs are:    --Cross-strait economic links became closer, the number  of Taiwan businessmen coming to the mainland for investment  greatly increased, and cross-strait trade interactions rapidly  developed.    Over the past year, our country's political situation was  steady, our society was stable, and our national economy  maintained strong growth. Amid various reforms aimed at  building the socialist market economic system, investment  environment continuously improved. The great potential in  economic development and the broad prospects which had been  revealed continuously attracted numerous investors, traders, and  industrial and commercial entrepreneurs from Taiwan. Investments  made by Taiwan businessmen once again greatly increased in 1993,  on the basis of 1992, a year in which the number of investment  projects and the agreed upon funds all surpassed the sums of  former years. According to statistics provided by a relevant  department, from January to June 1993 the state approved a total  of 4,891 Taiwan-funded projects, and the agreed upon investment  funds reached $4.637 billion, an 187 percent increase and a 251  percent increase respectively over the same period in 1992. A  relevant person has estimated that in 1993 newly added  Taiwan-funded projects might reach 10,000, and the agreed upon  investment funds might exceed $10 billion, ranking Taiwan second  on the mainland in the drive to attract and utilize foreign  funds.    Another gratifying change in Taiwan investments in the  mainland during 1993 was that investors developed from medium  and small enterprises to large consortia and large enterprises,  and the investment regions rapidly developed from the coastal  areas and large and medium cities to the interior, remote areas,  prefectures, counties, towns, and townships. Jiangsu, Shandong,  Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong are still the areas attracting  most Taiwan investments, while Qinghai and Tibet also succeeded  in absorbing and utilizing Taiwan funds for the first time.  Taiwan-funded enterprises can be found in every province,  autonomous region, and municipality in the country. Many large  consortia and enterprises in Taiwan rushed to the mainland for  inspections and talks, and this undoubtedly created a broader  perspective for Taiwan businessmen to invest in the mainland.  Public opinion on the island held that ""it was the largest  scale in collectively going to the mainland for investments""  since the Taiwan authorities lifted the ban on contacts with the  mainland in 1987.    In the area of cross-strait trade, according to the  statistics provided by the relevant department, from January to  September 1993 the total trade volume between the two sides  passing through the entrepot of Hong Kong reached $6.39 billion,  a 21.18 percent increase over the same period in 1992. The  supplementary and reciprocal feature of trade and economic  development across the strait has already become a common  understanding on both sides. In order to further promote  economic cooperation between the two sides of the strait, at the  end of last year the Standing Committee of the National People's  Congress [NPC] began to discuss the ""PRC Law on Protecting  Investments by Taiwan Compatriots (draft)."" It can be predicted  that once this bill is adopted and implemented, it will greatly  promote cross-strait trade and economic development in the  direction to standardization and institutionalization.    --The coming and going of personnel across the strait  became more frequent, the level continuously rose, and various  exchanges continuously expanded, bringing in a new phase in  which the two sides of the strait carried out special  discussions and academic research together on various domains  such as politics, economy, science, technology, education,  culture, and society.    According to the statistics provided by the relevant  department, from January to September 1993 1.155 million Taiwan  residents visited the mainland, and the figure is expected to  top 1.6 million for the whole year, thus greatly surpassing the  1.36 million in 1992, whereas the cumulative sum in the past six  years would exceed 5 million people. The number of mainland  residents going to Taiwan also rose greatly. According to  statistics, 3,309 persons went to Taiwan in 1993 for various  exchange activities, 3.6 times the figure of 926 in 1992.    The two prominent characteristics of the coming and going of  personnel are the great increase in number and the continuous  upgrading of level. In June 1993 the Taiwan authorities,  succumbing to the pressure of opinions from various quarters,  could not but allow Zhang Kehui, member of NPC Standing  Committee and president of All-China Federation of Taiwan  Compatriots, to hasten home to Taiwan for the funeral of his  parent, and this was a breakthrough in the visits to Taiwan by  senior personnel from the mainland. The visits to Taiwan for  exchanges activities by well-known mainland personnel such as  Wang Fosong, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences;  Liu Ji, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social  Sciences; He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic  Committee; Wang Meng, former culture minister; Ying Ruocheng,  former vice minister of culture; and Bao Yujun, deputy editor in  chief of RENMIN RIBAO, all aroused greater responses on the  island.    The number of senior personnel coming from Taiwan to the  mainland for exchange activities also markedly increased over  1992, and among them were ""members of the National Assembly,""  ""members of the Legislative Yuan,"" ""adviser to the presidential  palace,"" members of the Standing Committee of the Central  Committee of the Kuomintang, and main leaders of other political  parties. Seeing for oneself is a hundred times better than  hearing from others. The frequent exchanges of personnel across  the strait and the upgrading of level are helpful to enhancing  mutual understanding between the people on both sides of the  strait, as well as among persons of various circles of the  society, so that they can foster compassion and increase  consensus. Their significance and influence are obvious and  profound.    When the coming and going of personnel from both sides of  the  strait became more frequent, various exchanges across the strait  also continuously expanded and deepened, scoring rich results.  Last year, apart from the bilateral exchanges in the domains  such as culture, education, science, technology, film,  television, news, and health, which continued to develop, other  domains such as religion, tourism, architecture, finance,  securities, land management, sports, and social customs also  realized bilateral exchanges. What must be mentioned in  particular is cultural exchange, which involved a large number  of people and large projects, and had good effects. The  performances by the China School of Beijing Opera, the Beijing  School of Beijing Opera, Sichuan's Sichuan Opera Troupe, Hubei's  Hankou Troupe, Beijing People's Arts Troupe, and Young Chinese  Arts Troupe, as well as the exhibition of wood and clay figures  of ancient warriors and horses, the exhibition of the jade  clothes sewn with gold thread, the visit by Yunmen Dance  Performing Troupe to Taiwan, and the first cross-strait movies  show all had great impacts and changed the past pattern whereby  Taiwan pop singers ""dominated"" the mainland. The cultural  exchanges between the two sides of the strait are developing in  the multilevel, multi-domain, and high- taste direction. The  success in the cross-strait cultural exchanges illustrated that  Chinese culture has tremendous rallying force, and is an  important foundation for the two sides of the strait to  establish consensus and mutual trust.    Another feature of the continuously deepening bilateral  exchanges across the strait last year was that there was an  increasing number of various seminars jointly held by both sides  of the strait, and the contents became richer and touched on  cross-strait relations, as well as economic, industrial,  cultural, educational, scientific, and technological  topics....The discussions on areas and topics by various  quarters from both sides of the strait will undoubtedly play a  positive role in developing cross-strait economic, social, and  cultural ties, and in strengthening the links and interactions  among various circles on both sides of the strait. They can  also enlighten both sides when they sit down for consultations  and negotiations, and seek peaceful reunification of the country.    --Smoothly holding the ""talks between Wang Daohan and  Koo Cheng- fu,"" realizing official contacts and discussions  between the senior- level persons of the nongovernmental domain,  and making an historic and important step forward in the  development of relations between the two sides of the  strait.    The ""Wang-Ku talks"" were the most eye-catching event in the  development of relations between the two sides of the strait in  1993. It was held at the end of April last year in Singapore,  after efforts made jointly by both sides. It was the first  meeting of the most senior persons of the empowered  nongovernmental organizations on both sides of the strait, as  well as the first open contact and discussion between the  senior-level persons in nongovernmental capacity in more than 40  years. It had great significance and profound impact, and it  drew a widespread attention from both sides of the strait and  the international community.    As part of that nongovernmental, economic, routine, and  functional meeting, basing themselves on the spirit of mutual  respect, of consultation on equal footing, of being practical,  and of seeking common point while allowing differences, both  sides seriously discussed the relevant problems, reached  consensus on many areas, and signed the four documents of the  ""Wang-Ku Talks Joint Accord,"" the ""Agreement on Ties and System  of Talks Between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Strait [ARATS] and the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF],"" the  ""Agreement on Examination and Verification of Notarial Deeds in  Use on Both Sides of the Strait,"" and the ""Agreement on  Cross-Strait Enquiry Into Registered Mail and the Matter of  Compensation,"" scoring results which satisfied both sides. The  complete success in this round of talks played a positive role  in promoting forward development of cross- strait relations and  in fostering peaceful reunification of the country. President  Jiang Zemin spoke highly of it, and he said: ""The Wang-Ku  meeting is successful and fruitful, signifying that the  development of cross-strait relations has made a historic and  important step.""    In order to thoroughly implement the relevant agreements  reached by the talks, the ARATS and SEF held work meetings in  late August, early November, and mid-December in Beijing,  Xiamen, and Taipei. Both sides discussed the matters such as  repatriation of personnel, fishing disputes, repatriation of  hijackers, and the way to arrange trips for the work personnel  from the ARATS and SEF. Both sides also exchanged ideas and  reached some consensus on protecting the rights and benefits of  Taiwan investors on the mainland, as well as the related  problems, and on the issue of visits by the persons of  industrial and commercial circles from both sides of the strait.  This enabled the routine talks between the two sides of the  strait to be further deepened.    --The publishing of the white paper on ""The Taiwan  Question and China's Reunification,"" has for the first time  systematically and openly explained the cause of the Taiwan  question, its current situation, and the crux of the problem.  It also explained the Chinese Government's position, idea, and  basic policy on solving the Taiwan question.    The white paper resolutely safeguarded state sovereignty and  territorial integrity, sternly refuted the fallacious theories  such as ""two Chinas,"" ""one China, one Taiwan,"" and ""Taiwan  independence."" The white paper also clearly pointed out: ""The  wishes of Taiwan compatriots to become masters of their homes  and to administer Taiwan are reasonable and proper, and this is  not like `Taiwan independence' and they are basically different  from a very small handful of those who insist on following the  road of `Taiwan independence.'"" The white paper, after being  published, aroused enthusiastic responses in the international  community and on the island of Taiwan, and scored very good  results. It has already produced -- and will continue to  produce -- a more profound impact on the development of  cross-strait ties and reunification of the country.    In conclusion, 1993 was a year in which the development of  cross- strait ties made a new breakthrough and important  headway. The situation continues to develop in the direction  which is conducive to the peaceful reunification of the country.  Over the past year, in order to promote the development of ties  across the strait and to realize peaceful reunification of the  country sooner, the CPC and the Chinese Government adopted a  series of important measures to promote various exchanges and  interactions across the strait, as well as nongovernmental  contacts and talks, and to promote direct ""three links,"" winning  the support and approval from people on both sides of the  strait. At the same time, the Taiwan authorities also further  lifted certain restrictions on cross-strait exchanges and  interactions, and adopted some measures which helped fostering  communications and understanding, and this is in accordance with  the wishes and interests of the people in the whole country,  including the compatriots in Taiwan, and this is also conducive  to the benevolent development of ties between the two sides of  the strait.    However, over the past year, the development of relations  between the two sides of the strait still experienced some  twists, turns, obstructions, and variables. The main reason  rested on the island of Taiwan. Over the past year, the  struggle among various political forces on the island  intensified, in particular, the Taiwan authorities advocated  ""participation in the United Nations,"" put forward so-called  ""phase-nature policy of two Chinas,"" and fell back on the  one-China position, while the trend of thought of ""Taiwan  independence"" ran rampant on the island. This produced  unfavorable influence on the development of cross-strait ties,  and met with the strong opposition from the people on both sides  of the strait, as well as from Overseas Chinese. There is only  one China in this world, and Taiwan is an inseparable part of  Chinese territory, any attempt to pursue ""two Chinas"" ""one  China, one Taiwan,"" or ""Taiwan independence"" cannot succeed.    Although things are not always smooth in the course of  reunification of the country, reunification of the country  accords with the will of the people, and this general trend of  history is one which cannot be changed by any force. We believe  that in the new year, cross-strait ties will continue to have a  bigger development, and cross-strait interactions and  cooperation will still maintain the tendency of rapid  development. We hope that, proceeding from the basic interest  of the Chinese nation, the Taiwan authorities will continue to  uphold the principle of one China, further remove various  artificial obstacles to political contacts and negotiations  between the two sides of the strait, and do more practical  things in order to develop cross-strait relations and foster  reunification of the country.

It is  significant that the prime ministers of two ASEAN countries are  paying official visits to Vietnam in a short period of time.  This is yet another manifestation of the common aspirations of  Vietnam and other friendly countries to accelerate bilateral  relations and promote cooperation in the region in accordance  with the trend of peace, stability, and development in Southeast  Asia and the Asia-Pacific region.    Thailand, a beautiful country with a long traditional  culture, is enjoying rapid economic growth. Over the past  several years, the government of Prime Minister Chuan Likphai  has led the Thai people in overcoming numerous difficulties,  stabilizing the political situation, and accelerating economic  reform. In 1993, Thailand attained a GDP increase of 7.7  percent and was ranked among the countries of the world with a  rapid developmental pace. Its industrial production increased by  10 percent; agriculture by 2.3 percent; exports by 12.8 percent;  tourism by 13 percent; investment in the government sector by 54  percent; and investment in the private sector by 85.7 percent.  Its foreign currency reserves reached $25 billion, and it was  ranked among the 10 countries in the world with the highest  foreign currency reserves. Thailand's per capita income is  $1,660. Given this development pace, Thailand's economy will  certainly grow by 8.3 percent this year.    Vietnam and Thailand are two close neighbors with  longstanding cultural ties. The two countries established  diplomatic relations in 1976. In recent years, relations  between the two countries have developed favorably, especially  in the economic and cultural domains. Various bilateral  agreements have been signed in the fields of trade, economic and  scientific-technological cooperation, aviation services, and  promotion and insurance of investments. The two countries have  established joint committee for economic cooperation and have  reached an agreement on avoiding double taxation. These  bilateral agreements are being effectively implemented, thus  creating a good basis for achieving high results in economic and  trade cooperation between the two countries. The value of  two-way trade in 1993 increased by $200 million, compared to $12  million in 1988.    Today, Thailand has 43 investment projects in Vietnam with a  total capital of $149 million -- third among the ASEAN  countries. The Thai Government has also helped Vietnam with the  purchase of essential equipment and in education and training.    The Vietnamese people would like to thank the Thai  Government  and people for their high appraisal of Vietnam's achievements in  the renovation undertaking, their special attention to  accelerating relations of friendship and cooperation with  Vietnam, and their readiness to share with Vietnam their  experiences in national development.    Through recent visits and meetings between Vietnamese and  Thai leaders, the two countries have expressed a common desire  to resolve various outstanding problems and create an atmosphere  of peace and stability in the region, thereby creating favorable  conditions for multifaceted cooperation between the two nations.  Thailand encourages and supports Vietnam to participate in  various ASEAN development programs and join the organization, so  as to contribute to restoring peace, stability, and development  in the region.    During his official visit to Thailand in October 1993, party  General Secretary Do Muoi expressed an earnest wish to see  Vietnam and Thailand further expand their multifaceted  cooperation based on the principles of mutual respect,  noninterference to each other's internal affairs, equality,  mutual interest, and good neighborliness.

Sometimes, nature surrounding us can cause us --  tired and nervous with everyday complexities -- to become wild,  and then we claim that protection of nature is not our affair.  Our correspondent queried Alyaksandr Matsyasovich, head of the  Information and Public Relations Department within the State  Committee for Ecological Issues, on the pressing ecology issues  in Belarus.    Matsyasovich: At the start, I would like to note  that our Republic is characterized by an irrational use of  natural resources. Before, we connected this fact with  domineering economic relations: Energy and natural resources had  to be used most effectively and no one was interested in the  effectiveness of production [as published]. Low quality  production brought about a lot of waste which was not processed.  For example, yearly, around 4.5 tonnes of domestic and  industrial waste (per capita!) is being produced in Belarus.  Only two enterprises in Belarus -- in Minsk and Mogilev -- are  dealing with the partial processing of waste. A powerful Minsk  factory is processing barely 30 percent of this waste. The  unprocessed waste is being dumped. Officially, our dumps occupy  an area of more than 10,000 hectares. However, no one has ever  calculated the area occupied by unofficial dumps....    A second problem is the large-scale intrusion into nature.  Many types of plants, animals, and insects have disappeared.    We are currently living in a situation where former wet  regions of Polesye are suffering from lack of water, especially,  in Gomel Oblast.    Hyerasimaw: Alyaksandr Alfonsavich, could you  please remind us what natural resources we are rich in and how  we are using them?    Matsyasovich: First, our water resources. Almost  all our cities have more or less effective purifying stations.  However, purifying stations in some of our regions are  overloaded and overutilized. Minsk purifying stations are in  the latter category.    We cannot drink water from our rivers. Due to the improper  use of fertilizers and insecticides, the agricultural sector of  Belarus presents the greatest danger to our rivers. However, it  is because of the improper behavior of people that nature  suffers most of all. The main polluter of our rivers is ... oil!  If in southern Belarus -- where oil lies close to the surface  -- the outer surface is polluted due to the oil's outlet to the  surface, the oil pollution of our remaining areas is caused by  the improper use of oil resources.    Our water purity records usually exceed normal levels from  one- two to 40 points, like in Soligorsk. Verkhnedvinskiy,  Nesvizhskiy Rayons, and some rayons of Brest and Grodno Oblasts  suffer from a high level of water pollution as well.    Further, some 3 million tonnes of polluted substances are  discharged in the air. This equals the amount of toxic  substances polluting the air of Zaporozhie and Krivoy Rog taken  together. Maybe this is not much, but Belarus, located in a  specific geographical zone, is to a greater extent polluted by  transferred air masses from other territories. If we are to  believe West European experts, the Belarusian atmosphere is  polluted in 18-20 percent by its own sources and in 80-82  percent -- by someone else's.    From all the Belarusian cities, Novopolotsk is in an  extremely serious ecological situation. However, in 1993, air  pollution in Novopolotsk was decreased by 22 percent. This  time, it is connected not to the upgrading of the production  capacity, but to the fall of the economy.    The Kuybyshev factory in Mogilev is very harmful from an  ecological standpoint. To my regret, we cannot do anything to  improve the situation because this factory is located in the  center of the city. We cannot move people, or this enterprise,  or close this dangerous giant producing one of the most  poisonous chemical substances. In addition, there is not enough  room to build effective purifying stations.    Many years ago, Belarus signed a range of international  agreements, one of which stipulates specific amounts of nitrogen  oxides discharged into the air. These agreements hamper the  development of our power industry. These agreements do not  allow operating the new electric power plant No. 5 which was  built in Minsk. At the same time, the Republic badly needs  electric energy. We cannot afford to buy a good purifying  installation from Japan or Germany. Power engineering in  Belarus is going to ask the international community for  permission to temporarily sidestep the above-mentioned  agreements until the Republic stabilizes the work of power  engineering. Recently, Portugal has received such permission.  By the way, Portugal, Poland, Rumania, and Malta are leading  polluters in the world.    Hyerasimaw: Our Republic should have an effective  legal footing and appropriate state institutions and  organizations to resolve ecology issues. Are we moving forward  in this direction?    Matsyasovich: First of all, responsibility for the  protection of nature should be carried out by environmental  users themselves. We have the ``Law on Nature Protection.''  Therefore, any enterprise, including small ones, should keep to  existing norms. It is difficult because they lack proper  technologies and purifying equipment. Our State Committee for  Ecological Issues controls the implementation of ecological  laws. Violation of these laws brings about financial and  administrative penalties. We can even close enterprises that  violate these laws. Yes, this issue is not properly organized  in our Republic. In my opinion, hereditary factors of the old  administrative system still affect our actions.    [Matsyasovich continues] Anyway, we could improve  the entire ecological situation, especially our specific  institutions dealing with Chernobyl issues and following their  own programs. We require perspective, and a scientifically  grounded ecological policy. We require systematic monitoring,  scientific vision, etc. We have a relatively high research  potential. Already in the 1970's, Belarusian researchers  conducted a scientific prognosis for the next 20 years, and they  had prognosticated much of what we are experiencing today.  However, nobody wanted to listen to them then. We have  interesting research projects. It is essential to find such  economic levers that could make our producers use natural  resources rationally. It sounds incredible, but our legislation  has no notion of the so-called ``ecological crime.'' Following  is one of many examples. In Novopolotsk, around 90,000 tonnes  of high toxic substances have been spilled into the Dvina river.  Later, they reached the Baltic Sea and caused the death of  fish. The operator and the security engineer were tried for  violation of security rules but not for any serious ``ecological  crime.''    Violators of ecological laws are fined for polluting water  or  for poaching. So, what about the land and air? Currently, an  ecological code of laws including 16 laws is being drafted. We  have adopted the ``Law on the Protection of the Environment,''  ``On Ecological Examination,'' ``On Ecological Taxation,'' ``On  Waste.'' The laws ``On Protected Territories,'' ``On  Ecological Education,'' and ``On Regulation of the State Control  System'' are being drafted.    We should create a single system of state control. Just at  the moment, the state control system is split. The State  Committee for Protection of the Environment, the State Committee  for Land Reform, the Ministry of Forestry controlling the use  and protection of forests, the Chief Department of Belarusian  Fish Industry, the Chief Committee for Water, Meteorology  [Belhidramet], and various sanitary services do not cooperate.  None of these institutions has enough powers.    We should also speak about the examination of projects by  state experts, the system for the ecological education of  experts, the ecological culture of the population, and the use  of international experience.    Hyerasimaw: Yes, there are a lot of problems.  However, can we hope that they will be resolved?    Matsyasovich: In my opinion, we will be able to  resolve them. In the spring of 1993, the Belarusian Cabinet of  Ministers adopted a decree stipulating the upgrading of the  monitoring system. This decree will be implemented in 1994-95.  The decree on the introduction of regular land surveys has also  been adopted. This means that the use of all natural resources  will be strictly controlled, and the natural resources will be  subject to normative use. If we consider forestry, I can say  the following. The corresponding laws that had been adopted are  being currently implemented in this sphere. Felling does not  exceed the growth of forests. You know, after the 1941-45 war,  the greatest part of our forests was destroyed. Only 2.5  percent of the mature forest is left. Currently, a third of  Belarus is covered by forests. In other words, the program of  use and restoration of forests is being implemented. First of  all, we require a protection system for all our natural  resources. Of course, if new laws are adopted they will be  implemented and we will make progress.    Hyerasimaw: I wish you success. Thank you for the  interview.     "

The minister said he could only wish that these talks were  ""the beginning of the Russo-Chinese relations' transition on to  a qualitatively new level of wide-ranging constructive  partnership."" In his opinion, this partnership should extend to  cover not only bilateral cooperation, but also the two  countries' approach to solving issues of international  importance.    In the course of the negotiations, the two ministers  discussed a number of economic issues. Kozyrev pointed out that  Russia would like to launch some the joint projects, in  particular, the construction of a hydroelectric power station on  the river Yangtze. The two sides agreed to use the principle of  combined commercial activities on disputed sections of the  border as a temporary measure.    The talks also produced an agreement to continue the two  countries' military and technical cooperation, strictly  observing both their mutual interests and international  obligations.    The two sides signed a protocol between the Russian and  Chinese foreign ministries and an intergovernmental agreement on  the status of checkpoints on the Russo-Chinese border.    Speaking in the Chinese Association of People's Diplomacy  after the end of the talks, the Russian foreign minister pointed  to ""the Asian Pacific region's increasing importance for the  future of Russia,"" connected with the greater economic role  played by the Asian part of Russia. This makes the ties with  Asian neighbors even more important, as they already account for  about one third of Russia's trade turnover.    Kozyrev believes that the system of international relations  in the region, as in the whole world, ""is gaining a stable  multipolar character,"" while the ideology of regional and global  alliances of some Asian Pacific countries against others ""is  becoming a thing of the past."" The future of the region lies  not in power competition, but rather in cooperation and  interaction, he pointed out. The minister said the principle of  stable and balanced relations was the cornerstone of the  treaties Russia concluded with all countries of the region. He  added that the danger of large-scale armed conflicts in the  region had been reduced to a minimum today.    The Russian foreign minister described the XXI century as ""a  century of the Pacific region,"" since the Asian Pacific region's  economic role would have special importance. Asian countries'  international positions will be determined, in the first place,  by the extent of their involvement in the region's economic  relations. Russia is convinced building up the region's economic  potential is of no threat to its neighbors, but instead, it  creates the conditions for a dynamic economic growth, the  minister pointed out. ""Competition in this sphere is a mutually  profitable competition which all members of the Asian community  need,"" he added.    After the talks, Kozyrev's political advisor Galina Sidorova  said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was likely to  pay an official visit to China this year.    It is supposed that the main goal of the prime minister's  visit will be preparing a Russo-Chinese summit in Moscow. The  Chairman of China's State Council, Jiang Zemin, is expected to  come to Russia on an official visit in the third quarter of this  year, while Chernomyrdin is likely to visit China this May.

It has also suspended high-level visits between the two countries, a Foreign  Ministry spokesman said.    The freeze affects an agreed-upon $7.5-million loan and any new loans until  further notice.     -- The Italian government said it had suspended future development aid to  China because of Beijing's ""unacceptable repression."" Foreign Minister Giulio  Andreotti said, ""We have no choice but to suspend consideration (of future  programs) as a sign of our grave dissent from current executions and  unacceptable repression.""

Katyal: ""Stabilizing Ties With China""]    [Text] It is a measure of stability of the Sino-Indian  relations that there was no undue despair over the limited  progress by their experts, at their meeting last week to sort  out differences over the expansion of confidence building  measures [CBMs] along the border. On the contrary, the headlines  on the conclusion of their two days' discussions were based on a  positive but general comment of the Foreign Office  spokesman--that both sides had adopted a ""constructive and  forward-looking approach."" He need not have taken shelter behind  these cliches. The slow advance in the negotiations on sensitive  matters, connected with the advanced stage of the CBMs, is  unlikely to cause a misunderstanding. On the contrary, there is  the danger of avoidable suspicion if official remarks are seen  as glossing over specifics.    The experts, a mixed group of diplomats and military  personnel, met as a follow-up of the agreement, reached during  the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao's visit to China in  September last year, through which the two sides formalised  their resolve to maintain peace and tranquillity along the Line  of Control. The agreement, it was stated then, had established a  framework, but details were to be settled in keeping with the  principle of ""mutual and equal security."" The ""depth, timing and  nature"" of the reduction of forces--to cite one measure--were to  be settled through mutual discussions. Going by official  statements (and also what was left unstated) at the time of Mr.  Rao's visit, the experts were to sort out differences on the  alignment of the LAC [Line of Actual Control], reducing the  military forces along it and the modalities for re-deployment,  so as to end the eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation (in some  cases). The last task would also involve relocation of border  posts.    This is not an easy job, complicated as much by the  background of confrontation as by the terrain where equality in  the depth of withdrawal could confer unequal advantages on the  two sides. The negotiations, therefore, were bound to be hard  and tough and even the next round may not be final. This should  not cause dismay, much less alarm. On the contrary, it is a  matter of satisfaction that persisting differences are contained  within the framework for negotiations and do not disturb either  the peace in the border region or the CBMs, already in place.  The two sides may not have yet pulled out troops in conformity  with a mutually agreed plan but were known to have effected  withdrawal on the basis of their respective, independent  assessments.    The steps already taken or intended to be taken (subject to  the mutual agreement) are no flash-in-pan affair but are  anchored in the political understanding borne out of contacts at  various levels, from the top downward. It had been an  incremental process that promoted amity not only on  border-related issues but in most of the bilateral field. The  border has been tension-free now for years and even those  Western correspondents, who specialised in predicting conflict  and hostilities in the late Eighties on the strength of the  flimsiest of pointers, have not predicted a clash. The contacts  between the commanders and other related steps involved the  military forces in the institutionalised arrangement to maintain  peace in the border areas. It worked well and was gradually  expanded. What is now being attempted is a further expansion,  based on a firmer basis.    The progress and the positive results achieved in this case  encouraged New Delhi to suggest an identical arrangement to  Pakistan to stabilise the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.  This was the subject-matter of one of the six proposals,  conveyed to Islamabad last month for a smooth working  arrangement. The most comprehensive document, it was virtually  in the form of a draft agreement, based as it was on the  parallel with the Sino-Indian border. The LAC in Jammu and  Kashmir, as a matter of fact, is already demarcated, with the  two sides committed to respecting it under the Shimla Agreement.  The fact that there are no ambiguities about it should have been  an advantage but, in the context of distrust and acrimony, the  deadlock persists.    The involvement of the military establishments in the  Sino-Indian contacts is comparatively a recent development. The  interaction began in the late Eighties but picked up in the  aftermath of the positive process set in motion in December 1988  by the China visit of the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. It  got a new impetus in 1992 by the Beijing trip of the Defence  Minister of the day, Mr. Sharad Pawar. Mr. Pawar's move, itself,  followed contacts at other levels--the 1990 visit to China of a  team of the National Defence College and a return trip here by a  delegation of the Chinese National Defence University. Recently,  the military exchanges got a new spurt--with a visit by the  Chinese Vice Chief of the Army Staff here after a gap of some 30  years and calls for the Chinese naval ships at Bombay after four  decades.    This is a matter of satisfaction, but not of euphoria. There  are certain features of China's policies which cannot but cause  worry here. China, as is known, had been of crucial help to  Pakistan by providing it nuclear know-how. But for it,  Islamabad, perhaps, would not have achieved the present level of  development of its nuclear capability. Recently Chinese supplies  of M-11 missiles to Pakistan not only caused nervousness here  but also attracted the notice of the United States--it was  regarded a violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime  (MTCR), to which Beijing is a party. China, of course, does not  see anything unusual in it--this and other supplies are  described as commercial deals, and as the Chinese Ambassador in  New Delhi, Mr. Ruisheng Cheng, said the other day, India could  be a buyer of the military hardware if it desired.    China's nuclear capability--and its leaps forward--could not  but be a source of discomfort to India. The installation of  nuclear weapons in Tibet merely demonstrated the meaning of the  Chinese programme for India. It could not be directed at major  powers in the West. The other nations which should be worried  are Japan and the ASEAN [Association of South East Asian  Nations] countries. But, surprisingly, both China, a nuclear  power, and, Japan a non-nuclear power are signatories to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] and often lecture India  on the virtues of acceding to the treaty. Logically, Japan  should have a better appreciation of India's concerns but,  perhaps because of pressures from Washington and others in the  industrialised world, it echoes their exhortations to New Delhi.  The ASEAN members have big economic stakes in China in the wake  of its gigantic reform and liberalisation processes. This tends  to submerge the concerns over Beijing's nuclear policies and  related matters. But, in their heart of hearts, there is a  desire to balance a forward-looking China with some other  power--India could be one--now that the United States has  curtailed its presence in the region.    The bilateral relations between countries are seldom a  black-or-white affair, but a mix of the positive and the  negative, the comforting and the worrisome. The Sino-Indian ties  are no exception, and if there are incongruities in the  different elements of the total relationship, it should be taken  as a normal feature.    The mutually conflicting strands manifest themselves in  varied forms. Take the case of India and its stand on the NPT.  When pressured by the Western nations to accede to the treaty or  accept its regional variant, India pleads its inability to do so  because of its security concerns. New Delhi wants them to take  into account the China factor. And they turn round and say: ""But  haven't you normalised your relations with China? Have you not  agreed to maintain peace and tranquillity along the border?""    Not long ago, Pakistan-China relationship was India's major  worry. Because of their shared antipathy to India, the two  countries found several convergence points in their  neighbourhood policies. Pakistan achieved a major success by  securing China's public support on the Kashmir and other  problems with India. Beijing did not mince words in backing the  demand for a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir. Also, other  neighbours like Nepal made full use of the China card against  India. No such voices emanate from Beijing now. China supports  the idea of a solution of Kashmir and other issues through  direct, bilateral discussions between India and Pakistan. It  sees no other role for itself--certainly not as a mediator.  During her recent visit to Beijing, the Pakistan Prime Minister,  Ms. Benazir Bhutto, failed to secure China's support on these  matters. But otherwise Sino-Pakistan warmth remains undiminished.    And what about the United States and China? With all the  talk  against the human rights record of China, the United States has  not hesitated in forging close trade ties with it. It is a new,  pragmatic pattern--and Sino-Indian ties fit into it with several  pluses--but with some minuses.     "

0,FT931-9182 ,"FT931-9182 _AN-DBPBVABBFT 930216   FT  16 FEB 93 / Los Angeles repairs fabric but fails to heal wounds      By GEORGE GRAHAM   LOS ANGELES has wasted no time sweeping away the debris of the riots that racked the city nine months ago, leaving 42 dead and Dollars 1bn worth of damage. On almost every corner of Crenshaw Boulevard, running through a predominantly black district west of the city centre, shops were looted and burned during last spring's rioting. Today, many have reopened in newly constructed or refurbished premises. Other buildings are under construction, and even those plots where nothing is being done are tidied and neatly fenced. Many in Los Angeles express concern, however, that little has changed in their city, and also frustration that government at city, state and federal level has failed to respond to the challenge posed by riots on the scale seen last year. 'The Los Angeles riots were supposed to be a wake-up call. I am beginning to be afraid that people have put it on snooze control,' says Ms Dolly Gee, a labour lawyer active in the Asian-American community. Many Angelenos acknowledge a degree of tension as a second trial gets under way for the police officers whose acquittal last year on charges of assaulting Mr Rodney King sparked off the rioting, and the first cases resulting from the riots themselves also come to court. Relations between the city's African-American, Anglo, Latino and Asian-American communities are still often tense, with particular friction between blacks and Korean grocery store owners, who bore the brunt of last year's destruction. But there is also considerable irritation at a media portrait of inner Los Angeles as a powder keg waiting to explode once again as soon as the verdicts are returned in the police beating case, tried this time in a federal court. 'I am not prepared to say that tensions are rising. In fact, I think that generally speaking when you do have a riot a lot of energy is ventilated, and maybe you are not going to have a riot again in the same place,' says the Reverend James Lawson, pastor of the Holman United Methodist Church. The verdict in the second King trial, whether guilty or innocent, is unlikely to be greeted with as much surprise as the first acquittal, which appeared to fly in the face of the clear evidence of a videotape of the incident widely shown on television. However, many blacks in Los Angeles resent what they see as the contrast between the leniency accorded the police, and the much harsher treatment of the black youths accused of beating a white lorry driver during the riots whose trial is also getting under way. Many Angelenos, ordinary citizens as well as community activists and businessmen, express growing frustration at the lack of political leaders with any kind of vision, beyond short-term riot prevention, for a new Los Angeles equipped to deal with its variegated patterns of wealth, poverty, race and culture. 'We do feel government shouldn't abdicate its role, and to some extent it has,' said Mr Barry Sanders, a senior partner with the law firm of Latham  Watkins and co-chair of Rebuild LA, a task force set up in the wake of the riots to try to bring economic development back to the city's more depressed areas. With no fewer than 52 candidates scrambling to take the place of retiring Mayor Tom Bradley, that vacuum seems unlikely to be filled in the near future.

He graduated  from MGU [Moscow State University] with distinction in the field  of economic cybernetics. He is a doctor of sciences. He has  published some 100 scholarly works and articles on issues of  Soviet and Russian economic development. Since the early 1990's  he has worked on problems of the structural crisis in the Soviet  and Russian economy and development of approaches to overcome  it. From 23 December 1992 to 21 September 1993 he was Russian  minister of foreign economic relations. During the time that he  worked in this post he was able to overcome the downward trend  in exports, increase the export of finished products, and reach  a stable positive balance of trade. He retired on 21 September  1993 in disagreement with Presidential Edict No 1400, entitled  ""Constitutional Reform in Stages,"" which he believed violated  the Constitution. He is a deputy to the State Duma and chairman  of the State Duma Committee on foreign economic policy.    [Kozlov] Sergey Yuryevich, how would you describe the  present  state of affairs in the Russian economy?    [Glazyev] As not very reassuring. The paramount problem now  is the state budget, a draft of which is being reviewed in the  Duma right now. The actual economic policy which is concealed in  this draft will not help the country out of economic crisis and  gives no guarantees against plunging into hyperinflation and a  disastrous decline in production. The validity of the  macroeconomic hypothesis on which the draft budget is based  raises grave doubts. The budget itself does not fit this  hypothesis in its income and expenditure parts. For example, the  income part for foreign economic activity is greatly  understated. Budget income from the profit tax is exaggerated.    [Kozlov] And yet the budget was written by professionals...    [Glazyev] We can assume that they were guided by the 7-8  percent growth rate which occurred at the end of last year.  Beginning from this they calculated the approximate levels of  income and expenditures. The reality, however, proved much  harsher. According to expert estimates the drop in production  may be much more than expected and could be somewhere on the  order of 20-25 percent. Naturally, this will make it impossible  to reduce the rate of inflation and will put the country on the  brink of a plunge into hyperinflation. In January of this year  the drop in machinebuilding production reached almost 50 percent  compared with last year. Possibly this is not felt much in  governmental structures, but the workers whose enterprises have  shut down and the sectors whose production volume has decreased  several times over are undergoing a disaster today.    [Kozlov] Can we speak of even a rough balance in the budget?    [Glazyev] There is an obvious discrepancy in priorities in  the expenditure part. It is contemplated that enormous amounts  of money will be spent to maintain the fuel-energy complex and  agriculture, while inadequate amounts are envisioned for  science-intensive industry, conversion, and stimulating growth  in high-tech production areas. The obvious disproportions of the  budget message, its unreliability to put it one way, lead me to  think that we have to help the Government formulate a normal  economic policy and an acceptable budget.    [Kozlov] Isn't that what the Supreme Soviet, of sad memory,  was striving for?    [Glazyev] Well, so everything in life repeats itself. In all  likelihood we will propose to the Government that they join  forces with specialists from the State Duma. This kind of  initiative is in the spirit of recent steps of the Federal  Assembly, President, and the opposition to achieve civil peace  and consensus.    [Kozlov] When can we expect adoption of a refined and  amended  budget?    [Glazyev] We must try to see that the country enters the  second half of the year with a ratified budget for 1994. Then we  will immediately be able to begin work on the budget for the  next year.    [Kozlov] Incidentally, what happened to the recently  published anticrisis program of academicians Abalkin, Petrakov,  and Shatalin, the Saburov program, and indeed, your own program,  Sergey Yuryevich?    [Glazyev] They were certainly considered in preparation of  the President's Message to the Federal Assembly, but they were  not actually reflected in the Government's economic policy.    [Kozlov] What do you think of the term ""Ukainization of the  economy?"" Much has already been said about the similarity of  negative processes occurring in the Russian and Ukrainian  economies. What differences do you see?    [Glazyev] The term ""Ukrainization"" is improper from the  start. Objectively speaking, Ukraine is in a completely  different foreign economic situation than Russia. Russia today  has a stable positive balance of trade with a very significant  excess of export over import. Ukraine, on the contrary, has a  large and chronic trade deficit. It seems to me that without  large-scale foreign aid it will be hard for Ukraine to overcome  its economic crisis.    [Kozlov] What can you say about the current structure of  Russian export? The anticrisis program which you authored  envisions mechanisms to get back the many billions of dollars  which have settled in the foreign bank accounts of a small  number of Russians. How do you intend to do this?    [Glazyev] The structure of Russian export has now changed  for  the worse. Its raw material component has intensified anew. As  for domestic capital abroad, by last summer the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations had introduced a system to monitor  foreign currency revenue from export of raw materials. It was  fairly well thought out and had technical support, but  unfortunately, in the second half of the year it practically  ceased operations. We were not able to stop the leakage of  foreign currency income abroad. Generally speaking, there is  nothing difficult in monitoring export and import. The  appropriate instruments have been well-known for a long time.  Everything depends on the desire of the Central Bank, Ministry  of Finance, State Customs Committee, and Ministry of Foreign  Economic Relations to take the appropriate measures. Judging by  everything, they still do not have this desire. But everything  is determined by the macroeconomic situation in the country.  Repressive measures produce little here. But if conditions for  stabilization are secured the investment climate will change for  the better and legal capital will begin to return. As for  investment by Russian natural and legal persons in physical  assets abroad, in particular in real estate, this capital is  lost forever.    [Kozlov] What is your attitude toward the method established  in Russia for determining the exchange rate of the ruble in  auctions at the interbank currency exchange? How well does the  rate that is formed correspond to the actual ratio of the ruble  and the dollar?    [Glazyev] It seems to me that determination of the exchange  rate should be a significant, independent element of government  economic policy. The rate today is established in a largely  unplanned way. It is subject to such fluctuations that exporters  and importers cannot make long-term or even medium-term  forecasts. It is essential to have an exchange rate policy that  is independent, intelligible, and predictable for all  participants in economic activity. I do not think that the  exchange rate of the ruble today is too low, though. That is, of  course, if you do not take account of non-commodity, embodied  Russian assets. The stock market, the market for capital still  has not started working in Russia. Therefore the exchange rate  is formed exclusively in the commodity market.    [Kozlov] The last 100 days of voucher privatization have  come. In your view, has it been possible to accomplish the  assigned tasks within the framework of the model chosen by  Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee on Administration of State  Property]?    [Glazyev] I do not think so. Effective ownership mechanisms  have not been created in the economy. We do not know who  three-quarters of the privatized enterprises today belong to. If  we consider the fact that 80 percent of the commercial banks  were formed by industrial enterprises, we will see that the  ownership system which has developed among them is the system of  an undeveloped market economy--the so-called ""Yugoslav model.""  It leads to chronic depression, galloping inflation, economic  disintegration, and separatism. Perhaps the time has come to  look around and move toward creation of an effective system of  market-based ownership relations and not carry this hopeless  scheme to its final ""triumph.""    [Kozlov] On the one hand everyone talks of consensus and  national reconciliation, while on the other they intimidate you  with another round of confrontation...    [Glazyev] The dividing line does not run between advocates  and opponents of the reforms. It lies between those who want to  establish order, attain economic success, and overcome the  crisis and those who continue to rock the boat, instill  radicalism in public opinion, frighten the people with civil  war, and stir things up, creating muddy waters which they  themselves take advantage of.

The situation in  Dagestan, however, has reached a critical point. This is  attested to by the nature of the discussion of 18 January in the  Republic of Dagestan Council of Ministers and by the resolutions  that were passed there. The discussion topic was listed on the  agenda as ""Unregulated Migration Processes in the Republic of  Dagestan."" Chief Ilyasov of the personnel administration, who  also heads a special commission on migration, reported that the  number of Russians leaving the republic is increasing and said  that around 4,000 Russians had moved permanently out of Dagestan  in 1993. According to the 1989 census there were around 166,000  Russians in the Republic of Dagestan (approximately 9.2 percent  of the republic population of 1.8 million, but in the middle of  1993 the figure was just over 7 percent).    In recent years the process has acquired the characteristics  of a virtual avalanche. As Ilyasov reported, a sociological  survey indicated that the main reasons for Russian emigration  were the socioeconomic instability, the rising crime rate, and  the inter-ethnic friction. The speaker also mentioned other  reasons: unemployment (4.9 percent at the end of 1993 in  comparison with the republic average of 0.9 percent) and the  failure of wages to keep up with the minimum subsistence level.  According to Ilyasov, however, the main reason is the exertion  of unlawful pressure on the Russian population. Representatives  of law enforcement agencies reported that three criminal groups  in Makhachkala had divided up the city's neighborhoods and were  engaging in explicit acts of terrorism.    There are reports of 102 families that were given 10 days to  leave Makhachkala. Their documents were taken away from them,  and the property owners among them were forced at gunpoint to  sign sale authorizations. The republic Ministry of Internal  Affairs received 21 official complaints, but 40 incidents were  actually recorded. Twenty of these reports were substantiated,  but only one case was turned over to the courts. Chairman  Ramazanov of the Standing Commission on Interethnic Relations of  the republic Supreme Council said that the roots of the problem  include the erroneous policy of resettling highlanders in the  flatlands, which began back in the 1950s.    In a final settlement, Chairman Mirzabekov of the republic  Council of Ministers reminded the gathering that the existence  of the ""Russian problem"" had been acknowledged by the republic  leadership, and this means that all government agencies should  be taking measures to deter Russian emigration. He said he had  set up a coordinating council for the Kizlyar zone, that the  possibility of special status for the zone was being considered,  and that funds were being allocated for the socioeconomic  development of these regions. He said it was outrageous that  government agencies were responding to the complaints of  forcibly evicted citizens by advising them to take the matter to  court. He reminded the gathering that no member of a native  ethnic group in Dagestan had complained of eviction from a  Russian city on ethnic grounds.    According to Chief Palamarchuk of the Kizlyar municipal  administration, the resolution of the problem will depend mainly  on the activities of law enforcement agencies. Some local  administrations are offering their services in the purchase and  sale of real estate, but the Russians have had a mixed reaction  to this.     "

By DON SHANNON, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Two U.S. senators called on Nicaragua's Sandinista army and the Contra rebels  Saturday to turn in their weapons to help preserve the peace in their own  country and to prevent their arsenals from fueling the civil war in El  Salvador.    Sens. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) and Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) agreed in a broadcast  interview that a rapid arms cleanup is necessary to safeguard the new civilian  government of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, who upset President  Daniel Ortega at the polls last week.    Former Contra leader Adolfo Calero and Assistant Secretary of State for Latin  America Bernard Aronson, appearing on the same program as Dodd and Gramm,  emphasized the need for government guarantees to ensure the peaceful  integration of about 10,000 former guerrillas into Nicaraguan society.    Dodd, chairman of a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on hemisphere  affairs, and Gramm, a leading conservative, said that unless weapons in Central  America's most heavily armed nation are carefully accounted for, they may find  their way to El Salvador.    ""Programs that have both the military and Contras turn in their weapons are  very important,"" Gramm said on Cable News Network's ""Newsmaker Saturday""  program.    In the past, Salvadoran anti-government guerrillas have received major support  from the Sandinistas. There have also been unconfirmed reports that despite  their ideological differences, the U.S.-supplied Contras have sold weapons to  the Salvadoran rebels.    Although Contra leaders have refused to order their troops to turn in their  weapons before the 70,000 soldiers of the Sandinista-controlled army are  disarmed, Chamorro and President Bush have urged them to do so. Bush, in fact,  differed publicly with former President Ronald Reagan over the issue during a  meeting between the two in Los Angeles on Friday.    Harry Shlaudeman, a retired U.S. ambassador to Brazil who now serves as a  special State Department representative on Central American affairs, was in  Tegucigalpa, Honduras, this weekend seeking to persuade Contra leaders to leave  their Honduran camps.    At one time, Reagan Administration officials had proposed offering U.S. refugee  status to Contras. Dodd, however, discounted that possibility.    ""I don't think there's going to be much appetite to come up with green cards,""  he said. ""They've got to (go) back home.""    While both Dodd and Gramm warned of fiscal limitations on U.S. economic aid for  Nicaragua, Aronson said the Administration wants to ""move very quickly"" on a  support package similar to the assistance offered to Panama after the U.S.  invasion.    ""There are some immediate steps we're looking at,"" he said, citing removal of  the trade embargo imposed by the Reagan Administration as one example.    Aronson said he will meet Monday with Francisco Mayorga, Chamorro's chief  economic adviser. On Friday, Mayorga said in Managua that the new government  will ask for at least $300 million in U.S. aid.    But Gramm warned that Washington cannot foot the entire bill.    ""It's clear that we can't rebuild Nicaragua with American aid,"" declared the  co-author of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction act. ""I'd be willing  to offer Nicaragua a free-trade agreement.""    One possible source of aid to Nicaragua was identified in a General Accounting  Office report released Saturday by Sen. Edward M.

Your VEK correspondent, who had been in Turkmenistan for  several days prior to the Ashgabat Meeting, had a conversation  with Turkmenistan's minister of foreign affairs, Khalykberdi  Atayev.    ""Our republic does indeed take a special position among the  CIS countries,"" the minister said. ""We regard the Commonwealth  as a consultative instrument, lacking in any rigid  administrative organs. We consider that the CIS should  facilitate the development of bilateral relations between the  members of this organization. During the initial period many  people did not understand us, seeing in our position a desire to  isolate ourselves, to depart from the principles of uniting the  states involved. However, Turkmenistan's president, Saparmurad  Niyazov, maintains a different opinion. He advocates the uniting  of states on the basis of full sovereignty and the development  of bilateral relations. Therefore, our state did not sign the  CIS Charter in Minsk, nor did it join the economic union. We  assume that Turkmenistan will be able to join this organization  in the capacity of an associate member.""    ""Practical experience has shown that decisions adopted at  the  CIS level are not carried out in the necessary manner. Moreover,  these decisions do not facilitate businesslike cooperation among  the states involved. But bilateral decisions--in  contrast--clearly presuppose mutual obligations which must be  carried out. Such a position taken by Turkmenistan has found  understanding and support from a number of CIS states.""    Khalykberdi Atayev went on to explain his state's position  with regard to the conflict in Tajikistan:    ""When the matter arose of the need to create a joint troop  force in order to safeguard the Tajik border and to maintain  order in Tajikistan itself, Kazakhstan and Russia appealed to us  on this matter. Our president declared that he would not send a  single Turkmen soldier into Tajikistan and would not intervene  in this conflict. He posed the question as follows: Who would  the Turkmen soldiers fight against in Tajikistan? The Tajik  oppositionists had possibly crossed the border from Afghanistan  and were receiving support from certain Afghan groups. However,  the Kabul government immediately declared that it had nothing at  all to do with this. But within Tajikistan itself complications  and confrontations have taken place resulting from clashes  between various factions struggling for power. In such a  situation--just whom would the Turkmen troops be fighting  against? We have stated that Tajikistan must solve its own  internal problems by itself by means of talks among the  conflicting parties and by means of strengthening the power  structures within that country. Our participation in this matter  could consist of providing humanitarian assistance to the  suffering population.""    Turning to economic problems, the foreign minister noted  that  at the present time some 11 billion cubic meters of gas annually  pass through Russian territory on their way to the West.  However, by way of seeking its own, independent egress to  foreign markets, Turkmenistan is actively carrying on  preliminary talks with regard to constructing a gas pipeline  through the northern part of Iran and Turkey--to Europe. As the  minister noted, his country could export 10-15 billion cubic  meters of gas to Turkey, whereas it it could send 30 billion to  Europe. The explored gas reserves in Turkmenistan amount to 13  trillion cubic meters. Proposals are now under study for laying  gas pipelines to China's eastern shore and to Pakistan. Other  large-scale projects are also being studied, in particular, in  the field of international railroad transportation.     "

By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A top-level agency is needed to bring leadership and order to the chaos created  by several federal agencies involved in the nation's immigration and refugee  policies, a congressional commission said Tuesday.    ""Immigration policy requires constant study and attention at a senior level of  government,"" said the report by the Commission for the Study of International  Migration and Cooperative Economic Development, a 12-member, bipartisan group  formed by Congress.    The goal ""can best be achieved by centralizing the current widely dispersed  government structure for handling immigration and refugee affairs in a single  agency whose head reports directly to the President,"" the report continued.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), two  lawmakers intimately involved in immigration legislation, said the creation of  a new central agency was an idea worth pursuing.    Neither, however, rushed to join Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who introduced  a bill to create the Agency for Migration Affairs, as suggested in the report.    Cranston's bill would consolidate all the functions of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service except the U.S. Border Patrol with the Consular, Refugee  and Human Rights and the Humanitarian Affairs bureaus of the State Department.  It would also create a commissioner for migration affairs, who would be  appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate.    Currently, consuls at the State Department issue visas in other countries for  entry into the United States. The INS, an arm of the Justice Department, has  authority over immigrants after they arrive in the country, including the  authority to issue work-authorizing green cards.    ""We need a new, top-level agency, headed by a commissioner reporting directly  to the President, with centralized responsibilities currently being handled --  or mishandled -- by five government agencies or bureaus,"" Cranston said during  a news conference unveiling the commission's report.    Diego C. Asencio, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state and commission  director, seemed surprised that Cranston took the recommendation seriously  enough to offer a bill on the day of the report's release.    Calling the legislation ""provocative,"" Asencio said the commission suggested  the creation of a new agency as a means to ""start the debate"" on the nation's  disjointed immigration oversight. ""Other possibilities are out there to get to  the same point,"" he said.

By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      A top-level agency is needed to bring leadership and order to the chaos created  by several federal agencies involved in the nation's immigration and refugee  policies, a congressional commission said Tuesday.    ""Immigration policy requires constant study and attention at a senior level of  government,"" said the report by the Commission for the Study of International  Migration and Cooperative Economic Development, a 12-member, bipartisan group  formed by Congress.    The goal ""can best be achieved by centralizing the current widely dispersed  government structure for handling immigration and refugee affairs in a single  agency whose head reports directly to the President,"" the report continued.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), two  lawmakers intimately involved in immigration legislation, said the creation of  a new central agency was an idea worth pursuing.    Neither, however, rushed to join Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who introduced  a bill to create the Agency for Migration Affairs, as suggested in the report.    Cranston's bill would consolidate all the functions of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service except the U.S. Border Patrol with the Consular, Refugee  and Human Rights and the Humanitarian Affairs bureaus of the State Department.  It would also create a commissioner for migration affairs, who would be  appointed by the President with advice and consent of the Senate.    Currently, consuls at the State Department issue visas in other countries for  entry into the United States. The INS, an arm of the Justice Department, has  authority over immigrants after they arrive in the country, including the  authority to issue work-authorizing green cards.    ""We need a new, top-level agency, headed by a commissioner reporting directly  to the President, with centralized responsibilities currently being handled --  or mishandled -- by five government agencies or bureaus,"" Cranston said during  a news conference unveiling the commission's report.    Diego C. Asencio, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state and commission  director, seemed surprised that Cranston took the recommendation seriously  enough to offer a bill on the day of the report's release.    Calling the legislation ""provocative,"" Asencio said the commission suggested  the creation of a new agency as a means to ""start the debate"" on the nation's  disjointed immigration oversight. ""Other possibilities are out there to get to  the same point,"" he said.    At an earlier hearing before the House Foreign Relations Committee, Asencio  said the commission found that job creation in Mexico and other countries  offers the best solution to stopping the flow of illegal immigrants into the  United States.

Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,  gave an account of the trial and judgment of Sun Xianlu's air  hijack case at a news briefing today.    Sun Xianlu, 25, was a worker of the Tianjin No. 2 Steel  Smelting Plant. In July 1993, he started an idea of hijacking  an airliner to Taiwan and began to prepare for the criminal act.  On 28 November 1993, he boarded a Shanghai-bound plane of the  China International Airlines in Tianjin. Soon after the plane  took off, he threatened to set off explosives and coerced the  crew to fly toward Taiwan. After the crew members took some  resolute measures, Sun Xianlu was arrested at the Nanjing  airport.    After hearing the case, the Nanjing City Intermediate  People's Court of Jiangsu Province confirmed that Sun Xianlu  carefully plotted the hijacking and hijacked the plane by  threatening to set off explosives, and his act was an air hijack  crime. On 13 January 1994, the Nanjing City Intermediate  People's Court, in accordance with the relevant law, sentenced  Sun Xianlu to life imprisonment and deprived him of political  rights for life on the charge of air hijacking. After the  sentence was pronounced, Sun Xianlu did not appeal, nor did the  procuratorial organ lodged any protest within the time  prescribed by law. The verdict became legally effective on 25  January.    Liu Jiachen pointed out: A criminal who hijacks an airplane  with violence, coercion, or other methods is extremely dangerous  to the society, seriously disrupts normal air travel order,  causes great economic losses to the state, seriously jeopardizes  the safety of passengers' lives and property, and yields very  bad social effects. All countries and regions regard such an act  as a serious crime and impose severe punishment for it.  Relevant international conventions have been recognized by more  and more countries and regions. This means that air hijackers,  particularly those criminals who hijack civil airplanes, will be  punished by law no matter where they escape to.    According to relevant reports, Huang Shugang and Liu Baocai,  criminals who hijacked an airliner to Taiwan on 6 April 1993,  have been sentenced to 10-year imprisonment by Taiwan region's  judicial organ and they will not be allowed to stay in Taiwan  after serving the term. At the same time, a common  understanding of the cross- strait hijackers repatriation issue  was reached between our country's Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation in later part of December 1993. The two sides came to  a consensus that hijacking by violence, coercion, or other  methods is a serious crime and hijackers should be severely  punished, and that in principle, all hijackers will be sent back  to where they came from.    Liu Jiachen emphasized: Hijackers of aircraft have always  been a target to which severe blows will be dealt according to  China's Criminal Law. In particular, according to the ""Decision  on Punishing Hijackers of Aircraft"" adopted by the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress on 28 December 1992,  hijackers must be severely punished, or sentenced to death if  they cause severe injury or death to other people or heavy  damages to aircraft, or their crime is extraordinarily serious.  Liu Jiachen said that the people's judicial organ will  certainly impose harsh punishment on any desperadoes and  hijackers who dare to defy the law and make a reckless move.     "

Mr. Kim assured Boris Yeltsin of South Korea's  ""cooperation and support for reforms which are being effected in  Russia"".    The leaders of the two countries decided to give a boost to  political dialogue at various levels, including meetings between  the heads of state and government, parliamentary leaders and  cabinet ministers. They agreed to establish a ""hot line""  between the Kremlin in Moscow and the Blue House in Seoul to  maintain close contacts between the heads of two states.    The two sides agreed to make joint efforts to combine  Russia's high technologies with the introduction and industrial  resources of the Republic of Korea and encourage investments in  co-development of the natural resources of the Russian  Federation. They came out in support of direct business  contacts between the Russian Far East and the Republic of Korea.    The two presidents were gratified to note a steady growth of  bilateral trade and agreed to further efforts to strengthen  legal and organisational principles in such spheres as  transport, customs, and industrial standards to promote  bilateral trade and investments.    Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Kim agreed on close cooperation  between  the two states in tackling global issues. They highly  appreciated possibilities for dynamic growth in the Asia-Pacific  region and agreed to join hands to make it a region of peace and  prosperity.    Mr. Kim welcomed Russia's aspiration actively and  constructively participate in all areas of Pacific Rim  cooperation and pointed out that the Republic of Korea would  positivly consider Russia's candidacy for Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum membership.    The two presidents ""called on the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea as a party to the Treaty on Non-Proliferation  of Nuclear Weapons strictly and consistently fulfil its  obligations under the treaty and as regards inspection under the  safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

President Kim Yong-sam, for his part, ""gave a high appraisal  of Russia's proposal to convene a multilateral conference on  security and non-nuclear status of the Korean Peninsula.""    The two leaders agreed that ""any attempt to produce nuclear  weapons on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat to peace  and security not only in Korea but in Northeast Asia and and the  whole world as well"".

The two presidents ""pointed out the need for a continuation  of the dialogue between South and North Korea to ease tension,  to strenthen peace, security and stability, and agreed that the  unification of Korea should be achieved in a peaceful and  democratic way, through a direct dialogue between the two sides.""

Having established a Tariff and Customs Council, on  Wednesday  the ministers will approve the proposed tariff rates for some  products and on Thursday, as members of the Economic Council,  they will discuss the mechanism for joining the trade agreement.    A source close to the meeting said that ""the region paid  $1.6  billion in tariffs in recent months.""    Economy Ministers Delmer Urbizo of Honduras, Enrique Cordova  of El Salvador, and Pablo Pereira of Nicaragua participated in  the discussions. Costa Rican Economy Minister Roberto Rojas and  Guatemalan Economy Minister Eduardo Gonzalez also participated,  and they will discuss options to negotiate a trade agreement  with the United States, which could begin with parity for some  benefits of the North American treaty.    The ministers will analyze the report titled ""Commercial  Relations Between Central America and the United States,"" to  which NOTIMEX had access. The report establishes the  negotiation of ""parity"" for some benefits or ""full-rights""  participation in the trilateral treaty. According to the report  prepared by consultant Harold Rodas upon request from the UN  Development Program (UNDP) and the Secretariat of Central  American Economic Integration (SIECA), ""the United States'  commercial policy towards the region is not clearly defined.""    The area's concern is apparent, and that is why efforts are  being made to maintain the tariff benefits received from the  United States and even to expand them in view of the benefits  Mexico obtains by commercial agreements since NAFTA became  effective in January.    The report asks: ""When will Central America break the chains  of dependency on a preferential system? Is the region prepared  for the challenges of reciprocity?"" According to Rodas, these  questions arise because there ""is an abyss between the political  will and factual reality.""    Regarding the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP),  through which the United States imports 4,300 duty free products  from 139 countries and territories, the officials will review  the 15-month extension approved by the United States which ends  on 30 September. This preferential scheme seeks to sponsor  beneficiary countries' economic and industrial development, and  its legal base on a worldwide level is derived from Article IV  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The  beneficiaries can export eligible products duty free to the  United States, as long as they comply with norms of origin  requirements -- above all having a national value-added rate of  35 percent and a certificate of origin.    The UNDP-SIECA report, presented to the ministers on  Wednesday, also examines the so-called Caribbean Basin  Initiative sponsored by the United States. The initiative's goal  is to increase local and foreign investments in non-traditional  sectors, support economic diversification, and expand exports.  The preferential system is more extensive than the GSP because  no conditions are set on competition or graduality. However, the  initiative excludes certain important categories, such as  textiles, oil and oil derivatives, canned tuna, shoes, and  leather articles. A country can lose its Caribbean Basin  Initiative benefits by not cooperating in the struggle against  drug trafficking, being communist, or expropriating U.S.  citizens' assets, businesses, societies, or associations. The  benefits may also be lost if a country does not maintain an  extradition treaty with the United States.    The Central American economy ministers will analyze measures  against disloyal competition implemented by different countries.    The officials began talks on Wednesday following a detailed  report by SIECA Secretary Rafael Rodriguez Loucel on the 31st  SIECA Directors Meeting, which ended yesterday.     "

Our correspondent Milan Sutalo reports  on the talks:    [Sutalo] I feel that all the sides who are involved in this  tragic conflict are now ready to make gigantic steps toward the  cessation of hostilities and that they are ready to pay the  price to restore a permanent peace. This conviction was  expressed by Yasushi Akashi at the beginning of talks with his  hosts, representatives of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.  Recalling the agreement that was signed in Zagreb by Generals  Roso and Delic envisaging a cease-fire, withdrawal of heavy  weapons, interposition of UNPROFOR, and the organization of a  mixed commission that will be chaired by UNPROFOR, Akashi said  that UNPROFOR was ready to enter this process, but it was  necessary for all involved parties to cooperate. We also need  additional forces, Akashi said.    I think we will get support from the United Nations and its  member countries, but only when they are sure that the  interested parties are ready to make steps toward peace. Akashi  recalled the importance of the talks that are currently being  held in Washington and New York, but also said that efforts  toward peace were necessary to be made at the local level.    After we have alleviated the suffering of Sarajevo, Mostar  should be the next town where the suffering of population ought  to be alleviated. Therefore, I would like to hear what the  Croat side is ready to do in Mostar for the restoration of peace.    From what we could hear at the beginning of the talks, which  were open to public, we can fathom what the purpose of Akashi's  visit to Mostar is. After that, the talks were held behind  closed doors. Here is what Yasushi Akashi and Ivan Bender said  following the talks:    [Begin Akashi recording, in English with superimposed  translation] I have had very useful and productive talks here  with Croat leaders in Mostar and I have received assurances of  their full commitment to peace, I have heard their concerns that  this peace might be too fragile. That is all the more reason,  in my opinion, that we should join forces to make this peace  more durable. We have to start with specific concrete steps  toward a comprehensive peace. We will not be contented with  peace in Sarajevo, which is important [break in transmission  lasting for 1 minute 10 seconds]. [end recording]    [Begin Bender recording] We discussed the restoration of  peace in Sarajevo. We do not demand the application of that  kind of peace to Mostar alone: We demand that the same be done  with Mostar, Banja Luka, and Tuzla. We will persevere in that.  [end recording]    [Sutalo] Asked by a journalist, Yasushi Akashi commented on  the NATO downing of the Serb aircraft.    [Begin Akashi recording] This was a NATO action in  compliance  with the Security Council resolution concerning the no-fly zone.  I spoke with NATO Southern Command this morning which assured  me that they had followed the established procedures. UNPROFOR  was not involved in this action.    I also called Mr. Karadzic who was in Belgrade. He assured  me that it was important for us not to over-dramatize these kind  of incidents. And we will continue to make efforts to restore  peace, the process of which started in February, and we will try  to extend it to other places and areas.     "

Bulgaria withdraws its reservations on  Article 10 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the  Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces, on Article 10  of the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the  Wounded, Sick and Shipwrecked Members of Armed Forces at Sea, on  Articles 10, 12 and 85 on the Convention Relative to the  Treatment of Prisoners of War, and on Articles 11 and 45 of the  Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in  Time of War.    By a special act parliament ratified the Treaty for Friendly  Relations and Cooperation Between Bulgaria and Belarus signed in  October 1993 in Sofia. The treaty outlines the basic trends in  cooperation in trade and payments, education, science, culture  and transport.    By a special act parliament ratified the ""Open Skies"" Treaty  signed in March 1992 in Helsinki. The treaty regulates  reconnaissance flights by unarmed aircraft over the signatories,  outlining a complex system of quotas and agreed technology.    Parliament ratified Bulgaria's credit agreement with Japan's  Export-Import Bank signed last June in Tokyo. The agreement is  for U.S.$100 million. The loan is extended in the form of  co-financing the World Bank's structural adjustment loan. ""The  loan is granted at a time when this country is actually isolated  in the international credit market and will have a positive  effect on the stabilization of Bulgaria's economy and its  successful adjustment to market principles,"" the prime minister  wrote in his request to parliament for the ratification of the  agreement.    Parliament also ratified the financial agreement between  Bulgaria and the European Investment Bank (the Bulgarian  Airspace Development and Control Project) signed in Luxembourg  last July. The agreement is for ECU 30 million and will help  upgrade Bulgaria's system of air navigation services.    Parliament passed on second reading parts of the road  traffic  law.    The registration of a fifth parliamentary group --  ""Nezavisimost"" (""Independence""), was announced today. It  comprises deputies who left the ethnic Turks' Movement for  Rights and Freedoms (DPS), the anti-communist Union of  Democratic Forces and the coalition of the formerly communist  Socialists. Making this announcement, National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov said that the ""tendency towards a  multiplication of parliamentary groups does not contribute to  political stability."" ""The new formations are established far  from the electors and create certain difficulties in  parliament's work,"" Mr. Yordanov said.    At the beginning of today's sitting Socialist MP Yanaki  Stoilov announced that the parliamentary faction of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) is ready to discuss the closing  down of the Legislative Committee in order to unblock the  legislative process. Mr. Stoilov demanded changes in the  Parliamentary Rules of Procedure which would no longer make it  possible for the Legislative Committee to stop bills. According  to Mr. Stoilov many important bills are being held up in the  Legislative Committee.    According to Mr. Nino Stavrov MP of the BSP, at a session of  the Parliamentary National Security Committee earlier today,  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said that Bulgaria's stand  on the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina is neutrality. ""This  country is for a peaceful solution of the conflict in the former  Yugoslavia,"" Mr. Daskalov said, according to Mr. Stavrov. The  committee heard today Colonel Stefan Dimitrov nominated as chief  of the National Security Service.    DPS MP's had talks today with Finance Minister Stoyan  Aleksandrov. The DPS asked for the allocation of more funds to  the construction to country roads.     "

What is your opinion about these discussions and your  impression of Mr. Nemitz's discussions in Athens?    [Crvenkovski] We had very useful meetings and very extensive  discussions for two days, encompassing the general picture of  the situation in the whole region, and not only relations  between Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] and Greece, which is Mr. Nemitz's mandate. We had  expanded discussions because these relations are affected by the  situation in the whole region. I have not been informed about  the course of his discussions in Athens. I think that Mr.  Nemitz's stay here will be of great importance for the meetings  scheduled for New York next week. It is also very important  that during his stay in Ohrid Mr. Nemitz had the opportunity of  becoming acquainted with the culture and traditions of the  Macedonian nation, which will help him obtain a fuller picture  of the Republic of Macedonia.    [Karanfilovska] Was that the reason why you invited Mr.  Nemitz to Ohrid? There has been some speculation about this in  the media.    [Crvenkovski] I think that it was useful to hold the  discussions in a more relaxed atmosphere, as well as to take the  opportunity of introducing him to the historical values of Ohrid  and Macedonia.    [Karanfilovska] Mr. Nemitz stated that both sides had agreed  not to reveal the course and the results of the discussions.  Therefore, we shall refrain from asking such a question....    [Crvenkovski] Nevertheless, I shall avail myself of this  opportunity to remind you that I have been continually repeating  this during these months of discussions, for which I was exposed  to a series of attacks by journalists. Mr. Nemitz's statement  at least helped me to explain my conduct in public.    [Karanfilovska] A number of these attacks appeared in our  weekly, too, which also mentioned on several occasions the  ""Irish formula"" as a possible solution for the dispute. We are  not asking you whether there are negotiations about that, but  what is your opinion, and do you find it acceptable?    [Crvenkovski] The reason why I cannot comment on any formula  is because our stance is that there can be no separate solutions  for any of the disputed questions, and that is something that we  have explicitly advocated since the beginning. What we are  prepared to discuss are the entire relations with Greece. If we  reach a solution, it should be regulated in a satisfactory way,  be acceptable for Europe, and encompass all aspects of mutual  relations. In that context we can discuss separate solutions.  It is not our goal to solve some transient problems in  communications between the two countries, but to find lasting  solutions for long-lasting relations.    [Karanfilovska] Now that you have announced a new meeting in  New York, probably at the ministerial level, does it mean that  such a stance for discussions in a package is acceptable for the  other side?    [Crvenkovski] From the statements made by the other side  during the past few weeks you could see that such a position has  been accepted. Even I know that from their public statements,  since we have not had any direct contacts. I think that this is  a position that is more broadly accepted by the international  community. That is a point that we have persistently insisted  upon since the beginning of the dispute and I think that our  positions are beginning to converge.    [Karanfilovska] Is Greece a priority in your work?    [Crvenkovski] Basically, what we are trying to do is to  conduct a normal foreign policy, and we have been working on  ""driving that policy"" on several tracks from the outset, in  order to avoid the trap that Greece fell into when a single  problem, regardless of its importance, dominated its entire  foreign policy. This is not predominant in our work, neither in  terms of the time that we are devoting to it, nor in its  essence. It is a huge problem and we discuss it continually  with all our partners, but we are also engaged in what a foreign  policy should normally do -- not concentrate on one direction  and one problem.    [Karanfilovska] We are asking this because of the time that  you yourself are spending on the negotiations!    [Crvenkovski] It is true that I am spending a lot of time in  New York, but that is principally out of respect for Mr. Cyrus  Vance's invitations. They are sent to foreign ministers and I  think that it would be impolite to respond at a lower level to  invitations from a mediator whom we highly appreciate, and we  think it is important to communicate with him properly. It is  up to the other side to evaluate its own conduct. Second, the  stay there, although linked with the discussions with Mr. Vance,  provides a good opportunity for discussing other matters not  connected with the dispute. There are a number of countries  with which we still have not established contacts, or are having  difficulties in establishing them, because we cannot find a  suitable place to do this. On the other hand, the United  Nations is an excellent place in which all countries have active  missions. Therefore, a great deal of work on bilateral  questions is carried out there, too.    [Karanfilovska] You did not mention Washington, and you  often have meetings with senior U.S. officials during your  visits to the United States. You have met Secretary of State  Christopher a couple of times. How prominent is the subject of  Macedonia-Greece in these discussions, and how bilateral are  these relations?    [Crvenkovski] Concerning the level of our relations with the  United States and the level of our cooperation, such meetings  are normal during every stay there. The subject of  Macedonia-Greece arises in all the bilateral meetings, and not  only with U.S. officials, because everybody is interested in  this. However, the discussions in Washington principally  concentrate on bilateral questions and regional problems of  interest to ourselves and to our partners, who want to hear our  opinions and evaluations.    [Karanfilovska] It looks as if the United States is choosing  the more southern part of the Balkans for its presence, from  where it will be able to achieve its interests.    [Crvenkovski] I am not in favor of the idea that it has to  do with some presence in the region, with some interests, at  least not in the prevailing sense, as this is an idea that  belongs to the first half of the 20th century and even before  that, about spheres of interest and strategic positions in the  classic sense. The interest is, first of all, in giving support  to models of state development that promise longer stability.  The strategic interest of the United States and the European  Union in Macedonia is to see the success of the political model  that we are applying, which can serve as an example for solving  a whole complex of questions that generate severe crises in  other places since they are not approached correctly.    [Karanfilovska] Could that be the reason why after  Washington was ""meandering"" from Greece, via Albania and  Bulgaria, Macedonia was ""selected"" as a kind of a partner in the  Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] The ties with Macedonia have become closer  simply because of the political model, and first of all the  internal one, that we have chosen, and they consider that it is  in their strategic interest to support it for the sake of  stability in Europe, for open borders, with prospects for more  intensive development.    [Karanfilovska] Are the present relations in the Balkans,  and principally the problems with Greece and the closure of the  border, affecting the construction of a different policy toward  the other neighbors, and would it have been different if  relations with Greece had been different?    [Crvenkovski] I think that the policy would have been the  same, but the understanding and the support for that policy  might have been different. What is crucial to Macedonia's  position in the Balkans is to be open in all directions --  transportation and communications -- and to take the role that  naturally belongs to it, that is to be the crossroads for all  movement in the region. That is why it is of the utmost  importance to establish normal relations and links with our  neighbors. Therefore, the priority is to establish road,  railroad, and communications links wherever they existed before.  Thus, the east-west corridor was not imposed by the dispute  with Greece or the Greek embargo. It was imposed by the natural  role of the Republic of Macedonia that it is entitled to in the  region. The fact that this corridor is now gaining importance  and support from the international community is to a certain  extent a result of Greece's conduct and the embargo, and in that  context it has helped us. However, the bases of this policy of  communications are independent of the dispute, and that should  normally be the orientation, as should the development of the  north-south route the moment the problems have been overcome.  Macedonia cannot play any role, and principally economic, if it  does not have both directions. The fact that it is a crossroads  is a great advantage for Macedonia. It will lose it if it  neglects either of the two directions.    [Karanfilovska] It is paradoxical, but no matter how  intractable the problem with Greece might look now, it is, in a  way, smaller than the problems, first of all political, that  Macedonia is having with the other neighboring countries, with  which it still has political and economic cooperation. Why can  this cooperation not be achieved with Greece?    [Crvenkovski] We have offered this as a model with Greece  from the outset and we have been insisting on it. Everywhere  there are problems between neighboring countries. The question  is what the attitude of those countries is toward such problems  -- whether there is an open channel for dialogue, and whether  there is good will for finding solutions. We are in favor of  these kinds of relations, because they turned out to be  successful in Europe. That is why the relations with Albania  and Bulgaria, regardless of a number of questions that are  burdening them, are normal relations between European countries.  That is how we approach them, and to a great extent that is  their conduct toward us, too. Therefore, Europe's relationship  toward ourselves and these countries is different.    [Karanfilovska] You said that after the situation is  normalized, the Republic of Macedonia will go on developing the  north-south route as a road to Europe. However, it looks as if  Greece has been redirected on this road via Bulgaria and Romania.    [Crvenkovski] I do not know how they can look for other  directions knowing that they are creating problems on all sides  and in all possible directions. I do not want to get into their  motives for that. For our part, even in relations with Greece,  the basis of our foreign policy is dominant, and that is the  principle of equal distance with our neighbors.    [Karanfilovska] Do you here also include the Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia?    [Crvenkovski] Absolutely, speaking in the long term,  regardless of their situation now.    [Karanfilovska] Nevertheless, at this moment there is no  attempt for a dialogue with Belgrade, although this neighbor is  still under the regime of the international community's  sanctions?    [Crvenkovski] There are no diplomatic contacts because the  other side still refuses formally to recognize the Republic of  Macedonia. At this moment the question of succession is an open  problem. We think that it should be settled where it was agreed  -- in the Contact Group in Geneva.    [Karanfilovska] Your Yugoslav counterpart does not share  this opinion. He thinks that Skopje-Belgrade relations will  depend on Skopje-Athens relations.    [Crvenkovski] That is their problem. However, a normal  foreign policy should not limit itself to that. I would not  accept a foreign policy that would be in one part dictated by  someone else or be dependent on third countries.    [Karanfilovska] The Yugoslav Government ordered its Foreign  Ministry to start preparations for a dialogue with Albania. In  your opinion, is it related to the latest events in the far  south of the Balkans?    [Crvenkovski] It certainly is an initiative that deserves  congratulations, because it ultimately leads to the acceptance  of our basic orientation -- that relations in the Balkans can  only be solved through dialogue. The greater the number of  countries that support it, and the greater the number of  bilateral channels for dialogues among Balkan countries that are  opened, the faster it will lead toward EU and U.S. strategic  interest in supporting our model.    [Karanfilovska] There are certain reservations among part of  the opposition and among a number of self-proclaimed independent  intellectuals in Macedonia, who have recently appeared in  public, saying that the conduct of the Macedonian Government  toward Bulgaria is not equal to other countries and that it  still has some reservations inherited from the past.    [Crvenkovski] The basic determination of our foreign policy  is the principle of equal distance between our neighbors,  because that is the only way in which the Republic of Macedonia  can conduct a consistent policy even though at this moment it  does not actually have a real dialogue with some of its  neighbors. Relations with all our neighbors should be put on an  equal footing and there can be no more or less privileged  relations toward any of our neighbors. This naturally applies  to the Republic of Bulgaria, too. Overall, we are trying to  develop relations in a rapid and general way, by applying the  principle of equal distance and by thoroughly insisting on equal  relations in which it will be impossible to place or impose  conditions burdened with the past.    [Karanfilovska] Within the framework of stability in the  Balkans there certainly stands security. Macedonia still has  the open problem of its inclusion in the collective system of  the CSCE, although Albania, in staying neutral, abstained, while  Greece and Cyprus still oppose it. Another question connected  to the security system is the ""Partnership for Peace"" project in  which Macedonia has demonstrated a great interest, and it was  even announced as one of the topics for the recent discussions  with Mrs. Lin Davis [name as transliterated].    [Crvenkovski] As far as Albania's position on the CSCE is  concerned, the meeting of President Gligorov and Mr. Berisha  gives us the hope that there will not only be no problems from  Albania, but that we can expect active support for the Republic  of Macedonia, which indicates a very important step in  relations. Concerning the ""Partnership for Peace"" project, we  have shown our interest, as well as in cooperation with NATO.  We have had several official contacts, which raised clearly  defined interests in cooperation from both sides. We have had  intensive discussions on all the possible forms of cooperation  with the Western European Union. However, concerning the formal  participation of Macedonia in the ""Partnership for Peace,"" at  this moment there is one obstacle -- membership of the CSCE. We  discussed this with Mrs. Davis, and we shall continue the  discussions, with the possibility of starting broader contacts  before joining the project.    [Karanfilovska] Are there any discussions with the United  States about bilateral cooperation on a military plan?    [Crvenkovski] At this stage we think our cooperation should  be carried out within the framework of the multilateral  organizations, first of all because they have already developed  good channels of cooperation with the Republic of Macedonia. A  process of adjustment is necessary in the sense of the military  educational system, in order to achieve a cooperation on a  compatible level.    [Karanfilovska] Relations in the Balkans are also burdened  by some far away partners; we have in mind principally  Australia, not only relating to the decision to call the  Macedonians Slav Macedonians, but even more because of the  division of the Macedonian community in that country into those  from Vardar Macedonia and the ""others."" Is there a danger that  this may be accepted as a model for other countries where there  are such large communities of Macedonians?    [Crvenkovski] That action of the Australian Government  caused a series of consequences that have deeply complicated  relations inside Australia, where all the citizens, regardless  of their origin, had equal treatment and made the country an  example of a multiethnic community. This action, to which we  immediately reacted very strongly, sets a precedent that can  have consequences not only for the Macedonian community there,  but also for others. We know of no country that has renamed its  own citizens who have always had the right to declare their  national affiliation. I hope that the Australian Government  will soon reexamine this action. We were encouraged by the  explicit reaction of the media and of some provincial  governments. What came as a result of this in Australia is not  division, but much stronger cohesion. In this extremely  unpleasant situation there has been created greater cohesion and  coordination among the Macedonians in Australia. I do not think  that this will affect other countries in the sense of limiting  the rights of their citizens.    [Karanfilovska] When your name is publicly mentioned, it is  usually linked with relations with the Republic of Greece. The  journalists' ""pursuit"" of you usually takes place just at the  time negotiations and discussions are carried out about this.  There is little talk about the other aspects of your work.  What does the minister do in his ministry?    [Crvenkovski] Owing to the growing interest in relations  with Greece, there are some very important events from the  foreign policy area that remain unnoticed or uncovered. I shall  point out the example of the visit to Holland. That was the  first official visit to a European country after the  establishment of diplomatic relations, to which the Dutch side  devoted great importance -- a meeting was scheduled with the  prime minister, there were separate discussions with five  ministers, there was an address in parliament... it was an  extremely important event for our foreign policy.    As far as the work here is concerned, we were heavily  engaged  in organizing the ministry itself and its equipment, and in  setting up embassies within a very short period of time. If we  just have a look at this, together with the international  meetings and conferences that we have attended and where we have  achieved results, only then can we see the job that has been  done here in the ministry.    [Karanfilovska] The public often operates with wrong images.  There prevails the opinion that you are a recluse, an  uncommunicative minister, who rarely makes statements, who is  often absent... however, on the other hand, people who have had  official meetings with you have a different impression. We hear  that you have established private contacts with them, that you  often meet your partners, talk with them, and solve diplomatic  problems in a different way, not only in your office....    [Crvenkovski] The impression that I rarely make statements,  I would say, arises from the interest in the discussions with  Greece. If you look at all my statements, I think that I may  even appear too often. At one time I was even attacked by some  opposition politicians for being too great a presence in public.  As for the impression that people from the outside have, those  who I have contacts with, it is true that it is much easier to  establish official contacts with a state if you establish  friendly links. That is normal in the work of every foreign  minister if he wants to be successful. Private contacts are  important first of all for the official part of the work,  because they enable you to address a partner in the world at any  time, asking for advice, an opinion, or support.    [Karanfilovska] It is evident that, in spite of all your  engagement, you will retain the image of ""minister for Greece.""  Do you think that at the end of your mandate it will have a  positive or negative connotation?    [Minister] I cannot make evaluations about the final  impression on my work. Nevertheless, it is true that what I am  doing is far from being subordinated to relations with Greece.     "

In the final analysis, however, such a document was  elaborated. It prohibits everywhere the acquisition,  development, production, sale, or use of chemical weapons. All  stocks and also production capacities must be destroyed within  10 years of the convention's entry into force. Provision is  made for monitoring of national chemical industry installations  and for appropriate inspections to be conducted on a permanent  basis, as well as inspections on demand, when any country is  obliged to give foreign observers access to installations which  have come under suspicion.    According to the terms of the convention, it will come into  force once ratified by 65 participant states. This is expected  to happen next year. At present, however, the ratification  process is proceeding slowly. Just five countries have  confirmed in legislation their adhesion to this act of  international law. It is perfectly obvious that the majority of  countries are waiting for it to be ratified by Russia and the  United States.    In Russia the State Duma has now begun examining the  convention, and preparations are under way to ratify it. The  document is also being discussed in the U.S. Senate. Hearings  on ratification of the chemical weapons convention were held  recently in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The  Administration's representatives at the hearings -- James  Woolsey, director of the CIA; General John Shalikashvili,  chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and John Holum, director  of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency -- pointed out that  this international document, which prohibits an entire class of  mass destruction weapons, meets U.S. national security interests.    On the whole the senators listened favorably to the  Administration representatives. But it is no secret that there  are also opponents of the convention in the United States. It  can hardly be considered a coincidence that on the eve of the  hearings the U.S. press launched a new campaign of accusations  against Russia, which is allegedly ""concealing its efforts"" to  develop the latest types of chemical weapons, including binary  weapons.    THE NEW YORK TIMES has shown special zeal. It has repeatedly  addressed this topic in the past few days. At the same time,  not possessing any facts, since none exists, it has returned to  the long-refuted ""revelations"" of the Russian chemical scientist  Vil Mirzayanov in his sensational interview with THE BOSTON  GLOBE. True, in passing, it made the reservation that ""some of  his frightening statements elicit a skeptical attitude."" But  this was only a reservation.    As far as it is possible to judge, the majority of U.S.  congressmen still incline toward ratifying the convention. The  speediest positive examination of this problem in our State Duma  would obviously make a favorable impression on them. Although  it would be perfectly legitimate to put the question this way:  Ratification of the convention on chemical weapons in the U.S.  Senate would also prompt Russian legislators to make such a  decision.

Investigative Police detectives arrested Pablo David Contreras  Olivos, aka Jose Luis or Joam, yesterday in the vicinity of the  Plaza Italia. Contreras Olivos, who has been identified as the  current number two Lautaro Group leader, was in charge of the  group's military structure. He was arrested along with Maria  Angelica Medina Soto, aka La Cuca. She led the MAPU-Lautaro  [United Popular Action Movement, Lautaro Group].    Through these arrests the police were able to establish that  Guillermo Ossandon was in Cartagena, where he had been residing  for some time. The police arrested Ossandon in a telephone  booth in Cartagena. He did not offer any resistance. Along  with Ossandon, the police also arrested his companions Sandra  del Carmen Ramirez Barahona, and Flor Ines Alcallaga Cepeda.    [Begin Investigative Police Public Relations Chief Luis  Cariz  recording] All the investigations leading to the arrest of these  people were conducted on the basis of a decree issued by Judge  Dreiser, who has already been duly informed. We also asked  Judge Dreiser to authorize an extension of the detention period  in Investigative Police barracks for up to 10 days.    We are now proceeding to compare the existing evidence with  their testimony, so as to establish their involvement in the  numerous crimes with which they have been charged. [end  recording]    The government praised the Investigative Police for their  work, and commended the successful investigation that led to  breaking up the guerrilla group.    [Begin Interior Ministry Under Secretary Belisario Velasco  recording] During the operations officials seized the following  guns: one pistol, four revolvers, nine sawed-off Tamara  shotguns, and two double barrel shotguns.    We must also praise the Investigative Police intelligence  brigade's professionalism in planning and conducting this  operation. We must also praise them for the fact that no one was  injured.    As is well known, in the last couple of years the police  force has been increasingly coordinating its actions to  effectively comply with their role as established in the  Constitution. [end recording]    Guillermo Enrique Ossandon Canas, alias Diego Carvajal,  established the Lautaro Youth Movement in 1983. With a  dissident MAPU group Ossandon was able to establish an  organization that later developed into the Lautaro Rebel and  Popular Front [FRPL] Forces. Since then homicides, bomb attacks,  bank holdups, and armed propaganda actions increased  considerably in Chile.    FRPL forces first centered their actions in the southern  region of Santiago. Later they expanded their operations to  other regions. A few years ago the police arrested some FRPL  leaders. On one occasion the police almost arrested Ossandon,  but he was able to escape. In view of this the Investigative  Police special corps took action only after the entire operation  had been secured. They decided nevertheless to delay the  operation so as not to allow Ossandon to escape in the dark.    The Lautaro Movement leaders were brought in from the coast  aboard an airplane. They are currently under arrest at a  Santiago Investigative Police barracks.    Fearing extremist reprisals, the Investigative Police have  reinforced the guards throughout its units. Moreover, personnel  from several police precincts will take turns watching the  Lautaro Movement leaders.    The Interior Ministry will submit an injunction against the  five arrested Lautaro Movement members, who have been charged  with terrorist actions. In the next few days they will be  placed at the disposal of Judge Arnoldo Dreiser, who is in  charge of investigating the crimes perpetrated by the Lautaro  Group crimes.     "

Voronin,  under the rubric ""Politics"": ""Georgia's Fate Is in Russia's  Hands""]    [Text] It is not often that guests like this come to our  city. Even on an unofficial visit, even a former defense  minister, and not even of America but just of Georgia, still the  figure of Tengiz Kitovani is significant.    In December 1991, the former dissident seized power in  Tbilisi, drove out Gamsakhurdia, summoned Shevardnadze to  Georgia, and then, due to disagreement with his policies,  retired as minister of defense. This is basically all we know  about Kitovani. Meanwhile, in his homeland the former minister  is almost a national hero. The Caucasus in general respect men  of strong character. Dzhokhar Dudayev, Suret Kusseynov, Tengiz  Kitovani--the Chechens, Azeris, and Georgians take great pride  in their heroes. Unlike the other two, Kitovani is not now in  power; in fact, he is in opposition to the official regime.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Tengiz, what brings you to the  Southern Urals?    [Kitovani] My destiny is closely tied to this land. In my  life as a dissident I learned the Urals well from the inside,  but I was prevented from admiring your sights by . . . barbed  wire. Now the goal of my visit is to learn the opinion of the  Urals' inhabitants--the simple people, the businessmen, and the  politicians--about Georgia, about prospects for collaboration. I  would like the people of the Urals to have their say about  closer ties with my people.    I was in Moscow for two months, meeting with deputies of the  State Duma and members of the Russian government. It seems to  me, though, that you have to look for the opinion of the real  Russian people in the provinces, not in the capital. That is why  I'm here. So much links Georgia the with Urals, with  Chelyabinsk. Students from Tbilisi used to come here to study,  and they did their field work in your metallurgical plants. Now  it is essential that we restore the broken ties.    From the Biography of Tengiz Kitovani    By profession, an artist, laureate of many prizes. During  Khrushchev's ""thaw"" he got involved in political activity. A  monarchist by conviction. After the end of the ""thaw,"" in 1969,  he was sentenced. At the time, dissidents were put in prison on  criminal articles, so Kitovani was ""set up"" with a road  accident: for a harmless DTP [highway traffic accident] he got  15 years. That was how he ended up in the Urals: Katav-Ivanovsk,  Zlatoust, Kasli, a ""double"" special regime prison at the ChMZ  [not further identified]. . . . In Bakal the hot-headed Georgian  called the camp warden a ""red fascist,"" so another year was  tacked on--for disrespect for authority. After serving 13 years,  Kitovani was freed on an amnesty. He went back to Georgia,  returned to his profession as an artist, and once again took up  politics.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] What's going on in Georgia right  now?    [Kitovani] Of all the former union republics, Georgia has  suffered the most. Because of Zviad Gamsakhurdia's nationalistic  politics, we fenced ourselves off from our neighbors and above  all--from Russia. Right now the instability in the country is  great and economic ties have been broken. We are suffering badly  as a result. So far, though, some of our politicians feel that  we don't need Russia, that it's better to collaborate with  Europe and America. It doesn't seem that way to me. Georgia  needs an alliance with Russia, firm ties with its regions. I  have been saying this in the Georgian parliament for two years.  At first they didn't listen to me. Georgia lost the war and only  now is coming to its senses. Georgia has joined the CIS and is  hoping for an improvement in relations with its neighbor to the  north.    For us the CIS means Russia. Until our relations improve, my  republic is going to have it bad: 99 percent of our population  is living below the poverty line, and the ruble's rate against  the coupon is very high--1:125. Our entire hope rests on Russia.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] How do you assess Russian policy  toward Georgia?    [Kitovani] Recently the friendship and cooperation agreement  signed by the presidents of Georgia and Russia was received  negatively by Russian politicians, especially in the State Duma.  I understand them, though. The ""Shevardnadze factor"" plays a  role here. Russians have a bad attitude toward him, the former  Soviet minister of foreign affairs. I met with Zhirinovskiy in  Moscow, and he told me that he does not want friendship with  Shevardnadze's Georgia because of his role in the destruction of  the Soviet Union. Zhirinovskiy is wrong: Georgia is not  Shevardnadze. And this is another reason for my visit to  Chelyabinsk. I am meeting with local national patriots and  trying to convince them of this.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Recently the days of the first  Georgian president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, came to a tragic end.  Many contradictory opinions have been expressed about his death.  What do you think?    [Kitovani] Gamsakhurdia was a nationalist conducting a  nationalistic policy, and that is why he lost. I don't believe  that Zviad committed suicide, though. I think it was a murder, a  purely political murder. It was disadvantageous to someone to  see him alive. I cannot say more. Zviad was a dangerous enemy,  he nearly came to power a second time, not when his brigades  seized Lanchkhuti and prepared to storm Tbilisi, but on 3-4  October.    If the Moscow putsch had succeeded, Gamsakhurdia would have  been in Shevardnadze's place right now. Don't forget: he lived  in Chechnya, near Dudayev, and Dudayev is Khasbulatov, so there  is a direct link between them. Had a Chechen come to power in  Moscow, then the Chechen protege, Gamsakhurdia, would have come  to power in Tbilisi. But the putsch did not succeed, and the  dangerous ex-president was removed.    He could not have killed himself, I know him well. We  studied  in the same school and knew each other since we were children.  We participated in the dissident struggle together. After  perestroyka, having headed up the national liberation movement,  we came to power together. Zviad became president, and I became  commander of the national guard. Our paths diverged on 19 August  1991, however, when he supported the Communist putsch.    From the Biography of Tengiz Kitovani    In August 1991, Kitovani, virtually the number two man in  the  state, accused Gamsakhurdia of aiding and abetting the GKChP  (State Committee for the State of Emergency). Not waiting to be  arrested, he took 12,000 guardsmen loyal to him out of the  barracks and went off into the mountains. In a bold move he took  the ""Georgian Bastille,"" freed his comrades-in-arms from  prison--Georgiy Chanturiya, chairman of the National Democratic  Party, and Dzhaba Ioseliani, commander of the armed group  Mkhaderioni (""Horsemen""). For five months he was a partisan in  the forests. It was then that Tengiz Kitovani was given the  nickname ""the Georgian Che Guevara"" in the Russian and world  press.    In December 1991, the opposition stormed Tbilisi, firing  cannons on the presidential palace and seizing power. Georgians  call that storming the best work Kitovani the artist ever did:  the city scarcely suffered from the cannon fire, and only the  ideally exact block was destroyed--the president's.    Gamsakhurdia fled to Chechnya, and Kitovani headed up the  Military Council--in fact, Georgia. His monarchist views were  not meant to be, though, and he was forced to turn for help to  Shevardnadze, to whom all power over Georgia transferred soon  after.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] Tengiz, why did you give the power  you had seized up to Eduard Shevardnadze?    [Kitovani] There were 400,000 Communists in Georgia awaiting  his arrival. We could not go against our own people. Especially  since he enjoyed an authority and trust in the world, and that  was very important at that moment: after all, we had come to  power by means of an armed revolt, and the world did not trust  us.    Shevardnadze's coming to power, unfortunately, made sense in  a post-Communist state. We have other examples--Azerbaijan,  Turkmenistan, other republics. But Shevardnadze wanted to make  great policy in a small state. When he was the Soviet minister  of foreign affairs, Russia stood behind him. In little Georgia,  his ""great policy"" brought the country to its knees.  Shevardnadze did not take into account the processes going on in  Georgia--that is, the Abkhazian and Ossetian issues. He placed  the integrity of Georgia in jeopardy. I could not work with him  so I left my post as defense minister.    Still, Shevardnadze is not Zviad. Therefore, I did not go  into the mountains, I just went into the opposition. Chanturiya  right now is with me, too, but Ioseliani supports the current  head of the republic. Maybe Shevardnadze is a great politician,  but Georgia has not benefited from his policies, I don't think.    [CHELYABINSKIY RABOCHIY] How do you assess the future of  Russian-Georgian relations?    [Kitovani] Our tsars and forefathers concluded an alliance.  They were smarter and more far-sighted than we are. We must  follow their example. The two Orthodox Christian peoples must  unite. I see Georgia's future only with Russia.     "

Travel agencies were the first to bear the brunt  of the boycott, following the announcement of a boycott of  package tours to Mainland China as of 1 May by the Taipei  Association of Travel Agencies. As of now, cross-strait economic  exchanges and trade remain brisk and are unstoppable, while the  travel agencies which play a leading role in the boycott have  suffered misfortune and incurred heavy losses.    The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted heavy  economic losses on travel agencies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and  Mainland China, with the losses suffered by those in Taiwan  especially heavy. Travel agencies who organize mainland-bound  tours represent a sizable proportion of all travel agencies in  Taiwan. In Taipei City alone, there are up to 100 travel  agencies that operate mainland-bound tours. It is estimated  that Taiwan's travel agencies incurred 200-300 million yuan in  losses as a result of suspending mainland-bound package tours in  April. Every year, the months of April through June are the  peak season for mainland-bound travel. Boycott-induced losses  incurred by travel agencies this year are inestimable.    The boycott of mainland-bound tours is against the will of  the majority of travel agencies. Travel agencies raised strong  objections when the boycott injunction was first issued on 13  April. They noted that the Association of Travel Agencies had  not consulted the organizations representing travel agencies  when it announced the boycott. They also complained that the  MAC should not use their business as a political bargaining chip.    The Qiandao Lake incident has been resolved. At the  invitation of Mainland China's Association for Relations Across  the Taiwan Straits, officials of the Straits Exchange  Foundation, the victims' families, and relevant experts traveled  to Hangzhou on 8 May to deal with post-incident matters. It is  believed that efforts of relevant departments will lead to a  reasonable resolution of matters arising from the Qiandao Lake  incident.    The Association of Travel Agencies recently asked MAC to  call  off the boycott, citing the heavy losses suffered by travel  agencies, the prospect of closure facing travel agencies, and  attendant social problems. The MAC, however, asked travel  agencies to continue the boycott on the grounds that Mainland  China had not met three requests -- investigating the actual  state of affairs, paying compensation in the aftermath of the  incident, and determining who is to blame. This practice, which  is driven by self-interest without regard to the interests of  travel agencies, has compounded the woes of the latter who are  already in deep trouble.    Problems of one kind or another are inevitable in the  ever-expanding exchanges and contacts across the Taiwan Straits.  What matters is how the relevant departments on both sides of  the Taiwan Straits confront or resolve those problems. The  Taiwan authorities have played up the Qiandao Lake incident,  which is purely a criminal case, in order to politicize the  incident and to use the incident as a bargaining chip to  strengthen their political leverage with Mainland China. Such  actions will only hurt, not benefit, the sound development of  cross-strait relations.    The boycott of mainland-bound travel has inflicted  unnecessary losses on travel agencies on the both sides of the  Taiwan Straits. However, people should heighten their vigilance  and prevent the boycott from snowballing and causing more  problems of a greater magnitude.     "

Both sides will hold the fourth round of  talks in late March this year in order to reach a consensus on  the text of the agreement on the three issues of routine affairs.    Following conclusion of the talks, Tang Shubei said that  after four days of earnest discussions and common efforts, both  sides had reached understandings on the following issues:    1. Both sides feel that they have reached a wide range of  understanding on three issues of routine affairs, including the  ""repatriation of hijackers,"" the ""repatriation of personnel who  enter the other side's territory in violation of relevant  regulations and other related questions,"" and the ""handling of  maritime disputes in the Taiwan Straits."" Both sides agreed  that this has laid a good foundation for the holding of the  fourth round of talks and the signing of a written agreement.  Both sides have agreed to hold a meeting at the vice secretary  general level in Beijing in late March in order to reach a  consensus on the draft agreement on the three issues. Jiao  Renhe hoped that Tang Shubei and his ARATS counterparts will  proceed to sign a formal agreement in Taipei on the basis of the  draft agreement.    2. Both sides have also agreed that during the fourth  working meeting to be held in late March between the two  organizations, both sides will hold formal discussions on other  topics included in the ""Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu [Ku]  Talks."" The topics of discussions will include the protection  of intellectual property rights; joint operations against  maritime smuggling, robbery, and other criminal activities in  the Taiwan Straits; and economic, scientific, and technological  exchanges and cooperation.    3. Entrusted by ARATS President Wang Daohan, Tang Shubei  handed Wang's letter to Jiao Renhe on 1 February, inviting SEF  Chairman Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] to visit the mainland this year.  Jiao Renhe said he would actively create conditions for the  second meeting between Wang and Gu. The time and venue of the  Wang-Gu meeting will be discussed at the March meeting.    4. The two sides also agreed to assist each other in the  handling of the inherited property of some of the personnel who  left the mainland for Taiwan [before 1949].    On the basis of reaching the above understandings, both  sides  will publish a news release tomorrow.    Tang Shubei said after holding discussions, both sides have  enhanced mutual understanding and promoted the formation of  consensus. This fact shows once again that high-level  face-to-face meetings are very important because it is conducive  to increasing mutual trust and reaching mutual understanding.  The current visit to Beijing by Jiao Renhe for discussions in  this meeting was absolutely necessary. He said it is in this  scene that President Wang Daohan has invited Chairman Gu Zhenfu  to visit the mainland.    After the conclusion of the talks, Jiao Renhe also said: The  method and attitude adopted by both sides for discussing issues  were conducive to their solution. After long hours of  discussions, both sides have reached an understanding. They  will proceed quickly to make arrangements for the next round of  consultations on issues of routine affairs.     "

Nouhak  Phoumsavan, president of the Lao People's Democratic Republic  [LPDR]. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and his delegation were accorded an  honorable welcome by H.E. President Nouhak Phoumsavan and the  Lao people in all places they visited. H.E. Gen. Than Shwe and  the delegation called on Khamtai Siphandon, chairman of the Lao  People's Revolutionary Party Central Committee, in a cordial and  friendly atmosphere. They also visited various places of  economic, historic, and cultural significance in the capital,  Vientiane Province, and Luang Prabang Province.    Official talks between H.E. Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of  the LPDR and delegation, and H.E. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of  the SLORC of the Union of Myanmar, and delegation were held at  the Hokham Presidential Office in Vientiane. The two sides  informed each other of outstanding situations in their  respective countries during their talks, which proceeded in a  good atmosphere of profound friendship and mutual understanding.  They also exchanged views on international issues of common  interest. The two sides expressed satisfaction over the  increasing development of good relations of friendship and  cooperation between the two countries of Laos and Myanmar. This  development has been shown concretely through the exchanges of  high-level delegations, the exchanges of visits between the  peoples, and the settlement of various problems between the two  countries on the basis of sincerity and mutual understanding.    Noteworthy is that following the visit, the Government of  the  LPDR and the Government of the Union of Myanmar have jointly  signed three agreements -- namely the agreement on tourism  cooperation between governments of the two countries, the  agreement on the establishment of joint commission for bilateral  cooperation, and the agreement between Government of the LPDR  and Government of the Union of Myanmar on the permanent  international boundary between the two countries along the  Mekong River. These three agreements serve as a firm basis and  mark a historical milestone for the further and fruitful  enhancement, promotion, and expansion and the long duration of  the existing, good relations of friendship and cooperation  between Laos and Myanmar. The signing of the three agreements  has proved the intention and desire of the two sides to promote  and strengthen the relations and cooperation between the two  countries on the basis of the principles of equality, mutual  benefit, and complete respect of each other's sovereignty.    The success of the SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar  and  his delegation during this official visit to the LPDR marks the  opening of a new era -- an era for the further strengthening,  ever more profoundly and extensively, the relations and  cooperation between the two countries and the fraternal  friendship and affection between the two peoples of Laos and  Myanmar. The Lao people would like to wholeheartedly hail the  glorious success of the visit on this occasion. They pledge to  do their utmost, together with the Myanmar people, to contribute  to further developing the existing, good relations of friendship  and cooperation between the two countries and fruitfully  implementing the agreements on cooperation in various fields as  already signed by the governments of the two countries. This  will bring about concrete benefit to the two peoples of Laos and  Myanmar and contribute to promoting and establishing peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation for development in this  region and the rest of the world.

Right Wing, Buthelezi Play Kamikaze Politics -- Allister  Sparks writes in an article on the same page that the right wing  and Inkatha Chief Buthelezi are engaging in ""Kamikaze politics,""  and ""self-destruction with a vengeance."" ""Sure the right wing  can launch a campaign of sabotage and terrorism. They can make  things extremely uncomfortable and do great damage to the new  South Africa. But in the process they will set themselves up as  the targets of vengeance and loathing for years to come. No  minority group can survive that for long. If ever there was a  formula for national suicide, this is it."" Chief Buthelezi of  the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) is also following this hardball  strategy pursued by the right wing. Sparks believes the ""true  explanation"" for this is that ""his ego is such that he cannot  face the prospect of fighting an election he is likely to lose,  and so he wants out. From the beginning Buthelezi has wanted to  secure for himself a third position equal in status to that of  Nelson Mandela and President de Klerk. He now knows this is  unattainable and he cannot come to terms with the idea of  playing second fiddle to anyone.""    BUSINESS DAY    Criticism of COSATU Undemocratic Support for Single Ballot  --  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 9 February in a page 10  editorial asks ""someone who understands democracy"" to ""pay a  call"" on Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)  headquarters. ""Lessons in the workings of a democratic system,  and a word or two about political tolerance, are sorely needed.""  The COSATU leadership ""clearly does not understand"" that the  ""single ballot it supports so fervently is undemocratic. It  clearly cannot appreciate that people could oppose the single  ballot on democratic grounds without aligning themselves with  any party political cause. And it ignores the fact that the DP  [Democratic Party] an the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] also  support the double ballot -- two parties which can hardly be  said to be in bed with the right wing. COSATU deeply resents  anyone taking a view opposed to the ANC/COSATU `line'.""    SOWETAN    Danger of Sidelining Freedom Alliance -- Johannesburg  SOWETAN  in English on 9 February in a page 8 editorial warns there are  ""dangers"" which can be prompted by sidelining the Freedom  Alliance (FA). Although the FA ""does not have the will to  fight,"" and there are many civil servants in the homelands who  ""are not happy to sacrifice everything for the ambitions of  their political masters,"" there are ""elements in the FA who have  the ability to terrorise the people of this country.""  Therefore, ""it makes sense to forge a deal now before the  country is plunged into civil strife. This should be done  without compromising the sovereignty or integrity of the new  South Africa.""     "

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     On November 8, 1993, the President reported to the Congress pursuant to section 8(b) of the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978)b)) (the ``Pelly Amendment'') on the issue of trade by the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Taiwan in rhinoceros and tiger parts and products. The report followed the certification by the Secretary of the Interior that this trade was diminishing the effectiveness of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Five rhinoceros species and the tiger are listed in Appendix I of CITES, which means that the species are threatened with extinction and no trade for primarily commercial purposes is allowed.            The President reported that although ``recent actions by the PRC and Taiwan show that some progress has been made in addressing their rhinoceros and tiger trade, the record demonstrates that they still fall far short of the international conservation standards of CITES.'' The President suggested actions that the PRC and Taiwan could take that would demonstrate their commitment to the elimination of the trade and stated that the United States is prepared, through close dialogue and technical aid, to assist them in their efforts. However, the report concluded that, if measurable, verifiable and substantial progress were not made by March 1994, import prohibitions will be necessary, as recommended by the CIGES Standing Committee at its September 1993 meeting.    The suggested actions in the November 8 report, based on criteria established by CITES for adequate legislative measures and enforcement that effectively eliminates the trade, were further amplified in letters dated December 21, 1993, to the Chairman of the Council of Agriculture and the Minister of Economic Affairs in Taipei from the Secretary of the Interior, and by CITES and U.S. delegation visits to the PRC and Taiwan in January, February and March 1994. However, at its March 1994 meeting, the CITES Standing Committee noted the progress made by the PRC while pointing out that further actions are still needed.

Major and  Balladur are both struggling to maintain popularity, control and  respect at the head of right-wing parties. The success of the  Channel link will be crucial for both.    [LIBERATION] What does the Channel Tunnel represent for your  country?    [Major] It is a potent symbol of Britain's new role in  Europe. We share with France an enormous pride in the  achievement and skills of those who have designed and  constructed one of the greatest engineering projects of the  century. The tunnel links Great Britain with the Continent for  the first time in many thousands of years. It will bring us  nearer still to the French people, with whom our ties have grown  ever closer over past years.    [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel will bring our two countries  closer in many ways, not just economically. It will help  strengthen economic cohesion within the European Union. France  can expect to see an increase in tourism -- which is its primary  source of foreign currency.    [LlBERATlON] What impact is the tunnel expected to have?    [Major] It will be a direct link to the single market for  our companies who export goods, and for the millions who travel  from Britain every year.    In linking Britain to the French rail system and beyond that  to the wider European rail system, it will give our exporters  the chance to benefit from long rail runs for the first time.  It will also provide our business community with previously  unparalleled access to important capitals such as Paris and  Brussels. As for tourism, millions of Britons already travel to  the Continent every year by ferry and air. The opening of the  Channel Tunnel will provide healthy new competition. I hope,  too, that it will encourage as many French tourists to visit  Britain as British tourists visit France.    [LIBERATION] In France, the highspeed train link between  Paris and Calais is already in place. Britain must wait another  10 years. Why has it taken so long for the Conservative  government to make a decision regarding the ""British TGV [Train  A' Grande Vitesse]""?    [Major] It was never intended that a new line would be built  in Britain before the tunnel opened. The present rail lines  through Kent have been improved to take tunnel traffic and will  provide sufficient capacity until some time after the turn of  the century. But, given that capacity is unlikely to be  sufficient in the next 10 years or so, we are pressing ahead  with our plans for a new line to be ready within that timeframe.  We expect the line to reduce the London to Paris journey time  by 20-25 minutes. There are a number of factors which make the  British and French situations different. For example, French  terrain is more suitable for railways than south-east England  (being flatter), land values in Kent are higher than in northern  France -- and in France there was existing local demand for a  new rail link to serve the Lille area.    [LIBERATION] Great Britain is not as intensely committed to  the scheme as France, particularly where the rail link is  concerned. Is this a serious handicap?    [Balladur] It is not for me to judge the choices an  important partner of France chooses to make. I will simply say  that the high-speed TGV rail system in France has boosted the  railway industry, as demonstrated by the success of our  GEC-Alsthom [General Electric Company] in winning the South  Korean railway contract. We intend to build on this; that is  why the government has decided to build the Mediterranean (Lyon  to Nice) and Eastern (Paris to Strasbourg) TGV lines. TGV gave  the SNCF [French Railway Network] state railway new perspectives.    [LIBERATION] After centuries of fighting invasions as an  island, do the British fear losing sovereignty and identity with  such a tunnel?    [Major] Not at all. It is certainly true that the British  have never been accustomed to the idea of getting into a train  and arriving in another country. The sea crossing, however  short, has represented a barrier. But countries such as France,  which have always had land boundaries, are clearly sovereign and  have distinct identities. Britain is no different in that  respect.    [Balladur] The main feature of British civilisation has  undoubtedly been its extraordinary expansion throughout the  world. I cannot believe that the great British people, in order  to protect their identity, would now be cowering on the very  island from which they set sail to travel the world.    On the contrary, I am convinced that Britain has a major  role  in the building of Europe, not least in the originality of its  contribution to the overall structure.    [LIBERATION] Britain has been accused by some of its  European partners of trying to slow down enlargement of the  Union. Does the tunnel mean Britain will be more ""at the heart  of Europe?""    [Major] In fact it was Britain that was the foremost  advocate of enlargement and fought to have the states of the  European Free Trade Association brought into the Union at the  earliest date. In this we were successful.    [Balladur] Britain has made a remarkable contribution to  the strengthening of Europe in a large number of areas, for  example the setting up of the single market. The British  Government and people have, like their French counterparts, a  high opinion of their national destiny. But we all realise that  our old nations, while preserving their identity and  sovereignty, must co-operate more within the European framework.  Closer cooperation between our two countries is of particular  importance in ensuring that European opinions of the  international scene are taken into account. In fact, the  Yugoslav crisis shows that, at present, the involvement of other  European countries depends largely on a move by our two  countries which has brought our other European partners along  with it.    [LIBERATION] What about the co-operation between France and  Britain? Will it grow both on an economic and political level?    [Major] Our ties with France are already extremely close.  We are partners in the European Union, NATO, the UN Security  Council and the G7 group. We work together closely on foreign  policy, defence and many other issues. We invest enormous  amounts in each other's economies and many companies -- over  2,000 at the last count -- are co-located in one way or another  in both Britain and France.    Defence co-operation has been growing strongly in recent  years. We have more defence projects with France than with any  other partners. Our troops are used to working side by side on  exercises and in UN peacekeeping operations. Together we have  made the greatest troop contribution to peacekeeping in former  Yugoslavia.    I am sure our links in these and many other areas will  continue to grow.    [Balladur] Collaboration between France and Britain is close  and productive. It also goes back a long way. Ninety years  ago, our two countries formed the Entente Cordiale. The  vitality of this agreement is founded on basic interests that we  share, notably as nuclear powers and permanent members of the  Security Council.    Today, our troops are once again working side by side in  Bosnia. If the institutional debate has sometimes -- quite  understandably -- uncovered differing sensibilities on the part  of Britain and France, I am pleased to say that, when we are  faced with a crisis, our two countries are essentially on the  same side. That is why I have every confidence in the strength  of our future political co-operation.    As far as our economic, scientific and industrial  co-operation is concerned, this is particularly strong. Allow  me to quote the most obvious examples. Concorde, Jaguar, the  TGV trains.... Examples of successful Franco-British projects  abound.    I am convinced that the cross-fertilisation of our  economies,  as symbolised by the Channel Tunnel, will be more marked in the  years to come and I am delighted about this.    [LIBERATION] Could the Channel Tunnel be a commercial  failure?    [Major] Eurotunnel has built and will operate the tunnel  wholly as a private venture. In doing so they have backed their  own judgment about future profitability. The new choices the  tunnel offers both to the transport industry and the public will  ensure both its full use and its success.    [Balladur] The Channel Tunnel represents a large undertaking  which has broken new ground. One can never rule out the  possibility of running into difficulties in the initial stages.  However I am convinced that as soon as the French and British  people -- not forgetting all the other Europeans -- understand  the advantages of the tunnel, it will enjoy the success it  deserves.    [LIBERATION] Will you use the Channel Tunnel yourself?    [Major] I am very much looking forward to being able to use  the tunnel, both on business and privately.    [Balladur] Of course.     "

In addition, visits by personnel and other kinds of  exchanges have continued to increase. In the favorable situation  of the further development in cross- strait relations, there  unfortunately occurred the malignant criminal case of robbery,  arson, and murder at Qiandao Lake at the end of March which  killed 32 compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.  I express my profound condolences to the murdered compatriots  and my deep sympathy to their family members.    Wang Daohan said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council attached great importance to the ""Qiandao Lake  case"" after it happened, and the relevant Zhejiang authorities  put in full efforts with an earnest and responsible attitude to  crack the case. The criminals have now been arrested, and the  judicial department will severely punish them in accordance with  the law. Meanwhile, the relevant mainland authorities have  properly dealt with the aftermath of the incident, taking into  consideration the overall situation of safeguarding the  development of cross-strait relations. The relevant mainland  experts gave a detailed account to personnel of the Strait  Exchange Foundation [SEF] and relevant Taiwan experts on how the  case occurred and was cracked. In addition, they answered  various doubts of the Taiwan side about the case and also  arranged for Taiwan experts to visit the scene. This has  demonstrated the mainland's sincerity in making the greatest  efforts to explain the truth of the case to the Taiwan side.    Wang Daohan said: After the case occurred, compatriots from  the two sides of the Taiwan Strait shared the same sorrows and  regrets, and Taiwan circles have also put forward many opinions  and suggestions. We feel that in the powerful tide of thriving  cross- strait exchanges and unstoppable economic cooperation,  the ""Qiandao Lake incident"" was only an unexpected and  unfortunate case of murder and that it should not affect the  normal development of cross-strait relations. Furthermore, it  should not be used by a small number of people with ulterior  motives as an excuse to oppose the mainland, block cross-strait  exchanges, and advocate Taiwan independence. The two sides of  the Taiwan Strait should value the overall interests of the  Chinese people and rationally, calmly, and objectively treat the  case and various problems arising from it in the course of  handling the incident, as well as earnestly draw a lesson from  it. The mainland side will continue to tighten security  controls to ensure the security of Taiwan compatriots who visit  the mainland.    Wang Daohan said: The successful convening of the Wang-Gu  [Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu] talks one year ago has played an  active role in promoting the development of cross-strait  relations. In accordance with the agreements signed at the  talks, the ARATS and SEF have established a systematic  communications channel which has played an important role in  enhancing understanding and mutual trust as well as in  minimizing differences. With the continued development of  cross-strait relations, it should be said that there are bright  prospects for ARATS-SEF cooperation, and compatriots from the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait are placing high hopes on the  ARATS and the SEF. The two sides should further strengthen  their communications channel, particularly in strengthening  high-level contacts, increasing dialogue, eliminating  misunderstandings, resolving differences, and promoting  cooperation. Only with this can we comply with the wish of  compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and shoulder  the heavy responsibility entrusted by history.     "

The situation has attracted overseas investors into the huge  market in this field.    This is a view shared by representatives of nearly 20  overseas business offices in Beijing, as shown in recent  interviews with XINHUA when asked about China's investment  environment.    According to Chun Song-Chin, chief representative of the  Beijing office of the Lucky-Goldstar International Corporation  from the Republic of Korea, the Chinese Government has long been  aware of the importance of developing its infrastructure and has  put large sums into it, as signally manifested by its  determination to build the three gorges project and some other  large water conservancy projects.    Klaus Kaltenthaler, chief Beijing representative of  Germany's  BASF Chemical Corporation, appreciated China's rapid development  in telecommunications, saying that when the BASF came to China  at the beginning of the '80s, China's telecommunication  facilities were very backward, especially international  telecommunication services.    But now, he said, China's telecommunications system was much  better, with portable telephones and pagers widely in use.    H.T. Kung, director of the Public Relations Department of  the ATT China Company, noted that China has invested  heavily in  the development of telecommunications satellites, cables and  program- controlled telephones, which will increase the  telephone users rate from 2.15 percent of the population last  year to 3 percent this year, and the rate is expected to reach 6  to 7 percent by the end of this century.    He added that this will in turn greatly promote China's  economic development.    China's communication's development also left a strong  impression on these overseas business people.    They felt that China's transport systems have been improved  drastically, with great increases in the handling capacity of  ports like Tianjin, Dalian and Shanghai, construction of more  highways and electrification of railways, and opening of more  domestic and international air routes.    They said, however, that China's infrastructure, still a  weak  point in China's investment environment, was lagging behind  China's economic development, while from a long-term point of  view, this field holds a huge market and vast potential for  overseas investors who are also eager to be involved in this  development.    With the speeding up of China's reform and opening up, Anne  Stevenson-Yang, director of the Beijing office of the U.S.-China  Business Council which has more than 250 U.S. member  corporations, said that more and more U.S. companies want to  take part in China's construction of airports, railways,  highways and power stations, which has created a ""craze"" in the  U.S.    On China's working efficiency and the quality of its  personnel, these business executives believed that ""the change  in people's hearts and heads"" and improvement of education are  vitally important to China's reform and further improvement of  China's investment environment.    On this point, China's finance sector attracts more of their  interest. They said that they were pleased to see so many  professional Chinese people engaged in that sector.    While thinking highly of the service of China's banks, they  expressed their expectation of even better services in the  future.    Dick Liu, president of the Du Pont China Company, said that  Chinese Government officials are ""more open, more cooperative  and more efficient.""    He took Du Pont as an example: the first contract signed in  1991 between Du Pont and China took a year and a half to  achieve, while the second one signed last year only took a year,  and the third one which is under negotiation is expected to be  signed in several months.

The MSZP's foreign policy  program is ""not typical of the party"" in the sense that it is  free of the ambiguities that can be seen in the economic and  domestic political ideas. Anyway, the SZDSZ that has been  balanced all the time will not change something purely because  others also think similarly, Szent-Ivanyi added when he spoke  about the party's foreign political program.    He said that the idea of European integration, security  policy, and politics relating to the neighbors that includes  national minority policy as an organic part are the three basic  pillars of the program. The SZDSZ has managed to keep the three  issues in balance all along. The government's foreign policy  can be criticized precisely because the proportions have shifted  and the situation of the Hungarians living beyond the border has  been given a primary role. It can be said that the government's  foreign policy is bad compared to what it could have achieved.  Starting from a favorable position, it realized little of the  actual possibilities.    On the issue of joining Europe, Szent-Ivanyi pointed out  that, in the views of his party, rather than setting ""magic  deadlines,"" the goals have to be implemented as soon as the  country's and the economy's condition facilitate it; haste would  only cause harm. For this reason, in his view, the government  should not, as a campaign measure, overhastily submit its  request to the European Union.    In the area of security policy, he emphasized that, in  addition to urging foreign guarantees, we mainly have to  strengthen our domestic efforts. This proposal does not mean  increasing the military force. A balanced and internationally  respected attitude, domestic stability, the development of the  democratic institutional system, and the improvement of the  economy are more important factors.    As for the policy concerning the neighboring countries, the  SZDSZ expects a slow progress and the basic agreements would  only move the processes from their deadlock at the most. These  agreements are not products that can be sold and bought; the  party clearly states that the borders cannot be changed but this  can only be included in agreements together with other  guarantees. We must not give up the collective rights of  national minorities, but unutilized reserves also exist in the  area of individual rights. The elimination of dual taxation,  investment protection, new cultural and scientific agreements,  and the opening of new border crossing points would increase the  confidence of the neighbors.    It is generally true that the establishment of a modernized,  attractive, democratic, and stable Hungary is a precondition to  implementing the concept, Szent-Ivanyi told NEPSZABADSAG. Also  speaking to our newspaper, he said that the changes in the  foreign affairs staff (which affected about half of the  diplomatic staff) often had political motivations. If the SZDSZ  came to power, it would only initiate the change of ambassadors  in 15 to 20 cases at the most.    Talking about integrated foreign representations,  Szent-Ivanyi noted that the economic diplomacy tasks of the  Ministry for International Economic Relations [NGKM] could be  drawn under the authority of foreign affairs, the licensing  functions could be transferred to the Industry and Trade  Ministry, and the services to the chamber [not sepcified] or the  National Federation of Entrepreneurs [VOSZ]. Szent-Ivanyi noted  the deficit of the foreign affairs budget which might result in  the apparatus becoming unable to function by the end of this  year unless a supplementary budget is made.     "

The 38-year-old Davidian, who admitted having no experience in the politically  sensitive field of immigration, had been the leading choice to become Western  regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.    ""He does have outstanding credentials,"" said David Runkel, chief spokesman for  U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. ""We think that he will bring a degree of  professionalism to the office.""    Davidian's predecessor, Ezell, had a penchant for making statements that  enraged many Latinos.

Davidian, who is expected to start work Monday at the INS regional headquarters  in Laguna Niguel, replaces Robert M.

The post is considered a key one since the immigration agency is in the midst  of handling the second phase of the 1986 amnesty law.

""It's troubling to say the least,"" added Vibiana Andrede, a staff attorney with  the National Center for Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. ""We've gone from a hot  dog vendor to a know-nothing.""    (Ezell was an executive with the Der Wienerschnitzel Corp. when he was  appointed to the INS Western commissionership in 1983.)    Also, Davidian has been criticized by liberals who say he has dealt unfairly  with farm workers since he was named chairman of the ALRB in 1987.

For his part, Davidian, contacted late Tuesday at his office in Sacramento,  said the criticism is not new or fair.    ""That's just not so,"" he said.    He pointed out that similar criticism of inexperience was made of him when he  was named to the labor panel, and he said he has a sound grasp of agricultural  labor issues.

From Reuters      MOSCOW      The Soviet Union announced Tuesday that it would introduce domestic money  exchanges next year where the ruble, battered by a growing black market, would  trade freely against other currencies.    A government statement said the decision, effective Jan. 1, was an integral  part of the coming switch from a planned to a market economy and would help  prepare the ground for eventual ruble convertibility.    The statement said a previously unannounced government decree dated Aug. 4  provided for the opening of exchanges in Moscow, the capitals of the 15 Soviet  republics and in other major cities.    It was not immediately clear how far foreign organizations would be able to  take part in dealing on the exchanges, but a Finance Ministry official said he  saw no obstacle to non-Soviet banks joining in.    The official, who asked not to be identified, said the main purpose of the  exchanges would be ""to enable Soviet enterprises and organizations who have no  export potential to buy currency to purchase equipment abroad for their own  development.""    Many Soviet businesses, gaining increasing independence under President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev's economic reforms, hold vast sums of rubles but have no access to  foreign currency because they produce only for the domestic market.    During the past year, the state Bank for Foreign Economic Relations  (Vneshekonombank) has held occasional currency auctions for Soviet  organizations, but newly emerging commercial banks are known to be keen to take  part in these operations.    The Finance Ministry official said the exchanges, likely to be open at least  twice a week, were an extension of auctions held once a month in which only  Soviet organizations have been allowed to participate.    One Western banker in Moscow said there would be a clear interest for foreign  sellers to act on the new exchanges despite the limited demand for the ruble,  which has not been freely traded in the outside world since the 1920s.    But the Finance Ministry official said there was no question at this stage of  allowing export of rubles, at present strictly banned, for sale abroad to raise  hard currency. ""These will be purely domestic markets,"" he said.    The statement said Gosbank would control interbank and all other operations at  the new exchanges, which would be the first in the Soviet Union for six  decades.    The assertion that the measure was a move toward convertibility, or free  exchange of the ruble on world markets, surprised Soviet economists and foreign  bankers.    Even Soviet government experts have said frequently that this was unlikely to  be achieved before the mid-1990s at the earliest, even if the long-delayed  switch to a market system brings a quick boost to the crumbling economy.    The ruble has two officially set exchange rates -- a trading one of 0.58  against the dollar and a tourist rate of 5.8 to the dollar. But on the black  market, Soviet business publications say, the dollar sells for up to 25 rubles.    Soviet officials admit that the official rate, calculated against a basket of  Western currencies and at which all official foreign transactions are carried  out, is grossly out of line with the ruble's real value.    It has been widely assumed by foreign and Soviet specialists that the ruble  could not be freely traded on world markets without devastating effects on the  already weak economy before radical economic reforms took hold.    The government announcement did not make clear exactly how far the ruble would  be exposed.

REZA, Times Staff Writer      Teachers at La Jolla Country Day School filed a petition Friday with the  National Labor Relations Board, asking that their association be recognized as  the bargaining agent in contract talks with the school's management.    A local NLRB official, who asked not to be named, said the petition was filed  by a group calling itself the Country Day Teachers Assn., which seeks to  represent teachers, aides, librarians and the school nurse. The school has  about 75 teachers and has never had a union shop, school officials said.    A source familiar with the petition said the teachers decided to organize  partly because of school administrators' treatment of Sharon Rogers after the  March 10 bombing of her van. However, Barbara Judy, the association's  spokeswoman and a kindergarten teacher, refused to confirm that or to say when  the organization drive began. Judy said the petition signatures were gathered  Wednesday.      Caved In to Terrorists?    Rogers, wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III, has said that administrators caved  in to terrorism when they pressured her to resign in exchange for a $140,000  settlement after the bombing. Rogers had taught at the school 12 years and was  teaching a fourth-grade class when she resigned April 28.    The FBI is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist reprisal. Capt.  Rogers was in command of the guided missile cruiser Vincennes last summer when  a missile fired by the ship mistakenly downed an Iranian passenger jet in the  Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard.    Mark Saxon, newly elected president of the school's board of trustees, said he  does not believe the union bid is related to the school's decision not to renew  Rogers' teaching contract.    ""There's been no indication to me there is any relationship,"" he said.    Judy refused to publicly discuss Rogers' firing, saying that ""we don't like to  air family disputes."" But, she added, ""we certainly know that we have  colleagues who are no longer there for various reasons.""    Judy said the teachers' decision to organize is an attempt to play a greater  role in school affairs that directly effect them.      'Opening Communication'    ""We feel that the faculty, speaking together, can have some input in matters  that concern them. . . . Some people feel that they are not listened to  individually. . . . We feel this (union) is a proper forum by which to address  these concerns. It's a way of opening communication between the board,  administrators and the faculty,"" Judy said.    Both Judy, who has been a teacher at the school 15 years, and Saxon said that  teachers' unions at independent schools are rare.    ""This is not often done in independent schools,"" said Judy. ""We cherish our  parent body and (students) and have very close ties to them. We wouldn't do  this without thinking it over very carefully. We're all too old to be  radicals.""    Saxon estimated that 90% of the nation's independent schools do not have  unions.    The NLRB spokesman said the next step is to send a copy of the petition to the  school to confirm the signatures. The petition has to be signed by at least 30%  of the eligible membership. The names of those signing and number of signatures  are not allowed to be made public.    After the signatures are verified, both sides must meet to work out issues  raised by the petition and agree on an election. Disputes will be decided by  the NLRB regional director in Los Angeles.

0,FT943-9892 ,"FT943-9892 _AN-EHIE8AA4FT 940809   FT  09 AUG 94 / Waters smoothed in Taiwan straits: The talks between Beijing and Taipei      By TONY WALKER and LAURA TYSON   China's official media yesterday highlighted what was described as an 'important breakthrough' in talks between Chinese and Taiwanese officials, but gave less weight to the story than newspapers in Taiwan. People's Daily, the communist party newspaper, on page three of its international edition, reported that common ground had been achieved on 'functional issues' such as the repatriation of hijackers, fishing disputes and the return of mainland Chinese working illegally in Taiwan. But observers in Taipei cautioned that while the outcome of the talks, the sixth round since groundbreaking meetings in April 1993, had smoothed cross-strait waters for the time being, underlying political tensions would be likely to escalate in the future. Reports in the Chinese press were consistent in tone with the need for workmanlike discussions Beijing had emphasised in the lead-up to the talks between Mr Tang Shubei, secretary-general of China's quasi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and his Taiwanese counterpart, Chiao Jen-ho of the Straits Exchange Foundation. While Beijing is treating the latest developments in a sober manner, there is no doubt it is taking seriously the process begun in Singapore in 1993 when the two sides agreed at a highly publicised meeting to explore ways to broaden contacts as part of a confidence building process. Impetus has been given to the discussions by Beijing's growing concern, shared by the Taiwanese leadership, about a strengthening nationalist movement in Taiwan. China's leaders will not have overlooked opinion polls showing an increasing number of Taiwanese favouring independence. China's avowed aim is to achieve reunification of Taiwan with the mainland, but whereas in the past it had insisted there was plenty of time to achieve this, gains made in recent elections by opposition parties committed to independence have changed Beijing's approach. Mr Tang gave voice to these concerns in comments after the two sides reached agreement on Sunday. Describing cross-straits ties as 'very complicated', he added: 'Whomever tries to cut these ties and create hostile feelings is serving no-one's interests.' While it would be stretching a point to describe Mr Tang's visit to Taiwan as part of a 'charm offensive', there is also no doubt that he was at pains to show a human face to the Taiwanese to counter the independence tide. Mr Tang may also have wished to make amends for China's mishandling of a boat tragedy in March in which 24 Taiwanese tourists were murdered while sightseeing on a lake near Hangzhou, south of Shanghai. Mr Hu Fo, a politics professor at National Taiwan University, said the talks 'certainly helped restore a certain spirit of harmony, consensus and mutual trust' damaged by the incident. 'But the basic problems which existed well before (the incident) remain. This will make it extremely difficult to reach similar agreements on a political level.' Mr Shih Ming-teh, chairman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, denounced the talks, which he said Beijing had used merely to get ties back on track. Mainland Chinese media have expressed the hope that further high level discussions can be held soon, including a repeat of the 'summit' in Singapore between senior figures from both sides. China would like to force the pace on such issues as direct shipping and air links, but Taiwan remains nervous, fearing being drawn into a suffocating embrace. Beijing, for its part, wishes to encourage trade and investment further. Taiwanese investment in the mainland exceeds USDollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn), and would receive a significant boost if barriers to direct contacts were removed.   Countries:-  TWZ  Taiwan, Asia.

This is the  gist of a document drafted by the Foreign Ministry's Policy  Planning Division on relations between the two countries. The  threat of U.S. pressure has always hovered over Israel's head;  however, according to the document, which is classified as  secret, this threat has been withdrawn because of the  breakthrough in the peace talks. Washington considers Israel an  ally.    The most important piece of news regards the annual U.S.  aid,  to the tune of $3 billion. Until about a year ago, there was  talk of a certain gradual reduction in U.S. foreign aid. The  Policy Planning Division believes that the United States has no  intention of cutting foreign aid to Israel. The division even  goes as far as stating that ""there is a promise that if Israel  becomes more vulnerable, the United States will agree to give  (Israel) more aid and more access to technology."" It may be  assumed, therefore, that the scope of the foreign aid Israel  receives will only be changed in one of two instances: If the  Israeli Government halts the political process, the aid will be  cut. If, on the other hand, it should decide to ""take  additional risks"" -- a euphemism for a withdrawal from the Golan  Heights -- the United States may increase the aid.    And yet, one aspect of the Foreign Ministry document casts a  shadow on Israeli-U.S. relations. It has to do with the U.S.  secretary of state's determination to promote the peace talks  with Syria. These remarks, worded very vaguely, caused a slight  shock in Jerusalem and in the Israeli Embassy in Washington.  The embassy decided to react, because Itamar Rabinovich is not  only the ambassador but he also heads the Israeli team on the  talks with Syria.    A week ago, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres received a  classified telegram from Rabinovich, written after a  consultation was held at the embassy. Some of the senior  embassy political staff claimed that the Planning Division  document was politically inspired by Foreign Ministry officials.  The embassy agrees that the U.S. Administration does not  attribute the same degree of importance to foreign policy as did  previous administrations. The debate is about whether  Christopher is doing enough. The document makes one feel that  Planning Division personnel are not convinced that the Americans  can be trusted to use the momentum in order to bring about a  breakthrough in the negotiations with Syria.    The Washington embassy discussion ended with different  conclusions. It is true that the negotiations with Syria are  stuck and that things will move slower than expected, but the  embassy does not believe that this delay poses a threat to the  entire process.    The ambassador's report to his political staff indicates  that  there never was a situation in which the American peace team was  not attentive or ready to take action to promote peace. Embassy  staffers claim that the ball is indeed in the Syrian court.  This is the stage at which al-Asad is called upon to come up  with better answers for Israel. Therefore, there is nothing  wrong with the secretary of state delaying his visit as long as  al-Asad is not delivering the goods.    Washington has discerned signals of distress in Syria -- for  example, in the Syrian media attacks on Israel last week. Syria  is concerned about the progress in the process with the  Palestinians and the developments between Israel and Jordan.  Christopher's delayed Middle East visit made al-Asad feel  pressured. If Israel also pushes Christopher, the embassy said,  it will be asking for pressure in return. [passage omitted]     "

Although our  cooperation has been gradually acquiring an international  character, the Czech Republic remained our most important  partner. The tendency to standardize our mutual relations and  gradually eliminate the specific features is gaining in strength  particularly on the Czech side. Certain international  appearances, however, of the Czech Republic in support of the  Slovak Republic can be classified as signs of good cooperation.    The volume of mutual trade indicates a halt in the original  decline that followed the partition of the federation. A better  and broader utilization of the customs union could favorably  affect the speed and quality of the incorporation into the  Western integration structures. The Treaty on a Temporary  License To Conduct Business for Natural and Legal Persons Who  Conduct Business on the Territory of the Other Republic of the  Former Federation After 31 December 1993 was added at the end of  the year to the complex of the treaties signed with the Czech  Republic so far. On the whole, the division of the property of  the former federation (98 percent completed) can also be rated  favorably, although the most recent problems are not getting  solved as fast as desired.    The talks on an umbrella agreement regarding the border  regime between the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic have  progressed slowly because of the difference in approach to this  issue by the two parties. The problem of setting the amount of  administrative fees has been solved, however, for the  applications by citizens for permanent or long-term residence on  the territory of the other republic.    To designate the common border, a Slovak-Czech demarcation  commission has been established, which managed to define  successfully the international border between the Slovak  Republic and the Czech Republic. The last four questionable  instances in this area are currently being solved.    The mutual cultural ties are very close; albeit, the  reduction of the information flow and the mutual communication  threatens their firmness. Because Slovakia wishes to continue  presenting its culture to the citizens of the Czech Republic and  reinforce the spiritual identity of the expatriate community,  fundamental steps were taken to initiate the work of a Slovak  Cultural Center in Prague beginning on 1 January 1994.    During the year, several working meetings of representatives  of the two states at all levels took place, including three  meetings of the presidents.    Despite all endeavors and conciliatory measures by the  Slovak  Republic, the mutual mistrust and tense atmosphere in relations  with the Hungarian Republic could not be overcome. This is  indicated especially by the approach taken by the Hungarian  side, which was clearly dictated by the effort to challenge the  credibility of Slovakia at international forums, the emphasis  put on the problem of the rights of the Hungarian ethnic  minority by the unnecessary dramatization of some less  considerate unpremeditated steps by the Slovak side (the removal  of signs, for instance), and the fueling of the irredentist  tendencies of some representatives of the Hungarian parties in  Slovakia. Hungarian diplomacy used international forums to  complicate the starting position of Slovakia (CSCE, Council of  Europe, Central European Initiative), and this stand adversely  marked the entire development of mutual relations.    The decidedly negative interpretation of the construction of  the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project was successfully vanquished,  however, and depoliticized by submitting the conflict for  decision by the International Court of Justice at The Hague.  The reliability of the arguments by the Hungarian Republic has  diminished recently as regards the need for the reinforcement of  the defense and the status of the Hungarian ethnic minorities in  the neighboring countries--that is, also in Slovakia.    Because of the aforementioned tension in mutual relations,  no  official highest-level meetings have taken place this year,  except for some brief meetings of the prime ministers and  foreign ministers at multilateral forums and the participation  of our supreme representatives at the funeral of the deceased  Hungarian Prime Minister J. Antall.    The basis for mutual relations with the Polish Republic is a  good neighborhood without any open problems and joint efforts to  integrate into the West European structures. Nonetheless, not  all activities have been conducted according to the expectations  of both parties, as the Polish partners reckon with a more  active part on our side. The volume of trade declined, which is  a result of the restructuring of both economies and also the  absence of treaties in the economic sphere. A recovery in this  area should be helped by the opening of new border crossings  according to the schedule approved by the government in October.    A certain revival in our relations can be expected in the  near future because treaties are ready on cross-border  cooperation, the small border contact, and we are preparing the  opening of a Slovak institute in Warsaw. The activity in other  sectors leaves something to be desired.    Of the Polish officials, President Walesa visited Slovakia  with the Polish foreign minister on the occasion of the  inauguration of the president. Deputy Prime Minister R. Kovac  visited Poland.    The development of relations with Austria continued its  favorable trend. Contacts have been vitalized at all levels and  in all areas because, from the very beginning, the Slovak  diplomacy has been aware of the specific character of  cooperation with this country, which is our only neighbor with a  developed market economy and democratioc traditions, and a  future member of the European Union. The foreign political  importance of Austria increased also by many countries  accrediting their ambassadors to the Slovak Republic in Vienna  because many foreign observers and journalists also operate from  there. Moreover, Vienna is the seat of numerous international  organizations.    The official visits by the Slovak prime minister to Austria  and the Austrian federal president and the foreign minister to  the Slovak Republic helped in the quest for possibilities of  cooperation, as did the participation of Slovak officials at the  international undertakings in Vienna (UN Human Rights  Conference, Council of Europe Summit, and so forth).  International ties have also developed briskly, and this was  reflected in the signing of numerous treaties on cooperation.    Austria has become the largest foreign investor in Slovakia  and the third-largest business partner, but Slovakia has not  managed to eliminate the mutual trade deficit. The interchange  between the infrastructures of the two countries has also  progressed at a slow pace. The feeling of an environmental  threat to Austria on the part of Slovakia, to which some  ambiguous statements from our side contributed, remains an open  question. The problems with filling the post of Slovak  ambassador to Austria also had an adverse effect on our mutual  relations.    The specific feature of our relations with Ukraine lies in  the fact that ties were established between two new states with  a similar state-forming process and political and economic  problems. In the course of 1993, practically all spheres of  political, economic, and cultural life became active as the  appropriate treaties were drafted. The Treaty on Good  Neighborliness, Friendly Relations, and Cooperation merits  special mention, as do the treaties on problems concerning the  state border, including the readmission treaty, and several  ministerial treaties.    We have managed neither to settle the matter of permeability  of the state border with Ukraine nor to process a concept of new  border crossings. The border problems have been further  complicated by the disaster on the Uh River.    The Slovak president visited Kiev, and numerous meetings  took  place between Cabinet members and their Ukrainian partners.    2.2 Relations With the European Union    Another priority of foreign policy of the Slovak Republic  has  been and remains the integration into the West European  political, economic, and security structures. We have advanced  on the road to this objective by signing the European  (Association) Treaty on the association of the Slovak Republic  with the European Union in October 1993. For this reason, we  have paid extraordinary attention also to the establishment of  good bilateral relations with individual countries of the  European Twelve.    The relations with our former neighbor, the FRG, maintained  their somewhat privileged nature.    A material framework of the bilateral relations is formed by  the Treaty on Good Neighborliness and Cooperation Between the  Czech and Slovak Federal Republic and the FRG, on the basis of  which an actualization--that is, signing of additional  treaties--is being discussed.    The most significant contact actions have probably been the  visit by the Slovak president to the FRG, the meeting between  the foreign ministers, and numerous meetings and talks between  other ministers. Closer ties have also been formed between the  parliaments of the two countries.    The ties between the Slovak Republic and the individual  Bundeslaender have been developing well, particularly with  Bavaria, where the cooperation of individual sectors is further  advanced within the framework of the Slovak-Bavarian working  team. The visit by Slovak Prime Minister Meciar to Munich,  where he also met with Bavarian Prime Minister E. Stoiber,  confirmed the solid basis for such cooperation. Recently, we  have registered an increased interest in the Slovak Republic on  the part of other FRG laender as demonstrated by the visits of  delegations from Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia  to Bratislava.    In the second half of the year, the interest of the FRG in  cooperation with the Slovak Republic in the economic sphere  appreciably increased. This is also corroborated by the  establishment of a German economic mission in Bratislava and a  branch office of the Kreditny ustav pre obnovu a rozvoj [Credit  Institute for Reconstruction and Development] at the FRG Embassy  in Bratislava. In October 1993, the FRG assumed second place in  the volume of investment in the Slovak economy and is the  second-largest trade partner of the Slovak Republic. There was  very active communication on the level of the business sphere.    The compensation to Slovak citizens, former  concentration-camp prisoners, remains an open question. The  German side holds a relatively reserved stand and points out the  complex internal political economic situation. Similarly, the  question of employment of Slovak citizens working on contract in  the FRG must be resolved, while an increase to numbers  comparable with other Visegrad Four countries could not be  attained so far.    During the short time of the existence of an independent  representation office of the Slovak Republic, we have succeeded  in building an efficient representation and a wide network of  contacts. Nonetheless, the appointment of a Slovak ambassador to  the FRG has not yet been resolved. This state of affairs is  perceived adversely by the German side, and, to a certain  degree, it refutes the attained results.    The level of mutual relations with France rose after the  emergence of the Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993. That is  testified to by the extensive contact activity by members of the  Slovak Government. The fundamental objective of Slovak foreign  policy concerning France in 1993 was the use of the potential of  the declared French political support for the endeavors of  Slovakia to integrate into the European integration structures  in the admission into the Council of Europe, the signing of the  European Treaty on Association of the Slovak Republic with the  European Union, and the development of high-level bilateral  contacts.    France does not see any difference in the readiness of the  Visegrad Four countries to join NATO and the Western European  Union, but for now it will not support their membership in these  structures.    Regarding the Slovak Republic, France points out the  uncertain political and economic situation, ambiguities in  legislation, obfuscated privatization, and unsolved problems in  the sphere of minority policy.    In this context, it must be pointed out that the French  partners are not quite clear about the ""rules of the game""; the  cooperation rules have not been defined, and they feel that they  are not treated as equals. Following the official visits by  then Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Minister Delegate for  European Affairs Alain Lamassoure to the Slovak Republic, and  the official visit by the Slovak foreign minister to France in  1993, the Slovak Foreign Ministry plans for 1994 a meeting of  presidents and prime ministers of the two countries.    Parliamentary cooperation has developed between individual  sectors--interior, defense, education (Treaty on Cooperation in  the Area of Youth, Physical Education, and Sport was signed on 1  November 1993), and others.    Despite the cutback in the sphere of technical assistance,  several projects have been realized in the Slovak Republic in  1993, particularly in the spheres of education, culture,  environmental protection, agriculture, and public administration.    There are no unsolved issues in the sphere of bilateral  relations between Great Britain and Slovakia. A significant  stimulus for the development of the relationship was the visit  by the prime minister to London on 8 March 1993. He met with  British Prime Minister John Major; Michael Heseltine, British  president of the Board of Trade; EBRD [European Bank for  Reconstruction and Development] President Jacques Attali; and  representatives of the Confederation of British Industry. Other  significant contacts include the visit by Archibald Hamilton,  minister of state for armed forces, to the Slovak Republic, and  several meetings between other ministers.    From the political point of view, Great Britain is an  important partner as a member of the European structures the  Slovak Republic is interested in joining (European Union, NATO,  Western European Union). The interests of Britain differ in  certain instances from those of other members of these groupings  and often coincide with the interests of the Slovak Republic  (for example, expansion of the European Union membership,  liberalization of trade).    The assistance provided by Great Britain through the  Know-How  fund in many spheres of public administration is considerable.    The image of Slovakia in the UK has somewhat improved during  the year. Although the not-very-good economic situation is  still pointed out, and the domestic political situation is not  characterized as stable, the membership of Slovakia in  international organizations, to which the country was admitted  during 1993, has been emphasized all the time more frequently.    The significant official visits by our top-ranking  representatives to Belgium confirmed our endeavors to integrate  into the European and Euro-Atlantic structures. There was the  visit by the Slovak president on the occasion of the funeral of  King Baudouin I and the meetings during his visit to NATO, the  meeting between the Slovak prime minister and his Belgian  counterpart, and the talks between the Slovak foreign minister  and his Belgian counterpart. There were ties established also  between individual ministers.    Relations between the two countries can be described as  problem-free.    The development of relations with Luxembourg took a similar  course. Although the intensity of contacts was not very high, a  visit by the heir to the throne, Prince Henri, to the Slovak  Republic took place, and a working visit to Luxembourg by the  Slovak prime minister. Various important economic and business  contacts were established on these occasions.    After 1 January 1993, contacts with the Netherlands  generally  amplified, as witnessed by the official visit by Dutch Foreign  Minister Kooijmans to the Slovak Republic, which created the  framework for further development of mutual cooperation.  Certain favorable shifts in Dutch public opinion regarding the  Slovak Republic were registered. The Slovak Republic used  within the framework of the PSO [expansion unknown] bilateral  noninvestment aid in the amount of 3 million Dutch guilders.    The activities of the Foreign Ministry were aimed in the  relationship with Greece at forming prerequisites for an actual  support for Slovak endeavors to integrate quickly into the  European structures with respect to the Greek chairmanship of  the European Union beginning on 1 January 1994. These questions  and bilateral relations were on the agenda of the meeting of  foreign ministers of the two countries in Athens in June.    In the course of 1993, fundamental ties were established to  Spain. Except for the meeting between foreign ministers at the  48th UN General Assembly, however, no significant contacts took  place, and the present level of mutual relations is not  satisfactory. Cooperation in the economic sphere is  characterized by passivity on both sides and negligible interest  in developing actual contacts, while such an intensification  could be interesting for us because of the experience of Spain  with a transformation of the economy. Contractual relations are  also stagnating. A certain improvement could be detected in the  contacts between the Ministries of the Economy, Education and  Science, and Culture.    Our relations with Portugal can be characterized in a  similar  manner, despite a certain promise of an improvement by  occasional highest-level meetings at multilateral forums: a  meeting between the presidents in Washington, the prime  ministers in Vienna, and the foreign ministers at the UN in New  York. A favorable impulse was the visit by the Portuguese state  secretary of trade to the Slovak Republic. He reported an  interest of Portuguese enterprises in privatization.    Bilateral relations with Ireland have not developed.    2.3 Relations With Other States in Europe, North America,  and the Commonwealth of Independent States    In relations with other countries in Europe, Slovak  diplomacy  supported the endeavors for furthering possibilities of contacts  in both political and economic spheres. In some countries, we  wanted to create the appropriate framework for launching a  dialogue and creating opportunities for the expansion of  contacts in the future. Thus, cooperation was launched with  Turkey, Cyprus, Croatia, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], the Baltic states, and the Scandinavian  countries. In some instances, high-level meetings have already  taken place.    In relations with our traditional partners, we have tried  to maintain the position of the Slovak Republic, and, if  possible, use it for mutual support on the international scene.  All aspects of contacts have been developed with Slovenia, with  which we are tied by considerable common political and economic  interests, and with Romania, where a significant progress was  recorded in our mutual relations, including highest-level  meetings. As a result of the domestic political situation, our  contacts with Bulgaria somewhat stagnated.    Our relations with the Holy See have improved after our  president's official visit to the Vatican, and the meeting  between the Slovak prime minister with the state secretary of  the Holy See, Cardinal Angelo Sodano. We have also established  diplomatic ties with the Sovereign Order of Knights of Malta and  the Republic of San Marino.    The contacts with Switzerland are developing similarly well.  We have established contacts in the economic sphere,  parliamentary cooperation, and cooperation on the level of towns  and communities. The representatives of the Slovak Republic and  Switzerland met unofficially during the World Economic Forum in  Davos, and the Economic Forum in Crans Montana, attended by the  Slovak prime minister and several ministers. Slovak Prime  Minister Meciar met on this occasion with Swiss President Ogli.    Regarding the position of both North American states in the  world political, economic, and security relations, we have  considered the relations with them a priority. Foreign policy  of the Slovak Republic toward the United States of America was  built on the fact that although Slovakia is one of the successor  states to the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, it is perceived  as a new entity that must establish itself on the international  political, security, and economic scene. The second factor  affecting contacts with the United States was the influence of  the United States on the present arrangement of the world and  its decisive position within the framework of numerous  international organizations and institutions, which the Slovak  Republic wants to join, or whose support it would like to gain  (United Nations, NATO, IMF, World Bank, etc.). This corresponds  to the frequency of visits by World Bank representatives in the  course of the year. The Slovak president visited the United  States on the occasion of the opening of the Holocaust Museum,  the Slovak prime minister visited there, and so did the National  Council of the Slovak Republic chairman (three times), the  Slovak foreign minister on the occasion of the admission of  Slovakia to the United Nations and at the 48th UN General  Assembly, and four other ministerial visits.    The interest of the U.S. side focused on the sphere of  economic assistance and cooperation with the Slovak Republic.  The most important visits from the United States can be  considered the mixed delegation of the Department of Defense and  the Department of State headed by Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense Slocombe, whose members were able to acquaint themselves  with the orientation of the Slovak Republic in the sphere of  security policy and the orientation of the Army of the Slovak  Republic towards a compatibility of the army systems with the  NATO structures, and the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral  Export and the IMF expert team missions.    The relations with the United States are regulated by some  30  treaties, of which 11 have been signed since November 1989.    Because of the position of the Slovak Republic as a new  entity, in addition to the economic indicators, the United  States is also interested in the protection of human rights  here, freedom of speech, and minority rights. Despite positive  signals from the U.S. representatives towards the Slovak  Republic, in the political sphere, the exceptions in the  assessment of the sphere of the protection of human rights and  minorities, media policy, and the privatization process could  not be completely eliminated (see the CSCE Commission report to  the U.S. Congress).    There are also great reserves in the sphere of cooperation  with individual states of the United States, where only the  framework treaty with Maryland facilitates a broader economic  cooperation than the current one.    A problem of the Slovak Republic from this point of view  is, in particular, the lack of coordination of information flows  abroad. The latent apprehensions about the development of  democracy in the Slovak Republic are contributed to also by some  statements and measures by the highest representatives of the  Slovak Republic in the sphere of human rights and media policy.    Despite the status of Canada in the world, the Slovak  Republic's relations with this country at the highest level, as  well as relations with the Canadian representative mission,  which is based in Prague, have been only sporadic. That was  due, in particular, to the perception of the Slovak Republic as  the destroyer of the common state and to the drawing of  parallels with the efforts of Quebec to gain independence within  the framework of the Canadian federation.    The Slovak Republic is perceived in Canada as a politically  integral part of the group of Visegrad Four, though one that is  economically weaker, and one responds with understanding to the  efforts of the Slovak Republic to become integrated into West  European structures.    In May 1993 the Economic Development Corporation (EDC), the  most important Canadian economic organization guaranteeing  Canadian exporters' credits, included the Slovak Republic among  high-risk countries and refused to provide guarantees, thereby  virtually halting trade exchange. This suspension [of export  credit guarantees] has jeopardized the implementation of many  projects. This EDC attitude changed only at the beginning of  November, following the September 1993 visit by a delegation of  Slovak bankers headed by the governor of the Slovak National  Bank. In 1994 it is therefore possible to expect a revival of  economic relations and the provision of credits by Canadian  banks.    Cooperation at the level of government departments should be  based on a clear definition of the Slovak Republic's priorities  not only vis-a-vis Canada as a whole, but also vis-a-vis  Canadian provinces, many of which assume a more active approach  than federal bodies.    The following contacts took place in the course of 1993: the  Slovak Republic was visited by Otto Jelinek, minister of  national revenue, and several government ministers and Ivan  Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic, paid a visit to Canada.    In view of the political and economic situation of the  countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States [CIS],  Slovak foreign policy approached relations with them  pragmatically, with emphasis on the development of mutually  advantageous economic and trade relations and the effort to  recover some of our claims in these countries.    Proceeding from the new conditions in the two countries, the  Slovak Republic was building relations with the Russian  Federation on the basis of equal partnership. On the whole, we  have succeeded in following up on the positive aspects in  historical relations between the two nations.    The fundamental aim in building new relations with the  Russian Federation was to secure, above all, economic and trade  relations, which had been greatly disrupted in the preceding  period. Meeting this target was immensely difficult, due to the  exceedingly complicated domestic political, economic, and  socioeconomic situation in Russia. In spite of this, we have  succeeded in activating mutual relations and raising their  quality so that these relations can be characterized as good  partnership in all areas. Economic relations, in particular,  have been raised to a good level.    A number of contacts was realized in the course of 1993.  President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Bratislava, in particular,  was an event that should become an important factor for the  further development of mutual relations. The Treaty of Friendly  Relations and Cooperation was signed during the visit.    Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar paid important visits to  Moscow in March and in August 1993, which were devoted mainly to  questions of economic cooperation. The Agreement on Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation between the Governments of the  Slovak Republic and the Russian Federation and the Memorandum on  Questions of Slovak-Russian Trade and Economic Cooperation were  signed in 1993. Following up on Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's  visits, First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation O.  Lobov and Deputy Prime Minister Y. Yarov paid visits to the  Slovak Republic.    Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Slovak Republic Jozef  Moravcik paid a visit to the Russian Federation in March 1993,  as a member of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's delegation, and  this visit was reciprocated by the visit of Andrey Kozyrev,  minister of foreign affairs of the Russian Federation, to  Bratislava.    Mutual working visits by other ministers of the two  countries  were important.    With regard to relations with other CIS republics, no  activities were developed at the highest level and at  ministerial level and no visits at these levels were carried  out. In 1994 it is necessary to reckon with the development of  activities with, in particular, Belarus, Tajikistan, and  Kazakhstan.     "
