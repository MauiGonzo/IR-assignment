In fact it's set fair to return as a diplomatic nightmare as we approach the millennium, thanks to that cause of many past conflicts, oil. A Falkland Islands' councillor, Terry Peck, has just sent an open letter to certain British MPs complaining that the British government has failed to provide a 'letter of comfort' to the oil industry; this would have confirmed to the industry that a Pounds 6m oil exploration survey being conducted around the islands would be just the first step to full exploitation. The letter says: 'The lack of action stems from the reluctance of ministers to face Argentina on this issue. . . . The Argentine government has already written twice to oil companies claiming sovereignty over the areas concerned. Britain has done nothing to counter these claims.' Goodness knows what might happen were oil actually to be found.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.     FKZ  Falkland Islands.   Industries:-  P1311  Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

A British Gas executive yesterday confirmed that 'we have been discussing with YPF a number of possible joint ventures. There is an offering in the South Atlantic and we have discussed the possibility of joining up with YPF, but there is nothing formal yet.' The government plans to sell rights to six blocks in Argentine waters adjacent to Falkland waters. A tender was scheduled for last Wednesday, but YPF requested it be postponed for 90 days after British Gas had asked for more time to analyse technical data. A government official said no other companies were interested in the region because of the dispute with Britain over the Falkland islands. None the less, two companies are carrying out seismic exploration surveys off the Falklands under licences issued by the islands. Buenos Aires is anxious to increase British trade and investment, which it hopes would allay the Falklands' suspicion of Argentina and create commercial ties with Britain that would offset the vociferous pro-Falkland lobby in London.

The talks, expected to last two to three days, are the first formal negotiations on the most challenging and complex issue facing the two sides, apart from the central question of sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. It has long been rumoured that the seabed around the islands holds large oil reserves. However, there has been no exploration in the region since an inconclusive survey in the 1970s. Last year, London authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences, bringing the fraught issue of oil resources to the fore. If oil is found in commercial quantities around the islands, co-operation with Argentina would be essential to develop the reserves. Major gasfields have been found in Argentine waters between Tierra de Fuego and the Falklands, but, so far, little oil has been found. Although both sides will use this week's talks to set out their points of view, issues such as harmonisation of legislation, law enforcement, taxation, environmental policies and the demarcation of zones are yet to be addressed. Inevitably, they will touch either directly or indirectly on the sensitive issue of sovereignty. The islands' councillors have yet to pass any oil legislation. Their laws will depend on the outcome of the talks with Buenos Aires. However, Argentina does not recognise the Falklands' local government.  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Government sources think it unlikely that Argentine interests will end up operating installations on the islands themselves, but believe Argentina's coast could be a logical site for support operations. Preliminary results from seismic surveys conducted last year around the Falklands suggested the possibility of finding oil across a zone 25 per cent larger than the North Sea. The disclosure of Britain's position follows a recent request from Buenos Aires for a meeting of senior foreign ministry officials to discuss joint development of oil resources. London has yet to agree to this meeting. Reaching an oil accord with the UK is Argentina's next important policy objective, but it is unlikely to accept terms that implicitly recognise Britain's sovereignty over the islands. Buenos Aires has used recent talks on fish to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves. British Gas said last year it had discussed joint offshore exploration close to the disputed waters with YPF, Argentina's state-owned oil company. Some Falkland islanders are said to recognise that rapprochement with Argentina would probably be necessary if an oil industry were to be developed. Recent developments come against a background of steadily improving relations between the two former belligerents. A year ago, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, became the first UK cabinet minister to visit Argentina since the 1982 Falkland islands conflict.

Mr Phil Richards of the British Geological Survey, which carried out a seismic survey around the islands this year, said yesterday: 'The potential is good all around the islands. But we will not know exactly how much oil is there until someone starts digging.' The zone around the islands with the type of geological formation most likely to contain oil was 50 per cent larger than the British section of the North Sea, the survey said. But the Foreign Office said any new information could only be preliminary, since full seismic data would only become available next year. It further emphasised that seismic studies in themselves could not ensure the presence of oil. A round of exploratory drilling and more seismic tests were planned. Only after drilling could the presence of oil be guaranteed. Even then, it would be uncertain whether oil was available in commercial quantities, particularly given the difficult conditions in the waters around the islands, whose sovereignty is disputed between Britain and Argentina. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said this year that co-operation on oil exploration with Argentina remained a possibility. Oil company executives have said large-scale investment of oil development in the region would require a more explicit agreement on sovereignty than exists at present.

A British official said negotiators would focus on the next phase of exploration. The Falklands' government plans a second licensing round for seismic explorations beginning in July and running until March 1995. The Falklands selected two companies to carry out initial seismic surveys shortly after the 1992 negotiations failed. Argentina broke off talks after failing to agree on demarcation of Falkland waters bordering its territorial waters. International oil companies say co-operation with Argentina is important, given the need for heavy investments in a disputed zone. A UK official said successful joint management of fish stocks showed the sovereignty dispute could be put aside while both sides pursued practical interests, but Argentina's foreign ministry argues oil is different because it is a non-renewable resource, with important legal and tax ramifications. Both sides fear concessions over oil would imply recognition of the other's sovereignty claim. The Falklands remain a fixation in Argentina, which still claims the islands, despite defeat in the 1982 conflict with Britain. President Carlos Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000.

The job of chief executive of the Falkland Islands government is up for grabs. It pays well - Pounds 50,000 a year - and there are the usual perks, unlimited fishing, rough shooting, free limo etc . . . Ronald Sampson, the boss since April 1989, is leaving when his contract expires. He's returning to the family home at Stratford upon Avon, so far without any other job lined up. Faced with the messy task of untangling 20-odd companies involved in a fishing fiasco, which left the Falkland Islands with losses of some Pounds 25m, he's acquitted himself well. 'We've been scandal-free for five years,' he adds - no mean achievement given the islands' history. Potential replacements will be required to strut their stuff in front of an interviewing board consisting of Sampson; Sukey Cameron, the islands government's London representative; Gordon Jewkes, a former governor; a bod from the Foreign Office; and Paul Stevenson, former Royal Marines' commander. The job involves managing 200 civil servants (10 per cent of the population) and representing the islands in commercial and overseas contexts. It could be a particularly sensitive post given the flurry of excitement over the islands' oil potential, although exploration is unlikely to start before 1995. Sounds like just the sort of challenge for Bob Horton, the deposed boss of British Petroleum, if he were not tied up back home trying to make sure that Britain's railway privatisation runs on time.

Senior Falklands government officials have been told by the Foreign Office that further steps towards developing an oil industry in the area  - such as full-scale exploration  - must await agreement between London and Buenos Aires. However, this initial move, coinciding with the tenth anniversary today of the Argentine invasion of the Falklands, could provoke a strong protest from Argentina, which has been pressing for joint participation with the UK on every stage of the Falklands' oil programme. Its timing also appears to have pre-empted the outcome of the UK general election, which Falkland Islanders fear may lead to a Labour victory and a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty. Surprised foreign ministry officials in Buenos Aires said they had been reassured by the UK there would be no unilateral move on oil. Argentina wants to participate in the seismic studies, which it considers important in establishing the true economic potential of the area. Argentina, which does not recognise the islands' government, claims sovereignty over the surrounding waters. But the Foreign Office in London said that the Falklands government could, under local legislation, exercise rights over the seabed and the subsoil of the continental shelf around the islands. There is widespread speculation in the Falklands and in Buenos Aires that the islands have large oil reserves. A study of their oil potential by a private company in the 1970s has remained a closely guarded secret. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the islands' council, said there was no reason why the Falkland Islands could not go ahead with the studies. He expected seismic studies to be completed by the end of this year and to be in a position to licence blocks for exploration by the middle of 1993. Mr Sampson said local councillors had been 'made aware by the British government' that in the 'longer term there will have to be a much closer co-operation with Argentina in the exploration of oil'. UK-Argentine talks in Buenos Aires in February about oil were inconclusive, but further negotiations are planned for in London in June. The Foreign Office said last night that, given the 'sensitivity' of the oil issue, London and Buenos Aires were remaining in constant contact with each other.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

'We would both like to form a long-term partnership,' said Mr John Bueno, general manager of British Gas Argentina. Such an alliance would, in addition to other projects, seek to explore waters between Argentina and the Falkland Islands. British Gas already has a big presence in Argentina with important stakes in privatised gas distribution and power companies. But Mr Bueno stressed that talks between the companies could go no further until the British and Argentine governments had constructed the political framework within which exploration could proceed. Although Argentina was defeated in the 1982 war over the Falklands, it has not relinquished its claim over the islands, ownership of which was recently enshrined in the constitution.

0,FT931-932 ,"FT931-932 _AN-DC1AGAAVFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / An odd society battles on: David White finds Falkland Islanders an endangered species      By DAVID WHITE   MEASURED by the ratio of military to civilians, the Falkland Islands must have the most heavily defended population on earth. The colony's 2,200 inhabitants, almost all of British descent, barely outnumber the 2,000 UK airmen, soldiers and sailors posted there. Since the 1982 UK-Argentine conflict over the islands, an influx of new blood has reversed the population decline. But numbers have never been much greater than today and as a surge of prosperity based on squid fishery peters out, nothing short of an oil bonanza is likely to change that. The two communities live apart. Most servicemen are housed at Mount Pleasant, a new airfield complex built on a peat bog 35 miles from Stanley, the capital, along a road that (although the islands' best) is only partly tarmac. They are pretty self-sufficient. A sore point, under discussion with local authorities, is that mess kitchens use New Zealand lamb, in a territory whose treeless, wind-battered expanses serve little productive purpose except as grazing for 750,000 sheep. The meat comes by way of Britain, 8,400 miles away, in what is probably the longest voyage ever undertaken by a meat carcase. The thing is that the islands have no EC-standard abattoir and they say they cannot now afford one. Nevertheless, the armed forces are the islands' biggest cash customer, and the biggest tourism earner. They are warmly appreciated. Military flights, which anywhere else might be considered a nuisance, provide reassurance. 'We get complaints when people don't low-fly enough,' says Rear Admiral Neil Rankin, British forces commander. Islanders worry about the improving relations between London and Buenos Aires. The need to co-operate with Argentina, whether on fisheries or on future oil development, is a bitter pill to swallow. The scars from 1982 show no sign of healing. Argentine citizens are still banned. There are no transport connections. The main link to the outside world is the 18-hour, twice-weekly flight to the UK by RAF Tristar. The garrison, with a few Tornado fighters, heavy Hercules aircraft, helicopters and a frigate, is designed to hold the base until reinforcements arrive in a crisis. Running expenses are put at Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year, not counting the pay servicemen would get anyway, nor the cost of the RAF staging post on Ascension Island. In spite of the 'firm and unwavering commitment' pledged during a visit this week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the British defence secretary, the number of military personnel may be reduced. But the islanders' numbers could dwindle, too. Sixth-formers go to the UK; there may be less reason for them to come back. Prospects opened up after the war. Under a programme to bring land into local ownership, farm employee Mr Robin Marsh bought 20,000 acres in West Falkland, the smaller of the two main islands, with 5,000 sheep. But for the past three years, as world wool prices have plummeted, he has depended on support from the Falkland Islands government. This support may now stop. The government tapped unprecedented wealth from a licence regime set up in 1987 for vessels fishing within a 150-mile zone. The boats are mostly squid 'jiggers' from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and southern Europe. Government revenue, previously about Pounds 6m a year from wool tax receipts and UK grand aid, shot up to an unaided Pounds 40m. But last year Argentina launched a rival licence scheme, a move widely seen in the islands as deliberate economic pressure. Argentina is in a powerful position, since the young squid move south to the Falklands through its waters. It agreed with Britain last December to limit this season's number of licences. But the Falklands have slashed their estimate of licence earnings for the financial year just ending from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15m. Next year, government officials say, the planning figure is just Pounds 10m. At the islands' secretariat on Thatcher Drive, Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive, describes it as 'perhaps the greatest reduction in revenue that any country will experience short of having a war.' Public works, including the upgrading of tracks into something resembling proper roads, have run out of money. The good times have nonetheless left their imprint. A new hospital and school have been built. With a gradual migration from 'camp' - the country areas - residents say Stanley has become more bustling and urban. Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles can be spotted among the Land Rovers. Outlying settlements now have telephones and next month should receive television programmes. But where else do the armed forces provide the only television service? Sparseness, Englishness and remoteness make for an odd society. Darts matches and sheepdog trials are covered live on radio. The islands have no cash machine, no Indian restaurant, no illegal drugs and as yet no dole. There are as many species of penguin as pubs. What the islanders are waiting for is offshore oil. Successful exploration has been carried out in nearby Argentine waters. A seismic survey to the south is almost complete. Another has started to the north. Mr Sampson says even getting as far as exploration would bring a dramatic boost in population. Oil could transform the islands. But people are in two minds about the prospect. They value their unspoilt lifestyle. Says Mr Sampson: 'The most endangered species here would be Falkland Islanders.'   Countries:-  FKZ  Falkland Islands.

This is in spite of the fact that the UK continental shelf is now a mature area for oil and gas production. Between this year and 1997 annual spending on existing and new fields should fall by less than Pounds 1bn from this year's level of Pounds 8.5bn, says Scottish Enterprise, the development body, which yesterday published its biennial forecasts for UK and worldwide petroleum activity. The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn. The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices, follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when 214 wells were drilled. Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997. The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997.

The forecasts contrast with those Scottish Enterprise made in 1991, which suggested a rather steeper decline in spending on exploration, development and operations from an all-time peak in 1991. In that year spending in the UK continental shelf was Pounds 9.3bn. The continued high level of development spending, measured in 1993 prices, follows the record levels of exploration and appraisal reached in 1990, when 214 wells were drilled. Only 137 exploration and appraisal wells were started last year and Scottish Enterprise does not expect more than 105 to be drilled each year up to 1997. The study suggests this is partly due to the removal in the March Budget of petroleum revenue tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. About 41 new oil or gas fields are expected to come on stream in the northern North Sea and 29 in the southern sector between 1993 and 1997. But many new fields will use lower-cost subsea technology rather than platforms, while gas will make up an increasing proportion of the new fields coming into production. Oil output is expected to reach almost 2.5m barrels of oil a day in 1995, compared with 2m a day this year. After 1995 output will fall back slightly. About 20 per cent of future commercial fields in the North Sea have been delayed by more than a year because of an abundance of new supplies and weak oil prices, according to Arthur Andersen Petroleum Services.

Eleven years after its defeat in the 74-day conflict with Britain, the country's overriding foreign policy aim is winning sovereignty over the islands. In every important speech, President Carlos Menem makes a ritual reference to Argentina's sovereignty over the Falklands. He claims his policy of rapprochement - rather than confrontation - with Britain will enable Argentina to 'recover' sovereignty over the islands by 2000. Mr Menem said: 'We will continue talking. In the world of diplomacy one needs great patience. There is no possibility of taking this conflict over the Falklands to a situation similar to 1982.' His aim is to draw the UK into as close a relationship as possible. Stronger trade and investment links with Argentina would gradually reduce the importance of the Falklands to Britain. Eventually, London will have sufficient confidence in Argentina to consider transferring sovereignty. Several British companies already operate privatised utilities in Argentina. But instead of receding, the Falklands question remains an open sore in bilateral relations. Argentina continually presses for greater involvement in developing the natural resources. In 1991 the UK agreed to co-operate to conserve fisheries. Last year Argentina began to issue fishing licences, muscling in on the main source of revenue. Ordinary Argentines are frustrated that Mr Menem's policy has still not led to any talks over the crucial issue of sovereignty. London has remained unyielding in its insistence that co-operation with Argentina does not imply any recognition of its claim to the islands. The UK foreign office says this policy will change only if and when the islands' fewer than 2,000 inhabitants agree to a change in their status. Last month, Argentina suffered another diplomatic slap in the face when Britain announced it would extend territorial waters to 200 miles around the remote and uninhabited South Georgia and South Sandwich island groups, which Argentina also claims. Oil is emerging as another source of friction. The Falklands are believed to have big oil and gas deposits and Argentina wants to tie Britain into a joint oil regime. London has ignored Argentina's arguments, and last year licensed two companies to carry out seismic exploration in two blocks around the islands. Britain refuses to discuss oil co-operation until studies confirm the region does have hydrocarbon reserves in commercial quantities. There is scant chance of a shift in the islanders' virulently anti-Argentine attitudes. Memories of Argentina's three-month military occupation remain fresh. And Britain has still not lifted its arms embargo on Argentina. London has also successfully persuaded Washington not to sell two squadrons of ageing Skyhawk fighter bombers to Argentina. However, talks are planned later this year to resume training courses for Argentine officers at British military academies.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The British Geological Survey, which advises the island's government, said its reading of preliminary data from the two surveys suggested the region had a good potential for finding oil. Confirmation, however, would require exploratory drilling. Mr Nigel Fannin, principal geologist in the survey's petroleum geology group, based in Edinburgh, said the data suggested a sedimentary basin of potential oil-bearing rocks of 200,000 sq km around the island, compared with 160,000 sq km of such formations in the British North Sea. 'We have been very encouraged by what we have seen,' he added. The two seismic surveys concentrated on areas to the south, west and the north of the islands, where the water is shallower than to the east. Mr Fannin said the rocks and geological formations both appeared similar to those of the North Sea. Other conditions would also be similar: the water was 500 metres deep or less, and the sea state and weather would be similar to that experienced in the northern zones of the North Sea. However, Britain's Foreign Office played down the significance of the findings. It said full seismic data would only become available next year and many further steps would be needed before it was known whether commercial quantities of oil existed. Mr Fannin said the data should be complete by early next year, and the survey expected to be in a position to advise the island government on licensing for exploratory drilling by next summer. A licensing regime has yet to be established and remains a sensitive issue, with the sovereignty of the islands still disputed between Britain and Argentina.

He stressed that the supply sector of the oil exploration industry needed time to adjust to the new tax regime through the provision of a 'meaningful transitional arrangement'. Mr Knapman, speaking during the resumed committee stage of the Finance Bill, suggested that it should be possible to devise a 'fiscally neutral' scheme. Earlier Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, defended the decision of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, not to consult the industry in advance about the changes. Mr Alistair Darling, chief Labour spokesman in the debate, said the disruption caused to the industry by the chancellor's sudden announcement could result in the loss of between 10,000 and 30,000 jobs. He accepted that there was scope for adjusting petroleum revenue tax, and possibly for limiting the allowances that could be claimed in connection with exploration, providing the changes were phased in and permitted transitional relief. Mr Malcolm Bruce, for the Liberal Democrats, said his party would support a Labour amendment to provide transitional relief. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco. The move effectively takes Sun out of North Sea exploration although the company retains some producing assets.

0,FT941-6551 ,"FT941-6551 _AN-ECAD7AFPFT 940301   FT  01 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway desperate to head off slide in oil output      By KAREN FOSSLI      OSLO   Norway's Labour government is proposing a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities and stem a steep decline in crude oil production after 1996. The country is western Europe's biggest oil producer with daily output of 2.4m barrels, and is the fourth biggest crude oil exporter in the world. Oil companies argue the best way to boost activities is to ease the stringent tax regime. But in a White Paper presented last Friday to the Storting, Norway's parliament, the controversial tax issue went unmentioned. In the White Paper, the government recommended that exploration acreage be expanded by 16 per cent and rules for exploring in the Barents Sea be reformed to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries. A number of proposals were made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Environmentalists and fisherman fiercely oppose the move to expand exploration to the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern coast of Norway, and to new areas of the Norwegian Sea, off the coast of mid-Norway. Under the proposals, in the Skagerrak, just four exploration wells will be allowed to be drilled; only one rig will be allowed to work in the area at a time; and, drilling during the summer - peak harvest season for prawns - has been ruled out. In the Norwegian Sea, six wells will be allowed in the Nordland VI area during a limited period of the year with just one rig operating at a time. In the Barents Sea, where 52 wells have so far failed to yield any commercial discoveries, changes to licensing conditions have been proposed to cut the cost of exploring there. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only will output decline dramatically in two years time, from a peak of 2.6m barrels a day, but the country is also faced with stiffer competition for oil company investment. Last year Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat exploration wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. . . an 'unsatisfactory result', says the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, and far less than in the previous two years. Investment in the petroleum sector is forecast to fall dramatically in two years from about NKr60bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in 1993 unless new oil fields are discovered. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing 40m tonnes for those now being developed. Blocks located within the new acreage are to be offered for licence application by the beginning of next year, with award by the start of 1996. This timetable, says the government, could enable development to commence by 2005 with first production in 2010.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.

Before the signing ceremony, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  met with representatives of the five overseas firms: the Italian  Agip, the French Elf, the Japanese Energy Corporation, the  Japanese Petroleum Exploration Company and Texaco of the U.S.A.    The contract is the second one on petroleum prospecting and  exploration in the Tarim Basin. It is also the second one in  China's world-wide public tendering for cooperation in  exploiting China's land oil.    Under the new contract, the foreign firms will for the next  eight years shoulder all the expenses and risks in prospecting;  when oil and gas fields are found, the two sides will jointly  invest in exploration and production, and share the crude oil in  proportions laid down by the contract.    It is learned that since March 1 last year, when the China  National Petroleum Corporation opened the first round of public  tendering for the project, 68 corporations from 17 countries had  applied for the tendering documents and 54 of them had sent  representatives to Beijing to study relevant materials.    The south-eastern area of the Tarim Basin open for  cooperation consists of five sectors covered mainly by sand.     "

This is the first contract for foreign cooperation in  petroleum exploration and development in the Tarim Basin, and  the first contract reached through open bidding for petroleum  cooperation on the China mainland.    Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum and  Natural Gas Corporation, said the signing of the Tarim petroleum  contract by China, the U.S. and Japan not only represents the  new era for the input of foreign funds and technology into the  exploration and development of petroleum in Tarim, but it also  signals the arrival of a new era for the Chinese petroleum  industry and of fully opening up to the outside world.    State Council Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, and Tomur Dawamat,  Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing  Committee, attended the signing ceremony. Before the ceremony,  Vice Premier Zou Jiahua and Vice Chairman Tomur Dawamat met with  the three representatives who signed the contract.    The area of the southwestern Tarim Basin scheduled for  foreign cooperative development is located within the boundary  of Qiemo County in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and  covers an area of 14,475.4 square kilometers. This February,  with the approval of the State Council, the southwestern part of  the Tarim Basin was designated a new area for expanding foreign  cooperation in petroleum development on the China mainland.  Public bidding began on 1 March, and 68 corporations from 17  countries responded with bids, some of whom made on-site  inspections of the subject area. By the end of October, the  various bidding organizations had delivered their bids and  planning documents to the China National Petroleum and Natural  Gas Corporation. After careful consideration the U.S.  corporation was the first organization invited for contract  negotiations, and an agreement was reached after numerous  discussions.    It is understood that the form of the contract signed on 20  December is consistent with the terms used in all Chinese  offshore and mainland cooperative endeavors. During the  eight-year prospecting period, the foreign parties will bear all  prospecting expenses and risks, and when oil and gas fields are  found, both parties will jointly fund development and  production, and will divide the crude oil produced in accordance  with the stipulations of the contract. China will observe the  international market price structure, and use U.S. dollars to  buy the oil apportioned to the foreign participants that is  taken from the Tarim area. This will dispel any misgivings the  foreign interests may have about shipping crude oil out of that  area.     "

Natural gas reserves rose from 136.7 billion to 137  billion cubic meters, an increase of only 0.2 percent.    By reaching the level of 3.8 billion barrels (a figure  representing what it will be possible to produce), Brazil is  guaranteed a petroleum supply for 16 years if no more is  discovered and if it continues to extract an average of 700,000  barrels per day, as it is doing today.    If that conservative scenario holds up, the figures are  quite  comfortable compared to those in other countries. Although  worldwide reserves (1 trillion barrels) are sufficient for 43  years, their distribution is less comfortable for some  countries. The United Kingdom has enough petroleum for 5.9  years' worth of consumption, and the United States has enough  for 9.8 years, according to Dimas Jose Simoes, deputy  superintendent of operations in the Petrobras Department of  Exploration.    The fact is that petroleum reserves are concentrated in a  small group of countries. Ninety percent of the world's  petroleum reserves are owned by only 12 countries (most of them  in the Middle East). Brazil, which possesses 0.4 percent of the  total, is in 20th place. And 54.1 percent of the world's natural  gas reserves, which total 138 trillion cubic meters, is in the  Commonwealth of Independent States (the former Soviet Union) and  Iran. In this case, Brazil occupies a modest 40th place.    Petrobras's plans for increasing Brazilian petroleum  reserves  call for investments on the order of $700 million annually in  1994 and 1995, according to Celso Lucchesi, the firm's  superintendent of exploration. Petrobras expects to add 350  million barrels per year through 1997.    In 1992, for example, when the proven reserves in 234  countries rose by 2 billion barrels, Brazil added 830 million,  or over half the worldwide volume [as published]. This was  achieved thanks mainly to Petrobras investments beginning in the  mid-1980's in the deep waters of the Campos Basin, where the  company discovered the giant Marlim, Albacora, and Barracuda  fields. In 1992, when worldwide investments in exploration  totaled $11.6 billion, Petrobras invested $680 million, the  equivalent of about 6 percent of that total.    Potential    According to Simoes, the 3.8 billion barrels of proven  reserves may increase to 8.8 billion. The difference between the  two figures (5 billion barrels) represents petroleum that has  been discovered but whose volume has not been verified, a  process that will require additional exploration investments  beyond those already made.    Petrobras also has a third figure reflecting ""petroleum  potential"": 18 billion barrels of oil equivalent (including, in  this case, petroleum and natural gas).     "

Depending on the location of the drilling activities, the mixture of used oil and crude oil may need to be transported (by vessel, truck, rail, etc.) to a separate location for introduction into the pipeline or the petroleum refining facility. In the case of off-shore drilling sites for example, conveyance of the mixture may involve multiple modes of transportation (i.e., from the off-shore platform to land by vessel or pipeline and then to the crude oil pipeline by land-based transport). Today's exemption covers all modes of transportation of mixtures of used oil and crude or natural gas liquids, as long as the mixture contains less than 1% used oil and is destined for insertion into a petroleum refining facility process at a point prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. In addition, today's exemption covers storage of mixtures of used oil and crude oil, provided that the mixture contains less than 1% used oil and is inserted into a petroleum refining facility process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking.     Used oil that is generated at exploration and production sites continues to be subject to used oil generator standards prior to being mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under today's rule. Used oil that is generated off-site and transported to or stored at an exploration and production site is subject to the transporter and transfer facility standards, as applicable, up until the point at which the used oil is mixed with crude oil such that it is exempt under 279.10(g)(2).     EPA is exempting mixtures of used oil and crude oil held in discrete units at a refinery or at remote locations because the Agency understands that the amount of used oil contained in these mixtures is extremely small relative to the large quantities of crude oil. In developing today's rule, EPA held numerous discussions with petroleum refinery industry representatives regarding the maximum amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil that are destined for insertion into a petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. Industry representatives repeatedly informed the Agency that used oil constitutes less than 1% of these mixtures. In gathering information for today's rule, EPA held conference calls with representatives from a number of petroleum refining companies (e.g., Mobil Oil Corporation and Phillips Petroleum Inc.,). The Agency also conducted several site visits, including visits to an Amoco refinery in Whiting, Indiana and a Mobil Oil Corporation refinery in Paulsboro, New Jersey. In each case, EPA was informed that used oil does not currently, and will not comprise greater than 1% of the crude oil/used oil mixture because of the sheer volumes of crude oil that are continuously being produced and processed relative to the amount of used oil that is generated at production sites or refineries. This recent information is consistent with comments submitted in response to the 1985 Used Oil Proposed Rule in which Exxon Company, USA stated that the average percentage of used oil in refinery feed stock streams is less than 0.02% and Texaco, Inc., indicated that used oil would constitute no more than 0.01% of the refinery input.     EPA does not believe it is necessary to apply the used oil management standards to the less than 1% fraction of used oil that is being held temporarily in discrete units or transported from those units to the pipeline or the petroleum refinery for recycling as part of a mixture that is composed overwhelmingly of crude oil. In essence, because of the high ratio of crude oil to used oil, EPA considers the mixture to be equivalent to crude oil for regulatory purposes. EPA's part 279 standards were designed to control those particular risks associated with the management of used oil (e.g., uncontrolled burning, improper storage practices by used oil handlers) pursuant to section 3014 of RCRA.     The reason for EPA's imposition of a 1% limit on the amount of used oil contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil being stored or transported to a crude oil pipeline or petroleum refinery prior to insertion into the refining process is that, while we have determined that the small amounts of used oil that are being added to crude oil under current practices pose no incremental risk over normal crude oil, we have not evaluated whether larger amounts of used oil also pose no incremental risk. Given the information provided to EPA by the petroleum refining industry regarding the inherent limitations on the amount of used oil that is or should be contained in mixtures of used oil and crude oil (i.e., less than 1%), and given that EPA has received no information, either recently, or in response to previous rulemakings that provides basis for an alternative limit, the Agency sees no point in imposing a higher cap. Imposition of a higher cap could have the effect of encouraging mixing of used oil with crude oil that would not otherwise occur during the normal course of petroleum refining operations. Such an incentive might lead to increased incremental risk from management of large amounts of used oil, exempt from the part 279 standards, at petroleum refineries. EPA also concluded that a less precise limit (i.e., ``    de minimis    '' or ``small amounts''), as was suggested by some commenters from the petroleum refining industry, would needlessly cause uncertainty, given that EPA was told repeatedly that amounts currently introduced are far less than 1%.

Imposition of a higher cap could have the effect of encouraging mixing of used oil with crude oil that would not otherwise occur during the normal course of petroleum refining operations. Such an incentive might lead to increased incremental risk from management of large amounts of used oil, exempt from the part 279 standards, at petroleum refineries. EPA also concluded that a less precise limit (i.e., ``    de minimis    '' or ``small amounts''), as was suggested by some commenters from the petroleum refining industry, would needlessly cause uncertainty, given that EPA was told repeatedly that amounts currently introduced are far less than 1%.

0,FT944-6105 ,"FT944-6105 _AN-EK3EKAIWFT 941130   FT  30 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan sets out its stall for oil investment - Efforts to present a more welcoming aspect to foreign companies      By FARHAN BOKHARI   Pakistan will try to attract new British investments in the petroleum sector this week, stressing the benefits to investors of the country's recent reforms. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, opens a Pakistan investment conference in London today at which investors in various sectors, including petroleum, will be urged to step forward with new investment plans. Among the important developments in the petroleum sector this year, the government has committed itself to processing all requests for exploration from foreign companies within three months. Previously it could take more than two years before a company was granted an exploration licence. Foreign investors have also been assured full freedom to repatriate capital and profits, and will be allowed full ownership of local companies. Pakistan has an important stake in the success of this effort, in particular for the improvement of its balance of trade. Last year, the country imported oil worth over USDollars 1.8bn, about a sixth of its total import bill. It requires up to 280,000 barrels of oil a day but produces just under 60,000. Aside from encouraging investors to become more active in exploration, new agreements have been signed recently for the setting up of six new oil refineries. At present Pakistan has capacity to refine up to 140,000 barrels a day at three plants. These plants, however, are in need of large scale repairs and modernisation, senior officials say. The government estimates that it will receive investments worth over Dollars 1.9bn for oil refineries from private investors by the end of this decade. Its optimism over the success of its effort is based largely on estimates of over 197m barrels of crude oil in reserves. These are mainly located in the south-western province of Baluchistan and the southern province of Sindh. 'We hope to further accelerate these activities,' says Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, minister for petroleum and natural resources. 'We take weeks in taking a decision rather than years,' he says, adding that the new measures have given fresh encouragement to oil companies. Mr Khan is encouraged by recent agreements with Occidental Petroleum and Union Texas to drill more exploratory wells. He expects Shell and Omani oil company also to be given exploration licences and claims that in addition to the 18 foreign oil companies doing business in Pakistan, at least 30 more have shown an interest in examining the possibilities of exploratory work. The petroleum minister is convinced that developments in this sector will be crucial for the success of the country's effort to set up new power generation plants, especially oil-fired thermal units. 'With the setting up of all these thermal units, you'll need a lot of oil' he says. Despite the government's commitment, some analysts are still nervous over possible setbacks. Concern is running high that law and order problems could affect the work of oil companies, especially in remote parts of Sindh and Baluchistan. These could include armed robberies and demands for huge pay-offs from tribal chiefs before allowing exploration work to begin. Recent reports that the government of Baluchistan and the federal government in Islamabad have still not agreed on important issues, such as the division of royalties, has added to such concerns. Mr Khan denies, however, that there are any disagreements. Nevertheless, Mr Wazir Ahmed Jogezai, a former deputy speaker of the parliament in Islamabad and a politician from Baluchistan, warns that such 'bottlenecks' must be removed before the new incentives can succeed. 'The foreign investor has got to be given an assured law and order situation. What would you do in the wilderness of Baluchistan if you have an area and you can't really get in there?' he asks.

0,FT931-1493 ,"FT931-1493 _AN-DCXCKAAHFT 930324   FT  24 MAR 93 / N Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change      By DAVID GARDNER      BRUSSELS   AMERADA HESS, one of the most active companies in North Sea oil exploration, has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year and cut jobs because of tax changes an-nounced in the Budget last week. The company, which will be one of the hardest hit in the North Sea by proposed rules on petroleum revenue tax, said it would also pull out of many applications for government licences to explore in the UK. 'This is not an idle threat, we are doing what is necessary to survive,' said Mr Sam Laidlaw, managing director of Amerada, the UK arm of the international US oil company. Mr Laidlaw said that, even with its plans to cut exploration by 50 per cent, its profit level will still suffer. Last week, Mr Norman Lamont announced that the rate of petroleum revenue tax for existing fields in the North Sea will be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. But more importantly, for companies such as Amerada, he abolished PRT relief on the costs of oil exploration and appraisal. North Sea operators estimate that the cost of exploring will quadruple as a result of the Budget changes. Mr Harold Hughes, head of the UK Offshore Operators' Association, said: 'The proposals represent a major disincentive to future exploration activity which is the life blood of the North Sea.' A group of oil experts including several exploration directors of leading oil companies have written to newspapers denouncing the chancellor's tax changes. Amerada said the new regime would cut profits from Pounds 2 a barrel to 10p a barrel for a small discovery such as its Angus field, estimated to contain 10m barrels of oil. 'The profit under the old regime was pretty small. No one would contemplate developing a field for 10p a barrel and this is the future life-blood of the North Sea,' Mr Laidlaw said. The new UK regime would make Norway and Australasia more attractive prospects. The company is considering job cuts in its exploration department and laying off two rigs which it had contracted. Mr Laidlaw estimated that the industry could lose several thousand jobs in the short term and more over the longer term as a result of the new PRT rules. Mr Laidlaw said Amerada would pull out of applications it had already made to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to drill some North Sea blocks. Mr Richard Hardman, Amerada's exploration director, said the company would probably drill four wells next year as opposed to eight or 10 under the existing tax regime. Overall, he estimated that companies would drill 80 to 100 wells in the North Sea this year compared with 130 last year. The DTI is expected to announce results of the 14th licensing round in May. Applicant companies must commit to drill a certain number of wells within a particular time - since these will now not be eligible for tax relief, many companies are reassessing their commitments. Mr Laidlaw is lobbying for changes in the PRT proposals, arguing that only one or two large companies in the North Sea would be net beneficiaries of the new rules.

Addressing the China petroleum investment conference which  opened here today, he said China ""offers much scope for oil  exploration and development"" and has ""bright prospects for  economic growth and the growth of the oil sector.""    Therefore, he said, China ""has a strong interest in helping  to maintain a reasonable level of oil prices, which will  encourage further investment.""    The China petroleum investment conference, attended by a  total of 329 delegates from 183 well-known multinational oil  companies, banks and financial organizations and China's oil  industry, is the highest-ranking international oil forum ever  held in the country.    The delegates were expected to discuss issues concerning  joint and cooperative exploration and development of China's oil  and natural gas resources during the two-day conference.    Addressing the opening, Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), spelt out China's  strategy to develop its oil industry.    He said China has opened its petroleum industry to the  outside world and thus provided more opportunities to foreign  investors.    He added that China welcomes world investors to cooperate in  China's petroleum industry.    Sheng Huaren, president of the China Petrochemical  Corporation (Sinopec), Wang Yan, president of the China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), and Zheng Dunxun, president of  the China Chemical Import and Export Corporation (Sinochem),  spoke on the development trends in China's oil and petrochemical  industries.    Also present at the meeting were Omani Deputy Minister of  Petroleum and Minerals Salem Shaban.    The conference, sponsored by the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, CNPC,  Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem, is designed to provide a forum for  oil companies and financial institutions both in and outside  China to increase understanding and exchange information.

This information has been  confirmed.    According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep  as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that  found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of  approximately 2,500 meters.    The exploration activity is being carried out under the  terms  of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm,  which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains  risk contracts with several foreign firms.    The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed  by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled  could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has  been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to  evaluate the magnitude of the deposit.    According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in  quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10  and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil  discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore,  it will be less difficult to refine.    Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11  of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in  February 1993.    Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French  Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and  exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters.    Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating  under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four  of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee  that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon  quota of crude oil.    In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban  marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign  companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the  country at international market prices if they so decide. Also,  no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to  sell the product overseas.    According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the  foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and  technical means for oil exploration in an established area and  agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered.    According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry,  seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in  the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus  operates.    Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological  terms have been found in this area. These structures are  considered very favorable for petroleum deposits.    Information available in the foreign companies' zone of  operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy  crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at  present), but also light crude.    Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons.  Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons.  This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the  production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.     "

Demonstration That Recovered Oil Meets Conditions of Exclusion      Under 261.2(f), persons claiming that recovered oil is excluded from the definition of solid waste bear the burden of proof in enforcement actions to demonstrate that they qualify for the exclusion. This would normally require some type of demonstration that the recovered oil is going to be and actually is used in a petroleum refining operation prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. For on-site sources, this documentation could be entries in the operating records of the facility showing where the oil is recovered and where it re-enters the refining process. For off-site sources, this demonstration is especially important. Adequate documentation could entail     bona fide     contractual agreements with other facilities to take the recovered oil, shipping or delivery records to the receiving facility, or other similar records. These records are important to show enforcement personnel that the conditions of the exclusion have been met. Without this documentation, the burden of proof will ordinarily not be satisfied because enforcement personnel will have no way of verifying that the recovered oil actually was used in the refining process and the assumption can be made that the oil was not reused, and was instead sent off-site or managed on-site as a hazardous waste.      IX. Examples of How Today's Rule Operates      Example 1      Petroleum refinery A generates wastewater. As part of primary wastewater treatment, it skims oil from the wastewater. This operation occurs in wastewater treatment tanks. The skimmed oil is then gathered and inserted directly into crude oil storage units for insertion into the refining process.  The refinery process wastewater is still considered to be a solid waste, notwithstanding that some oil is skimmed from it. The wastewater treatment tanks used for treating the wastewater are exempt from subtitle C regulation. Section 264.1(g)(6), 265.1(c)(10). The skimmed oil is recovered oil that is excluded from being a solid waste under today's regulation because it originates from petroleum refining, it is not land disposed before being recycled, and it is returned to the designated part of the petroleum refining process. (This answer assumes that the recovered oil is not being accumulated speculatively.)      Example 2      Same facts as Example 1, except that the skimmed oil requires processing in the plant's slop oil system. This process involves demulsifying and separation via chemical addition, thermal treatment, and gravity separation.  Same answer as in Example 1. It should also be noted that water and solids from the slop oil system can be wastes, and if hazardous, can be subject to Subtitle C regulation once they are removed from the slop oil tank.      Example 3        Same facts as Example 1, except that the source of the recovered oil is a petrochemical plant wastewater treatment system.  The oil is not excluded from being a solid waste under today's rule because it does not come from petroleum refining, exploration or production operations.        Example 4        Facility B recovers oil from spills at exploration and production operations. The oil is trucked to a tank, where separation occurs. The separated oil is put into a pipeline for ultimate insertion into crude oil storage units at a petroleum refinery.    The oil recovered from the spills is excluded from being a solid waste. It is a type of recovered oil, and is excluded because it originates from exploration and production activities, is not land disposed or accumulated speculatively, and is inserted into a refining process.        Example 5        Facility C is a bulk petroleum storage facility. Oil spilled from its product storage tanks is too contaminated to be directly used as product. The oil is sent back to a refinery where it is placed in a slop oil system and returned to the refining process.  The spilled oil is excluded from being a solid waste, not under today's rule, but under 261.33 (and 261.2 Table 1) because it is a commercial chemical product that is being recycled rather than abandoned. (EPA interprets this principle to apply to commercial chemical products that exhibit characteristics as well as those listed in 261.33. 50 FR 14219 (April 11, 1985).) (This answer assumes that the oil is recovered promptly and that the spills do not create permanent land disposal units. See 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990).)

More than 20 MPs gathered at a meeting organised by Mr Cranley Onslow, former chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, to hear complaints from the oil industry that it was already losing contracts as a result of the government's decision. In the Budget Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, announced an end to oil companies' rights to set their exploration costs against their total petroleum revenue tax bill. The effect will be to increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West who attended the meeting, said: 'Our intention is to convince the government that damage is already being done to all sorts of industries as a result of what is going on.' During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill Ms Harriet Harman, shadow Treasury spokesperson, said that the government's claim that it was helping those on lower incomes by widening the 20 per cent band on income tax was bogus.

Mr Ken Derr, Chevron's chairman, said that 500 of the 2,500 jobs being eliminated related to a decision to downsize the company's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. The refinery represents about 20 per cent of Chevron's total petroleum refining capacity and its partial or full closure has been under review for some time. Mr Derr said the company would focus on reducing operating costs. He said low natural gas prices, poor refining margins, the recession and reduced demand for petroleum products had hampered Chevron's financial results. Mr Derr said a final decision on Port Arthur would be made later this year. Among the options is a complete shut down except for chemicals manufacturing  -this would cut about 1,600 jobs. At a minimum the refinery will cut capacity by a third to 200,000 barrels a day. The other 2,000 Chevron jobs will be eliminated by way of voluntary early retirement, organisational changes and asset sales. Mr Derr said that Dollars 185m of the Dollars 270m fourth-quarter after-tax charges would relate to the Port Arthur refinery. If the refinery is shut down Chevron would incur an additional Dollars 200m charge. Mr Derr announced plans to accelerate Chevron's programme to sell off more of its non-strategic US oil and gas fields. He said new US environmental regulations contained in the Clean Air Act would lead to costs of more than Dollars 2bn over the next five years at Chevron's eight US refineries. The Chevron chief said the company's 1992 capital and exploration budget would total Dollars 5.3bn, 6 per cent higher than last year. In the third quarter of 1991 Chevron's net profit fell by 22 per cent to Dollars 313m. Deliveries of petroleum products in the US - an important measure of demand  -declined by 2 per cent in 1991, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API). The industry association said that oil's share of domestic US energy consumption fell to less than 41 per cent in 1991, it lowest level in 40 years. Mr Edward Murphy, API's finance director, said the statistics gathered for last year indicate 'that the exploration and production sectors of the petroleum industry in the US have entered a period of accelerated decline, while there is accelerated growth overseas'.

The government signed 22 production sharing contracts with oil companies in 1991, up from 14 in each of the previous two years, and the report estimates a further 15 could be signed this year. However, only 123 exploration wells drilled last year, 38.5 per cent below the number forecast by Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company. Actual exploration and development expenditure by oil companies was Dollars 1.875bn, significantly lower than the Dollars 2.27bn budgeted. The report cautions that oil companies are farming out exploration in frontier areas, where the cost of a wildcat well exceeds Dollars 30m, in order to limit exposure. Pertamina forecasts that oil companies' exploration expenditure will reach Dollars 2.84bn this year, although the report says the softness of the oil market may lead to 'some erosion in budgeted outlays'. The report estimates Indonesia's crude and condensate production in 1991 at 1.592m barrels a day, dropping to 1.53m b/d in the first quarter of this year. Exports in 1991 averaged 905,000 b/d, of which 44 per cent went to Japan and 11 per cent to the US. The value of Indonesia's oil and condensate exports last year totalled Dollars 6.4bn, down from Dollars 8.75bn in 1990. Indonesia also produced 22m tonnes of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for 38 per cent of world production. All production was exported, with Japan accounting for 80 per cent, South Korea 13 per cent and Taiwan 7 per cent. LNG exports in 1991 were valued at Dollars 4.04bn.

President Carlos Menem cancelled plans to attend a military parade, apparently for fear of being jeered by pro-military right wingers. He chose to attend Mass at the national shrine of Lujan. However, former combatants invited to join the president boycotted the service, claiming he was using it for political purposes. The bishop officiating at Mass said the invasion was to 'safeguard constitutional order.' Mr Menem said: 'Today is a day of reflection and homage to all those who fell defending national territory.' The only military parade was held in the Patagonian city of Ro Gallegos, 2,100 km south of Buenos Aires and on the same latitude as Port Stanley, the Falklands capital. There, Mr Antonio Gonzalez, defence minister, said Argentina would eventually win sovereignty over the islands through 'tireless diplomatic efforts.' Meanwhile, the UK embassy in Buenos Aires denied that the islands' government would issue seismic survey licences for oil exploration, as announced by the chief executive of the Falklands government this week. 'The British government is committed to giving no surprises and intends to stick to this,' an official said. The islands have legislation enabling them to market exploration licences, but rules are still being studied in London and will only be enacted after consultation with Argentina.

Mr Alvaro Teixeira, Secretary General of the Association of Latin American State Petroleum companies, said yesterday that new investments in exploration and production between 1992 and 1996 are likely to total Dollars 75bn, an annual average of Dollars 18.75bn, not including the petrochemical sector. This compares with Dollars 8bn invested in 1990 and Dollars 9bn last year. The major part will come from Venezuela, the region's biggest producer, which is embarking on a series of joint ventures, followed by Mexico and Brazil, which has an ambitious programme to become self-sufficient by 1994. Latin America has the world's second largest oil reserves after the Middle East and is at present responsible for 12 per cent of global production. According to Mr Teixeira the new investment drive will increase the region's production from 7.4m barrels per day to 10m b/d by the end of the decade. He said: 'Latin American reserves have increased 600 per cent over the last 25 years - more than any other region in the world. The potential of new discoveries is still very high because the area is still little explored'. Mr Teixeira described the petroleum sector as 'one of the engines of growth of Latin America', which could 'benefit greatly from the region's re-entry into the international financial community'. He said it could be an essential tool for integration, adding that several countries including Brazil and Mexico were negotiating with Cuba for offshore exploration rights and shared use of terminals and refineries.

The Deputy Director, Xie Zhiqiang, of the Tarim Petroleum  Prospecting and Development Directorate, announced that during  four years of prospecting in northern and central Tarim,  covering an area of over 30,000 square kilometers, over 95,000  kilometers of two-dimensional digital seismic prospecting, and  2,200 kilometers of three-dimensional prospecting have been  completed, 169 exploratory wells have been drilled, totalling  970,000 meters of drilling footage, and industrial-grade oil and  gas flows have been found at 81 wells. Six oil fields that have  been confirmed or basically confirmed and ready for exploitation  are the Lunnan, Sangtamu, Donghetang, Jilake, Jiefang Qudong,  and Tazhong-4 oil fields. Three hundred million tons of oil  reserves and about 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas  reserves are basically confirmed and under control. What is  especially satisfying is that the Tazhong-4 oil field, which has  130 million tons of reserves, has the resources to assure the  construction of a 5-million ton crude oil production capability.  This year, the Tazhong-10 and Tazhong-6 wells have each produced  high-output flows of oil and gas, demonstrating that central  Tarim is an area of large-sized oil fields.    Important gains have also been made in development and  construction. Construction of crude oil production capabilities  of 1.4 million tons was begun at Lunnan, Sangtamu, and Jiefang  Qudong oil fields last year. The production capacity of  Donghetang oil field was expanded from 750,000 tons to 2.15  million tons last year. One hundred and sixty five kilometers of  the 230-kilometer Taklimakan desert highway have been completed,  and it is expected to be open to the Tazhong-4 oil field by the  end of June next year; 140 kilometers of the oil-field pipeline  have also been completed this year.    Petroleum exploration will be further accelerated during the  next three years. It is estimated that by 1995 confirmed and  controlled petroleum geology reserves will be 800 million tons,  and in 1996 the annual output of crude oil will be 5 million  tons.    The US$500 million loaned by the Xinjiang Branch of the Bank  of China for petroleum exploration and development in Tarim will  be used over the next two years to buy facilities, precision  instruments, and desert transportation vehicles needed for the  oil field.

It was the third agreement in a month by a foreign oil group to take all the risks in developing new fields since shortage of cash forced the government to stop taking majority stakes in exploration joint ventures. After initial resistance to the terms offered by Nigeria's ruling transitional council this year, the foreign oil companies are falling into line following last month's signing by Royal Dutch/Shell and Elf of France. Exxon of the US is to sign a similar deal on Friday. The contract marks the return of BP to active exploration in Nigeria after an absence since 1979, when its Nigerian assets were nationalised. It was welcomed by Mr Philip Asiodu, the oil minister, who said at the signing in Lagos: 'We are all sorry that matters political led to a rupture'. The structure is estimated to hold reserves of at least 250m barrels and could have as much as 1bn barrels. BP-Statoil will pay a signature bonus of USDollars 42m and are committed to investing a minimum of Dollars 65m over the next six years. Seismic tests will begin this year and the first discovery is expected by the end of 1994. Mr Asiodu said that Nigerian law would be amended by August to allow more favourable terms for the increased risk taken by foreign oil companies in the new contracts. For deep offshore exploration the petroleum profit tax will be cut to 50 per cent, the investment tax credit will be 50 per cent and royalties to NNPC, the state-owned petroleum corporation, will be on a sliding scale from 16 per cent to zero, according to depth. Similar amendments will be made to terms for contracts covering onshore blocks. The BP-Statoil alliance, established more than two and a half years ago, expects to complete negotiations next year with authorities in Azerbaijan on terms and conditions to develop the Chirakh oil field, according to the chief executives of the respective companies, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Speaking in Stavanger at a briefing on the alliance's development, Mr David Simon of BP and Mr Harald Norvik of Statoil agreed that significant results had been achieved by the two companies in a very short time but recognised that its true test would be to bring production on stream with a resonable return on investment in the various areas where it was operating. Mr John Brown, BP vice-president of exploration and development, said the Chirakh development could need investment amounting to 'several tens of billions of kroner' but he would not be drawn on specific figures, which could be sensitive in current negotiations. The alliance believes the Chirakh field holds at least 1bn barrels of oil. The two companies aim to bring it on stream by the end of 1997 with output of about 200,000 barrels a day. In March, the alliance delivered results of a development study for Chirakh to Socar, the Azerbaijani state oil company, and also results of a study on the prospects of exploring for oil and gas in the Shak Deniz area, in the southern part of the Caspian Sea. Elsewhere in the South Caspian Sea, the BP/Statoil alliance is participating in a licence operated by Amoco, which has commenced negotiations on obtaining a production sharing agreement. Next month it aims to bring on stream non-productive wells in western Siberia that it has rehabilitated.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.     Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.     Statoil.

Mr Satish Sharma, energy minister, said a sharp increase in exploration was needed to cope with India's fast-expanding energy demand, which is growing at 8-10 per cent a year. At present about Dollars 1.4bn is spent each year on exploration and development. The scale of the task is such that the government is seeking large foreign involvement in the oil industry, which until recently had been the sole preserve of India's two big state-owned oil companies. The government has opened a new licensing round, in which it hopes that medium-sized western oil companies will take part. Mr Sharma, who is on a world tour to promote the round, said he was aware of past accusations that India was withholding the best acreage for domestic companies. But he said the latest licensing round included areas in which there were confirmed oil and gas deposits. He also acknowledged that there was a perception among the big western oil companies that India was unlikely to contain the very large fields which were most highly valued. He noted, however, that half of India's 26 sedimentary basins remained unexpl-ored.

He insisted that the likely impact of the new regime had been carefully examined before its introduction and provision made for up to Pounds 200m to be available in the current financial year for any transitional relief that was required. The government secured a majority of 36 (289-253) to defeat a Labour amendment to the Finance Bill designed to provide more wide ranging transitional relief. An amendment moved by Mr Alex Salmond for the Scottish Nationalists with a similar objective was defeated by a government majority of 37 (287-250). Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour treasury spokesman, accused Mr Dorrell of failing to take into account that at least 10,000 jobs would be lost as a result of the changes. He warned of the danger that the new regime would result in exploration work being exported from potential oil fields in the north sea to other parts of the world. Sun Oil, the UK arm of the Philadelphia-based energy company, yesterday sold a package of 10 North Sea exploration blocks to Amoco.

The 16-year licences cover 28 of the 128 blocks in the Slyne and Erris Troughs lying some 70km off the west and north-west Ireland, and represent the first major offshore exploration effort in the Republic since the early 1980s. The licence terms require some 5,000km of seismic and other geophysical testing to be carried out, followed by the drilling of exploration wells. Eleven of the 28 blocks have been licenced to a consortium headed by Statoil (UK), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. In announcing the licence awards this week, Mr Noel Treacy the Irish energy minister, said the response to the round had been 'very encouraging and vindicates our recent efforts to promote offshore exploration, particularly the 1992 licensing terms and taxation measures'. These measures include a concessionary corporation tax rate of 25 per cent for companies producing oil and gas under licence. The Slyne and Erris Troughs lie in water depths ranging from 200m to over 1,000m, and is a relatively unexplored area, having had only three exploratory wells drilled to date, although seismic surveys carried out in 1991 and 1992 suggested a 'significant potential' for both oil and gas. The current licensing round, covering 178 blocks in the Porcupine Basin off the west of Ireland, closes in December this year.

0,FT933-292 ,"FT933-292 _AN-DI2CRAGOFT 930929   FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (13): Oil industry revives - Liberalised petrol prices help investment      By DAVID PILLING   RUSTING PIPES, broken-down pumps and disintegrating infrastructure have for years been the physical signs of Peru's declining oil industry. From the eastern jungles to the coastal desert of the north-west it is a picture of decay. Production dwindled from a peak of 71.4m barrels in 1980 to below 40m barrels in 1991, and proven reserves slumped from 900m barrels to less than 400m. But, as in the mining sector, there are signs of a reversal of fortunes. Production of crude petroleum rose one per cent last year to 115,000 b/d, and the government expects a rise of about 10 per cent in 1993 to 127,000 b/d, or 46.5m barrels over the year. Much of that results from increased production at Occidental Petroleum of the US, which has recently committed itself to investing more than Dollars 30m in new exploration after settlement of a long-running payments dispute with state-owned oil concern Petro Peru. The financial situation of Petro Peru itself has been made healthier by the August 1990 liberalisation of petrol prices, which has provided a greater profit incentive for investment in maintenance and exploration for new reserves. Eventually the government intends to privatise the state group, which may be split into as many as 40 operating units. Changing attitudes to the petroleum industry have been consolidated in a new hydrocarbons law which seeks to make Peru more attractive to foreign investors. Companies, whose exploration and production contracts will be on a surer footing, will market their oil output as they see fit. Restrictions on exploring within 30 miles of Peruvian frontiers have also been lifted. 'The new law is very sound,' says Mr Roger Alderson, general manager at Great Western Resources of Houston. 'It simplifies the old regulations, replacing 33 separate statutes. Now, probably for the first time ever, Peruvians have accepted that they need foreign investment.' It looks as though new attitudes may pay off. Peru, which has drilled only eight wells in the past two years against 100 in Argentina, is witnessing increased exploration. Great Western has committed Dollars 40m over four years to explore 1m hectares in the jungle, while American International Petroleum is spending at least Dollars 12m over two years on offshore drilling. Mobil Oil is currently undertaking technical evaluation of the Madre de Dios region in the southern jungle. Mr Alderson expects significant discoveries in the next few years which, he says, could easily see the restoration of 1980 output levels. There is also renewed interest in the enormous Camisea gas field in Cuzco, which has estimated reserves equivalent to 2bn barrels of oil, plus 700m barrels of condensates. Shell, which abandoned plans to develop the resource in 1988 after failure to agree terms with the Garcia government, is reported to be looking at the project again. It is estimated that Camisea would require investment of Dollars 1.8bn to harness its full potential, though it might be possible to phase in production with initial sales to the local market. In the hydrocarbons sector generally, smaller petroleum companies have so far shown more interest in Peruvian investments than their larger counterparts, a pattern seen in neighbouring Colombia. However, in an annual survey of international oil companies conducted earlier this year by Simon Petroleum Technology, Peru jumped to 17th on the world list of attractive investment propositions. Three years ago it stood at 37. Mr Alderson believes it could climb as high as eighth by next year. 'There used to be - and still is to a certain extent - enormous trepidation about coming to Peru,' he says. 'But now it appears that the country is turning the corner.'

One-off charges of Dollars 145m - mainly related to the rise in the US corporate tax rate - led to a fall in net income to Dollars 420m, or Dollars 1.29 a share, from Dollars 467m or Dollars 1.37 a share the year before. Before special items, net income in both periods jumped to Dollars 565m from Dollars 410m. US refining and marketing income climbed to Dollars 164m, from Dollars 69m, while earnings overseas were up from Dollars 19m to Dollars 50m. Lower oil prices accounted for most of the improvement. Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief operating officer, said the company had cut operating expenses by 14 per cent over the past two years, equivalent to a saving of Dollars 1 a barrel. US exploration and production income fell to Dollars 125m from Dollars 251m as higher natural gas prices failed to make up for a Dollars 3.94 fall in the price realised for a barrel of oil. Unocal, the Los Angeles-based energy group, lifted its third-quarter earnings to Dollars 70m or 25 cents a share from Dollars 11m or 1 cent a year ago, boosted by improved West Coast refining and marketing operations, Reuter reports. Higher domestic natural gas prices, lower worldwide exploration expense and lower interest expense contributed to the improved results. The quarter included a Dollars 14m charge on the effect of the higher federal tax rate on deferred taxes. The 1992 quarter included a Dollars 32m restructuring charge. Third-quarter operating earnings from petroleum exploration and production fell to Dollars 101m from Dollars 121m in 1992, reflecting lower worldwide crude oil prices and production. Higher domestic natural gas prices and production and lower exploration expense partially offset the drop.   Companies:-  Chevron Corp.     Unocal Corp.

Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, said the award of the licences to Eukan Energy Limited and Altwood Petroleum was made outside the formal licensing rounds for exploration acreage. It was the first use of the 'out-of-round procedure', under which companies can apply to the government for acreage in areas where they believe early exploration for oil and gas is merited. 'The use of the out-of-round procedure in this case is another example of the flexibility of our licensing system,' Mr Eggar said. The five licences are in the following areas: Yorkshire, north-east of Sheffield. the Staffordshire/Cheshire border north-east of Stoke-on-Trent. the Derbyshire/Nottinghamshire border north-west of Nottingham. Surrey and Sussex between the North and South Downs. All of the licences are on private land. The companies will need planning permission and the owners' consent before they can begin seismic testing and exploratory drilling. A separate government appraisal licence would be required if any oil or gas is discovered. In another move intended to demonstrate flexibility in on-shore oil and gas exploration, the government allowed Tullow Exploration temporarily to extend its seismic work 1km beyond the boundaries of two licences it holds in Lincolnshire. Mr Eggar said the award of the new type of seismic survey licence was 'a clear demonstration of our commitment to support oil and gas companies through a flexible licensing system'. The licence awarded yesterday does not allow any drilling and only covers areas adjacent to a principal licence. It will last for one year.   Companies:-  Eukan Energy.     Altwood Petroleum.

He added in an  interview with AL-HAYAH that OPEC could restore Iraq's prewar  quota, which was distributed among other countries, without a  price collapse.    The Omani minister, whose country usually undertakes the  role  of coordinator between OPEC producers and other producers,  criticized countries in the petroleum exporting organization for  blaming the current petroleum price declines on nonmember  countries, describing this as unfair, especially given the  tendency of OPEC's production to rise, and the production of  nonmember countries to decline.    Al-Shanfari, who this week accepted the OPEC  secretary-general's invitation to intervene with countries  outside the organization to support petroleum prices, showed no  eagerness to reduce the production of his country, or that of  other producers outside the organization. He emphasized that  OPEC itself needed ""cohesion"" and that OPEC itself was capable  of fixing prices.    The Omani minister confirmed the increase in his country's  production this year, to record levels: 800,000 barrels.    The text of the interview follows:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] This month, in which Oman's national day  falls, and in the light of the drop in petroleum prices, it has  been noted that the Sultanate's production and reserves have  risen. What is the volume of the increase? How can it be  reconciled with Oman's pessimistic expectations in the early  1970's?    [Al-Shanfari] I am pleased to give you a complete picture of  our petroleum production, especially since 1974. It was in that  year that the picture of the future of petroleum and gas was  very bleak. At that time, Omani and international experts  expected that Oman would have petroleum in the years to  come--the years we are now living in.    At the time, we had a petroleum reserve of about 1.5 billion  barrels; our daily production was less than 300,000 barrels.  Today, praise God, and with the guidance and support of His  Majesty Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id in the petroleum sector, we have  achieved these excellent results. Our production is now 800,000  barrels per day [bpd], of which 80,000 bpd are for local  consumption. We export the rest (720,000 bpd).    Oman's petroleum reserves have more than tripled, nearing 5  billion barrels. We hope soon to add half a billion more barrels  to the reserve, and I may say that the outlook is now bright. We  are still at the beginning of the road, and I believe that we  have great petroleum possibilities.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] More than one OPEC official has said that  the  petroleum market is now experiencing a new price war, and that  the non-OPEC member countries of the region--among them  Oman--are responsible for this deterioration. Do you agree with  this assessment? Or is it your view that the failure of OPEC  states themselves to adhere to the quotas is behind the rise in  supply, and by extension the price collapse?    [Al-Shanfari] There is much to be said about this, but I do  not want to get into blaming anyone in particular. The fact is  that the global economy is in an unstable state. When  development is slow in this economy, it is difficult to expect  the consumption of large quantities of petroleum. Consumption  grows slowly in the Western world--i.e., the industrialized  countries--at a rate of less than 1 percent. Comparing that with  the countries of Asia, we find that there is a large increase in  consumption, and a greater absorptive capacity; average  petroleum consumption rises 10 percent per year, reaching 14  percent in the case of China.    Thus there are many factors involved in the collapse of  petroleum prices, which taken all together do not encourage the  growth of demand for petroleum. It is also true that some  countries boosted their production capacity, such as the North  Sea countries, Norway and Britain, but honestly, I cannot lay  blame on the countries outside OPEC, because the majority are  countries with small production (with the exception of Russia  and the North Sea countries) that do not affect the global  petroleum markets. Going back to the production of producing  countries outside OPEC will fortify this view; we find that  their petroleum production is decreasing. In 1989, their  production was 43 million bpd, and this year it dropped to about  40 million bpd.    In 1988, the OPEC countries' production was 21.8 million  bpd,  and it rose this year to about 26.9 million bpd.    So--there is a reduction in the petroleum production of the  non-OPEC states, and an increase in the petroleum production of  the organization's member states. Thus it would be wrong and  unfair for us to blame the drop in prices on the non-OPEC states.    Here in Oman, as a coordinating state between the OPEC  member  producers and non-OPEC producers, we do not want to lay blame on  specific parties, and we hope that our brothers in OPEC will not  lay blame on the non-OPEC countries. I can give an example in  this context that some members in the exporting organization  directly boosted their production higher than it had been before  the last Gulf war by nearly 40 or 50 percent. Some countries  that had a daily production of 1.5 million barrels before the  crisis have increased it to nearly two million bpd or more.    Another thing. All indications are that many non-OPEC  producers are decreasing production. China, for example, will  this year become an importing country, and India, too, will  bcome an petroleum importer within months or a year at the most.    Among some OPEC member states there is a lack of agreement  or  consensus, but if there were to be cooperation and some good  will among us, then the price situation would improve. Time is  on OPEC's side; this is what I think and understand from my  experience with petroleum-producing countries inside and outside  the organization. I also say that we must not lay blame on one  another. Let us coordinate with one another, because our dispute  is not in the best interests of producing countries. I want  there to be cooperation and mutual understanding among all  producers.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There are calls to hold a meeting of OPEC  states and nonmember countries to reach an agreement to support  prices based on the OPEC member states' request for a 5 percent  or more drop in production, as has happened before. Would you  agree, at this time, when we are seeing a retreat in petroleum  prices and revenues, to another drop in your production, or will  you price as you did before to convince Russia and other  producers to lower their production?    [Al-Shanfari] We have no problem going along with these  calls, on condition prices are raised. But we believe that  lowering production without prices being raised would be hard  for a country like Russia, which is facing economic hardship, or  China, whose exports do not exceed 100,000 bpd. That leaves  Oman, Mexico, or Egypt. Is it possible to ask Egypt, which has  enormous economic challenges, or us in Oman, whose petroleum  revenues are insufficient to achieve the government's ambitions,  especially as we want to follow in the footsteps of our brothers  in the Gulf, who produce large quantities of petroleum.    We in Oman need petroleum revenues for the basic necessities  of development. How can our brothers, who produce millions of  barrels, ask Oman to reduce its production by 20,000 or 30,000  barrels?    Even so, we have no objection, and are constantly declaring  our readiness to cooperate. But how can we ask a country like  Egypt, in its circumstances, with a population growth of nearly  a million people every year?    This is why we hope the members of OPEC will do their utmost  to cooperate among themselves. If that happens, they might be  able to solve the current petroleum price problem.    Everyone knows that Norway is not prepared to lower its  production. While they might cooperate with us, it is only  verbally. They are always attending the coordination meetings  that OPEC members and nonmembers hold, just to listen to our  points of view. Britain is the same, except that it does not  consent to attend our meetings, because they have their own  circumsatcnes and policy. I reiterate, in spite of that, our  willingness to cooperate, as non-OPEC producers, but it is up to  OPEC to define or fix prices, so there must be greater cohesion  within the organization. Our belief is that even if we did lower  our production, it would not be much of a help to the current  price situation. All the power lies within the organization.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Would you agree with the view that the  chance  of Iraq returning to the petroleum market is one of the major  reasons for the current drop in global petroleum prices?    [Al-Shanfari] Everyone knows that Iraq is a  petroleum-producing country, and Iraq's quota of OPEC production  before the war is known. Iraq's return to the ""petroleum  producers' and exporters' club"" is something to be taken into  consideration. We in the Sultanate of Oman hope that Iraq will  go back to producing its petroleum. The Iraqi people have  suffered enough. Iraq's quota is known to all, just as Kuwait's  was. Kuwait came back and resumed producing its quota, even  increased it. The Emirates' quota was known, and its current  production is known. Iraq should resume producing, and Iraq's  resumption of production will not mean chaos or disorder in the  global petroleum market. I believe the OPEC countries will allow  Iraq to resume its quota. As to when Iraq will return and what  effect that will have, these matters are hard to predict fully  right now, though our hope is that sanctions will be lifted from  Iraq and it will be able to resume exporting petroleum.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] But what will happen to the market and  prices  in the event OPEC is preventing from granting Iraq its old quota  as soon as the international sanctions are lifted?    [Al-Shanfari] The question of the price collapse might  happen, I believe, if OPEC does not consent to give Iraq its  former quota. Prices would plunge, possibly reaching $10 per  barrel. This would hurt producers. If Iraq is given the quota  that was taken from it, or distributed among some other  countries, I don't think we'll see a collapse of petroleum  prices.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Recently there has been a noticeable  slowdown  in the giant joint ventures Oman had contracted for, for  instance, the construction of an petroleum pipeline from the  Caspian Sea to the Black Sea, or the gas pipeline to India, as  well as the liquid gas project--whose estimated total price tag  is nearly $18 or $19 billion.    [Al-Shanfari] Discussing these projects brings us to the  Sultanate's efforts to diversify its revenue sources at the  local level, into the areas of agriculture, industry, fisheries,  and minerals. We have also begun to diversify these sources  abroad; we have begun to seek out economic projects abroad. We  have actually signed agrements with Russia and Kazakhstan to  build a Black Sea pipeline through Russia. The project is now  ready for implementation. An economic study is now being  prepared, along with the route of the pipeline. We hope that the  study will be adequate, and we will receive it soon. Naturally  we have entered the stage of obtaining of the petroleum  exploration concession in Kazakhstan, and we hope that work will  get under way soon in developing this concession. We have signed  an agreement with the Indian Government to supply the Indian  subcontinent with natural gas from Oman. As the world's second  most populous country, after China, India likewise has a rising  demand for energy, and the same holds true for the other rapidly  developing countries of Asia, such as Vietnam, Taiwan, and  others. The agreement includes the building of a pipeline, and a  study is now being prepared. We hope it will be completed for us  to consider by March/April 1994. The study will definitively  establish the route of the pipeline and its actual cost. We are  negotiating with the Indian Government over the pricing of the  gas, and are working on having the project implemented at the  earliest possible opportunity. We have the strong support of His  Majesty the Sultan in building this pipeline, which will be the  first of its kind in the world--it will be built at a depth of  3,000 meters under the sea.    Economically, it will be a first-class pipeline. It will  allow the planning of other pipelines between the Indian  subcontinent and the Arabian peninsula. We in Oman welcome the  participation and cooperation of our brothers in the region,  should they have the intention. We could work on petroleum  pipelines, because as we have begun with gas we can take on the  building of other pipelines for petroleum.    According to what I have understood from Petroleum Ministry  experts, the main obstacle to this project is technical, in  terms of the means of putting a pipeline 3,000 feet down, but  even this obstacle can be overcome. When the studies are  completed, there will be an international tender for the  construction of the pipeline. There is another project, the  liquified gas complex we are also interested in, which may cost  as much as to $9 billion.    People may wonder how these huge, expensive projects are  funded. So far we have knocked on the doors of international  financiers, because we are still in the study stage, but what I  would like to make clear is that building these projects will  not affect the development process at home. No portion of our  current global investments will be withdrawn; these projects  will be funded through international institutions. I do not  believe Oman will have any difficulty in handling this funding,  because these projects are vital and profitable, and the  Sultanate's economic reputation abroad is excellent, because of  our political stability. Contacts have been made in this regard.  We in the Petroleum Ministry, as well as our brothers in the  Omani Finance Ministry, have received proposals from  international banks and investors, all of whom want to take part  in these projects.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] After your recent visits to China and India,  you announced Omani investments in those two countries'  petroleum industries. What is the nature and scale of the  investments? Will they be in the field of exploration and  extraction, or in petroleum refining?    [Al-Shanfari] On my visit to India, we noticed vast  possibilities in all aspects of work and investment in China. We  are now discussing projects such as obtaining Chinese petroleum  concession regions, building petroleum refineries, and  participating in pipeline construction. We are still at the  negotiation and discussion stage, so right now it is difficult  to say what will be agreed upon. I think we willl be able to get  certain project agreements within about four months.    Turning to foreign investments, we have a project to build  two petroleum refineries in India, and we have also taken a  share in an petroleum refinery in Thailand with Caltex, Inc. We  are thus trying to diversify our income sources, especially  since most of these projects will produce revenues in 10 or 15  years, and at that point will constitute another support for the  Omani economy, which will prevent our continued dependence  solely on petroleum revenues.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you think that India's recent agreement  with Iran for a natural gas pipeline from Iran to India will  affect the Indian government's commitment to their agreement  with you?    [Al-Shanfari] So far, our agreement is in force, and we are  moving ahead with it. The Indian Government feels that we are  serious about implementing it, and I do not think the Indians  will change their minds. I met with Indian Prime Minister  Narasimha Rao, who asserted his support for the project. Just  last week there were talks with the Indians on the course of the  work. We are now at the stage of implementing what we agreed  upon. We are not speaking of an imaginary project. We hope that  two years from now the Indian subcontnent will have natural gas  from the Arabian peninsula.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Has the Sultanate's petrochemical project,  which will depend on more natural gas energy and discoveries in  the Sultanate, reached the stage of signing an agreement, or is  it still at the preliminary study stage?    [Al-Shanfari] The extent of the natural gas present under  the  Sultanate has begun to become clear. At present we have reached  gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic feet. We have an ambitious  exploration program, and I think there are great possibilities.  I believe continued exploration for gas will make the picture  even clearer. We are able--according to our own experts'  estimates--to double our present gas reserves. We use natural  gas in Oman to provide energy for electric stations. Another  large electrical station will soon be added, in Manah, in the  interior of Oman.    As to the petrochemical complex and other projects, we are  continue to study them, especially as our available gas reserves  are sufficient for the Sultanate's local consumption for more  than 30 years, in addition to covering the liquid gas project's  needs and those of the natural gas pipeline to India.    We believe that within a few months we will add new  quantities of gas. This gas is associated with petroleum  (petroleum liquids) that will be added to our petroleum reserves.      "

Many oil companies have said the tax changes announced in the Budget will lead to a halving of exploration activity in the North Sea. The row in the industry over the tax changes was further fuelled yesterday by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based oil analysts, who questioned the Treasury's forecasts for revenue from the tax measures. The analysts estimate that the changes will raise Pounds 115m in tax over the next three years rather than the Pounds 700m Treasury forecast. The Treasury has defended its tax measures by saying that the previous regime subsidised inefficient exploration. The new rules reduce the tax rate on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. They also abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. BP said yesterday that the Forth field, which contains about 180m barrels of oil, will be more profitable as a result of the abolition of petroleum revenue tax on new oilfields. Industry analysts say the Forth field could be worth an additional Pounds 100m because of the proposed changes. Wood MacKenzie believes that six companies, including BP, stand to gain from the new proposals; six companies, including British Gas, will lose in the short term, but gain in the long term; and 17 companies will be overall losers. The analysts say the number of wells drilled in the North Sea could drop below 100 from 116 last year. BP plans to bring its Forth field on stream in early 1996. The company said yesterday that, although the field will be more profitable under the new tax rules, they will force more efficiency in development because there will be no chance of writing off cost overruns against tax.

Summary of Today's Final Rule           EPA is finalizing a revised version of the January 8, 1988 proposal in today's notice. The final rule states in essence that recovered oil from petroleum refinery operations, petroleum exploration and production, and transportation incident thereto, is excluded from the regulatory definition of solid waste if it is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The recovered oil thus need not be generated at the site of the refining process_a potentially significant expansion of the proposal. This exclusion applies, however, only if the oil is not managed in land disposal units or accumulated speculatively before it is inserted.       EPA expects that most of the recovered oil affected by this rule will be generated from wastewater treatment operations. As explained below, EPA is narrowing the proposal (which would have excluded petroleum refining wastewaters containing oil that eventually gets recycled) by finding that refinery operations upstream of recovered oil systems involve wastewater treatment, not an on-going refining process. Thus, petroleum refinery wastewaters undergoing treatment should not be excluded from the definition of solid waste. In addition, even if these wastewater treatment operations are characterized as also involving recycling, the operations involve discarded residuals that can be part of the waste disposal problem, and hence the wastewater treatment operations need not be characterized as part of an ``ongoing production process'' for purposes of excluding materials from the definition of solid waste. Once oil is recovered, however, the Agency believes it reasonable to exclude it from the definition of solid waste if the oil is to be reused in the refining process (even though the oil may still require a significant amount of further processing before it can actually be so reused). This is because the recovered oil and its management within refining operations can be viewed as part of the petroleum refining process and not part of the waste disposal problem.           EPA is also slightly amending the regulatory exemption for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste (see 261.6 (a)(3)(vii), redesignated (a)(3)(vi) in today's rule). The Agency is slightly broadening the current exemption so that it also applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, but the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated.         As a matter of drafting, the principal change brought about by today's rule takes the form of an exclusion from the regulatory definition of solid waste. Specifically, paragraph (12) is being added to the list of exclusions in 261.4 (a). In addition, EPA is removing the regulatory exemption in 261.6(a)(3)(v) which is superseded by today's exclusion, and redesignating the remaining exemptions in 261.6(a)(3) (vi) and (vii) as 261.6(a)(3) (v) and (vi), respectively, in order to maintain consecutive numbering. EPA is also revising two other regulatory exemptions in 261.6(a)(3). Finally, EPA is making conforming changes to 261.3(c)(2)(ii)(B) and 266.100(b)(3), both as a result of today's rulemaking, and to reflect conforming changes that EPA inadvertently omitted during promulgation of the used oil final rule (57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992)).       IV. Scope of Today's Final Rule           A. Limiting Scope to Recovered Oil From Petroleum Refining, Exploration and Production           As noted above, today's rule excludes recovered oil generated from petroleum exploration, production and refining activities, and from the transportation incident thereto, from being a solid waste when the recovered oil is inserted into a designated point in a petroleum refining process. This section of the preamble discusses why EPA is crafting the exclusion in this manner. More specifically, we discuss why the exclusion does not cover oil recovered in operations downstream from petroleum refining, and why the exclusion does not apply to recovered oil from industries other than petroleum refining, exploration, or production.

The French group will provide financing and technological assistance for the development of the field, expected to start production in 1994. In return, Total will have access to Hamra's entire output of condensates and liquefied petroleum gas - an estimated 150m to 200m barrels petroleum equivalent - for a period of 14 to 17 years. The deal shows the continued willingness of big Western companies to invest in Algeria, despite the political uncertainty that has been hanging over the country's future since the rise of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front. Total also agreed yesterday to renew for a further five years its joint venture with Sonatrach for the operation of the Mereksen oil field, which currently produces around 600,000 tonnes of oil a year. It also signed two exploration contracts covering 6,458 square kilometres at Djebel Bottena and Hamra Southeast.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

The technology has also have helped identify new fields outside the mature North Sea province. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the industry watchdog, upgraded its estimates of total recoverable petroleum resources by 12 per cent to between 8bn and 12.5bn tonnes of oil equivalent. At current prices some estimates put the value of the upgrade at around NKr450bn (Dollars 225bn). The NPD's estimate puts undiscovered resources at 3.7bn tonnes, the potential for improved recovery from existing fields at 500m tonnes and discovered recoverable resources at 5.6bn tonnes. The oil/gas ratio of potential new resources and improved recovery is respectively 40 per cent and 60 per cent. In the past Norwegian petroleum resources have been upgraded by an average of about 30 per cent from original estimates. Given average annual oil production of 80m tonnes and annual gas production of 25m tonnes of oil equivalent, the country's oil will last for about 45 years and its gas for about 200 years. Norway is western Europe's biggest crude oil producer, with an annual output of 2.4m barrels It is the third-biggest supplier of gas. The continental shelf embraces an estimated 1.1m sq km of sedimentary rocks, of which just 40 per cent has been opened for exploration drilling. The shelf is divided into three areas; the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea. The North Sea comprises all areas south of the 62nd parallel, while the Norwegian Sea extends to intermediate areas between the North Sea and the Barents Sea, which comprises areas north of Andoeya in the Lofoten Islands. The NPD says that on average, every third wildcat well drilled on the shelf has produced hydrocarbons when tested. In the North Sea, for example, 320 structures have been drilled and 112 discovery wells defined. For the Norwegian Sea the respective numbers are 70 structures and 17 discoveries, while in the Barents Sea the figures are respectively 45 and 16. 'During the last five years resource growth has been slightly less than production growth. Although we can no longer expect to find as much oil as we produce, good opportunities will still exist for further interesting oil finds,' the NPD. says Norway's first licensing round was held in 1965, when 23 production licences covering 80 blocks were issued, all in water depths of less than 150m in the southern North Sea. Exploration in recent years has moved into water depths of 300m and is heading into depths of between 500m and 2,000m. Drilling technology has advanced to the point where it can meet deep water challenges, the NPD says. Norway's first two oil discoveries were made in 1967 and 1968. They were followed by the discovery of the prolific Ekofisk field, but not until 33 wells were drilled to confirm its commerciality. The NPD likes to tell this story as a reminder to oil companies thinking of giving up in frustration with their lack of success in the Barents Sea. Despite 25 years of intensive North Sea exploration, the NPD believes there may still be a considerable undiscovered resource potential. In the last few years several interesting small and medium-sized discoveries have been made close to existing infrastructure and in reallocated blocks undergoing renewed exploration. The NPD estimates that about 25 per cent of total North Sea resources are still awaiting discovery. Earlier this year, Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, boosted estimates of the amount of oil found in its North Sea Snorre field by 10 per cent to 890m barrels. Snorre came on stream last autumn and still faces two further stages of development. In the Norwegian Sea's Voering Basin, off the coast of mid-Norway and north of the emerging Haltenbanken oil and gas province, explorers drilled unsuccessfully for several years before three discoveries were made in 1990-92. The NPD estimates total Norwegian Sea resources at 1,450m tonnes of oil equivalent, of which 42 per cent is oil and 58 per cent gas. Its statistical analysis shows a 95 per cent probability of finding 200m tonnes of petroleum and a 5 per cent probability of finding 2,200m tonnes. The recently confirmed Norwegian Sea Norne field, operated by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, is believed to contain an estimated 400m barrels of oil and the company aims to bring it on stream in 1996. 'The Norne discovery opens up the region's future potential. . . but we struggled for a long time and drilled two dry wells before we struck oil,' says Mr Kyrre Nese, Statoil's executive vice-president of exploration and development. He believes it will take another decade before sufficient exploration is undertaken in the field to reduce uncertainty over reserves potential. On Haltenbanken, Norske Shell recently announced an upgrade of Draugen oil reserves by 160m barrels to 580m. Draugen is due to come on stream later this year. Mr Einar Knutsen, a Norske Shell director, says three-dimensional surveys undertaken in 1991 and 1992 triggered the possibility that Draugen might contain more oil. 'I would not exclude the possibility of a further Draugen upgrade,' he says. Norske Shell is at present undertaking interpretative analysis of 3-D surveys of two blocks south of Draugen with a view to commencing exploration drilling next year to define the prospects. Mr Knutsen says that Statoil's Norne discovery is encouraging news but cautions that the industry will have to undertake years of drilling to gain sufficient knowledge of the region to be confident over its resource potential. 'Excluding Norne, there have been no other discoveries in the region,' he says, adding that his company will concentrate on maximising recovery from Draugen and defining the prospects of blocks 6411 and 6412. In the vast Barents Sea, Norway has found gas but made no commercial oil discoveries. In the Russian part of the Barents Sea, Shtokmanovskoye, believed to be the world's biggest offshore gas field, was discovered five years ago. The Russians also found oil there. In mid-August Norske Shell will drill the only well to be drilled this year in the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. 'We have expectations, but this is a crucial well. If it is dry it will mean Shell has reached a crossroads in its commitment to the Barents Sea,' Mr Knutsen says. Mr Nese says the main challenge for Barents Sea explorers is to develop exploration models that can lead to oil discoveries. 'We know there is significant gas reserves there and gas marketing efforts are under way, but the area is far away from gas markets.' The NPD estimates total resources in the Barents Sea to be 1,380m tonnes of oil equivalent, of which 14 per cent is oil and 86 per cent gas.   Companies:-  Saga Petroleum.

In the brigadier's opinion, ""petroleum is a strategic  element, and therefore it is necessary to remain alert to the  international interests that want to conquer the Brazilian  petroleum reserves.""

Wang Tao, president of China National Petroleum Corp.  (CNPC),  unveiled the second round of international bidding here today.    The first round for exploring oil and gas in the Tarim Basin  in China's remote Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region ended last  year. An initial petroleum contract has been signed between the  CNPC and the Exxon and the Japan Oil Company group. More  commercial negotiations are under way.    Wang said the projects now open to foreign bidding fall into  two categories -- risk exploration and enhanced oil recovery  projects. Registration will begin on February 15, 1994.    In the first category, 26 exploration blocks in China's nine  provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of  Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Hubei,  Gansu, Qinghai and Tianjin are inviting foreign bids.    According to Wang, oil resources in these blocks with a  total  area of 216,000 square kilometers are estimated at 6.2 billion  tons and natural gas resources at 800 billion cubic meters.    ""This indicates a good prospect for exploration,"" Wang said.    He added that most blocks are located near industrial and  agricultural centers with convenient transportation  infrastructures, which will surely facilitate operations there.    Wang assured that international conventions and formulas for  product-sharing will be adopted in this round of bidding as in  the previous one. Foreign companies will be solely responsible  for all exploration risks in the contract blocks.    Commercial discoveries will be jointly developed by Chinese  and foreign partners while post-tax profits will be shared in  accordance with the terms and conditions set in the contracts.    Wang said the second category covers enhanced oil recovery  projects in 11 developed blocks scattered in the eight mature  oil fields of Shengli, Dagang, Huabei, Jianghan, Henan, Jiangsu,  Zhongyuan and Jilin.    Total oil-bearing area in the blocks is 190.2 square  kilometers with oil reserves of 380 million tons in place. The  recovery factor in these blocks varies from 18.3 to 85.3 percent  of the recoverable reserves, Wang told the conference.    Located within developed fields, with reliable resources,  complete infrastructures and guaranteed logistic support, these  projects are expected to be quick to produce results.    In the projects, foreign companies will shoulder risks  alone,  or together with the Chinese side, for pilot tests. The two  sides will be joint operators after stimulation methods are  chosen and share the incremental increases in oil following tax  payment.    Wang said foreign companies are free to forward their  tenders  individually or to bid through the formation of consortiums.    The registered foreign companies will start data review,  purchase data packages and make field trips from March 1 to  August 1, 1994. The bidding is scheduled to end on August 30,  1994, followed by bid evaluation.    Wang said China is looking for overseas cooperation in  downstream utilization of oil and gas, construction of  long-distance oil and gas pipelines and manufacturing of special  petroleum equipment as well as engineering and technical  services.    It will also seek foreign partners to explore and develop  oil  and gas resources outside China, Wang added.     "

The deal, covering rights to 10,000 sq km, arises from a contract signed in 1989 for Amoco to do a survey based on what was known of Poland's domestic energy resources. It comes in the midst of tendering by other foreign companies for oil exploration rights to a further 35,000 sq km of the country. A tender has also just closed for coal bed methane gas exploration; six foreign companies, including Amoco, applied. Poland is dependent on supplies of Russian gas for two-thirds of its 13bn cubic metres annual consumption, while almost all its oil is imported from Russia and the Middle East.

Several wells have yielded natural gas, but they are not considered commercially exploitable because of the long distances to markets and high development costs. With the current low level of oil prices and the high costs of exploring the remote region, companies say activity in the area is an 'exotic indulgence'. Recognising the decline in oil company interest in the area, the government recently proposed more attractive terms and conditions for exploring there. The authorities earlier linked the award of the most attractive Norwegian shelf exploration acreage to company commitment to invest in high-risk acreage such as the Barents Sea. Many oil companies have welcomed the proposed changes but nevertheless say they do little to enhance prospectivity, given low oil prices, distances to markets and Norway's stringent tax regime. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, says it must develop new strategies before it proceeds and is not likely to drill a new well in the region for at least two years. The group has spent some NKr2.5bn, about 25 per cent of total oil company exploration costs there. 'We're at a crossroads, and must soon decide whether - and how - we are going to continue in the southern Barents Sea or switch our attention to other parts of the Norwegian shelf,' Mr Tor Fjaeran, Statoil senior vice president for domestic resource development, said recently. He welcomed the new proposals but stressed that the potential for finding hydrocarbons - particularly oil - was the principal factor determining Statoil's commitment. Mr Fjaeran said oil companies' expectations for the region had been reduced because of the dominance of gas. 'The area is primarily a gas province and no way has been found for selling the gas already discovered,' he said. At the same time, according to Mr Fjaeran, present geological information suggested that only small oil discoveries could be expected, while environmental challenges added to costs. Statoil recently completed testing a Barents Sea discovery that yielded a high gas flow and low oil production and established that the find, though technically producible, was not commercial. The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the industry watchdog, estimates the potential recoverable petroleum reserves of the region at 1.12bn tonnes of oil equivalent, of which oil accounts for 190m and gas 930m. About 260m tonnes of petroleum has been discovered, it says. Mobil Exploration Norway, a pioneer explorer in the area, has spent about NKr750m to drill seven wells. 'We have not completely lost interest, but we have to look at the Barents Sea compared with other prospective areas,' says a company executive. 'Although we appreciate the new proposals, the fiscal regime is still the same.' 'Saga Petroleum, Norway's largest independent oil company, spent about NKr150m exploring in the Barents Sea. 'We feel the Barents Sea is still interesting given its size and, there are new explorations models but, given the small amount of oil discovered so far, it is hard to justify investment in the area right now,' says a Saga executive.

The Texas-based Exxon suffered a 15.1 per cent drop in second-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 955m. This is the lowest quarterly net profit for the company since 1989, the year of the Alaskan oil spill from the Exxon Valdez. Exxon's earnings per share were down to 76 cents from 90 cents a year ago. Revenues in the quarter were 1.8 per cent higher at Dollars 27.76bn. For the first six months of 1992 Exxon's net income was down by 31.5 per cent at Dollars 2.3bn, on revenues that were 4 per cent lower at Dollars 55.67bn. Texaco of White Plains, New York, said its second-quarter net income was Dollars 245m, a decline of 8.9 per cent. Earnings per share were 85 cents, against 94 cents in 1991. Revenues were 4.4 per cent higher at Dollars 9.4bn. For the first half of 1992 Texaco's net earnings were 34.9 per cent lower at Dollars 445m, on revenues that were 6.3 per cent down at Dollars 18bn. The second-quarter net profit at Occidental Petroleum, based in Los Angeles, was nearly halved - from Dollars 147m, or 49 cents a share, a year ago to Dollars 75m, or 25 cents. Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, against Dollars 2.4bn. For the first six months Occidental, undergoing a substantial restructuring programme, suffered a 38.7 per cent drop in net income, to Dollars 173m. Revenues were down to Dollars 4.3bn from Dollars 5.2bn in the first half of 1991. The drop in earnings at these companies continues a trend started on Wednesday, when Amoco, the fifth largest US oil and gas company, reported a 22.5 per cent fall in underlying second-quarter earnings and a Dollars 478m net loss after taking an Dollars 805m charge for restructuring and severance payment costs. Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, said the group's performance was affected by lower petroleum product margins, which were in turn affected by rising crude supply costs, weak economic conditions and soft demand in many markets. Earnings from exploration and production operation were Dollars 83m higher at Dollars 725m while income from the refining and marketing side slumped by Dollars 352m to Dollars 180m, due mainly to problems in the US market. Included in the second-quarter results was a Dollars 75m charge for restructuring Exxon's US oil and gas businesses. The tendency of energy companies to direct exploration spending away from the US was illustrated by Exxon's devoting 70 per cent of its worldwide capital and exploration expenditures to projects outside the US. Mr James Kinnear, chief executive of Texaco, stressed the company's effort to maintain the strength of its financial position in the face of generally weak industry conditions. He said Texaco expected to produce full-year cash savings of around Dollars 700m from reductions in planned capital spending and expenses.

It will also begin the spade work for  the Presidential and National Assembly elections.    This was announced by President Sam Nujoma at a State House  news conference on Wednesday. Many Namibians have complained  about the availability of land and the disproportionate  distribution of available arable land. A Land Conference was  held in Windhoek in 1991, to find solutions to the land hunger.    The President vowed to pursue closer cooperation in conflict  resolution to ensure stability for the common interests of the  region. ""Although our country enjoys relative peace and  stability, we cannot be indifferent to the sufferings of  others,"" President Nujoma told the press conference.    Nujoma reviewed development progress in the past year and  said the government would continue to consolidate and strengthen  the foundations of political, economic and social development.  He declared that education would take priority in his  government until the day he died.    ""We have now embarked upon an irreversible path towards  national building, a step that has led to sound investment  opportunity and socio-economic upliftment of our people.""  President Nujoma highlighted successes in road infrastructural  development, oil and gas exploration, fisheries and regional  cooperation.    He welcomed the reintegration of Walvis Bay, stating that  the  port town would become a major centre for regional cooperation  and would give great impetus to the growth of the Namibian  economy. At independence, the government initiated the  formidable task of turning Namibia's transport network towards a  much more favourable east-west direction.    Five major road projects have been implemented and some of  the new links are to be completed within the next three years.    On petroleum exploration and production, remarkable progress  has also been achieved. Realising that the petroleum industry  is a hazardous one, the government has established an emergency  plan. It is developing oil and gas regulations regarding  health, safety and the protection of the environment, during  exploration and production activities. Pre-feasibility studies  for Epupa hydro-electric scheme have been completed and the  feasibility study phase is to commence soon.    President Nujoma expressed satisfaction with the growth of  the fishing industry, which he described as the second largest  industrial employer. The President noted that industrialists  had made substantial foreign exchange earnings the past year and  there would be no deterioration in the country's balance of  payments. He said he foresaw greater investment and job  opportunities being created by all these developments.     "
0,FT931-2746 ,"FT931-2746 _AN-DCRCHAF0FT 930318   FT  18 MAR 93 / After the Budget: Oil equities knocked by tax reforms      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   OIL COMPANY shares were hit yesterday as the City reacted to news of the most significant overhaul to North Sea taxation in 10 years, an-nounced in Tuesday's Budget. The complexity of the tax changes means there will be substantial winners and losers. British Petroleum is one of the main beneficiaries from the new regime and its share price rose 6.5 per cent between the market close on Monday and the close last night. But some of the smaller exploration companies saw their shares fall - Clyde Petroleum and Hardy Oil and Gas were down 11 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Mr David Simon, chief executive of BP, said the reduction in the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent was 'a long-sought and fundamental structural reform'. City analysts estimate that BP will add between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m to its profits from the tax change. But Shell sounded a note of caution. Mr John Collins, chairman and chief executive of Shell UK, said: 'The inability to charge exploration and appraisal expenditure against income from PRT-paying fields puts a downward pressure on exploration and appraisal activity.' This is by far the most controversial part of Mr Norman Lamont's announcement. It will mean oil companies paying 64p of every pound invested, compared with 17p and could substantially reduce exploration activity, hitting smaller companies hardest. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, said: 'The changes have taken away a lot of the incentive to re-invest your earnings in new projects in the North Sea.' Although Enterprise stands to gain from the tax overhaul, Mr Walmesley said the changes meant that oil operators, already suffering from low oil prices and high costs will reduce their exploration work. Mr Kenneth Waters, finance director of Goal Petroleum, one of the smaller exploration and production companies, said: 'We have to review our whole strategy as a result of these changes and we will look at putting more of our money overseas.' Mr Paul Zatz, finance director of Clyde Petroleum, said the company was already directing much of its investment overseas, particularly to the Netherlands. 'It will inevitably mean a drop-off in future activity in the North Sea.' The PRT rate reduction gives larger companies an incentive to extract more barrels from existing oilfields - an important boost at a time when many fields are nearing depletion. Mr Simon said this could raise the recoverable reserves and extend the productive life of some oilfields. Some industry analysts fear, however, that the government will kill off exploration in new areas of the North Sea, such as the west of Shetland region where it is costly to drill for oil. BP has just made a large discovery west of Shetland which was hailed as opening up a completely new offshore oil province. Mr Simon said yesterday the tax changes would help develop the discovery, where a higher rate of return was necessary. But analysts believe other companies could be deterred from becoming involved.

0,FT942-1252 ,"FT942-1252 _AN-EFXC1AHBFT 940624   FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Norway (11): Not much left on the shelf - Energy, the oil's running low, turn up the gas      By KAREN FOSSLI   The era of Norwegian 'elephant' size oil discoveries, as they are known in the industry, is over. While it is too early to write the country's obituary as an oil producer, there is little geological evidence that current levels of oil production can be sustained beyond the decade. Currently western Europe's biggest oil producer, with daily output of more than 2.4m barrels, Norway's ranking would have fallen behind Britain this year had the government not opened the oil taps full-bore, to compensate for a loss in revenue caused by weak oil prices and a weaker dollar. According to forecasts by Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultant, crude oil production will hit 2.67m barrels a day this year and rise to 2.82m b/d in 1995, before peaking at a daily rate of 2.85m barrels in 1996. In 1993, the state's net petroleum revenue comprised slightly less than 10 per cent of total revenue, while petroleum exports accounted for one third of total exports, and related investments represented one third of total Norwegian investment. Petroleum also represented 15 per cent of GNP. Total capital expenditure in the offshore petroleum sector last year peaked at a record estimated NKr60bn, 7.5 per cent of GDP, and may have added substantially to mainland GDP, because oil equipment goods - production platforms in particular - are, for a large part, manufactured by land-based industry. But there is no immediate prospect of any new, significant oil discoveries being made on the Norwegian continental shelf. The last big discovery - Norne, made in 1986 - is expected to yield peak annual production of around 15m barrels of oil a year, just 12 per cent of that of the giant Statfjord field, discovered 20 years ago, at the dawn of Norway's oil age. The size of new discoveries is expected to diminish to an average 20m tonnes of oil equivalent, compared with 90m tonnes for fields now producing, and 40m tonnes for those currently being developed. Earlier this year, the government proposed a comprehensive overhaul of energy policy, and more recently scrapped immediate plans to sharpen petroleum taxes - both moves in a desperate attempt to stimulate petroleum activities to stem the awaited steep decline in oil output. In a white paper presented in March, the government called for exploration acreage to be expanded by 16 per cent, and for reform of rules for exploring in the Barents Sea, to make it more attractive. It also intends to speed up the process for approving oil discoveries for development, and a number of proposals have been made to streamline licensing rules and management of the state's oil and gas resources. Norway has little choice but to stimulate oil activity; not only is output set to decline dramatically, but stiff competition has emerged from oil regions elsewhere in the world vying for investment. For the first time in many years, foreign oil companies operating in Norway are having to fight for funds from headquarters to maintain investment. Several are even undertaking substantial streamlining operations, in which staff levels are being cut sharply. Earlier this year, the French oil company Total announced a strategic reorientation in which it closed its office in Stavanger, Norway's oil capital, retrenched to Oslo, cut staff from 150 to 100 - all to achieve annual cost savings of more than NKr20m. Total has also warned that interest in Norway's next licensing round, for which new acreage will be put on offer next year, will be kept at a minimum unless the country's draconian tax regime is realigned to reflect the reality of current oil prices. In Norway's 14th licensing round last year, both Esso and Shell refused to apply for high-risk acreage, and subsequently withdrew from bidding in protest against stringent operating conditions. Mobil recently announced that it would complete a reorganisation of its drilling department in August, after finishing its last well as operator. 'With no wells to drill, we cannot justify keeping together a drilling group sized as we are to drill wells and accomplish the myriad of other activities associated with being an active operator,' drilling manager Iain Montgomery told staff. Elf Aquitaine this month revealed plans for a dramatic reduction in staff in Stavanger, and numerous other oil companies are reluctant to embark on new development projects while oil prices remain weak and petroleum taxes high. Investment in the petroleum sector is expected to fall by 8 per cent this year, and will decline dramatically within the next two years unless oil companies commit to new projects. Last year, Norway boosted recoverable petroleum reserves by 259m tonnes of oil equivalent to 5.89bn tonnes, but the increase was due to adjustments to reserves of producing fields and discoveries not yet developed, rather than to exploration success. Out of a total of 18 wildcat explortion wells drilled in 1993, just three small discoveries were made, yielding only 9m tonnes. Optimists, however, point out that 60 per cent of the continental shelf has yet to be opened for exploration. What is certain is the success which Norway is achieving in the transition to becoming an important gas-producing nation. Its share of the western European gas market will soon reach 15 per cent. 'While our oil production will probably reach its zenith in the near future, the large investments in gas-field development will lead to a substantial increase in Norway's gas production from 1995 to the year 2000,' says Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister. Gas production is expected to reach as much as 70bn cubic metres by the turn of the century, while gas sales contracts already amount to more than 50bn cubic metres annually. More than half of western Europe's proven gas resources are found on Norway's continental shelf. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, believes that, while the 20th century was the age of oil, the 21st is set to become the gas era, particularly as concern for the environment becomes the driving force behind the growth of gas consumption.

Luis Macas, president of the Confederation of Indigenous  Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the indigenous people  are willing to take up the last resort, adding that the  indigenous people and others residing in the Amazon region could  even seize the wells ``to prevent additional ecological  disaster.''    The Ecuadoran Government today opened the seventh round of  petroleum bids for the exploration and exploitation of 3.2  million hectares in the Ecuadoran Amazon region and offshore  areas. The indigenous people's representative said the  petroleum companies have caused irreparable damage to the  environment and to the life of the inhabitants of the Ecuadoran  Amazon region.    Macas said, ``The Ecuadoran Government is putting the only  green area left in the Amazon region up for bid, and this is the  reason why we have requested a 15-year moratorium on the  bidding.''    The indigenous leader added that the exploitation of  petroleum has been carried out in an irrational manner and  without consulting the people who are most affected -- namely,  the indigenous people and residents of the Ecuadoran Amazon  region. The Conaie president noted that the indigenous people  have filed a suit with the Human Rights Commission of the OAS,  and he added that the international organization is waiting for  the government to send the commission an invitation to inspect  the oil drilling areas.    Ecuador's environmental and indigenous people's  organizations  this morning took over the Energy and Mines Ministry to pressure  the government not to carry out the bidding. They also  requested a meeting with President Sixto Duran-Ballen.     "

The Australian Geological Survey Organization (AGSO) has  released its first report on the petroleum potential of an  offshore area in the Philippines.    The AGSO scientists' report includes 10 new maps, based on  current and previously collected seismic data, and shows the  structure of key horizons at a detailed scale, together with  results of the offshore geochemical survey and analyses of  samples taken from onshore oil seeps and exploration wells.    Findings on three other Philippine offshore basins would be  due for release in March.    ""In the Ragay Gulf Basin, the first of the four offshore  basins, major fault systems controlling the distribution of  hydrocarbon traps are now better understood and have been mapped  more accurately than previously. An important limestone  formation containing possible petroleum source and reservoir  rocks is shown to be much more extensive than was thought  previously, and includes reefal deposits which may provide  attractive targets for future oil exploration. Large potential  hydrocarbon traps in various parts of the basin were mapped with  sufficient accuracy to estimate likely reserves,"" AGSO's project  leader, Dr. Chao-Shing Lee said.    From March to May 1992, AGSO and the Philippine Department  of  Energy conducted a cooperative geophysical and geochemical  survey to evaluate the petroleum potential of four offshore  basins in the Philippines.    The $5 million project was funded by the Australian  International Development Assistance Bureau (AIDAB). A total of  nearly 3,000 line kilometers of seismic and 5,000 line  kilometers of geochemical data was collected using AGSO's  geoscientific research vessel, Rig Seismic.    ""The new-seismic shooting achieved penetration to a greater  depth than previously, allowing improved definition of key  horizons and structural features,"" Lee said.    In geochemical surveying, a towed 'fish' measures the  concentration of hydrocarbons dissolved in sea-water a few  meters above the seabed. Analysis of the hydrocarbons will  determine whether they are ""fossil"" hydrocarbons such as oil,  gas, or condensate escaping from sub-surface rocks, or the  product of recent biological activity in the water column or  bottom oozes.    ""Zones with anomalously high hydrocarbon concentration mark  the sites where hydrocarbons are escaping from the seabed. By  examining these zones in relation to the seismic data, it is  possible to identify areas where hydrocarbons are likely to be  accumulating,"" Lee said.     "

Net income for the quarter was Dollars 666m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, compared with Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1, a year earlier. Excluding one-time net gains of Dollars 53m in the latest quarter and a special charge of Dollars 25m a year earlier, Mobil said operating earnings rose 40 per cent to Dollars 613m, or Dollars 1.50. Mobil's US marketing and refining operations earned Dollars 139m in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 19m a year earlier. The company attributed the improvement partly to better industry margins. Overseas, marketing and refining brought in earnings of Dollars 215m, up Dollars 130m, led by a strong performance in the Pacific Rim. Results in Europe were better than last year, but continued to reflect the impact of recession. Cost-cutting measures also helped earnings. Mobil's domestic exploration and producing earnings fell Dollars 36m to Dollars 110m. A sharp drop in crude oil prices was only partly offset by higher natural gas prices and lower administrative expenses. International exploration and producing earnings dropped Dollars 61m to Dollars 255m reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and reduced European natural gas volumes. Earnings from chemicals slid Dollars 15m to Dollars 9m. The company blamed sluggish economies and industry oversupply for the low margins on polyethylene and films. During the quarter, Mobil's corporate and other expenses rose Dollars 11m to Dollars 47m but financing expenses were Dollars 10m lower at Dollars 68m, reflecting a lower debt level and lower interest rates. Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.05, against Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1 a year ago. Stripping out one-time items in both years, Amoco's operating earnings slipped to Dollars 446m, or 90 cents from Dollars 454m, or 92 cents last year. Lower crude oil prices and production volume depressed earnings from US exploration and production, to Dollars 156m from Dollars 253m last time.

The  jump in gas production will be even greater: from 20.2 million  cubic meters per day to 24.6 million cubic meters per day--a  rise of 22 percent.    It happens that 1993 was not one of the most promising years  for investment in Petrobras, which was working with a limited  budget. Investments by the end of the year totaled about $2  billion, of which something like $980 million was spent to  develop the production of petroleum and natural gas.    But results were better than the company expected, according  to the assistant superintendent of the Production Department,  Bergson Antonio Cajueiro. The company extracted 669,000 barrels  per day, or 6,000 barrels per day more than had been expected  initially.    By the end of the year, the country had produced about 2  million barrels more than expected, with the result that it did  not have to import the equivalent of $32 million worth. Compared  to 1992, petroleum production was up 2.4 percent, and gas  production was up 6 percent.    That performance was due in particular to the fact that the  Bijupira-Salema (Campos Basin) and Caravela (Santos Basin)  fields produced more than expected in Petrobras' initial  calculations. There was also increased operational productivity,  according to Cajueiro.    The stars in petroleum production in 1993 were the Campos  Basin off the Rio de Janeiro coast and the Santos Basin, which  extends from Cabo Frio in Rio de Janeiro to Santa Catarina. They  played an important part in the increase in production and in  reserves, which, according to preliminary Petrobras  calculations, ended the year at 4 billion barrels, or 8.1  percent more than the total of 3.7 billion barrels in 1992.    All indications are that the Campos and Santos Basins will  continue to perform outstandingly in 1994, when Petrobras plans  to invest $1.1 billion to develop our country's petroleum and  natural gas production. The amount scheduled for all Petrobras  deals is $3.4 billion, according to Orlando Galvao, the  company's financial director. Two-thirds of that will be spent  on petroleum exploration and production.    Challenge    Increasing petroleum production from 669,000 barrels per day  to 719,000 is being considered a challenge at Petrobras. After  all, as Cajueiro explained, that will come to 50,000 more  barrels per day, a quite significant amount. Moreover, there  will be the natural decline in production by producing wells. If  nothing is spent to expand production, production will fall from  669,000 barrels per day to 629,000 barrels per day--a drop of  40,000 barrels per day. So in fact, according to Cajueiro's  calculations, Petrobras will have to produce an additional  90,000 barrels per day to achieve 719,000 barrels per day  (40,000 to make up for the natural decline in production plus  the additional 50,000). By the end of the year, assuming an  average price of $16 per barrel (based on 1993 prices through  November), the state firm will have saved $520 million that it  otherwise would have had to spend on petroleum imports. The  major contributors to increased production will be the giant  Marlim and Albacora fields (in the Campos Basin), Caravela  (Santos Basin), and Urucu (Amazon Basin).    If petroleum production of 719,000 barrels per day (on  average) is confirmed by the end of 1994 and if consumption is  on the order of 1.3 billion barrels per day (a conservative  estimate), our country's oil fields will be supplying 55 percent  of our domestic requirements, while the remaining 45 percent  will have to be imported.

Turnover at Pounds 45.9m was 18 per cent lower. Earnings per share fell to 1.84p from 2.76p. The impact of a 21-day maintenance shutdown at the onshore Wytch Farm field and the decommissioning of the Angus offshore field was reflected in last year's average production figure, which slipped to about 12,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (including natural gas) from 13,888 b/d last time. But Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said current production had recovered to 1992 levels and was set to rise to 20,000 b/d within two years. Cash balances stood at Pounds 47.2m at year end, with debt of Dollars 120m. Gearing was 50 per cent. The removal by the government last year of petroleum revenue tax relief on exploration and appraisal drilling was reflected in an Pounds 8.8m one-off exceptional charge. The amount relates to deferred PRT in prior years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said that aside from the exceptional charge, the loss of tax relief on exploration expenditure had been 'offset to some extent by the lower PRT rate'. Analysts said the exceptional charge was the only surprise in the results, which were otherwise in line with expectations. Additional appraisal of finds enabled the company to boost its estimate of proven reserves by 15 per cent. Mr Jamieson said the low oil price environment had caused the company to focus on projects which could lead to an early payback. He said 75 per cent of the company's effort would be aimed at projects which could enhance short to medium term cash flow, with 25 per cent reserved for longer term exploration activity. COMMENT Cuba, Cambodia and Myanmar are just a few of the exotic though difficult locations which have appealed to Premier's explorers So far the strategy of going into difficult countries has worked well. Premier gets good terms and large stakes. If finds are made some of the stake is farmed out topay for development, leaving the company with a good chunk of the consequent production. But if oil prices linger at low levels it can only extend the strategy if the majors which operate many of its producing fields can continue to make significant cuts in their costs.

0,FT921-2097 ,"FT921-2097 _AN-CCTBGAEWFT 920320   FT  20 MAR 92 / Falklands struggle for a new identity: Jimmy Burns surveys the windswept island colony for which Britain fought a war      By JIMMY BURNS   A British soldier recently discovered he had been in Port Stanley, capital of the Falkland Islands, only after he had driven through it. Turning to his passenger, who was also his commanding officer, he commented on the 'village' they had just passed and, as they motored on into the countryside, wondered when they would see Stanley. Indeed, at a glance, it is difficult to understand what all the fuss was about. The islands - that saw an Argentine invasion and subsequent death of more than 1,000 soldiers ten years ago - still look not much different from a scattering of Scottish isles. Stark and windswept, they loom out of the south Atlantic like a geological afterthought. Stanley, where most of the Falklands population of 2,100 is concentrated, has fewer facilities than many smallish European villages: primitively built houses, a single bank and the Upland Goose, which represents the capital's claim to an international hotel but in reality is little more than a glamorised pub. It keeps its clients entertained with nightly videos and a one-page summary of world news. Newspapers arrive several days late. It says much for the abandoned condition of the British colony before the war that the present-day Falklands boasts of economic progress: a new fully equipped hospital and school, a new telephone and road system linking some previously isolated areas, and a new military airport that can be used by wide-bodied jets. No British government, having lost lives to retain the islands, could afford to let them sink into oblivion. Between 1982 and 1987, the kelpers, as the islanders call themselves, found it easy to get subsidies for their business projects: Pounds 30m was channelled from London into the civilian sector and Pounds 3bn was earmarked in defence spending. The programme proved controversial because of some ill-judged investments in projects which in different political circumstances might have been subjected to more careful scrutiny. The Falklands programme has since been streamlined and subjected to more control. As the governor of the islands, Mr William Fullerton, says, the economy has entered a 'consolidation phase.' The real change in the Falklands' economic fortunes has come about thanks to the discovery of squid in the South Atlantic and the granting of fishing licences by the local government to foreign companies. The licences now account for 65 per cent of the islands' operating revenue, even though this is still only a third of what the British Ministry of Defence pays out to maintain its troops on the islands. Thanks to squid, the islands are more self-sufficient than they used to be and less dependent on their traditional wool industry, which over the years suffered because of weak world demand. The new sense of confidence is personified by Mr Terry Betts. In 1982 he was an employee of the Falkland Islands Company, which virtually controlled the local economy but whose substantial landholdings have been broken up and distributed with government assistance to Falklands residents. Its Stanley holdings, including the Upland Goose, are up for sale. Today, Mr Betts and his wife run their own businesses, including several smaller retailing outlets, and have taken shareholdings in some of the foreign companies which have obtained licences. 'We've moved from living within a colonial glove,' he said, 'to having a sense of our own identity. What matters to me is success and economic growth.' The problem for the Falklands is where to go next. Officials believe the islands' licensing regime has reached its maximum potential, balancing the need to increase revenue and the need to conserve stocks on which future revenue depends. In fact, licensing revenue has fallen to Pounds 25m from its peak of Pounds 28m in the 1988-89 season because of more stringent conservation and competition from other fishing areas. One option being considered by the government is broadening the scope of the islands' economic involvement in the fishing industry through development of onshore facilities and a more carefully scrutinised programme of joint ventures. Few kelpers have any direct stake in what is actually fished in their waters, while support facilities are based in the Chilean port of Punta Arenas. There is also growing local interest in the prospect of developing oil resources. London has authorised the local Falkland Islands government to issue seismic exploration licences. At the same time it has embarked on talks with Argentina - at which island officials have been present - with a view eventually to discussing issues such as harmonisation of legislation, enviromental policies and demarcation of zones. No conclusive survey has ever been done in and around the islands, although the offshore seabed has long been rumoured to hold large oil reserves. However, any serious oil development in the islands could well provoke considerable environmental and political problems and thereby revive the issue of sovereignty.

Revenues for the quarter were down marginally at Dollars 9.7bn, against Dollars 9.75bn. For the whole of 1992 Texaco's net profit slumped by 45 per cent to Dollars 712m (Dollars 2.37 per share). This figure, however, included a Dollars 300m charge for changes in accounting principles. Revenues for 1992 were Dollars 37.7bn, down from Dollars 38.3bn in 1991. Mr James Kinnear, outgoing Texaco chief executive, said that beyond special charges, the decline in 1992 profits occurred primarily from soft market conditions for refined products, crude oil market conditions and a generally difficult business environment. But he added that in 1992 Texaco realised cash savings of about Dollars 500m from reductions in operating and overhead expenses. Texaco said its fourth-quarter operating income before taking the charges was Dollars 416m, up from Dollars 295m in the last quarter of 1991. Despite tax benefits of Dollars 40m, the fourth-quarter net profit was depressed by special charges. These included a special write-off of Dollars 34m caused by property damage from a fire at Los Angeles refinery and Hurricane Andrew. In addition, there were Dollars 58m of payments for staff severance payments and Dollars 64m for charges associated with asset-writedowns and reserves for environmental clean-up matters. Operating earnings from US petroleum and natural gas exploration and production in 1992 were Dollars 543m, down from Dollars 605m. Non-US exploration and production operating profits were Dollars 416m in 1992, against Dollars 421m in 1991. Manufacturing and marketing operating income in the US was Dollars 276m in 1992, against Dollars 188m in 1991, and Dollars 300m outside the US, down from Dollars 647m in 1991. Total capital and exploration spending in 1992 was Dollars 3.15bn worldwide, against Dollars 3.57bn in 1991.

0,FT931-3057 ,"FT931-3057 _AN-DCQCCAG3FT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mixed blessings for oil industry - Petroleum Revenue Tax      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE OIL industry was caught by surprise yesterday by the extent of the chancellor's changes to the tax regime in the North Sea. He proposed a sharp reduction in the Petroleum Revenue Tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for existing field and its elimination for new fields. But he also said tax allowances for the industry would be sharply reduced. Few in the industry had been expecting a significant overhaul of petroleum taxes and many producers were in disarray about whether they would lose or gain from the move. But the tax changes are likely to affect the way in which companies operate in the North Sea and raise the prospect of a substantial reduction in exploration in the area. In spite of the fact that some companies will see substantial gains from the changes, many North Sea operators were infuriated by the move which they believe will place an extra burden on the industry when oil prices are low and costs high. Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group: the UK Offshore Operators Association, said: 'We're very concerned at the enormity of the change - it will decrease the amount of exploration in the North Sea and add to the cost burden the industry is facing.' Mr Hughes said that exploration costs for many companies could quadruple as they will be unable to write them off against Petroleum Revenue Tax. In the past, many companies have been able to fund their entire oil drilling programmes by reclaiming PRT they have previously paid on producing fields. This is why the regime cost the treasury Pounds 200m in 1991 to 1992. But some large North Sea operators such as British Petroleum which pay a lot of PRT on producing fields will benefit from the new tax regime. City analysts reckon that the reduction in the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent along with other tax changes could add as much as Pounds 130m to Pounds 140m to BP's profits. Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, estimates that BP will make a profit of Pounds 725m this year. The PRT benefit could increase its profits by 20 per cent next year. Shell is also likely to benefit by about Pounds 40m a year, he estimates. However, smaller exploration and production companies which have traditionally written off their exploration costs against PRT will be badly affected by the move. In addition, under the proposed changes, companies such as Lasmo and Enterprise Oil will not be able to transfer tax allowance benefits between fields in the North Sea so that they offset part of their development costs for new fields against tax paid on producing fields. The UKOOA challenged the chancellor's figures for revenue he expects to raise from the tax changes. Mr Lamont said the changes will raise Pounds 300m in 1994 to 1995 and Pounds 400m the year after. However, Mr Hughes believes the figues will actually be much higher. He said it could cut down the extent to which companies want to become involved in North Sea exploration. 'This will mean companies have to review their commitments to the next licensing round (for oil exploration acreage) and some partnerships could fall apart under the strain,' he said. The North Sea last year reached a production peak of over 2m barrels of oil a day and the chancellor is clearly hoping that the tax changes will not deter too many companies from exploration and production.

Speaking to mining executives at PNG's annual geology, exploration and mining conference in Lae, Mr Kaputin indicated that after the large ADollars 1.2bn (USDollars 857m) Lihir gold mine project was finalised, there would be a moratorium on further mining project decisions. 'Let me advise you that after this project (Lihir), we will hold everything and I have been instructed to use the next six to 12 months to come up with a new policy,' Mr Kaputin said. 'I am not, at this stage, in a position to let you know what my terms of reference are going to be, but we will be visiting a number of countries to examine their respective mining and petroleum policies in order to re-examine our own national policies.' Already, the PNG government has kept the international investment community on tenterhooks over Lihir. Originally, there were hopes that the necessary special mining lease for the project - a joint venture between Britain's RTZ group and Niugini Mining, which is controlled by Canada's Battle Mountain - would be granted by the government at the beginning of 1994. However, the matter has subsequently been bogged down in the PNG cabinet for months, with the dispute apparently centred on whether the state-owned Malaysian Mining Corporation should be brought into the project at an early stage, and what share of the equity should be given to local landowners. Mr Paias Wingti, PNG's prime minister, recently told parliament that the deal would be concluded 'properly and . . . at the right time'. He added that 'we will not be pressured by lobby groups.' The decision by Mr Kaputin, who took over the mining portfolio in a ministerial reshuffle at the beginning of this year, to put future projects on hold while he reviews PNG's mining policy seems likely to jeopardise further PNG's already-strained relations with parts of the international investment community.

0,FT932-17180 ,"FT932-17180 _AN-DDACLAICFT 930401   FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (15): Ambitious agenda for new team - Oil's longstanding problems are being tackled      By PAUL ADAMS   THE ENERGY sector is in need of an overhaul, and the new ministerial team led by Chief Philip Asiodu is determined to get the process under way in the short period at their disposal. Mr Asiodu, one of the leading technocrats on the transitional council, is the secretary for petroleum resources, and is highly regarded in the oil business. He has been associated with the industry for three decades, and has begun to tackle problems which, in the words of one oil man, 'have been holding back the industry for years'. Mr Asiodu and his colleagues are scheduled to hold office only until August, but he has nevertheless set an ambitious agenda. By then he aims to sign up foreign oil companies to develop new fields, get the multi-billion liquefied natural gas project off the ground after three decades of false starts, introduce sustainable domestic fuel prices, and free up the downstream and distribution sectors to foreign and private sector investment. If he achieves most of these aims, or commits the succeeding government to achieving them, 1993 will have been a turning point for the oil industry. Nigeria's budgeted oil revenue this year is Dollars 6.3bn, which is 80 per cent of the country's foreign currency earnings; but it sells fewer barrels of oil than it did in 1980, when the price was more than 50 per cent higher. Nigeria is even richer in gas than in oil, yet this resource has yet to be adequately tapped. The reasons include: inappropriate state regulation to limits on the percentage that foreign investors can hold in oil companies; downstream investment obstacles, such as loss-making domestic petroleum prices; and an inefficient local distribution system. One of these factors - the structure of the ownership of the oil industry - is putting a strain on the funding of production and exploration. Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) holds a majority stake in all the joint ventures that produce oil (which in March was just under 1.8m b/d. Yet NNPC - whose contribution to production and exploration should be proportionate to its equity stake - has said it intends to increase productive capacity from the present level of 2m b/d to 2.5m b/d by the mid-1990s, so that it can increase its Opec quota, assuming the market picks up. Nigeria's proven oil reserves are approximately 20bn barrels, but the majority of the oil fields are small and have wells producing between 500 and 5,000 b/d. Around two-thirds of Nigeria's production is onshore, mostly in the swamps of the Niger Delta, and all offshore fields are in shallow water. The next major area for exploration is in deep water concessions, as much as 4,000 feet deep. 'That is frontier territory,' says Jim Massey, Mobil's exploration and production director in Nigeria. 'Not much of the world's oil production is even at 2,000 feet deep. 'Under the production-sharing agreement, we would be purely a contractor with no equity. When we found oil we would recover our costs and then split the profits with NNPC on a sliding scale.' Mobil, like the other oil majors, stresses the importance of the Memorandum of Understanding, which in 1986 underwrote profitability for NNPC's equity partners at Dollars 2 a barrel, at a time when oil prices were very low. The agreement was amended to allow Dollars 2.5 a barrel, subject to sufficient investment, but provides no scope for extra reward based on high efficiency when the oil price is more buoyant. The draft production-sharing contract does provide such incentives, but forces the international oil companies to bear all the risk. Ashland of the US already has such a contract, but since 1991 a number of big oil companies have been negotiating for rewards to justify the cost of working in deep water. Among those interested in deep-water blocks is BP, in partnership with Statoil, ending an 11-year absence following nationalisation of its assets. Questioned about production sharing, Mr Asiodu replied: 'Once you have reached a taxation regime of over 80 per cent, the theoretical ownership of 60 per cent of the equity, as opposed to having a contractor working for you, brings minimal extra benefit', he said prior to issuing a third draft of the terms. 'So exploration sharing is better for us because we can save what little money we have for more pressing needs.' Among pressing needs is the improvement of efficiency in the downstream sector. Although NNPC has four domestic refineries with an installed capacity of over 400,000 b/d, one has been out of action since it caught fire in 1989, and the sector is running at about 50 per cent of capacity. Mismanagement and lack of funding due to very low domestic fuel prices have led to a crumbling distribution system and petrol shortages. Corruption and smuggling into neighbouring Benin, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, where domestic fuel prices are about ten and 20 times higher, has exacerbated the problem. The Transitional Council believes the solution lies in lifting the fuel price subsidies. On March 15, it reduced subsidies on non-conventionals - that is base oils, lubricant oils, paraffin wax and aviation fuel. These measures, and a three-month campaign explaining to the public the arguments against the fuel price subsidy, are in preparation for the raising of the price of petrol and diesel, with the inevitable inflationary effect and the threat of riots in response. Privatisation of downstream assets is unlikely to bring the same enthusiasm from the big oil companies as the sale of NNPC's upstream equity, but if fuel prices are raised substantially, the way could be open for new investment to transform the marketing and distribution of petroleum products. Publication of guidelines and incentives for investment in gas-related and petrochemicals products is imminent. The government is forced to meet the rising cost of the Eleme petrochemicals plant, which plans to start exporting polyethylene and polypropylene early in 1994. At the same time, it has to fund Nafcon 2, the next fertiliser plant, the LNG project, and the gas-gathering venture with Chevron to produce Liquefied Petroleum Gas at Escravos.

By 27 December, the China Petroleum and Natural Gas  Corporation had fully met its state plan for the output of oil  and natural gas, and the total annual output of crude oil was  139.2 million tons, 1.037 million tons above last year's figure,  and the natural gas output was 15.4 billion cubic meters, up 290  million cubic meters from last year. The China Offshore  Petroleum Corporation produced 4.60 million tons of crude oil,  up 0.73 million tons from last year. This outstanding  accomplishment enabled China to maintain its rising position  among the world's main petroleum producers.    Beginning this year, the continental oil fields brought  about  a favorable situation in which east and west are keeping pace  with each other. The eastern region, as represented by the  Daqing oil field, vigorously implemented the ""stable oil output  and control of water consumption"" system engineering project and  posted an annual output of 55.90 million tons of crude oil, up  0.244 million tons from last year. In the west, all oil fields  strove to create favorable conditions, increasing their crude  oil output by 1.739 million tons compared with last year.

Although political pressure for a government climbdown was mounting, senior Treasury figures said the industry should not expect any changes to its proposals. The comments followed suggestions that the government might be prepared to go some way towards addressing the industry's concerns by fine-tuning the transition arrangements, particularly to meet some of the objections over the retrospective nature of the changes. The oil industry is finding it difficult to present a united front against the changes because there are some companies that stand to gain substantially in terms of increased cashflow. Nevertheless, the industry seems united over one issue - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies say they applied to the Department of Trade and Industry for licences to explore in the North Sea on the understanding that the rules would not change. As part of the application process they committed themselves to drill a certain number of wells. Some suggest that they could not fulfil these obligations without tax relief. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said that if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells they could still apply for tax relief. But oil companies want that undertaking to cover 'firm commitments' they have made to drill wells. The Treasury yesterday dismissed these arguments and suggested there was no legal requirement for oil companies to stick to exploration targets agreed with the DTI. The new rules will lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea, a change that will hit many of the small independent companies hard. The industry suggests that the changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea. Oil operators are warning that they will have to scale down exploration severely if the changes go ahead. A survey found that 85 per cent of oil companies expected job losses to result from the changes.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

A year earlier, Exxon had net earnings of Dollars 1.3bn, or Dollars 1.03, including non-recurring gains of Dollars 158m. Revenues fell 2.3 per cent to Dollars 27.26bn from Dollars 27.91bn in the first three months of 1992. Mr Lawrence Rawl, outgoing chairman, said the company's reduced operating expenses helped staunch earnings erosion in the quarter in spite of sluggish economic conditions in Exxon's leading markets. On Wall Street, shares in Exxon fell Dollars 1 5/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/4 yesterday. During the first three months of 1993, Exxon benefited from higher crude oil prices and higher sales of chemical products.

Although a joint official statement maintained that talks held in Buenos Aires had been 'cordial', the two sides remain far apart. Argentina, which still claims sovereignty over the South Atlantic islands despite its defeat by Britain in the 1982 Falklands conflict, has previously co-operated over the setting of fishing limits. Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentina's deputy foreign minister, yesterday denied reports that Buenos Aires had unilaterally declared a quota of 220,000 tonnes, but confirmed it 'believes there is no problem aiming for the maximum catch possible'. He said scientific reports indicated that levels of fish around the islands were such that there was no need to repeat last year's bilateral agreement, in which the Argentines and Falkland islanders agreed to limit their catch as 'the resource was becoming scanty'. The British government is likely to consider provocative a statement by Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, late on Wednesday night. He said: 'Last year we did not catch (our full quota of) 220,000 tonnes, but this year we will do so because our scientific information indicates that this will not affect the biomass.'

Mr Mark Rayner, the CRA executive responsible for Papua New Guinea (PNG), confirmed yesterday that he had made the sale offer last week in discussions with Mr Masket Iangalio, PNG's mining and petroleum minister. Mr Rayner said CRA effectively had two conditions on any mine handover to PNG. One was that the sale would only be made to the rightful land owners and the other was that CRA retained secure exploration title to Mt Kare's hard rock mineral resource. CRA reportedly plans to offer participation in any hard rock exploration programme at Mt Kare to partners in the country's Porgera gold consortium. CRA's sale offer has come amid an intensified power struggle between more than 6,000 groups of competing land owners at Mt Kare. But reports of the offer in the Australian press on Monday brought a stinging response last night from Mr Paias Wingti, PNG prime minister. Mr Wingti accused 'vested interests' of starting a media campaign aimed at diverting his government from a review of 'iniquitous agreements' over the country's mineral resources. 'The activities of one or two of the major Australian-based interests here now in Papua New Guinea in seeking to divide or disadvantage our people over resource projects amount to a threat to our sovereignty,' Mr Wingti said.

Another big oil company, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., reported  that earnings fell 16%, while independent producer Ashland Oil Co. said its  earnings more than doubled in the quarter.    New York-based Exxon earned $1.1 billion in the three months ended June 30,  compared to $140 million in the 1989 quarter. Revenue totaled $26.08 billion,  up 10% from $23.61 billion a year ago.    Last year's results included an $850-million provision for the Valdez spill.  Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990 million in the 1989  quarter.    Arco's second-quarter earnings fell to $391 million from $467 million in 1989.  Sales of the Los Angeles company fell 7% to $4 billion from $4.3 billion.    Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., reported record net income of $100 million for  the quarter ended June 30, 1990. The amount was more than double the $44  million in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last year's quarter.    Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said earnings from petroleum and natural gas  operations increased $205 million, or 22%, despite lower crude prices. He said  that helped offset a $115-million drop in chemical earnings.    Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were $81 million, down  from $289 million in 1989. But earnings from foreign exploration and production  operations rose $75 million to $464 million.    From coal and minerals operations, Exxon earned $12 million, compared to $22  million last year.    For the first half of 1990, Exxon earned $2.38 billion, up 22% from $1.95  billion in 1989. Revenue rose 15% to $52 billion.    The 1989 results included an $880-million provision related to the Valdez  accident and a $535-million cumulative accounting gain following adoption of  new income tax accounting standards.

Another big oil company, Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., reported  that earnings fell 16%, while independent producer Ashland Oil Co. said its  earnings more than doubled in the quarter.    New York-based Exxon earned $1.1 billion in the three months ended June 30,  compared to $140 million in the 1989 quarter. Revenue totaled $26.08 billion,  up 10% from $23.61 billion a year ago.    Last year's results included an $850-million provision for the Valdez spill.  Without that, Exxon said, it would have earned $990 million in the 1989  quarter.    Arco's second-quarter earnings fell to $391 million from $467 million in 1989.  Sales of the Los Angeles company fell 7% to $4 billion from $4.3 billion.    Ashland, based in Ashland, Ky., reported record net income of $100 million for  the quarter ended June 30, 1990. The amount was more than double the $44  million in 1989. Sales were $2.2 billion, the same as in last year's quarter.    Exxon Chairman L. G. Rawl said earnings from petroleum and natural gas  operations increased $205 million, or 22%, despite lower crude prices. He said  that helped offset a $115-million drop in chemical earnings.    Earnings from U.S. exploration and production activities were $81 million, down  from $289 million in 1989. But earnings from foreign exploration and production  operations rose $75 million to $464 million.    From coal and minerals operations, Exxon earned $12 million, compared to $22  million last year.    For the first half of 1990, Exxon earned $2.38 billion, up 22% from $1.95  billion in 1989. Revenue rose 15% to $52 billion.

0,FT931-1331 ,"FT931-1331 _AN-DCYCKAEWFT 930325   FT  25 MAR 93 / BP defends oil tax from attacks: Rig owners reject BP claims  -Warning of further closures / Capacity exceeds orders      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRITISH Petroleum yesterday attacked claims by other oil operators that tax changes announced by the chancellor in the Budget would severely curtail North Sea activity. But oil rig owners said yesterday that four drilling programmes had already been cancelled since last Tuesday, when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, proposed to reduce the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to abolish tax allowances for exploration and appraisal work. Today representatives from Amerada Hess, the North Sea exploration company, are to meet Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury. The company, one of the most active in North Sea exploration, has threatened to halve its exploration programme this year if the government insists on its proposed changes to the tax regime. The divergent views of the winners and losers in the largest overhaul of North Sea taxes for 10 years are generating a serious row in the oil industry over how to respond to Mr Lamont's proposals. Mr John Browne, ex-ploration director at BP, said the attacks on the proposed changes by the UK Offshore Operators' Association, the industry group, were 'hasty and inappropriate.' Mr Browne said the tax reforms were overdue. The taxpayer had spent 30 years subsidising what has sometimes been wasteful oil exploration. BP says the proportion of wells drilled which result in commercial oil finds has dropped in the past five years from one in four to one in seven. The proposals would give exploration work a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective, he said, and the reduction in the tax rate for existing fields would encourage companies to improve recovery of oil. 'Even the most efficient fields leave 40 per cent of the oil in the ground. Many of those older fields would be nearing depletion by the end of the decade. They will now have a longer life,' he said. One analyst estimated that the industry as a whole could recover 500m to 1bn barrels from existing fields given the incentive of lower taxes. BP is a net beneficiary of the changes - analysts estimate they could add as much as Pounds 140m a year to its profits. The company has the third-largest drilling programme in the North Sea and is set to spend Pounds 90m on exploration this year. Mr Browne said much more oil could be recovered from existing fields than will be found in small discoveries of 10m to 20m barrels. He said the changes would help bring new areas, such as the recent west-of-Shetlands discovery, on stream more quickly. However, owners of drilling rigs have written to Mr John Major, the prime minister, and to Mr Lamont warning of the consequences of the proposals. Mr Mike Salter, chief executive of Smedvig, a drilling rig operator, and chairman of the British Rig Owners Association, said the proposals would increase the number of rigs idle and crews out of work. He said 40 per cent of drilling rigs in the North Sea were already idle. Exploration work fell 32 per cent last year because of low oil prices and high costs.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

The restructuring will be provided for in a CDollars 369m (USDollars 318.1m) after-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 1991. Mr Wilbert Hopper, chairman of the Calgary-based company, said yesterday: 'We are not counting on a major recovery in demand for refined petroleum products and we expect continued intense competition for market share.' Petro-Canada's main competitors are Imperial Oil, a subsidiary of Exxon, and Shell Canada, controlled by Royal Dutch Shell. The domestic industry's sales of refined petroleum products slipped by 7 per cent last year, following a 2.7 per cent fall in 1990. Over the next 6-18 months, Petro-Canada will cut 80,000 barrels a day in refining capacity, mainly at plants in British Columbia and Ontario. It is also seeking a joint-venture partner or buyer for a refinery in Montreal. The company also plans to close or sell one-third of its 3,200 retail and 340 wholesale outlets. It has already sold a number of exploration properties and reduced capital spending in line with a 50 per cent shortfall in expected cash flows last year. The refining and marketing business lost CDollars 106m in the first nine months of last year. The company said the division will post a small operating loss, before the special charge, in the fourth quarter. Petro-Canada was created as Canada's national energy company during the mid-1970s energy crisis to give Ottawa a window on the oil industry. It grew mainly by buying assets from foreign-controlled oil companies, including BP and Belgium's Petrofina.  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

To meet China's need for foreign cooperation in the  extraction of petroleum resources, China follows international  practice by drawing on the experience of some of the world's  petroleum-producing countries and by constantly perfecting and  enriching China's tax policy for foreign cooperation in  petroleum as well as its laws and regulations. China has  initially formed a set of regulations for foreign cooperation in  petroleum that contain clear measures, which play an important  role in attracting foreign capital and promoting the prospecting  and exploration of petroleum resources. In 1991 China completed  the reform of its income tax system for enterprises in which  foreign businessmen had invested and for foreign enterprises. At  the end of 1993 China carried out the largest reform of its tax  system since the founding of the PRC, with the focus on  reforming the circulation tax and on reforming the income tax on  domestic venture enterprises and individuals. For China's  petroleum corporations and foreign petroleum corporations, the  main point was the abolishing of the consolidated industry and  commerce tax and the changes in the collection of the value  added tax, business tax, and consumption tax.    To maintain the continuity and stability of the tax policy,  so that it is more advantageous to attracting foreign capital  and promoting the opening up to the outside world, the Fifth  Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee passed the  ""Decision on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax,  Consumption Tax, and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which  Foreign Businessmen Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises.""  On the basis of this decision the State Council issued a ""Notice  on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, Consumption Tax,  and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which Foreign Businessmen  Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises."" In the decision and  notice, provisions were specially made for the tax issue with  regard to Sino-foreign cooperation in the extraction of  petroleum resources, the main parts being: ""The collection in  kind of the value added tax on petroleum and natural gas  extracted from Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields is at a  rate of 5 percent; and, in line with the existing stipulated  collection of the mining area use fee, the value added tax will  temporarily not be collected, and when the value added tax is  being calculated there will be no deduction on the income tax.  When crude oil or natural gas is exported, there will be no  drawback. The oil (gas) fields at sea exploited by the China  National Offshore Oil Corporation will be run in accordance with  the abovementioned stipulations.""    The stipulated tax preference is mainly embodied in:    1. The industry and commerce consolidated tax on crude oil  and natural gas extracted in Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas)  fields has been changed to a value added tax, but the tax in  kind will continue to be collected. A tax in kind on crude oil  and natural gas is not exclusive to China, but rather is the  current practice of the main petroleum-producing countries of  the world. Mainly out of consideration that petroleum is a major  source of energy, the governments of petroleum-producing  countries should, through tax measures, control part of the  petroleum reserves. Now, because of the output of Sino-foreign  cooperative oil (gas) fields, the tax in kind on crude oil is  entrusted to the cooperative oil (gas) fields for selling in a  lump and putting in storage according to the actual sales value.  The principle of collection of a tax in kind is understood and  accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies.    2. After the value added tax was put into effect, its rate  on  crude oil was 17 percent and its rate on natural gas was 13  percent. In order not to increase the tax burden on Chinese and  foreign petroleum companies because of the tax system reform,  the State Council notice decided that the value added tax on  crude oil and natural gas extracted in the Sino-foreign  cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea would be at a rate  of 5 percent. This decision has three advantages for the Chinese  and foreign petroleum companies:    One advantage is that it is consistent with the principle of  China's circulation tax at the 5 percent level on petroleum  resources extracted by foreign countries. This principle has  been accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies, and it  has become an important provision in the petroleum contracts  signed by the Chinese and foreign sides. The second advantage is  that, under the new tax system, when crude oil and natural gas,  on which there is a tax rate of 5 percent, is sold domestically,  because objectively the funds held by the bying side are reduced  (mainly the funds held by the buying side for income tax, the  crude oil and natural gas of the Sino-foreign cooperative oil  (gas) fields and those at sea possess a superiority in the price  aspect. The third advantage is that, because likewise there is  no drawback on the export of crude oil, the crude oil of the  Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea only  bear 5 percent of the circulation tax, and before the crude oil  is exported it bears 17 percent of the domestic circulation tax,  the Chinese and foreign petroleumn companies possess competitive  strength in the export of crude oil.    3. Still according to the existing stipulated collection of  the mining area use fee, the natural resources tax will  temporarily not be levied. The levying of a mining area use fee  confirms to international practice, and it is accepted by  Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. China's collection of  the mining area use fee is at an above-quota graduated fee rate;  at-sea oil (gas) fields in which the annual crude oil total  output does not exceed 1 million tons and the annual natural gas  total output does not exceed 2 billion are exempt from the  mining area use fee. The main purpose of this exemption is to  encourage the development of small oil (gas) fields at sea and  to formulate special policies for them. Similarly, for a  medium-sized oilfield at sea that has an annual output of 1  million tons, if the mining area use fee is levied but  temporarily the natural resources tax is not levied, then it  possesses the advanatage that the Chinese and foreign petroleum  companies at this field will get every year a small sum of money  to help pay the 8 million-yuan tax.    Summarizing what has been said above, because in the past a  preferential tax policy was given to Chinese and foreign  petroleum companies, including the continued retention of  import-export and other preferential policies, the Chinese and  foreign petroleum companies will not, because of this reform of  the tax system, have their tax burden increased; conversely,  because the tax system reform makes China's tax system more  rational, the fact that the level of collection management is  constantly rising and the tax preferences are becoming more  marked is bound to further promote the opening of China's sea  and land petroleum resources.

The China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) says its overseas  operations are advancing as scheduled.    In the meantime, it says, conditions are suitable for  opening  new areas for petroleum exploration and development.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Zhang Yongyi, CNPC's  vice-president, cited the example of old oil wells in Peru that  have been upgraded by Chinese technicians and are now producing  more oil.    CNPC signed a contract with Petrol Peru last year for  further  development of a 182-square-kilometre block in an old oilfield.  Production at the oilfield, which was discovered in 1874, has  declined after more than 100 years of exploitation.    CNPC, which produces some 140 million tons of crude oil a  year, has mature technology and enough equipment for enhancing  oil recovery, Zhang said.    In a couple of North and Latin American nations, CNPC is  conducting seismic work, Zhang revealed.    In Thailand, CNPC has made progress in developing oil.  Another CNPC official said Chinese are doing preparatory work  for constructing an oilfield.    In Papua New Guinea, CNPC will explore for oil in one block  code- named 160 and another named Kamusi. CNPC is teaming up  with companies from Japan and Hong Kong in the exploration.    After leading a business group to the Central Asian nations  of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan last  month, Zhang said new fields for cooperation will be opened  there. Zhang was travelling with a Chinese Government  delegation headed by Premier Li Peng.    Zhang believes prospects for Chinese co-operation with the  four republics are good since the needs of all five countries  are complementary.    Two letters of intent for closer ties were signed by CNPC  and  the petroleum sectors of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.    More co-operation is expected in the exploration,  development  and trade of crude oil and natural gas.    According to the letters of intent, technical exchanges and  visits to oilfields will be more frequent than before.    CNPC and Turkmenistan reaffirmed their desires to work  together, along with the Japanese industrial conglomerate  Mitsubishi, to develop natural gas.    Construction of a pipeline is being considered to carry  natural gas from Turkmenistan to Japan by way of China. Gas  resources in Turkmenistan are estimated at 20,000 billion cubic  metres.    Zhang cited several advantages for CNPC in improving  petroleum cooperation with Central Asia:    -- Proximity, which ensures convenience in co-operative  exploration, development and trade;    -- Chinese technology, engineering and experience, which  suit  the needs of the four nations;    -- Similar economic and social conditions, which enhance  mutual understanding as the five countries make the transition  from rigid central planning to market economies.

0,FT931-697 ,"FT931-697 _AN-DC2BZABWFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Spoils of the North Sea   ANY TAX reform as sweeping as the chancellor's new fiscal regime for North Sea oil inevitably creates winners and losers. The more important question is whether it creates the right incentives to ensure that maximum economic benefit is extracted from the dwindling energy resources that remain. Since the present arrangements are excessively complex, incorporate inadequate incentives for companies to control costs, and are ill-designed for a period in which many North Sea oil fields are reaching maturity, the reforms probably have more to commend them than the complaints of the smaller oil producers might suggest. But if form is any guide, they will not produce quite as stable a long-term regime as the chancellor predicts. Under the old regime, only a small number of fields paid PRT at all and most of these were older fields. This was because exploration and appraisal costs could be off-set against the income from existing fields, thereby reducing or eliminating the charge to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and corporation tax. The effect was to cut the cost of exploration and appraisal to less than 17p in the pound, which provided a powerful incentive for drilling activity. But the tax take from existing fields, which suffered from a combined rate of royalty and tax charges of just over 85 per cent, provided a countervailing disincentive to further development. As a result there was a risk that substantial energy resources would be left untapped. This has led to suggestions from some larger companies, which are responsible for about 80 per cent of the development of existing fields, that the exploration tail has been allowed to wag the development dog. It has also led to a great deal of lobbying. Underlying logic In his budget package, the chancellor appears to have bought the big companies' argument. A reduction in the rate of PRT from 75 per cent to 50 per cent means that the combined tax rate for those existing fields that pay royalty and corporation tax as well as PRT will fall from 85 per cent to nearer 70 per cent. And it is hard to quarrel with the underlying logic, given that the current rate of PRT was set when the oil price was three times higher in real terms and costs were significantly lower. The more difficult question is whether the accompanying abolition of PRT relief on exploration and appraisal costs, together with the switch to corporation tax on new fields, will lead to an undesirable reduction in the amount of exploration activity. Unhappy timing North Sea exploration has already been falling for predictable reasons: the odds on drilling successfully, according to British Petroleum, have gone from one in four to one in seven over the past five years. Exploration is understandably gravitating to more attractive prospects elsewhere. Judging by the initial reaction of many independent oil companies, this trend will accelerate. But the fact that the PRT regime has actually been costing the exchequer money poses a question about whether the government may now be subsidising sub-optimal investment in the North Sea. Certainly the reforms mean that future exploration will be more cost conscious; but because the prize to be had from developing new fields will be greater under corporation tax rules than before, the Treasury's calculation must be that drilling will continue where the prospects of significant finds are best. From negative PRT revenues of Pounds 200m in 1991-92, the Treasury expects an inflow of Pounds 300m in 1994-5 and Pounds 400m thereafter. It is nonetheless worrying that the hard-pressed independent sector, which has performed a useful role in the North Sea, is being so obviously disadvantaged relative to the giants of the industry - and hardly surprising that independent companies are distrustful of the Treasury's motives. The timing of the chancellor's move also looks unhappy, given the adverse job consequences at a time of rising unemployment. That said, the broad thrust of the tax reforms is right for a North Sea that is reaching maturity. But if the suspicion that the Treasury's revenue calculations are based on over-optimistic assumptions about the future level of exploration proves right, the new corporation tax regime will no doubt grow complications just as readily the old PRT did.

Recovered Oil and Recovered Oil Systems       Today's rule deals primarily with the status under RCRA Subtitle C of recovered oil which is returned to the petroleum refining process. ``Recovered oil'' is a generic term that applies to secondary materials consisting primarily of oil such as oil separator skimmings from plant wastewaters, slop oil and emulsions, oil skimmed from ballast water tanks, and oil from refinery process units (    e.g.,     off-specification process streams). As explained in detail below, today's rule excludes from the definition of solid waste recovered oil from petroleum exploration and production, petroleum refining, and transportation incident to either of these activities, when the recovered oil is reinserted into a petroleum refining process. The exclusion does not apply to recovered oil generated from petroleum operations downstream of refining such as marketing or retail sales_because this oil is already excluded for the most part, as discussed below _, or from non-petroleum industry operations.   This rule also does not exclude hazardous sludges (such as wastes K048, K051, or F037) or other similar wastes from regulation. Distinguishing between these wastes and recovered oil is sometimes difficult. Factors EPA will consider in making this distinction include water content, solids content, and potentially, metals content. See generally 50 FR at 49170 n. 16 (Nov. 29, 1985). EPA repeats, however, that the salient characteristic of recovered oil is the obvious one: that it consist primarily of oil.   Used oil also is not a type of recovered oil, and hence remains subject to the applicable regulations for used oil. See generally 59 FR 10550 (March 4, 1994). The only exception is when     de minimis     quantities of used oil are incidentally captured by refinery wastewater treatment systems. This could occur, for example, when small leaks, spills, or drippings of used oil from machinery, pumps, or other refinery equipment during normal operations are lost to the wastewater treatment system. In these instances, the used oil present in de minimis quantities in wastewater is not subject to the used oil standards. See generally 57 FR at 41566 (Sept. 10, 1992).   The objective of a recovered oil system is to gather and recycle oil generated throughout the refinery, or (to a lesser extent) generated from off-site sources.    4     Recovered oil operations almost always occur in tanks, usually a series of tanks that successively purify the oil to the point where it is sufficiently clean and dewatered to be inserted into the petroleum refining process. 53 FR at 525. Some oil is collected directly from process units and sent by means of pipes or vacuum trucks to the refinery's dedicated oil tanks. Occasionally this recovered oil is of sufficient purity that it can be inserted directly into the refining process with little or no treatment in the recovered oil system.             4     See RCRA Docket No. F87SWRPFFFFF, submission by the American Petroleum Institute on ``Recovered Refinery Oil System'', April 16, 1993.        Recovered oil from plant wastewater operations is most often a water-in-oil emulsion, which is sent first to tanks where gravity separates much of it into oil, emulsion, and water layers. The intermediate layer of emulsions then may be sent to other tanks where it will undergo further emulsion-breaking treatment (    e.g.,     mechanical centrifuging, heating, or chemical additives). At the end of each stage, the separated water is returned to the refinery oil/water separators, while the oil is either further treated or, if sufficiently dewatered, is returned to one or more refinery process units. These may include crude oil distillation or catalytic cracking units.    5             5         Id.          G. Status of Wastewater Streams, Wastewater Treatment Units, Recovered Oil, and Recovered Oil Systems Under Current RCRA Rules       Under present RCRA regulations, petroleum refinery wastewaters upstream of a wastewater discharge that is subject to regulation under Sections 307(b) or 402 of the Clean Water Act, are solid wastes. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(1) and (2). Such petroleum refinery wastewaters are hazardous if they exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, or are listed hazardous wastes (although there are presently no specific hazardous waste listings for petroleum refining industry wastewaters). Petroleum refining wastewater storage and treatment operations generate a number of listed hazardous wastes. In particular, sludges from primary treatment operations are listed under the generic F037 and F038 listings. Sludges from Dissolved Air Flotation (DAF) wastewater treatment units and API separators (particular types of primary wastewater treatment devices) are listed as wastes K048 and K051, respectively. Slop oil systems generate listed wastes as well: slop oil emulsion solids are listed as K049. Also, EPA is studying additional petroleum refining wastes as part of a listing determination required by RCRA 3001 (e)(2).   In addition, petroleum refineries typically generate large volumes of wastes that exhibit hazardous waste characteristics. Individual wastewater streams upstream of wastewater treatment may exhibit the Toxicity Characteristic, particularly for chromium, lead and benzene (see 40 CFR 261.24), or the characteristics of corrosivity or ignitability (40 CFR 261.21 and 261.22, respectively). These wastewaters may also contain other hazardous constituents that are not part of the Toxicity Characteristic. See Tables in Section V, Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category.     Sludges generated from secondary or tertiary wastewater treatment also may exhibit one or more hazardous waste characteristics.   Tanks storing listed wastes which engage in primary wastewater treatment operations are presently exempt from federal Subtitle C regulation because they are wastewater treatment units (    i.e.     tanks). 40 CFR 264.1 (g)(6) and 265.1 (c)(10). Hazardous wastes removed from those units are subject to regulation upon exiting the tanks.

The Kelpers are scheduled to begin the  process at the end of the year, with or without Argentina's  approval.    The date for reopening the negotiations (which have been  frozen since 1992) was agreed between Foreign Minister Guido Di  Tella and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd during a meeting  in London on 3 March. Negotiations will be carried out within  the so-called Argentine-British High-Level Group which has been  inactive since negotiations failed in 1992.    Di Tella was scheduled to make a private visit to London  this  coming weekend, but he brought the date forward to 10 March  despite the fact that President Carlos Menem was still in Spain.  His haste to meet with Hurd was reportedly due to the fact that  the meeting was going to take place before this month, but he  still did not have British approval, which was only granted on 3  March.    Di Tella and Hurd also agreed to negotiate through  diplomatic  channels during the time remaining before the meeting -- which  must be carried out in Buenos Aires -- in order to formulate a  basis for a prior agreement to guarantee some positive results  at the key meeting.    One of the hurdles -- beside the conflict over sovereignty  that is being kept under the framework of the so-called  protective ""umbrella"" -- is to define the reaches of the term  cooperation.    -- So far, although it is not a definitive answer, Great  Britain understands that the term only supposes the exchange of  information and the willingness to act jointly to protect the  environment.    -- Argentina, however, thinks that the term supposes  participation in oil exploration and exploitation within the  area controlled by the British.    During the London meeting Di Tella mentioned a topic that is  indirectly related to the Malvinas Islands. He mentioned to  Hurd ""Argentina's concern"" over Great Britain's increasing  political and military relations with Chile.    The Argentine foreign minister mentioned the one-week visit  future Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma is scheduled to make  to London and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's  visit to Chile, among other things.    Hurd's answer was that Perez Yoma was invited before he was  named minister and that Thatcher is no longer a member of the  British Government.    Hurd affirmed that London does not want to drive any wedge  between Argentina and Chile; on the contrary, it is interested  in good relations between the two Latin American countries.    The Chilean question was only a side issue of the meeting's  central topic: Oil. Di Tella knows that the issue will be  essential for the success or failure of his Malvinas policy.    The Kelpers are ready to call for bids on the licenses to  begin exploring and exploiting for oil by the end of the year,  if negotiations in May fail.    This is why leading Foreign Ministry officials are thinking  of discussing the issue with U.S. Vice President Al Gore when he  visits Buenos Aires at the end of the month, as CLARIN announced  on 2 March.    What diplomats seem not to have been taken into account is  that Gore supports ecologist concepts which oppose all  ""off-shore"" drilling, due to their negative effects on the  environment. In any case, to play the North American game now  seems premature, unless you believe that the May negotiation  will not succeed due to the distance separating the two parties.     "

This is a shot in the arm for the flagging oil sector, which is suffering from persistently low oil prices. They are the type of projects the chancellor intended to encourage when he announced changes to petroleum revenue tax rules in the Budget. Both projects stand to benefit from the tax changes - some analysts reckon the new rules have added Pounds 100m to the value of BP's Forth field, which it announced it would develop last Friday. In addition, the lower tax rate will give Shell an added incentive to go ahead with the extensive plans it revealed on Tuesday to extend the life of its Brent field. But both projects were planned long before the tax changes and would probably have gone ahead anyway. Because of the long lead times required for large investment decisions in the North Sea, many oil companies fear the full effects of the changes will not be evident for many years. By that time, they argue, exploration will dwindle and it will be too late to entice it back by changing the rules again. The new rules lower the rate of tax paid on existing fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it altogether for new fields. They also remove tax relief on exploration and appraisal work in the North Sea which will hit many of the small independent companies hardest. The Treasury estimates that the rule changes will raise Pounds 700m over three years. But this forecast has been challenged by Wood MacKenzie, the Edinburgh-based industry analyst, which estimates the revenue increase to be Pounds 115m over the same period. The industry agrees that the tax changes will quadruple the cost of exploring in the North Sea and this has caused an outcry in the oil industry. But the new rules have also led to a row between companies that stand to gain from the proposals and those that will lose. British Petroleum is one of the winners. Wood MacKenzie reckons that the new rules will improve its cashflow by Pounds 412m or 14 per cent over three years. Companies such as Amerada Hess stand to lose the most  - an estimated Pounds 83m or 10 per cent knocked off its cashflow until 1996, according to Wood MacKenzie. The split between winners and losers has made it very difficult for the industry to formulate a joint response to the government's proposals and this has undoubtedly weakened its case. The Treasury sees little justification for making changes to the new rules. But there is one issue that has united the industry - the retrospective nature of the tax changes. Companies applying for acreage to drill in the North Sea must make presentations to the Department of Trade and Industry in which they sketch out their plans for exploration. As part of this they will agree to drill a certain number of wells over a specific period of time. 'We make these commitments in good faith that the rules at the time will stay in place,' said Mr David Keith, managing director of Seafield Resources, one of the smaller UK exploration companies. Companies are calling either for a transition period during which tax relief will still apply to wells they are committed to or to be released from the obligations made under previous licensing rounds. Under the present arrangements, if companies do not drill the wells to which they are committed, the government can take away their exploration licences. The DTI has yet to respond, but it has sent a letter to companies asking if they want to revise their bids made for the 14th licensing round, the results of which are due to be announced in a couple of months. It is the independent oil sector that will be most severely affected by the new rules and many say they are looking to move much of their exploration effort overseas. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director of British Borneo, one of the small UK exploration companies, sums it up: 'This will greatly curtail future exploration activity which is needed to find the next generation of new fields. It will decimate the drilling contractors and in the long run, will shut down much of the North Sea much sooner than we would have expected.'   Companies:-  Shell Transport and Trading.

Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo had had 'a hell of a year. I think we have now come of age.' The company increased its oil and gas revenues by 56 per cent to Pounds 28m. Mr Gaynor said British-Borneo had maintained its exploration success rate of 40 per cent for the third consecutive year. It intended in the current year to step up investment in exploration, particularly in the US, from about Dollars 18m a year to up to Dollars 30m. The changes to the petroleum revenue tax introduced in the last budget had made the North Sea a less attractive option. Exploration costs were some four times higher as a result, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo had doubled investment in the US to about Dollars 9m in the year just ended, helping it to benefit from the 15 per cent increase in the average US gas price during the year. Part of the revenue improvement was due to becoming an operator, as opposed to being a hands-off investor, for the first time, Mr Gaynor said. British-Borneo was beginning to see opportunites to build up its oil assets in light of the weak price. Any acquisitions and investments would be funded through cash flow, Mr Gaynor said. Income from the group's portfolio of oil and gas investments fell from Pounds 7.2m to Pounds 5.4m. However, the group realised some Pounds 4.3m from the portfolio which ended the year with a market value of Pounds 19.3m. The dividend was maintained at 4.433p, for a steady total of 7.1p.

The two owners of the two vessels will be dealt with  according to ROC fishing laws which mandate punishment for  illegal operation in foreign economic zones, COA Fisheries  Department Director Li Chien-chuan said.    Li said that the fishing licenses for the ships may be  suspended or revoked.    The owners of the ships were not available for comment on  the  incident, in which an Argentine Navy corvette opened fire on the  Chin Yuan Hsing Saturday, forcing the crew to escape the sinking  vessel in lifeboats.    About 110 Taiwan fishing boats are reportedly fishing for  squid near Argentina and the Falkland Islands. Of this number,  Li said, sixty have signed fishing agreements with the Falkland  Islands and 13 with the Argentine Government which allow them to  fish in territorial waters.    The remaining 37 squid boats have not signed the accords and  can only fish on the high seas, he said. They are prohibited  from fishing in Argentine or Falkland Islands territorial waters.    The Argentine Navy has been strictly enforcing a ban on  illegal fishing and will continue to do so, Li added.    Meanwhile, a report from Buenos Aires said that the crew of  the Chin Yuan Hsing was rescued by the Chin Chuang Hsing, which  is still somewhere on the high seas.    The Chin Chuang Hsing was expected to return to Port  Stanley,  Falkland Islands on Saturday afternoon, but remained on the high  seas through late Sunday.    A medical team has been sent to the port to await the Chin  Chuang Hsing and treat any injured sailors, the report said.     "

The concession, formerly held by Belco, was taken over by the state after a 1985 contractual dispute. Settlement of an insurance claim by American International Group is still outstanding. Petrotech, registered in Delaware, is part of the New York McAllister Brothers group. Its current operations focus on Venezuela and the Gulf of Mexico. Through a subsidiary, International Marine, it has maintained a presence in Peru for ten years, servicing the Petromar offshore field. Two other international companies - Hallwood Petroleum of the US and Compania Naviera Perez Companc of Argentina - pre-qualified to bid. Petrotech will take an average of almost 79 per cent of all crude produced, leaving 21 per cent for Petroperu, the state-run petroleum giant. The concession for the 400-hectare lot Z-2B will run for ten years with an option to renew for a further ten. Output from the field has slumped since the Belco days, from a peak of 30,000 barrels a day to an all-time low last year of less than half that. In recent months, despite a dearth of equipment and spare parts, output has risen to 17,000 b/d. The concession is an important step in the planned privatisation of Petroperu. According to Mr Jaime Quijandria, the company's president, 'the most attractive part of the field lies in the 50 per cent still unexplored. And while that exploration goes ahead, the new operating company will be earning cash from the half that's already working'. Contract terms require Petrotech to drill at least 40 development wells over the next three years and five exploration wells by the year 2000. Petrotech officials estimated drilling costs at Dollars 80m and Dollars 20m respectively. The operator will also pay Petroperu Dollars 10m a year for the lease of existing assets. Another Dollars 30m to Dollars 60m will have to be spent on repairs and modernisation. Meanwhile, other advances were made in the transformation Petroperu. Three weeks ago, New York-based Booz, Allen and Hamilton was contracted to advise the Peruvian government on an overall privatisation strategy for the oil sector. And ten days ago Great Western Resources, through its Peruvian affiliate, signed an exploration agreement with Petroperu for Block 65 in the Maranon basin. It is the company's first ever venture outside the US. The Belco insurance claim remains unresolved. While AIG tacitly agreed to the re-leasing of the ex-Belco field, sources said that the dispute, involving Dollars 185m in compensation and already recognised by the Fujimori government, had by no means been dropped.

The 36-strong standing committee that will consider the Finance Bill appears to contain a majority of MPs in favour of changing the government's Budget proposals in line with a suggestion by Mr John Butterfill, the Tory MP for Bournemouth East. Mr Butterfill has tabled an amendment to the bill that would provide some transitional relief for oil companies affected by the changes. The relief would be paid for by levying for a limited time a higher rate of petroleum revenue tax than the government proposes. But ministers insisted yesterday, ahead of today's Commons debate, that PRT would be cut from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, as set out in the Budget, and that tax relief for exploratory drilling would be abolished. The government indicated that its proposals would be enacted even if changes passed in committee had to be reversed at the report stage. Some companies have said that the government's changes would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 40,000 jobs. Ministers are understood to be sympathetic to the arguments advanced by the offshore supply industry, which fears the consequences of diminished exploration activity by their oil company customers. But ministers believe many of these companies are large and sophisticated enough to follow oil producers to other exploration sites if necessary. Ministers also argue that the supply industry will benefit from the surge in production they expect to follow enactment of the proposals. Some support for this view came yesterday when British Petroleum said it would bring forward a Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2bn oil development project because of the proposed PRT changes. The company said yesterday its plans had been given 'significant impetus' by the tax changes. The project, which involves BP and eight other companies, will develop nine oil and gas fields containing 650m barrels of oil and 1,200bn cubic feet of gas. The improvement in the economics of the project mean production will start in 1998. BP said that under the old tax regime three of the fields would have paid PRT, making them less profitable. The government is also expected to argue today that changing its proposals now would penalise companies whose forward-planning had accommodated what was announced in the Budget. It is likely also to argue that the tax has actually cost the Treasury some Pounds 900m in the past two years. Gamble in the North Sea, Page 17   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Guido Di Tella, foreign minister, said Argentina would pay an unidentified 'third country' to remove the mines, which dot large swathes of land outside Port Stanley, the islands' capital. A Foreign Ministry official said this might be done in co-operation with the UN. British officials have welcomed the offer 'in principle' but said it raised complex questions. They noted that Argentina kept no maps of minefields or records of the quantity of mines laid. Furthermore, the plastic mines are difficult to detect, and their detonators deteriorate with time, making explosion unpredictable. The offer is part of Mr Di Tella's so-called 'charm offensive' to overcome the Falklanders' deep suspicion of Argentina. He has broadcast to the islands, met Falkland councillors in London and sent Christmas gifts to inhabitants. However, on Monday, the 161st anniversary of the British occupation of the Falklands, the Foreign Ministry restated Argentina's 'inalienable rights to sovereignty' over them.

Although the Treasury said no new government spending would be involved, the change means that companies will find it easier to claim the Pounds 200m in aid which was earmarked - with tight restrictions - in the March Budget. But the amendments proposed by the Treasury may not go far enough to stem a backbench rebellion and the government may be forced to make further concessions. Mr John Butterfill, one of the leading Tory campaigners against the original Budget proposal, called the concession a very small move in the right direction. Mr John Watts, the Tory chairman of the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs, welcomed the move but said he hoped the government could be persuaded to move a bit further. The proposed changes to petroleum revenue taxes announced in the Budget caused a furore among many smaller companies in the oil industry because they abolished relief for exploration work. Companies said it would lead to a halving of exploration activity and the loss of up to 30,000 jobs. But larger companies such as British Petroleum welcomed the proposed reduction in the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent. The Treasury yesterday admitted its original Budget proposals had made it too difficult for companies to claim transitional help to cushion them from the initial effects of the tax changes. In yesterday's amendment, the government said it would allow companies to claim up to Pounds 10m each until the end of next year for exploration work that will be affected by the abolition of tax relief. Mr Butterfill said he and others would press for the relief to be extended until 1996. 'It's a helpful step but far too modest,' he said yesterday. 'It will help one or two companies but it won't solve the fundamental problem.' Companies will be able to claim interim relief on wells they had committed to drill as part of obligations made to the Department of Trade and Industry in order to win licences to explore in the North Sea. The DTI was understood to be pushing the Treasury to loosen its restrictions on transitional aid. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said this week that applications for seven blocks in the latest oil licensing round had been withdrawn as a result of the PRT changes and that some companies had scaled back the number of wells they planned to drill. Backbenchers are likely to discuss the change with the oil companies before deciding how much further to press the government.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

But Mr Alfred McCrane, chairman, warned: 'The international petroleum industry is faced with continuing uncertain world economic conditions, as well as the oversupply of crude oil,' which has pushed oil prices down by Dollars 3 a barrel since May. He added that attention to controlling costs and other operational improvements 'will be particularly important in the forward period'. Post-tax profits reached Dollars 309m, or Dollars 1.10 a share, compared with Dollars 151m, or 49 cents, a year ago. First-half net income was up from Dollars 383m (before the effect of a Dollars 300m charge reflecting an accounting change) to Dollars 587m. second-quarter operating profits of Dollars 419m, up from Dollars 294m, were bolstered by Dollars 163m from oil and gas exploration and production in the US, up from Dollars 112m on the back of natural gas prices which recovered from low 1992 levels. Upstream activities abroad returned an operating profit of Dollars 82m, against Dollars 46m, after benefiting from higher production in the Middle East and Indonesia. Refining and marketing operating profits fell from Dollars 77m to Dollars 63m in the US, reflecting 'excess supplies of refined products' on the US east and Gulf coasts. The international downstream operating result, aided by stronger margins in Latin America, rose from Dollars 61m to Dollars 120m. Petrochemicals suffered an operating loss of Dollars 7m (a Dollars 2m profit a year ago) due to higher feedstock and energy costs. Lower interest costs and cost-cutting reduced non-operating expenses by Dollars 53m to Dollars 210m. Higher natural gas prices also boosted Occidental Petroleum, pushing second-quarter net income to Dollars 75m, or 21 cents a share, up from Dollars 50m, or 16 cents, in the same period of 1992. Net income for the half year was Dollars 155m, against a loss of Dollars 87m last time when the company took a Dollars 93m charge for an accounting change. Second-quarter operating profits from oil and gas of Dollars 130m, up from Dollars 79m, were boosted by Dollars 55m from a tax refund and disposal of a stake in Trident NGL. In 1992, figures had been lifted by Dollars 35m from a litigation settlement. Amoco, the US oil and gas group, exceeded analysts' expectations with second-quarter net income of Dollars 487m, or 98 cents a share, compared with Dollars 216m, or 43 cents, before restructuring charges a year ago. The figures were boosted by higher earnings from US exploration and production, due mainly to higher gas prices, and an improvement in costs in refining and marketing, said Mr Laurance Fuller, chairman. Due to higher gas prices, operating profits from US exploration and production rose to Dollars 293m before a Dollars 63m charge for environmental clean-up costs, from Dollars 154m in the 1992 quarter. Lower exploration costs and favourable exchange movements pushed operating profits on foreign upstream activities to Dollars 53m, compared with a loss of Dollars 27m a year ago. First-half operating income was Dollars 830m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, compared with Dollars 473m, or 95 cents, a year ago, before the effects in 1992 of charges related to restructuring and accounting changes.

Gurr, 49, who joined the Tec after spending many years in industry, says that running a Tec demands a complex range of skills which are applicable to his new job. 'The key to the job is running the government as a business, while stimulating local entrepreneurship and ensuring sustainable growth in the economy,' he says.

It also unveiled plans to float a minority interest in its American subsidiary in the US. The assets are being acquired by Bridge Oil (USA), the company's existing US vehicle, which is currently 100 per cent owned by the Australian parent. They include producing natural gas and oil properties in the Anadarko Basin in Oklahoma, in the Texas Panhandle, and other smaller interests in Wyoming and central Texas. Bridge said that the properties currently contain about 56.8bn cu ft equivalent of net proved and probable reserves, worth ADollars 60m. The exploration acreage, costing ADollars 16m, totals about 9.2m acres in the western US, the bulk of which offers exploration rights for up to 13 years and conversion into long-term production leases if a discovery is made. The company plans to fund the deal via a mixture of cash and shares - including the delivery of a 10 per cent interest in Bridge Oil (USA) to Santa Fe Energy. The initial public offering of shares in Bridge Oil (USA), which is conditional on regulatory approvals, will involve 4m shares, and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to fund a ADollars 67m dividend payment to Bridge Oil itself. After the flotation, it is estimated that around 28.57 per cent of Bridge Oil (USA) will be owned by the general public; 10 per cent by Santa Fe; and the remaining 61.43 per cent by the parent Bridge Oil company. Bridge Oil became involved in the US petroleum industry in 1981, expanding in the late-1980s. In January 1990, it spent ADollars 147m on a package of producing properties from USX Corporation.

Concession contracts to operate and explore marginal fields will be offered in late September or early October. Marginal fields are defined as those that now produce less than 1 per cent of Ecuador's total output. Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, believes that reserves and production in these fields can be increased significantly with only modest investment. Under the current administration's oil policy Petroecuador's limited investment funds are to be utilised to develop the country's principal fields. A team of specialists is evaluating each of the 10 wells to be offered for bidding. The studies will determine precise investment requirements, which for now are estimated to total USDollars 60m. 'This is a low-risk investment,' says Mr Bernardo Perez of Petroecuador's contracting office, 'because the fields are already producing and much of the infrastructure is in place.' The oil fields combined proven reserves total more than 100m barrels but are expected to increase following exploration efforts. The operating cost per barrel of crude oil varies between Dollars 1.45 and Dollars 6. Under the newly devised contract the current output of each field will continue to go to Petroecuador and the contractors income will be generated by increasing production. The winning bidder will be the company that offers the state the highest percentage of the additional output and the largest investment. If the contractor proves unable to increase production within two years, the concession will be terminated and the field will have to be returned to state control. Part of the contract, which is to last for 20 years, will also allow for oil exploration in the immediate vicinity of the existing well sites. Newly discovered reserves will be remunerated over a fixed compensation period. Infrastructure or machinery installed by the contractor will become state property after the contract expires. The announcement of this latest bid comes only months after 10 petroleum companies won the right to explore and produce oil in over 2m hectares of Amazon rain forests.

Exxon reported net income of Dollars 1.35bn, or Dollars 1.07 a share, down from Dollars 2.24bn, or Dollars 1.78, in the same period of 1991. However, Mr Lawrence Rawl, Exxon's chairman, noted that net income had been up more than 20 per cent from the Dollars 1.12bn recorded in the 'more typical' fourth quarter, in spite of lower crude realisations, a weak US market for natural gas and softer economic conditions in many markets. He said the results had benefited from stronger natural gas sales in Europe, improved earnings from worldwide chemicals operations, overseas tax credits and asset sales. Operating volumes were strong, with liquids production, natural gas production, refinery runs, petroleum product sales and chemical sales all higher than in the first quarter of last year. US exploration and production made Dollars 125m, down from Dollars 150m, while foreign production earned Dollars 785m, up from Dollars 721m. Refining and marketing profits slumped from Dollars 256m to Dollars 23m in the US, and from Dollars 1.097bn to Dollars 450m abroad. Chemicals saw profits dip from Dollars 123m to Dollars 87m in the US and from Dollars 100m to Dollars 63m abroad. Texaco reported net income of Dollars 200m, or 68 cents, compared to Dollars 415m, or Dollars 1.51, in the first period of 1991. Revenues dipped from Dollars 10.2bn to Dollars 8.6bn due to lower prices, offset only slightly by higher sales volumes for refined products. Mr James Kinnear, Texaco's chief executive, said world economic weakness had lessened demand for crude oil and petroleum products, with a 15 per cent drop in crude prices since the first quarter of last year. He said Texaco intended to maintain its strong financial position and was reducing its planned capital expenditure for the year by 10 per cent. Meanwhile, Occidental Petroleum, the Los Angeles based group undergoing a broad restructuring, reported net income of Dollars 98m, or 32 cents a share, down from Dollars 136m, or 45 cents, in the first quarter of last year.

At present, Petrobras is keeping three probes busy  drilling wells in the Santos basin, and a fourth will be  installed next week.    ""The goal of this effort is to find alternatives to the  Campos Basin in Rio (the company's main drilling site). The  potential for new offshore petroleum discoveries in the Santos  basin is very high,"" said Dimas Dultra Simoes, assistant  superintendent of operations for Petrobras's exploration  department.    According to Simoes, the Santos basin has an estimated  potential of 200 million barrels of oil equivalent. The fields  already discovered in that basin are Tubarao, Coral, Estrela do  Mar, Merluza, and Caravelas. One of the producing wells in the  Caravelas field, 1-BSS-64, has the highest flow rate of any in  Brazil, contributing about 10,000 barrels of petroleum a day.    Of the three wells now being drilled, the 1-BSS-74, located  180 km off Sao Sebastiao, on the Sao Paulo coast, is the first  deepwater well in Sao Paulo. It is 1,140 meters deep. ""That well  is in the final drilling stages. Within the next several days,  we will find out if there is oil there,"" Simoes said. The other  two wells are the 1-BSS-72 and the Caravelas, an extension of  the Caravelas field.    The Santos basin has also shown good prospects as a source  of  natural gas. The Merluza field has an average production of  600,000 cubic meters of gas per day and a potential to reach the  2 million cubic meter/day level. The field has proven reserves  of 13 billion cubic meters of natural gas.    According to Simoes, interest in exploiting the Santos basin  increased after the seismic data survey done by ship from 1992  to early 1993. In that effort, which involved an investment of  $15 million, a radiography was made of the subsoil, surveying  the best sites to drill wells. ""At the moment, Petrobras is  studying an integrated project to boost production in the  basin,"" he said.     "

In an interview, Mr Di Tella said: 'We would be willing to pay some kind of compensation in exchange for Argentine sovereignty, but we do not want them to be paid to get out of the islands.' Mr Di Tella did not mention a figure, but implied it could be substantial. He said former UK government adviser Alan Walters had proposed a similar solution to the dispute over the islands, which led in 1982 to a 74-day conflict between the two countries.

However, Mrs Sharon Halford, a Falklands councillor, said: 'I don't think this would be viewed very favourably. Money is not everything. If they bought someone out, where would they go?' Mr Di Tella denied that payments would be made to encourage people to leave the Falklands and settle elsewhere. He said, 'We want to be very respectful of these 2,000 people.

Chen Bingqian, CNOOC's vice-president, was quoted as saying  the two sides can join their efforts in ""whatever forms are  acceptable to both.""    He made the remark at a meeting with a delegation from  Taiwan's China Technical Consultants, Inc., whose members are  mainly from Taiwan's China Petroleum Corporation.    Chen told the delegation that CNOOC has forged links with  leading oil producers all over the world in the past decade and  struck 95 contracts and agreements with 54 oil companies from 13  countries on offshore oil development.    However, he said, ""It is a great pity that our counterparts  across the Taiwan Straits have been deprived of such  opportunities.""    The 11-member team from Taiwan is visiting the mainland to  study the petroleum and petrochemical industries in the coastal  areas and seek ways to co-operate.    Chen said co-operation between the mainland and Taiwan can  take many forms. The CNOOC can co-operate with the Taiwan  corporation directly or with its overseas subsidiaries; it can  co-operate with conglomerates grouping the Taiwan corporation's  overseas subsidiaries and foreign companies; and it can also  co-operate with independently-registered overseas companies  formed by the Taiwan corporation and foreign firms, he proposed.    He welcomed the corporation to render technical services for  the offshore operations carried out by the CNOOC and its foreign  partners.    The two sides can concentrate co-operative efforts on oil  exploration in the Taiwan Straits, the southwestern offshore  basin of Taiwan and the Chaoshan Depression, blocks in the East  China Sea and other offshore areas of interest, he added.    The vice-president also briefed the delegation on the  development of the CNOOC and its co-operation with foreign oil  companies at the request of the guests, the informed source said.    The delegation, at the invitation of the China Petrochemical  Corporation (Sinopec), arrived in Beijing January 6 to start a  month-long survey of oil and gas exploration and development,  oil refining, and the production and sale of petrochemical  products in the coastal areas.    According to the source, the team members showed enthusiasm  in raising questions and seeking co-operative projects.    The two sides reached agreement on enhancing exchanges  across  the Straits to end more than 40 years of isolation and find new  ways for co-operation.    Chen also asked the delegation to convey the greetings of  CNOOC President Wang Yan to the heads of the Taiwan corporation,  and said he hoped for early formal high-level contacts between  the two sides.    It was reported that the Taiwan corporation's leadership has  announced considering flexible approaches for cross-Straits co-  operation and has been working actively in this regard.    The source said many indications suggest a softening of  Taiwan's policy on investment flow to the mainland, which gives  rise to a ""cautiously optimistic prospect"" for co-operative oil  exploration.    The delegation is scheduled to end its survey February 5  before returning to Taiwan.     "
0,FT943-6372 ,"FT943-6372 _AN-EH3EIAA8FT 940830   FT  30 AUG 94 / Falklands rivalry tests quick tempers: Diplomats in Buenos Aires must learn the mating and migratory habits of squid      By JOHN BARHAM   Argentina reacted furiously when the UK government last week announced a seemingly innocuous decision to extend control over a 547 square mile patch of ocean outside fishery control areas around the Falkland Islands. The Argentinians declared they would not 'tolerate, accept and much less consent' to the move. The UK claimed poachers used this so-called 'Gap' area as a bolt-hole. Even though the Gap lies within Falklands territorial waters, British officials say they tried to discuss the issue with Buenos Aires all year. The Argentinians kept postponing talks and the British decided to act unilaterally. President Carlos Menem angrily said he would send patrol ships into the Gap, even though it lies outside Argentina's 200-mile territorial limit. Although he played down the issue later in the week, the Falklands remain a contentious and sensitive issue. British diplomats posted in Buenos Aires must master the intricacies of fishing data and develop a thorough understanding of the mating and migratory habits of Illex squid, the islands' main resource. The Illex travels through Argentine and Falkland waters, so both sides now hold talks to share the catch. They have learned to co-operate over protecting squid, to preserve what has become a very big industry. They swap catch data, establish quotas and keep each other posted about the position of poachers. Although Falklanders sneer at Argentina's inability to patrol its waters effectively, the coast guard is notoriously aggressive. Trigger-happy captains often pepper poachers with gunshot. Last May, a Taiwanese ship sank after fleeing into Falkland waters when a coast guard cutter fired on it. Licence sales are a vital revenue source for the Falklands. This year's fish licence sales of Pounds 24.1m make up nearly two-thirds of government revenues. However, this is a far cry from the boom years of the 1980s. In 1989, the islands raked in a record Pounds 28.8m from fisheries. Next year, the islands do not expect to sell more than Pounds 16.6m worth of licences. The main reason for this is competition from Argentina which recently launched a rival licence regime of its own, selling 60 licences this year, priced to undercut the Falkland licences. Furthermore, this year's Illex season was exceptionally bad. Ships caught only 67,000 tonnes in Falklands waters against an historical average of 165,000 tonnes. Both Argentina and the islands closed the Illex season early to preserve the stocks. In addition, a fisheries agreement between Argentina and the European Union has led to a big increase in catches. The pact allows European vessels to enter Argentine waters once closed to foreign ships in exchange for grants and privileged access to EU markets. Brussels wants to find new fishing grounds outside European waters, mainly to benefit Spain's big fishing fleet. In 1993, 915,500 tonnes of fish were caught in Argentine waters, 126 per cent more than five years earlier. Although these statistics are not reliable, they do indicate a rising trend in fishing effort. Argentina now exports more fish than beef. Fish export revenues last year rose 18 per cent to Dollars 660m. Hake accounted for nearly half Argentina's 1993 catch of 422,000 tonnes, an increase of 14 per cent over 1992. Squid volumes rose 150 per cent to 194,000 tonnes. But Mr Julio Torre, the editor of Redes, a fishing trade publication, warns: 'Catches are reaching their limits for several species, especially hake. Blue whiting and squid are also approaching their limits. For the first time, this region is reaching its limit.' Although fishing has become a big earner for Argentina, its under-funded and overstretched navy, air force and coast guard are unable to prevent poaching. It is anyone's guess how much fish is really caught in the South Atlantic.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     FKZ  Falkland Islands.

But in a move which could lessen potential conflict between London and Buenos Aires over the issue, Falkland Islands officials have agreed to allow results of the survey to be made available to oil companies operating in Argentina. The UK Foreign Office is expected soon to give its formal seal of approval to the licensing arrangements between the islands' government and the two companies, Spectrum of the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New York-based energy services group Schlumberger. Both companies were picked from a list of groups that had expressed an interest to the British Geological Survey, the UK government-funded research organisation which is advising island officials. Under draft arrangements approved by the Falkland Islands government, the companies will spend more than Pounds 7m on high-technology seismic work expected to be completed by October 1993. Revenue from the results' sale will be shared between the companies and the Falklands government. The work will be carried out within a 200-mile zone around the islands. Mr Ronald Sampson, chief executive of the Falkland Islands government, said the islands had a policy 'to do our own thing within our own waters'. But the decision to make the work available commercially is in part a concession to the Buenos Aires government.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Wang  Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), said  co-operation with foreign governments and companies, unfurling  offshore as well as onshore, will take more flexible forms.    In an interview with Business Weekly, Wang said a wide range  of joint ventures is to be forged to tap the country's petroleum  resources.    Wang revealed that Chinese and international oil firms are  working on possible joint ventures in upstream as well as  downstream operations.    Big projects can be expected to begin immediately once  approved by the government,    China's oil industry, which annually produces 144 million  tons of oil and 16 billion cubic metres of natural gas, has  absorbed $15 billion in overseas investment over the past 16  years.    Wang is leading a 54-member Chinese delegation to the 14th  World Petroleum Congress opening today in Stavanger, Norway.    Wang said the oil delegation, the largest the country has  ever sent abroad, will promote Chinese views and ideas on  overcoming global challenges in energy development.    China, which is to host the 15th World Petroleum Congress in  Beijing in 1997, expects important information to emerge in  Stavanger.    The Chinese delegates are to cultivate foreign countries'  views on energy development and discover new measures for  protecting the environment.    ""We hope exchanges on a wide range of topics in Norway will  help pave the way for greater foreign co-operation,"" Wang said.    He praised China's oil development over the past 15 years,  saying foreign co-operation has helped raise operations to a new  stage.    Chief among the accomplishments are that:    --About one-fifth of the country's land has been opened to  foreign oil exploration and development.    Foreign co-operation started 15 years ago in the country's  offshore areas, and was extended onshore last year with the  opening of international bidding for exploration in the Tarim  desert basin in XinJiang Uygur Autonomous Region.    Wang said exploration contracts with foreign firms are being  carried out.    Encouraged by China's open policies, foreign firms are not  only exploring virgin territory but are also enhancing the  recovery of oil in existing oilfields.    More than 70 foreign oil firms from 15 countries have  applied  for another round of bidding for onshore operations. Results of  the bidding are due within three months.    The foreign firms expect to explore 26 blocks and start 11  enhanced-recovery projects.    --Co-operative projects in oil refining and petrochemical  manufacturing are expected to satisfy the rising demand in  China, which anticipates 9 per cent economic growth in the next  seven years.    --Foreign companies will also work with Chinese on  engineering, technical research and equipment manufacturing.    Last year, CNPC signed $206 million worth of contracts for  engineering and labour services abroad. The volume equalled the  total for all of the 1980s.    --Preparations for overseas oil operations and financing are  under way.     "

However, group operating revenue rose to NKr1.26bn from NKr1.09bn, helped by higher petroleum production which rose to the equivalent of about 1m tonnes of oil. Operating profit fell to NKr280m from NKr393m. The reduction in operating profit was due largely to lower oil prices compared with the first quarter of 1991, which was affected by the Gulf war. There were increased costs relating to expansion in exploration activities and higher field depreciation. A royalty in the Oseberg (oil field) was also reflected in increased costs, the company said. Saga did not detail exploration costs but said that depreciation had risen by NKr81m to NKr279m. Group operating expenses rose to NKr977m from NKr694m. First-quarter crude oil sales were lifted to 6.4m barrels from 5.1m barrels in the same period last year. Saga said that it obtained an average sale price of NKr114 per barrel of oil in the first three months compared with NKr136 last year. To improve the company's financial structure, Saga said it issued a NKr1bn bond with a 10-year maturity in Norway in January. Exportfinans, the export credit guarantee bank owned by the commercial banks, reported a 19 per cent improvement in first-quarter operating profit to NKr87m from NKr73m last year. Exportfinans explained the increase was due to improvements in asset management and non-recurring income from certain financial transactions. The company said that as a result of balance sheet growth, its capital adequacy ratio declined from 21 per cent at year end to 16.7 per cent at end-March. Loans disbursed in the first quarter were 15 per cent up on last year and totalled NKr598m. Of that, about 65 per cent was extended on market terms while 35 per cent was government-supported credits. The grant element of mixed credits in 1992 was increased by NKr250m to NKr340m. This, and the adjustment of regulations governing maturities and the proportions that could be financed, provided the industry with a greater opportunity for contracts, the company said. It said there was increasing interest in export credits on market terms for exports to industrialised countries.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

You find one, in a semi-derelict state, that has been shut down by the public health authorities. How long does it take and how much money do you need to turn it into an award-winning purveyor of food and drink? For former truck salesman, John Milligan, the answer is 12 years and the surprisingly small sum of just over Pounds 150,000. From handing over Pounds 41,000 for a partly decrepit building in Great Tew, Oxfordshire, Milligan has been rewarded with the latest Good Pub Guide naming his Falkland Arms the best village pub in Britain. The path from partly-wrecked building to thriving business has not been easy. At one stage, Milligan faced 14 summonses for doing internal conversion work without planning permission on what is a Grade I listed building in a Grade I listed village. Great Tew is so quintessentially English, it could be straight off a 1930s film set. He was forced to take out a bank loan to cover a Pounds 20,000 back-tax demand and for which he is now suing his former accountants. A fire last month caused Pounds 10,000 of damage to the kitchen and suspended the Falkland Arms' trade in food and accommodation for three weeks. After obtaining an engineering degree in Belfast, Milligan joined Ford and then Godfrey Davis as a truck salesman. He bought a pub in Hertfordshire in 1976. Then he saw in the Morning Advertiser that the Falkland Arms was up for sale. His bid was accepted at auction. All the money for the purchase came as a loan from Allied Irish Bank. Milligan retained his first pub and had Pounds 18,000 of his own money to spend on the new venture. The Falkland Arms had been shut six months earlier. 'I decided it would not have been worth getting in a surveyor to look at it, it was so bad. Part of the thatched roof had caved in. The top floors were all rotten and some of the main beams needed renewing. Part of the staircases could not be saved. The kitchens were in a right state. There must have been an inch of gunge on the walls of the cellar,' says Milligan. Fortunately, the 2ft thick Cotswold ironstone walls were sound and the tiled roof above the main bar was in usable, if poor, condition. So within a year, the Falkland Arms reopened for business. 'What we basically had to do during that period was put in the toilets at the end of the building. We had to connect them to a private sewerage system. Then we dug up the mud floors in the cellar and put down concrete floors.' It took a year to complete this limited work because 52-year-old Milligan was doing most of it himself, coming over from his other pub four days a week. He has continued to do a lot of the work with the help of one or two local contractors. He has spent just Pounds 70,000 on rebuilding and fitting out the premises, including furnishing five guest bedrooms. The biggest element was replacing the thatched roof. 'It has been done from Norfolk reeds rather than from straw because reed will last a lot longer,' says Milligan. The Pounds 41,000 loan has been paid off but Milligan subsequently took out a further Pounds 60,000 from AIB, part of that to cover back-tax payments. Milligan says he did not know he needed planning permission to make internal alterations. He acknowledges with a wry smile, though, that he probably would not have got permission to make all the changes if he had applied beforehand. 'Fortunately it has worked out quite well with English Heritage and the Department of the Environment. Everything is now sorted out.' The Falkland Arms, with its massive oak ceiling beams, hundreds of hanging mugs, table candles, high-back settles and 50 types of snuff on sale, averages around Pounds 4,000 turnover a week. Three quarters of this comes from wet trade  - alcohol and soft drinks  - rather than food. Of last year's turnover of Pounds 210,000, the Falkland Arms made a substantial gross profit of 48 per cent. Milligan spends a couple of thousand pounds a year on advertising. The pub started to appear in Britain's drinking guides as early as 1982. Several live-in managers have been employed over the past 10 years at Great Tew, many of them with no previous experience. Milligan says this provides good training for them to move on to another pub. 'I wouldn't want to keep a manager for more than two years or so. For one thing, it is very hard work. It would kill them,' he says. The present manager and his wife together earn Pounds 11,000 a year. The pub's total wage bill is about Pounds 20,000. The pub sells beers from four breweries including Hook Norton and Hall and Woodhouse and always has on tap three guest beers which at the moment include Woodfordes Phoenix and Bullion Old Mill. The margins on beer are surprisingly large. Low-gravity ale, for which Milligan pays 48p a pint, excluding Vat, is sold over the bar for Pounds 1.16. Milligan can extract little discount from the breweries. 'A large freehouse could demand astronomical discounts on beer. Grand Met would offer you maybe Pounds 40 or Pounds 50 discount on a 36-gallon barrel. It's crazy but they are fighting for business,' he says. The Falkland Arms dispatches about 18,000 gallons of beer a year. Milligan's wife, Hazel, supervises the kitchen; its menu includes cheese, prawn and potato pie and lamb in apricot, with main courses costing about Pounds 4.50. A double room with breakfast is Pounds 40. A businessman and landlord, Milligan believes the Falkland Arms is now worth more than Pounds 500,000. That is incentive enough to stay in the business. 'Maybe next year, we'll look to buy another pub.' The Falkland Arms, Great Tew, Oxfordshire. Tel:0608 - 83653.

Up to now a total of 34 oil-gas fields have been found with  a  proved oil-bearing area of over 1,200 square kilometers in the  three basins of Junggar, Tarim and Turpan.    Scattered in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region, the basins cover a total area of 740,000 square  kilometers.    Scientists from home and other countries have proved that  the  basins have good generative conditions for oil and natural gas.    They predicted that reserves in the basins hold billions of  tons of oil, about one-fourth of the total onshore oil resources  in China.    In the early 1980s, China began its efforts to find new oil  resources in the western part of the country as part of the  country's oil development strategy.    Since then, a large-scale oil prospecting and exploration  campaign involving big investment has started on the Gobi Desert  of Xinjiang.    Local petroleum scientists said that oil prospecting and  development there has entered a very active and fruitful period.    Some nine new oil and natural gas fields have been  discovered  in the 130,000-square-kilometer Junggar Basin in northern  Xinjiang in the past ten years, including Xiazijie, Huoshaoshan,  Beisantai, Cainan, Shixi and Mahu.    In the Tarim Basin, which is 560,000 square kilometers in  area, nine oil-gas fields have been found in the last five years.    Six new oil-gas fields have been discovered in the Turpan  Basin, though prospecting and exploration started only three  years ago.    Now 18 oil-gas fields have been built or are under  construction in the three basins. They have had a production  capacity of 11.79 million tons of crude oil annually.    Petroleum geologists have made surveys of deep geological  structures of the three basins and discovered 75 large  oil-bearing structures. And beginning this year there will be a  ""peak stage"" when more oil-gas reserver will be found in the  three basins.    Now there are over 50,000 oil workers and over 100 drilling  and geological teams working in the basins. The prospecting is  expanding and wells are being sunk deeper, from 3,000 meters to  more than 6,000 meters.     "
0,FT923-13483 ,"FT923-13483 _AN-CGMA3AEDFT 920713   FT  13 JUL 92 / Oil industry refines its operations: A look at structural change in the US energy sector      By ALAN FRIEDMAN   THE US oil and gas industry will this week begin reporting mainly lower second-quarter earnings against a backdrop of dramatic reductions in capital spending and job numbers at many companies. The cuts are more than a cyclical reaction to the weakness of US demand for petroleum products and crude oil prices that are well below levels seen just before the Gulf war in January, 1991. Instead, industry experts say the US sector has begun a structural change that could ultimately shift much exploration and production away from the United States while raising energy prices for retail and corporate consumers. The challenges facing the US energy industry are several: Congressional and local restrictions on drilling in places such as the waters off the coasts of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska are causing many companies to redirect their exploration efforts away from the US. The sputtering US recovery and increasing price competition are keeping marketing and distribution profit margins under pressure. The industry has also concluded that the medium-term outlook is for only slightly improved crude oil and natural gas prices. The cost of modernising refineries and developing cleaner, reformulated petrol - as dictated by environmental laws such as the Clean Air Act - will be tens of billions of dollars during the next few years. The consensus view is that the industry's operating cash flow will decline by 10 per cent this year, to about Dollars 44bn (Pounds 23bn). Net profits of the energy sector, which fell by an aggregate of more than 50 per cent in the first three months of 1992, are expected to drop by at least 10 per cent in the second quarter and by almost as much for the whole of 1992. The result is that many companies are slashing operating costs. That means sharp reductions in capital spending budgets, selling non-strategic assets and saving money by redundancies that on average will eliminate up to 15 per cent of the workforces of several big US companies. Although the restructuring process has been underway for more than a year, last week saw several announcements that are typical of the trend. Last Monday, after a survey of 247 companies, Salomon Brothers forecast a drop of nearly 20 per cent in 1992 spending on North American exploration and production. Spending by these same companies outside the US was projected to rise by 9.5 per cent. On Tuesday, Mobil, the second biggest US energy group, said its 1992 capital appropriations budget would be Dollars 1bn less than previously predicted. The company's payroll was forecast to decline by 10 per cent by year-end and the disposal of more than Dollars 600m of assets was forecast. Wednesday saw Amoco, the fifth biggest US energy company, unveil plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or nearly 16 per cent, by the end of next year. On Friday, Mr Charles DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute (API), complained that lower crude prices, the sluggish economy and drilling restrictions had caused the loss of 63,000 US energy jobs over the past year and could lead to another 50,000 redundancies over the next 12 months. In New York, Mr Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, reckoned the US sector was facing 'major structural changes,' including a dramatic shift in exploration budgets from the US to places such as republics of the former Soviet Union, Colombia, Yemen, Algeria, Venezuela and Indonesia. Mr Goldstein said spending cuts had 'decimated' the US exploration and production infrastructure of so many companies that the ability of the industry to respond in a timely manner when the economic recovery eventually strengthened was now in question. In Houston, Mr Roger Frey, an energy sector loan specialist at Chase Manhattan, attributed the structural changes to both mounting environmental costs and the fact that 'the industry can no longer bank on steady price increases'. He said there was a realisation by the industry of the need 'to adjust to only moderate oil and natural gas prices in the foreseeable future'. Mr DiBona of the API argued that while the US energy sector would eventually be leaner and more competitive, the shift away from exploration and production in the US could be permanent and could affect the US balance of payments in the 1990s. Compounding the outlook is the fact that US refinery capacity is forecast by analysts to drop by between 5 per cent and 10 per cent during the next three years, while the nation's proven reserves continue to decline over time. The implications of the US energy sector's restructuring were summed up two weeks ago by Mr Victor Burk, managing director of the oil and gas industry services division of Arthur Andersen, the consultancy. Although Mr Burk said the shift away from US exploration would continue, he noted this did not mean the US would be abandoned. Rather, the industry would enter a new era when exploration would be pursued on the basis of geographical, operational and technological niche opportunities. Mr Paul Ting, an oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, concluded that while 1991 was a bad year, with net income down by 21 per cent for the top 10 US energy groups, profits in the current year would also decline, although less sharply. With refining and marketing margins under pressure, much of the earnings sweepstakes in the latter half of 1992 will depend upon the price of crude, which is not expected to rise in a significant way. Earnings could improve again next year, thanks partly to the lower operating costs being wrought by restructuring. But neither US job levels nor exploration activities are expected to return to past levels for quite some time.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          CAPITAL SPENDING  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              On oil and gas exploration and production                   by top five US groups (dollarsm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            In the US          Outside North America                           -----------        -----------------------                     1991     1992      %      1991     1992      %                    actual  estimate  change  actual  estimate  change  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exxon              2,095    1,850     -11.7  3,040    3,325      +9.4 Mobil                920      600     -34.8  1,361    1,500     +10.2 Texaco               905      709     -21.7  1,044    1,112      +6.5 Chevron            1,050      850     -19.1  1,100    1,250     +13.6 Amoco               965       500     -48.2  1,233    1,200      -2.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Salomon Brothers  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

Argentina and the UK agreed in October substantially to raise next year's catch of the prized illex squid, the most sought-after resource in the waters surrounding the Falkland Islands. Argentina will increase its catch by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes but the Falklands will retain their 1993 quota of 150,000 tonnes. However, Clarin, Argentina's largest-selling newspaper, yesterday reported that the Falklands would open a sector of their waters closed to fishing since 1990. It criticised this as a 'new step in the British government's policy of faits accomplis' and implied that Argentina had been duped. Argentina has not lifted its claim over the islands, despite its defeat in the Falklands conflict of 1982. It resents British policy decisions in the region as an affront to its sovereignty. President Carlos Menem says Argentina will 'recover' the islands by the year 2000. However, British officials say they told Argentina in October of their decision to open the Falklands Outer Conservation Zone, a 50-mile-wide sector of sea north-east of the islands. The zone, set up in 1990 in the first fishing agreement with Argentina, had been renewed every year until now. London was able to defuse anger in the islands over the sharply increased Argentine catch, by saying that opening the zone would make Falkland licences more attractive to Asian fishing fleets. Licence sales, the islands' largest revenue source, have fallen sharply in the face of strong competition from Argentina. British officials say 1994 Falkland licence prices have increased by about 10 per cent. A British official claimed that as a concession to Argentina, London had played down the opening of the zone. He said: 'We are looking for ways to give the Argentines a soft landing and make things presentationally helpful for them'. But in a statement yesterday, Argentina's foreign ministry portrayed its agreement to opening the zone as a concession to Britain.

That opinion indicated that in petroleum refining operations ``(a)ny hydrocarbons that are not usable in a particular form or state are returned to an appropriate stage in the refining process so they can eventually be used. Likewise, the hydrocarbons and materials which escape from a refinery's production vessels are gathered and, by a complex retrieval system, returned to appropriate parts of the refining process.'' 824 F. 2d at 1181. Today's rule does not assert RCRA jurisdiction over any refining operations that process hydrocarbons into products, nor over hydrocarbons that are lost from process vessels and are gathered for return to refining. Rather, the Agency is stating that up to and including primary wastewater treatment, plant wastewaters are just that, and their management is potentially subject to Subtitle C controls. Oil that is recovered from wastewater, however, is no longer a solid waste, and recovered oil systems that do engage in retrieval of hydrocarbons for eventual refining are not subject to RCRA controls.    13                   13     The Agency also views its action as consistent with its rulemaking involving residues from coke by-product operations that are returned to the coking process, or related processes. 57 FR 27880 (June 22, 1992). The Agency stated that such materials were not solid wastes provided they were not land disposed before reinsertion. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(10). However, unlike the petroleum wastewaters containing small amounts of oil at issue here, the coke byproduct residues were found to be very similar to the raw material being replaced, and required no further purification to be usable. They could be inserted more or less directly into the coking or related tar-refining processes. Such residues are conceptually analogous to the purified oil coming from a petroleum slop oil facility.              C. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil From Off-Site Sources         Today's final rule, in defining the scope of recovered oil subject to the exclusion, excludes recovered oil from both off-site and on-site sources. EPA believes that recovered oil from petroleum refining, exploration and production, and transportation incident thereto, whether generated from these off-site or on-site sources, is essentially the same raw material (i.e., ``oil'') as that which is normally and routinely transported to, and inserted into, petroleum refining processes. Therefore, recovered oil from off-site sources should also be excluded when it is going to be recycled in this manner.    14     Examples of off-site sources of recovered oil include oil recovered from other petroleum refineries, and from oil and gas drilling operations.    15                   14     Certain wastes from petroleum exploration, development and production are currently exempt from Subtitle C regulation under 261.4(b)(5). There may be a degree of overlap between the materials excluded by today's action, and materials currently exempt under 261.4(b)(5). See 53 FR at 25446 (July 6, 1988), 58 FR 15284 (Mar. 22, 1993), and     Report to Congress, Management of Wastes from the Exploration, Development, and Production of Crude Oil, Natural Gas, and Geothermal Energy, Volumes 13 and Executive Summaries    , December 1987, EPA/530SW88003, for descriptions and clarifications of exempt and non-exempt wastes from oil and gas exploration, development, and production.                    15     As noted above, recovered oil does not include ``used oil'' (as defined in 40 CFR 279.1) brought to a refinery from off-site sources. (    De minimis     quantities of used oil that are incidentally captured by refinery wastewater treatment systems and subsequently recovered with other oil are not considered used oil.) See 57 FR 41566 (September 10, 1992) and 59 FR 1994 (March 4, 1994) for discussion on the scope of the definition of used oil. See also Section X.C.2 ``Used Oil'' later in this preamble.          This exclusion is somewhat broader than that proposed in the January 8, 1988 notice, which would have limited the exclusion to materials generated on-site. 53 FR 525. However, the 1988 proposal would not have been limited to recovered oil, but rather would have included all oil-bearing secondary materials, so that the Agency was particularly concerned with limiting the exclusion's scope because such materials as listed sludges, tank bottoms and contaminated media could be excluded.     Id    . In addition, if the exclusion was to cover oil-bearing hazardous secondary materials, EPA was concerned that RCRA Section 3004(r)(2) would be rendered meaningless.     Id    . These concerns are no longer present when the exclusion is limited to recovered oil.     The main reason for extending the exclusion to recovered oil generated at locations other than a refinery (when such oil is ultimately returned to a refinery) is that the oil is essentially the same (in terms of physical composition and potential risk) as recovered oil generated on-site. (The only significant difference is that recovered oil generated off-site is transported"," FR940728-0-00057   FR940728-0-00019        Nor is today's action inconsistent with     AMC I's     statements regarding the scope of petroleum refining activities that are outside the scope of Subtitle C. That opinion indicated that in petroleum refining operations ``(a)ny hydrocarbons that are not usable in a particular form or state are returned to an appropriate stage in the refining process so they can eventually be used. Likewise, the hydrocarbons and materials which escape from a refinery's production vessels are gathered and, by a complex retrieval system, returned to appropriate parts of the refining process.'' 824 F. 2d at 1181. Today's rule does not assert RCRA jurisdiction over any refining operations that process hydrocarbons into products, nor over hydrocarbons that are lost from process vessels and are gathered for return to refining. Rather, the Agency is stating that up to and including primary wastewater treatment, plant wastewaters are just that, and their management is potentially subject to Subtitle C controls. Oil that is recovered from wastewater, however, is no longer a solid waste, and recovered oil systems that do engage in retrieval of hydrocarbons for eventual refining are not subject to RCRA controls.    13                   13     The Agency also views its action as consistent with its rulemaking involving residues from coke by-product operations that are returned to the coking process, or related processes. 57 FR 27880 (June 22, 1992). The Agency stated that such materials were not solid wastes provided they were not land disposed before reinsertion. See 40 CFR 261.4(a)(10). However, unlike the petroleum wastewaters containing small amounts of oil at issue here, the coke byproduct residues were found to be very similar to the raw material being replaced, and required no further purification to be usable. They could be inserted more or less directly into the coking or related tar-refining processes. Such residues are conceptually analogous to the purified oil coming from a petroleum slop oil facility.              C. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil From Off-Site Sources         Today's final rule, in defining the scope of recovered oil subject to the exclusion, excludes recovered oil from both off-site and on-site sources.

These concerns are no longer present when the exclusion is limited to recovered oil.     The main reason for extending the exclusion to recovered oil generated at locations other than a refinery (when such oil is ultimately returned to a refinery) is that the oil is essentially the same (in terms of physical composition and potential risk) as recovered oil generated on-site. (The only significant difference is that recovered oil generated off-site is transported_in the same manner as crude oil. EPA does not regard this distinction as significant enough to warrant different regulatory status for off-site recovered oil.) The Agency thus is responding to comments received from industry, urging the Agency to extend the scope of the exclusion to certain off-site activities. However, these commenters argued further that refineries comprise but one segment of a large, integrated industry, extending from the production field, through the pipeline, to the refinery, to the marketing terminal, to tank trucks, and, ultimately, to the customer. EPA does not necessarily accept this argument, which is unnecessary to justify today's rule. Again, EPA will continue its broader policy review of the Definition of Solid Waste. EPA notes as well that the action in today's rule is not precedential for other industries. Determining what activities are a part of on-going production activities and not part of the waste disposal problem necessarily entails fact-specific evaluation. The Agency's conclusions regarding secondary materials generated by particular industries thus need not be germane to the regulatory status of secondary materials generated by other industries.         V. Rationale for Conditioning the Exclusion on Recovered Oil Not Being Placed on the Land and Not Being Accumulated Speculatively         This rule does not exclude land-based hazardous waste management units from which oil may be recovered. Thus, if recovered oil, or material containing oil, is placed in land-based units such as surface impoundments or land treatment units, those units remain subject to Subtitle C requirements (provided the material being placed is hazardous under RCRA). The Agency considers material placed in such units to be discarded, and hence solid wastes. See also     AMC I    , 824 F. 2d at n.20. These are classic disposal practices (see RCRA Section 1002(b)(7)), and placement of oily materials in such units (whether for storage, treatment, or disposal) is inconsistent with the use of the material as a valued product. In addition, the D.C. Circuit held in     AMC II     that materials destined for recycling were still solid wastes if held in surface impoundments before being recycled (907 F. 2d at 1186).     The final condition for the exclusion to apply is that recovered oil not be accumulated speculatively (as defined in 261.1(c)(8)) before it is recycled back into a petroleum refining process. This is a standard condition that the Agency applies to otherwise excluded secondary materials (see, e.g.,   261.2(e)(2)(iii)) to prevent the materials being held for prolonged periods without being recycled, with attendant increased environmental risk. See 50 FR at 634635, 658661 (Jan. 4, 1985). No commenter seriously questioned applying this condition. Thus, recovered oil that would otherwise be excluded that is accumulated speculatively is considered to be discarded and hence a solid waste.                      "
0,FT931-1332 ,"FT931-1332 _AN-DCYCKAEVFT 930325   FT  25 MAR 93 / Budget adds to depression over the North Sea: Rig manufacturers are braced for hard times      By ANDREW TAYLOR   THE THREAT by Amerada Hess to halve its North Sea oil exploration programme bodes ill for Britain's offshore oil and gas fabricators. Amerada, a leading North Sea exploration company, has threatened the cut if the government goes ahead with Budget proposals for changes in the petroleum revenue tax regime. Rig manufacturers have already seen a big drop in work since last autumn. Two thirds of the 18,000 workers employed six months ago in fabricators' yards have lost their jobs. One yard has been mothballed. Further rationalisation and closures are inevitable, says the industry, with capacity running well ahead of orders. The situation could be made even worse if oil producers reduce exploration fur-ther. Some fabricators may be forced to pull out of the market - even if the government decides not to favour coal at the expense of gas production in the energy white paper expected today. The industry believes that up to half the 12 yards operated by the seven largest fabricators - Amec Offshore, Highlands Fabricators, McDermott Scotland, Redpath, RGC, SLP and UIE Scotland - may be vulnerable. Mr Syd Fudge, chairman of the Offshore Manufacturers and Constructors Association, which represents the seven fabricators, fears that the few remaining opportunities for British companies to tender for North Sea work may be reduced even further as a result of the government's policies. Mr John Walmesley, finance director of Enterprise Oil, says the effect of Budget tax proposals would be to take away much of the incentive to re-invest earnings in new projects in the North Sea. Under the Budget proposals, extraction from existing fields will become more economic while operators will no longer be able to offset exploration costs against the profits from existing fields. The changes could not have come at a worse time for fabricators. A large drop in orders had been expected as the level of North Sea construction, which had been strongly in manufacturers' favour in the late 1980s and early 1990s, began to drop. Investment emphasis is likely to change - most of the large, more easily exploited oil and gas fields were discovered when oil prices were equivalent to Dollars 40 to Dollars 50 a barrel at today's prices. But yesterday's price was just Dollars 18.60 a barrel. Future fields are likely to be smaller, more complex and more costly to develop, say producers. The recession, and the fact that oil prices are not expected to rise substantially in real terms, will limit further spending. Investment, they say, is more likely to be in repair and maintenance rather than in the construction of large new rigs. Production facilities are likely to be smaller, with new units hooking up to existing, larger production platforms. That will mean less need for large assembly yards, many of which are in the former shipbuilding areas of north-east England and Scotland. Numbers employed in the yards since September have fallen from more than 18,000 to approaching 6,000. Turnover of Pounds 1.5bn last year is likely to fall to just Pounds 500m this year. McDermott, the US owner of the Ardersier yard near Inverness, and one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, has announced redundancy for most of its remaining 500 workers. The yard, which 18 months ago employed 3,500 people, has run out of orders. Closures and the shift in work to care and maintenance, as in the case of Ardersier, will damage local economies further. The three yards operated by Amec at Wallsend, Tyne and Wear, generated a turnover of Pounds 200m last year of which Amec estimates 80 per cent is spent in the local economy. This year turnover is likely to be nearer Pounds 100m - indicating a net loss to the community of about Pounds 80m. Companies are looking to overseas work to offset the decline in UK orders. In most cases this will involve selling management expertise rather than providing employment for British workers and suppliers of materials and components. The exception is for work for the Norwegian sector of the North Sea but competition is tough and tends to favour the home players.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Unocal said it would increase its 1990 North American development drilling  budget by 12%, or $33 million, to drill 93 new development oil wells in the  United States and Canada that were originally scheduled to be drilled in 1991.    With the announcement, Los Angeles-based Unocal joins companies such as Conoco  Inc. and Chevron Corp., who earlier announced plans to speed up some drilling  to take advantage of a windfall resulting from higher oil prices.    But analysts said the projects do not signal a widespread increase in U.S. oil  drilling activity as a result of the Middle East crisis. That's mainly because  most oil executives are reluctant to change long-term spending plans based on  what is perceived as a momentary run-up of crude prices.    ""It's the anticipation of prices that focuses exploration (planning),"" said  Robert Megill, a petroleum economist and former Exxon Corp. executive in  Houston. That means ""prices five years down the road,"" he said.    Most industry executives expect crude oil prices to fall from their current  high levels once the crisis is resolved, removing the long-term financial  incentive for dramatic increases in U.S. drilling.    Unocal's stepped-up drilling plans ""reflect the use of additional cash that's  coming into the upstream (exploration and development) part of the company  because of higher oil prices,"" said John F. Imle Jr., a Unocal senior vice  president.    But, he added, these are projects that were planned all along based on oil  price projections made before the Middle East crisis began. They are not  marginal projects that suddenly appear more attractive simply because prices  have jumped for now.    The 93 new wells, including 20 in California, are expected to increase the  company's net production of oil and liquids by 5,700 barrels a day by 1991.    Last week, Unocal Corp. reported that third-quarter earnings had risen 53% to  $121 million from $79 million in the like period a year earlier.    Other companies that have recently stepped up drilling include:    * Chevron, which in August said it would spend an additional $100 million in  1990 on domestic oil and natural gas production, an increase of about 10% over  its total U.S. exploration and production budget. The money would be used to  drill about 130 development wells in major existing oil fields in California,  Colorado, Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.    * Conoco Inc., which said it would increase its 1990 exploration and production  budget by $10 million, to $540 million, to drill five new exploration wells in  the Gulf of Mexico that had been originally scheduled in 1991.    * British Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield Co., which, since the Middle East  crisis began, have stepped up a program of well stimulation on Alaska's North  Slope, helping to boost production. Separately, they announced plans to spend  $1.1 billion on a long-term gas handling project designed to arrest the decline  of Alaskan oil production.    Elsewhere, there are signs that oil drillers have increased their activity  since Iraq invaded Kuwait.    This week, the number of active oil and natural gas rigs increased to 1,107  from 1,010 a year ago, according to the widely consulted rig count report  released Monday by oil services company Baker Hughes Inc.    The rig count, which is a measure of the number of rigs exploring for oil, has  risen in eight of the last 10 weeks and is at its highest level in about 2 1/2  years, said Baker Hughes spokesman Ron Turner in Houston.    Overall, the oil industry had planned to increase upstream spending in 1990  independent of the Middle East crisis, expecting oil prices to rise gradually  on their own. But there remain real impediments to dramatic increases in  domestic oil drilling, and most oil companies have been shifting their efforts  overseas.    The oil industry argues that the likeliest sources of large, new oil  discoveries in the United States are off limits, including offshore areas and  the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    In addition, the number of available drilling rigs and rig crews has dropped  dramatically since the oil boom of the early 1980s. In December, 1981, the rig  count peaked at 4,500. After oil prices crashed in the summer of 1986, the rig  count plummeted to 663.

0,FT933-3146 ,"FT933-3146 _AN-DIOCVAEIFT 930915   FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Goal net profits rise 18% to Pounds 2.8m      By ROBERT CORZINE   GOAL Petroleum, the UK independent exploration and production company, reported an 18 per cent jump in net profits to Pounds 2.8m for the first half of the year despite a 13 per cent fall in production. Earnings per share also rose 18 per cent to 2.07p. The decline in output was offset by favourable exchange rate movements which resulted in higher sterling prices for oil. Turnover to the end of June remained unchanged from the same period last year at Pounds 20.9m, according to Mr Roger Bexon, chairman. He said the company would use its financial strength - net borrowings fell Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 16.2m to give a gearing ratio of 18 per cent - to expand reserves, either through successful exploration, acquisition or by boosting output of existing reserves, such as the Wytch Farm and Magnus fields in the UK. Mr Bexon added that the changes made earlier this year to the UK's petroleum tax regime would 'substantially increase' Goal's discretionary income and enhance its flexibility in making any acquisitions. 'While the North Sea still offers many opportunities ..we continually review possible investments in other areas,' he said. The company's average production rate was 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day during the first half of the year (11,500). The fall was due to planned maintainence shutdowns at the Buchan and Wytch Farm fields. There is again no interim dividend.   Companies:-  Goal Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

ACTION:     Notice of public hearings.               SUMMARY:     The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) is holding public hearings on the investigation that the Department of Commerce initiated, on April 5, 1994, to determine the effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended. This notice identifies the issues on which the Department is interested in obtaining the public's views. It also sets forth the procedures for public participation in the hearings.                 DATES:     The hearings will be held in New York, New York, on Monday, June 6, 1994; in Dallas, Texas, on Monday, June 13, 1994; and in Santa Clara, California, on Thursday, June 16, 1994. Requests to speak are due by Monday, May 23, 1994. The hearing in New York will be held in the Ceremonial Courtroom of the U.S. Court of International Trade, One Federal Plaza. The hearing in Dallas will be held at the Joe C. Thompson Amphitheatre, Cityplace Center East, 2711 N. Haskill. The hearing in Santa Clara will be held at the City of Santa Clara Council Chambers, 1500 Wurburton Avenue.             ADDRESSES:     Send requests to speak and written copies of the oral presentation to Steven C. Goldman, Deputy Director, Office of Industrial Resource Administration, room 3878, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.             FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Bernard Kritzer, Senior Industry Analyst, Office of Foreign Availability,   Telephone: (202) 4820074.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:         I. Background and Specific Comments Requested         On March 11, 1994, the Independent Petroleum Association of America petitioned the Department of Commerce to initiate an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), to determine the effects on the national security of imports of crude oil and petroleum products.       On April 5, 1994, the Department of Commerce formally accepted the petition and initiated an investigation. The findings and recommendations of the investigation are to be reported by the Secretary of Commerce to the President no later than December 31, 1994 (i.e., within 270 days). For further details on this investigation, see the     Federal Register     of April 12, 1994 (59 FR 17335).

Air Atlantic Uruguay ran its inaugural four-hour flight, in a converted Hercules 130 leased from the Uruguayan air force, in September, but has since been refused permission to fly. 'The problem is the use of a military plane for a civilian flight,' said Mr James. 'At the moment things are stuck but we are trying to resolve the issue.' In principle, the British are keen to see more flights to the Falklands, which since the British-Argentine conflict of 1982 have been practically cut off from the Latin American mainland. The Air Atlantic flight, whose maiden trip brought fresh fruit and other rarities to the isolated South Atlantic islands, was the first of its kind since the war.

Mr Menem said on TV that 'before the year 2000, Argentina' would be 'setting foot on the Falklands, without any type of conflict.' Mr Hurd, who is to meet Mr Menem today, repeated at Buenos Aires airport Britain's refusal to discuss sovereignty of the Falklands, over which the UK fought a 1982 war. 'We have no doubt of our position, so what we have to do is build on progress already made.' Mr Hurd said his visit will further consolidate relations with Argentina, with which Britain resumed diplomatic links three years ago. The two have reached temporary fishing agreements in the South Atlantic and on military confidence-building measures. One of Argentina's most cherished foreign policy objectives is to assume a more prominent role in international affairs.

At the present rate of production the country's reserves will last well into the next century. The most recent discovery was in the Tiputini field in the easternmost region of Ecuador. The exploratory well Pishtingo 1 alone indicated about 237m barrels, almost equal to the estimated reserves for the Tiputini and nearby Tanacocha field together. Mr Ricardo Estrada, the executive director of Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, said it was now obvious that 'the prospects of further incrementing the petroleum reserves of the country are excellent'. In order to tap other potential reserves in the area, Petroecuador will hold another round of bidding for exploration in the near future. Before exploiting the new reserves, five more exploratory wells are planned for the area. Furthermore, 190 km of road and 300 km of pipeline need to be constructed north-west to Lago Agrio, from where the trans-Ecudadorian pipeline will transport the oil across the Andes to the Pacific ports. Petroecuador calculates that the project requires an investment of USDollars 280m over six years. The field's production time is estimated 'DISTEyears, with a maximum daily output of 45,000 barrels a day. In order to transport the heavy crude from Tiputini, it needs to be mixed with a lighter crude from the Panacocha field. Until a more efficient and economic form of transport is available Petroecuador is expected to push the development of the field while the lighter crude is still available to mix with its oil.

The joint venture being negotiated is a proposed 50:50 Russian and foreign co-operation, and aims to develop discovered oil and gas fields. Severgasprom, the leading Russian partner in the pact, has applied for exploitation licences on behalf of the group. The licences comprise the oil fields Mid and North-Kharyaga and five gas and gas condensate fields. Saga said the joint venture also aimed to apply for exploration and production licences for an area near the discovered fields. One appraisal well is planned this year on the Mid-Kharyaga field which may be cored, logged and tested by western contractors financed by Saga and Shell. For two years Saga and its Russian partners have been negotiating a joint venture agreement and undertaken joint petroleum reserves studies, technical development scenarios and economic feasibility studies, but Saga said further appraisal activities, studies and commercial negotiations were required before the commercial viability of the fields could be declared.

The answer is that Tatham seems to be a one of a small but growing band of Foreign Office folk who, believe it or not, are keen on the place. Before Beirut, Tatham headed the Falkland Islands' department at the Foreign Office, responsible for not only the islands but also Argentina. The department was set up after the 1982 Anglo-Argentine war over the islands, and closed when diplomatic ties were renewed in 1990. Clearly the FO feels that the sensitivities of 2,000 sheep farmers bear striking similarity to the byzantine world of Middle East affairs.

""The demand for petroleum, which is now the main source of  energy, will continue to grow as the incomes of the people rise.  Therefore, although Indonesia is still a petroleum exporting  country, with the present growth in consumption it will be a  petroleum importing country in the future.""    The chief state said this Saturday [5 March] as he  inaugurated the PERTAMINA [National Oil and Natural Gas  Company]-Atlantic Richfield Bali North, Incorporated, [ARBNI]  natural gas production and transport facilities in the  Pagerungan Islands and the PERTAMINA-Atlantic Richfield  Indonesia, Incorporated, [ARII] natural gas production and  transport facilities at Sidoardjo in East Java.    Therefore, according to the president, efforts to conserve  and diversify energy sources must be made consistently and  continuously. In this connection, the use of natural gas, the  reserves of which are quite large, is very important.    The chief of state said that the use of natural gas as a raw  material in making fertilizer has stimulated development in the  agriculture sector. Through the success of agricultural  development, millions of farmers have increased their earnings,  and the growth of domestic industry has been stimulated.    ""Natural gas has now become an important export commodity.  No  small amount of foreign exchange has been earned from natural  gas exports,"" the chief of state said.    Indonesian natural gas enters a new era with the  inauguration  of these two projects in the natural gas sector. The Indonesian  people will use natural gas on a large scale for domestic needs.    Natural gas flowing through the PERTAMINA-ARII production  and  transport facilities off the northwest coast of Java will be  used to fuel the steam-electric power plants at Muara Karang and  Tanjung Priok.    With the construction of Pagerungan PERTAMINA-ARBNI natural  gas production and transport facilities, all the fuel  requirements of the gas-fueled steam power plant at Gresik will  be met. Gas from that project will also be used by the State Gas  Company to meet the needs of homes and small industry in and  around Surabaya and as a raw material for the petrochemical  industry.    Indonesia is now experiencing a great increase in electric  power demand because of the progress of industrial development.  If that demand for power cannot be met, the industrialization  process will be hindered.    The chief of state said that because of the importance of  natural gas to future development, the government will keep  encouraging exploration activity. Although natural gas reserves  are now quite large, the search for new reserves needs to  continue into order to meet long-term demand.    ""There is a good possibility of this, because geologically  Indonesia possesses very great natural gas resources. I am  confident that, with the support of advances in science and  technology, there is still a great possibility of finding new  oil and gas in Indonesia,"" the chief of state said.    It is hoped that the success achieved by ARII and ARBNI  under  production-sharing contracts will create optimism among other  contractors working in Indonesia that there is a big chance of  finding new oil and gas in the country.    The chief of state said that in the development of oil and  natural gas efforts, the government has listened to complaints  about oil and natural gas exploration in Indonesia. A positive  dialogue needs to be developed between PERTAMINA and its  partners with regard to the various methods that can enhance  their mutual benefit.    In this connection, on 31 December 1993 the Indonesian  Government issued a new incentive package that is more conducive  to exploration and production activity.    Background    At the beginning of 1992, PERTAMINA and ARCO Indonesia  contracted with PLN [State Electricity Public Corporation] to  supply 260 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for 11  years beginning in 1994.    The natural gas will be used as fuel for the gas-fueled  steam  power plants at Muara Karang and Tanjung Priok, which are  long-term projects scheduled for phased implementation. The  first phase, implemented on 1 September 1993, was conducted as a  ""fast track"" by the direct appointment of an implementing  contractor.    The second, third, and fourth phases are to supply 50  million  cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Bima and Northwest  Corner Fields and develop existing natural gas reserves as an  effort to maintain natural gas supplies until 2004. Initial  capital for phase one until production will be more than $300  million. For development through phase six, the total cost is  estimated to be $824 million. This investment will be used to  expand 5 platforms to 29 platforms, 135 kilometers of pipeline  to 423 kilometers, and 11 production wells to 89.    Benefits    Many benefits of the presence of ARCO at Pagerungan were  reported to President Suharto, but the president did not accept  the reports at face value. In a dialogue with members of the  Pagerungan community who gathered at Permisan Village, Jabon,  Sidoarjo, the president asked them directly about the benefits  of the presence of ARCO in its involvement with natural gas.    Haji Djaelani, leader of the ""Abu Hurairah"" Islamic Boarding  School at Pagerungan frankly answered the president by saying  that the presence of the project is very beneficial to residents  of Pagerungan. ""Damaged, unusable school buildings, both secular  and Islamic, have now taken on a new look,"" he said. Similarly,  a fisherman from Wadjo, who had long lived there, expressed his  many thanks for the project.    Also, a teacher from there has experienced the facilities:  ARCO has built a new school, and he obtained a new house near  the school. A cooperative managed by teachers has been  developed, too. A Pagerungan PKK [Family Welfare Development]  manager asked for communications facilities to facilitate his  work of visiting isolated groups on some of the islands. ""I  request communications facilities to facilitate my work,"" he  said expectantly.    The president later asked ARCO to take part in considering  the request. A young man then followed by speaking of the  potential of existing neighborhood youth associations. The  president asked the young man to take part in finding  alternatives for fishermen who cannot go to sea in the  off-season so that their energies can be put to use. He said  that Pagerungan fishermen cannot work during the westerly  monsoon. ""Find a good alternative--using other skills,  naturally--so that fisherman can continue to work during the  westerly monsoon."" The regent of Sumenep also accompanied  members of the community in the dialogue with the president.     "

As the islanders celebrate the event this weekend in the company of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Argentina is still agonising over the defeat. Despite this, for the first time in years, there is a sense of hope and optimism in the air in Buenos Aires. Argentina has changed since it sent its forces to recover the islands and now is enjoying a period of unprecedented political freedom and economic growth. In many ways, yesterday's defeat and today's relative prosperity are closely linked. Defeat not only broke the power of the military and restored civilian rule, it also eroded the power of other groups such as the church, big business and trade unions that had blocked reforms for decades. Hyperinflation in 1989 hastened the end of the corrupt, inefficient state-dominated economy. When he took office in 1989, President Carlos Menem was forced to introduce what has become one of the world's most radical and most successful free market reforms. Today, Argentina has low inflation, rapid economic expansion and growing international prestige. The economy is set to grow 6 per cent this year and inflation should fall to below 20 per cent from 84 per cent in 1991. Growth, stability and respectability, as well as overarching objectives in their own right, are also part of the strategy to win control of the Falklands. Recovering the Falklands remains a national aspiration that no government can ignore. Only last week, Mr Menem repeated earlier statements that Argentina would peacefully establish sovereignty over the islands 'by the year 2000'. Argentine diplomats argue that as their country becomes a respected member of the international community by creating a stable, prosperous and democratic system open to international trade and investment, the Falklands' rejection of ties with Argentina - culminating in full integration - will therefore appear increasingly unreasonable. The architect of Mr Menem's foreign and economic policies is Mr Domingo Cavallo. He became foreign minister in 1989, when he established Argentina's pro-western foreign policy. In 1991 he became economy minister, creating a convertible currency and bringing much-needed energy and coherence to Mr Menem's flagging reforms. Argentina not only restored diplomatic relations with London in 1990. It has submitted to American pressure to scrap the controversial Condor II ballistic missile project and abandoned exports of sensitive missile and nuclear technologies. It has applied for membership of the 24-member industrial-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and rarely misses an opportunity to join in United Nations peace-keeping missions. In return, it has won crucial backing from the US and other G7 countries in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Talks with London over the Falklands have moved on from sterile bickering over sovereignty to mundane, but more productive discussions over fishing rights and oil exploration regimes. Meanwhile, both sides have simply agreed to disagree over the underlying issue of sovereignty. Mr Guido di Tella, the foreign minister, has even gone so far as accepting the importance of recognising the islanders' rights, rather than their interests - an important distinction which demonstrates an Argentine willingness to compromise. Another important strand in the intertwining economic and foreign policies is Argentina's courtship of British trade and investment. Britain's exports are set to double this year from about Pounds 70m in 1991, while Argentine exports should remain stable at about Pounds 140m. Bilateral trade is still to reach the level at which it stood in 1981: Pounds 298.1m. Officials want to attract UK investment in Argentina's aggressive privatisation programme. Furthermore, privatised utility companies are expected to invest heavily in upgrading the collapsing infrastructure, making Argentina a promising market for everything from railway equipment to power generators. Buenos Aires believes growing British exports and investments will help reduce the Falklanders' suspicions of all things Argentine. They also hope UK companies with business in Argentina could counteract the highly effective anti-Argentine Falklands lobby in Whitehall and Westminster. However, the potential for expanding trade is limited by the lack of British government export insurance cover. British officials say coverage will only be resumed once Argentina establishes a track record in honouring international financial commitments. That will be easier than persuading London to change its policy of defending the Falklanders' right to self determination. And the islanders remain as resolutely anti-Argentine as ever. Furthermore, Argentina still faces problems that will inevitably encourage suspicion of its opponents in the British parliament. The economy may be booming on the back of consumer demand, but Argentina's industry is still a long way from being internationally competitive. In spite of 10 years of democracy, congress is weak and, like the judiciary, dominated by an all-powerful presidency. Mr Menem himself is permanently dogged by corruption scandals. He cares little for institutional reform, except for pushing hard for a constitutional amendment which would allow him to stand for re-election. An economic reverse, such as an upsurge in inflation, could have dangerous political side effects. Equally, a political upset, such as another scandal or complications arising from Mr Menem's campaign to amend the constitution, could destabilise the economy. The Argentine belief that its commendable policies will bring it any closer to winning the Falkland Islands in the foreseeable future may thus prove to be a delusion.

In July Falkland Islands' officials announced they had chosen Spectrum of the UK and Geco Prakla, a subsidiary of the New York-based energy services group Schlumberger, to conduct more than Pounds 7m in high-technology seismic work beginning next month. However, the islands' administration, under instructions from the UK Foreign Office, yesterday again invited applications for the licences in a move expected to delay work in the area until at least early next year. The Foreign Office said last night the move reflected the UK government's concern that the tendering process should be fair and transparent. 'We want the net to be thrown as wide as possible,' an official said. It is believed the announcement earlier this summer drew protests from other companies, including Ensign, a UK computer analysis group. The companies are understood to be interested in applying for licences but were not fully consulted by the Falkland Islands' government or the British Geological Survey, the UK government-funded research organisation advising island officials.

He will see Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary. He will also meet opposition politicians and business leaders. In September, Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, made the first official trip to Britain by a minister since the 1982 Falklands war. Three British cabinet ministers have visited Buenos Aires this year. Relations began improving after President Carlos Menem took office in 1989 and adopted pro-western foreign policies and free market economics. However, the unresolved dispute over the Falklands means that Mr Menem is unlikely to be invited to London soon. Mr Di Tella is trying to win over the Falkland islanders by convincing them that Argentina has changed for the better. He has met Falkland representatives and broadcast to the islands via the BBC World Service. But suspicious Falklanders reject his advances and Britain refuses to discuss the islands' political future. The two sides have agreed on other questions, principally fisheries, the Falklands' main source of revenue. Mr Di Tella will sign a new one-year fishing agreement. However, Britain refuses to lift its arms embargo preventing Argentina from replacing aircraft shot down in 1982.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The Bush Administration has argued that declining U.S. oil production and  increasing reliance on foreign producers is undermining national energy  security.    In its year-end report, the petroleum institute said U.S. crude oil production  averaged 7.6 million barrels a day in 1989. That was the lowest in 26 years and  a record decline of 553,000 barrels per day, or 6.8%, from the 1988 total.    The previous biggest decline in domestic oil output was 474,000 barrels per day  in 1949.    Alaskan oil production, which had increased almost every year since the start  of production from the huge Prudhoe Bay field in 1977, fell by 140,000 barrels  per day in 1989.    The report said the Alaska decline was exaggerated by maintenance work and  traffic restrictions following the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill last March,  and that the ""underlying decline trend"" in Alaska was about 100,000 barrels per  day.    Oil imports rose to 7.9 million barrels a day last year, up 8.2% from 1988 and  nearly 60% above the 1985 level, when imports sank to a low of 5 million  barrels a day before prices collapsed on the world market in 1986.    The report said that while imports from Western Hemisphere sources still  accounted for about 43% of total imports in 1989, imports from the Persian Gulf  continued to grow to 21% of the total.

0,FT934-5297 ,"FT934-5297 _AN-DLACFAGYFT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Green cloud hangs over Ecuadorean oil sector - Raymond Colitt reports on a wave of protest that has potential investors worried      By RAYMOND COLITT   Only months before the Ecuadorean government is to invite foreign oil companies to bid for new exploration blocks in the country's Amazon region - potentially worth billions of dollars - a new wave of protests by environmentalists and indigenous groups has investors worried. The latest in a series of actions against oil companies in the region came earlier this month as several aboriginal communities filed a civil law suit against the US oil company Texaco. The Indians of various tribes in the Amazon forests are demanding of Texaco an indemnity in addition to legal costs of at least USDollars 50,000 for each of the affected inhabitants of the area, which could run into thousands of people. Separately the plaintiffs are to claim clean-up costs that may, according to some estimates, reach hundreds of millions of dollars. Texaco is accused of negligence, recklessness and intentional damage in its exploration and production activities. These are alleged to have increased the risk of cancer, respiratory and gastro-intestinal illnesses and to have caused other personal injuries and property damages. According to Mr Cristobal Bonifaz, a lawyer for the Indians, Texaco did not always employ technologies and practices that met industry standards. For example, toxic substances, he said, were not disposed of properly, but were rather 'dumped' into pits, rivers and bogs or burnt without any pollution control. Mr Bonifaz adds that the environmental damage in Ecuador's Amazon region far exceeds that caused by the Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska three years ago. Texaco has not operated in the fields of the Oriente, as Ecuador's Amazonian region is called, since 1990, when its contract with the Ecuadorean government expired and it withdrew after 20 years as the principal operator from a consortium with the state-owned Petroecuador. The US petroleum company denies the allegations and argues that the case should have been filed in Ecuador, where Petroecuador is legally established. Yet the plaintiffs argue that the defendant is legally a resident of New York and that all decisions regarding operations in Ecuador were essentially taken in the US. Meanwhile, Texaco awaits the results of an environmental audit initiated by the Ecuadorean government itself to determine exactly what environmental damage has been caused and what the reparation cost might be. The results of a study conducted by a Canadian environmental consulting firm are expected soon. Ecuador's minister of energy and mining, Mr Franciso Acosta, says that he will not sign any new contract with Texaco - which seeks to commercialise petrol within Ecuador - until the environmental review has been completed and Texaco has renewed its commitment to abide by it. The validity of the audit has been questioned by environmental groups in the US and Ecuador because of the lack of public access to information, the exclusion of local communities from the process and the terms of the audit, which were set by Texaco and Petroecuador. Laws and regulations that might substantiate specific infractions against Texaco are scarce. Ecuador has only recently adopted environmental regulations specific to the petroleum industry. Yet first the court for the southern district of New York must be signed to hear the case. That considerable environmental damage has been caused in the Oriente is beyond question. Countless acres of rain forest have disappeared, water and soil have been polluted by oil spills and animal habitats have been destroyed. According to a government estimate nearly 17m gallons of oil has leaked out of the Texaco-operated pipeline. Preliminary results from an independent study by the US-based Institute on Economic and Social Rights indicates that in areas in which Texaco operated there is evidence of the presence of toxic substances like benzine and toluol in excess of levels deemed tolerable by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Yet the company maintains that its emergency clean-up efforts were effective and that oil spills, often due to natural disasters, represented only a small percentage of the total amount transported during 18 years of operation. Texaco is not the only company accused of environmental improprieties. Only days before the legal suit against Texaco, members of the Cofan tribe - armed with spears and shotguns - forced drilling to be suspended at a Petroecuador site. The Cofanes demanded that the exploratory work within a national park and close to their tribal lands be halted. Especially indignant at President Duran Ballen's decision to allow resumption of exploratory work after having previously suspended it because of environmental concerns, they contended that they were not consulted about the activities as is required by law. Confrontation is certain to continue as the Cofanes insist that Petroecuador withdraw from their lands. Petroecuador has already had to shut down one of its most promising sites - Tiputini Panacocha, also located in the national park - following a decree by the government's environmental agency in response to supposed damage. Despite assurances to potential investors by the energy minister, potentially interested oil companies are wary of increasing confrontation by indigenous peoples and environmental groups that might lead to costly legal battles and an image problem at home.

0,FT921-13645 ,"FT921-13645 _AN-CAUBNAAGFT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / Survey of Egypt (7): A new hand at the pump - Confidence is rising in the oilfields      By TONY WALKER   FOR EGYPT'S oil and gas sector it has been a year of upheaval, but things appear to be settling down following the abrupt replacement last May of the long-serving oil minister, the volatile Dr Abdel Hadi Qandil, by Mr Hamdi el-Banbi, a low-key technocrat. The new minister of Petroleum and Mineral Wealth has quietly put his stamp on his ministry with a reshuffle of senior positions and a new pricing policy for crude oil exports. The new formula, which applied from October 1, sets the price of Egypt's benchmark Suez Blend crude at 60 per cent Brent minus Dollars 3.00, 20 per cent Iran Heavy minus Dollars 0.55 and 20 per cent Suez Blend spot. Mr Tarek Heggy, head of Shell in Egypt, was speaking for the industry when he observed that 'in the old days, Egyptian pricing was a dollar out on a daily basis, now its barely a dime'. Apart from bringing greater order to the daily marketing of Egyptian crude, and thus lessening friction with foreign companies, the new formula is also designed to appeal to purchasers seeking long-term contracts. Mr Banbi's initiation in his early days as minister has not been without pain, however. British Petroleum's decision to sell its 16.67 per cent stake in the Suez Oil Company (SUCO) to Repsol of Spain and to scale down its activities in Egypt was hardly a vote of confidence. But BP executives say the decision was less a reflection of the difficulties of doing business in Egypt than of the company's worldwide rationalisation to enable it to concentrate on new and perhaps more promising exploration zones. Mr Banbi, at a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Cairo late last year, sought to place the best gloss on the BP decision, noting that big players such as Shell had come and gone in Egypt without serious effect. The new minister also foreshadowed a renewed drive to increase areas under exploration for both oil and gas after a hiatus period in the past year or so, due in part to personnel changes in the petroleum ministry and in the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC). Fourteen exploration agreements were currently being processed, and there would be at least two bid rounds for new acreage this year. 'Our goal is not only to maintain our reserve base of 6bn barrels equivalent, but also to exert all efforts to increase it,' Mr Banbi said. To this end, Egypt has, since the mid-1980s, been encouraging oil companies to explore for gas. The introduction of a new gas clause has spurred efforts in that direction. Egypt's present gas reserve totals 12 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The target is 27 TCF to meet anticipated demand for the next 20 years. Dr Banbi, in his American Chamber address, described this as a 'real challenge to all involved.' He added that if companies discovered larger quantities of gas than could be absorbed by the growing domestic market, as Egypt seeks to convert as much as possible of its power sector and larger processing industries to gas use, surpluses could be exported. Shell has been particularly active in gas exploration and development. Its main production comes from its Badr al-Din deposits in the Western Desert where reserves total about 2TCF. The gas is delivered via a 270-km pipeline to al-Amiriya near Alexandria. Shell has also been among the leaders in investment in oil exploration with drilling programmes from the Gulf of Suez to the Western desert: it has made modest finds in both, including gas in the latter. It is also exploring offshore in the Mediterranean. British Gas is another foreign participant which is relatively bullish about its investments in Egypt. The company, in partnership with Yukong of South Korea and Union Pacific Petroleum Suez of the US, is committed to commercial production from its Gulf of Suez North Zafarana concession. Reserves in the British Gas concession - the first sizeable find in the Gulf of Suez for several years - are put at between 50-100m barrels, somewhat less than indicated by initial exploration. Among other noteworthy developments in the past year or so was Repsol's strong entry to the Egyptian scene. In 1990, it bought Conoco's Western Desert interests, and followed that up in 1991 with its SUCO purchase. Repsol's aggressive strategy in Egypt appears aimed at securing a reliable Mediterranean source of crude oil. Mr Banbi's elevation to minister (he was previously chairman of EGPC) was accompanied by the good news that Egypt's oil export earnings jumped by 70 per cent to Dollars 2.54bn in the year to June, due largely to the Gulf crisis.

'There is enough illex for everyone,' he insists. 'This is based on empirical observation.' Harengus has fished for squid for years, catching 12,000 to 15,000 tonnes a year. It has found that squid availability varies very little. Mr Olaciregui adds that the illex market is limited to Japan, South Korea, Spain and Italy, so demand is reasonably stable. In December, Argentina announced that it would offer licences for foreign ships to fish for illex squid in its waters - in direct competition with the Falkand Islands, which in 1987 set up a highly lucrative licensing regime. The islanders say the illex is a delicate resource, which if overfished could be eliminated. Mr John Barton, Falklands director of fisheries, said yesterday: 'Fishing pressure is already very high and we firmly believe that a moderate increase in fishing effort will lead to a collapse of the stock.' Last year, the Falkands reported licence revenues of Pounds 25m, some 80 per cent of which came from illex licences. Mr Barton says that Argentina's offer of cheaper licences has lured away most of the islands' Asian clients, undermining its revenues.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, said: 'Britain will pay a very high price for this joke.' He said Argentina would censure the British decision in multilateral conservation bodies covering the Antarctic. However, the ministry did not expand on what price Argentina planned to exact from the UK or how it would do so. Britain had told Argentina privately that it intended to introduce a fishing regime in the two islands' territorial waters on August 1, but made no statement on the issue. Mr Di Tella only announced the British decision on Monday. London had already extended to 200 miles, from 12 miles, the islands' territorial waters prior to imposing the licence regime, similar to one introduced in the nearby Falkland Islands seven years ago. UK officials said they have already received considerable signs of interest from fishing companies to take out the new licences, with fees to be based on a percentage of the catch. Debate in Argentina over the future of the Falkland Islands has intensified in the past 10 days, after it had emerged that the Argentine government was considering the concession, under its sovereignty, of a special status for the islands, similar to Puerto Rico's status as an associate of the US. This would enable the islands to retain all their present rights of self-determination, the use of sterling as currency, and allegiance to the British crown, while transferring only formal sovereignty to Argentina. However, some Argentine analysts feared that changing the nature of Argentina's claim to the islands was only a prelude to surrendering it altogether.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

Last week the UK government announced that it would extend the 12-mile limit around the two island groups to 200 miles to halt over-fishing. British officials said yesterday that new fishing regulations were being drafted similar to those already being enforced around the Falklands. Argentina reacted angrily to Britain's decision to extend territorial waters and will be doubly displeased by a unilateral move to charge vessels for the right to fish there. Argentina claims sovereignty over the Georgias and South Sandwich islands as well as the Falklands. In statements issued over the weekend, Argentine officials said the new 200-mile limits would indirectly grant Argentina a role in fishing policy because both island groups fell within the ambit of the 22-nation Commission on Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, of which both Argentina and Britain were members. British officials dismissed that suggestion, however, insisting that they would not accept any Argentine role that implied recognition of its territorial claims. For the moment, the British announcement is only a formality as London lacks fishery patrol ships to enforce the extended limits. However, officials said it was considered important to announce it before the next fishing season began in February. Britain and Argentina are to hold talks on a new fisheries regime in waters around the Falklands. No date has been set, but discussions are expected to begin in May or June. Argentina last year introduced a licensing scheme for ships operating in its waters that is similar to the Falklands' regime and it has managed to poach most of the islands' best customers by offering cut-price licences.

0,FT934-2579 ,"FT934-2579 _AN-DLMDEAEIFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (5): Liberalisation pays off  -Latin American attracts more investors      By DAVID BATTMAN   Many oil companies are taking a renewed interest in Latin America, where the trend is towards liberalisation of oil sectors and encouragement of foreign investment. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, confirmed recently that 'investment has come to Latin America because the resource base exists and because the countries of Latin America have established a very receptive fiscal and regulatory climate. If that situation is maintained, there is no obstacle to the fulfilment of Latin America's potential in terms of production and export capacity'. But the transformation of Latin America into a region with a unique blend of foreign private and state involvement is not yet fulfilled. It is not yet clear that the changes effected can be serve as a model for other regions seeking to expand their oil and gas sectors. Its production potential has never been in doubt. US companies in particular have long been involved in exploration and production, along with several European oil majors. The oil shocks of the 1970s and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 served as a reminder to the US of the strategic importance of alternative fuel sources, particularly when they are so much closer geographically. But political risks (in the region which invented oil nationalism) proved unacceptably high for many companies in the 1970s and 1980s. Latin America's turnaround started with the spread of economic orthodoxy which followed the debt shock of the mid-1980s. Governments sought to open up their economies to make them more competitive, reduce spending and control inflation as requirements for the restructuring of foreign debt and to secure much-needed foreign capital investments. Key aims of the oil and gas industries have been to secure foreign capital and technological injections not easily available domestically, and generally to work in partnership with the state company. Mexico and possibly Brazil are opening up some areas to foreign involvement while retaining overall control. Other main regional producers are showing greater flexibility. Partnership represents the most viable path for Latin America and potentially for other developing areas. For example, the Venezuelan Congress recently approved the development with Shell, Exxon and Mitsubishi of offshore gasfields and export of LNG to the US, at an outlay of Dollars 7bn. Agreements have also been reached with Conoco and Total, Ituchi and Marubeni to produce extra heavy crude, with investment outlays of Dollars 3.5bn. Interest in exploration in Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia and Argentina is currently high. The Ecuadorean government is shortly to issue exploration licences for 2.2m hectares. So far, 100 foreign oil companies have expressed interest and 50 have bought detailed documents on the Oriente (Amazon) and offshore blocks. Oil and gas pipeline contractors ware seeking to benefit from major construction projects in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia and Venezuela. At the other extreme, Argentina in 1993 privatised its state oil company YPF. But this is unlikely to serve as a model for the rest of Latin America. Although YPF is said to be the oldest state oil company in the world, it has never been the kind of nationalist symbol that Pemex was for Mexico. Full privatisation of state oil and gas companies would, if desired, prove nigh-impossible in most countries. For this reason, Mexico insisted on retaining Pemex's privileged status when signing the North America Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The position of Mexican President Carlos Menem is also stronger than that of most of his contemporaries. Success in attracting foreign companies will therefore depend on the terms of the contracts offered and on governments' willingness to stick to them. Latin America petroleum specialist Dr Chris Brogan says that if Latin America is to attract the finance necessary to develop its oil potential, 'it must ensure that contractual terms on offer are as good if not better than those being offered elsewhere in the world'. He adds that investors who their fingers badly burnt in the past must be convinced that contractual terms, once agreed, are not subjected to sudden, unilateral change. The need for Latin America to provide the best contracts possible becomes more acute given difficult operating conditions in many countries. Governments remain over-bureaucratic and occasionally corrupt, while exploration and production sites can be in remote areas with poor communications. There are high security risks in Colombia, where ultra-leftist guerrillas prey on the oil and gas sector, and Peru, where Shining Path guerrillas are not a beaten force. Two failed coups in 1992 in Venezuela did not directly affect the oil and gas sector but destabilised the country. In Venezuela the lead-up to the December 3 elections indicated a popular opposition to neo-liberal solutions which is likely to be echoed elsewhere in Latin America in 1994. It is unlikely that this mood change will result in attempts markedly to change oil and gas policies, though it may limit the extent to which governments such as Colombia can implement plans to make existing and future association contracts more competitive. Furthermore, the extractive industries are under pressure from environmental and indigenous groups. In Ecuador, the allocation of new oil exploration blocks in January is prompting increased controversy over the environmental impact of oil operations, particularly in Amerindian areas. Amerindian representatives began legal proceedings against Texaco in New York on November 3 in a bid to win Dollars 1.5bn-worth of compensation for environmental damage. This has implications for the region as a whole, and companies can help themselves by strict environmental controls and good relations with the grassroots in their areas of operation. In general, nothing succeeds like success. The reawakening of interest in Latin America was guaranteed in 1992 when a British Petroleum-led consortium discovered a big field in eastern Colombia, since identified as one of the Western Hemisphere's largest finds for 20 years. BP hopes to reach production of 150,000 b/d from Cusiana by the end of 1995 (this would represent a third of national production at today's levels), rising to 600,000 b/d thereafter. More such oil and gas finds would have a galvanising effect in the country concerned and sustain interest in Latin America as a whole. Under these circumstances, oil and gas companies will continue to tolerate difficult operating conditions if host governments behave supportively and avoid arbitrary actions.

Mr William Doyle, Director of Texaco China, described the 9,814 sq km Tarim bloc as a 'world class opportunity' for the five-member partnership, in which Agip will be the operating company. Other members of the consortium include Elf of France and two Japanese companies - Japan Energy Company and the Japan Petroleum Exploration Company. Each partner will have 20 per cent. Mr Doyle said he was aware of suggestions that China was offering less prospective areas in the Tarim basin to foreign participation, but Texaco was 'very pleased' with the potential of its concession, which lies at the western end of five being made available to foreign companies. China announced about a year ago that it was inviting foreigners to explore in promising onshore areas including the Tarim, which had long been eyed by the international petroleum industry as potentially 'one of the world's last great oil plays'. Response from foreign companies has been lukewarm, however, compared to the enthusiasm that greeted the opening of China's offshore areas in the early 1980s. Among factors dampening enthusiasm have been worries about lack of infrastructure in the Tarim and uncertainty about the construction of a pipeline to transport oil from the remote region. Mr Doyle said he was confident that if oil was discovered in commercial quantities that the Chinese would ensure that transport would be facilitated. He estimated a 2,000km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain would cost 'several billions'. Texaco has been relatively successful in its Chinese ventures. With its partners Agip and Chevron of the US, it is producing 60,000 barrels a day in the South China Sea. The American company recently signed agreements to explore in the East China Sea south of Shanghai. It is also involved in exploration in the Bohai Gulf, south-east of Beijing.

Remarkable increases have been seen in both the amount and  the number of projects involving state investment in the  northwestern provinces of Gansu, Qinghai and Shaanxi and the  Xinjiang Uygur and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regions.    So far, half of the fund for economic development of these  regions has come from state investment, which focuses on the  exploration and exploitation of coal and oil resources,  establishment of large state-owned enterprises and  infrastructure construction.    The five interior provinces and autonomous regions in  northwest China occupy one-third of the country's total  landspace. Among the 160 kinds of minerals found in China, 120  have been sited there.    Two out of the three newly-discovered large-scale natural  gas  fields are located in northwest China with the one in the basin  on the borders of Gansu, Shaanxi and Ningxia the country's  largest gas field ever found.    The plentiful natural gas of Shaanxi, the oil reserves of  Xinjiang, coal resources in Ningxia and the rich water power  resources of the Yellow River that winds through the region are  all of vital significance to the country's economic development.    Despite the area's rich natural resources, northwest China's  economic development has long lagged behind that of other parts  of the country for geographical and historical reasons.    Promotion of the local economy and exploitation of natural  resources has become an urgent need for the country. In China's  eighth five-year-plan, priority has been given to the  development of the transportation and electrical power  industries and the tapping of resources in northwest China.    Increased state investment has been rewarded with extensive  growth seen in electricity supplies, transporting capacity and  output of petroleum in the northwest region, which is expected  to become the country's number one energy supplier in the near  future.

0,FT924-12286 ,"FT924-12286 _AN-CJUB4AGGFT 921021   FT  21 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina to boost squid catch      By JOHN BARHAM      BUENOS AIRES   ARGENTINA PLANS sharply to increase its catches in the South Atlantic of the lucrative Illex squid, in direct competition with the Falkland Islands, which rely heavily on the sale of fishing licences. Mr Fernando Gutierrez, fisheries undersecretary, said yesterday that new regulations would allow up to 40 foreign-owned, special squid fishing vessels, known as jiggers, to operate in Argentine waters and catch up to 100,000 tonnes a year. The decision is an important step towards liberalising Argentina's fishing industry. By law, only locally-registered vessels may fish in its territorial waters. However, the new regulations will allow foreign ships to operate on a 'temporary charter' basis in association with Argentine nationals. Argentina lacks jigger capacity of its own and hopes to increase its share of Illex catches by attracting Asian-owned vessels to its waters. Argentina expects to catch only 60,000 tonnes of squid this year, up from 40,000 tonnes in 1991. In comparison, the Falklands expects to catch about 160,000 tonnes of Illex this year, 8.6 per cent less than in 1991. The Falklands introduced a successful licensing regime after the 1982 conflict with Argentina. Squid licences - sold largely to Japanese, Taiwanese and South Korean companies - account for 75 per cent of the Falklands' annual licence revenue of Pounds 24m. Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, warned that Argentina's decision would further depress already low Illex prices, and he added that increased fishing effort by Argentina could damage Illex stocks. The squid are very sensitive to environmental factors and over-fishing. Falling prices and the risk to the resource have led the Falklands to curtail fishing every year since 1989. Argentina, Britain and Falkland officials will hold a new round of their biannual fishery talks in London next month.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

In a two-hour meeting with representatives,  delegates, tour operators, and reporters attending the Cuba-94  tourism convention, President Castro answered more than a dozen  questions.    He said anything that has an impact on the economy is very  important to the country, that tourism is one of the areas with  the greatest impact, and that it is growing at a rate of almost  30 percent yearly. He added that because Cuba has tourist  potential, and especially because there is willingness to keep  it growing, tourism is considered a priority.    The blockade was also among the issues discussed at the  meeting with delegates, tour operators, and reporters from the  tourism convention. On this matter, the commander in chief said  President Clinton is maintaining his severity, but in a softer  manner and with less threatening, less bellicose words. He said,  however, that the severity of U.S. policy toward Cuba has not  changed. It remains the same.    Concerning foreign investments in the country, Fidel Castro  said the opening will be increasingly broader and that it is  perfectly conceivable because the objective is to attain the  means to develop the country.    When asked about how a socialist system can coexist with the  flow of foreign capital, Castro said that Cuba neither will give  up socialism nor defraud those who want to contribute to the  development of this and other fields, such as petroleum  exploration and exploitation.    Concerning the desired image for Cuba, Castro said he wants  to convey the image of a beautiful country with natural  conditions; a hospitable and sound nation; a well-organized,  drug-free country with a warm climate and a high culture that  protects the environment.    The 15th tourism convention gathered 971 delegates from 26  European and American countries and representatives from Algiers  and the Arab world.

The strike is in protest against the annulment of last year's presidential poll and the arrest two weeks ago of its deposed winner, Mr Moshood Abiola. Mr Abiola has been charged with treason after declaring himself president and is in police custody waiting for a plea for bail to be heard on July 14. The government said yesterday it had made 'special arrangements' to ensure supplies of petroleum products reached filling stations in Lagos and four other southern cities - Ibadan, Engugu, Benin and Port Harcourt - after this week's strike by Nupeng, the blue-collar oil workers' union, left most filling stations dry. It also said that the army would be providing help to ease the fuel shortage and that three military barracks in Lagos were selling fuel directly to the public. In line with a tough stand it has recently taken against civilian opponents, the government said that strikers who disrupted these measures would be regarded as saboteurs. The low official price of petrol in Nigeria, equivalent to some 2p a litre, has led to smuggling abroad of refined products. Military officers have been accused of taking part in the trade. The oil producing companies have maintained normal output of crude despite the strike by Nupeng, but the senior staff association Pengassan has now warned it will go on strike by July 12 unless the government agrees to 'resolve urgently the political crisis' by upholding the result of the presidential election as well as clearing all outstanding debts to joint venture partners, estimated at Dollars 700m (Pounds 461m). Pengassan blames recent job losses in the energy sector on the government's failure to fund its 60 per cent share of the joint ventures. 'Between December and May, 3,000 members or 20 per cent of our membership have lost their jobs due to redundancies by oil service and exploration companies.

The task  will be carried out by U.S. Army Engineering Corps personnel.    Di Tella said this is ""the first Argentine proposal the  Kelpers have accepted"" since the 1982 war. The foreign minister  added that the Kelpers' main conditions are that the work ""will  not be carried out by Argentine experts"" and that the work must  be guaranteed to be ""100 percent.""    The Argentine Armed Forces planted some 30,000 mines on the  islands during the conflict. It is estimated that the task of  withdrawing them will cost between $5 and $6 million.    The foreign minister expressed a desire to travel to the  islands once all mines are removed and ""to walk over"" the fields  that have been surrounded by barbed wire since the end of the  war. Argentines are forbidden entry to the islands.    During a news conference yesterday, Di Tella mentioned the  possibility of financing the cleanup through a World Bank loan  or a UN fund. The United Nations has approved a resolution  creating a reserve to finance the removal of millions of mines  planted around the globe. [passage omitted]    The foreign minister admitted that NAFTA is becoming  ""increasingly remote"" for Argentina.

BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of  the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez.    The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere  that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the  collapse of oil prices in 1986.    During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs,  closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others,  and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown  sources dwindled.    Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic  oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the  industry's gasoline refining business forever.    In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and  financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants  among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline  demand is expected to grow the fastest.    The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry  developments:    California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as  well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of  exploration and production units, including some staff cuts.    ""I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the  upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry,"" said Edward Morse,  executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.    Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in  California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining  half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern  California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa  Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said  last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational  companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the  Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would  bring Unocal more than $500 million.    ""I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here,"" said Thomas K.  Nance, Tosco's treasurer. ""The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight,  and the expectation is that the market will only get better.""    The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other  parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery  production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes  lube oil, aromatics and solvents.    ""It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as  they are, you just can't compete,"" said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf  Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other  regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The  West Coast has the strongest.    In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp  drop in domestic oil and gas production.    ""This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the  exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85,"" said Phillip  Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. ""The idea behind  it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . .  There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants,"" meaning fields  large enough to reward oil company development.    In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s,  according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is  expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990.  Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet.    The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about  75% to 78% of total E&P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse  said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its  annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more  than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990.    ""When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the  future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy  the cornerstone of their operations,"" said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of  Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall.    But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is  picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever  match pre-collapse levels. ""From almost every perspective, there are signs that  (exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the  U.S., but in the U.S. as well,"" Morse said.    The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been  climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the  oil services firm. As of Nov. 6, the number of rotary drilling rigs in use rose  to 1,042. That's still well below the peak level of 4,530 or so in 1981, but is  nevertheless the highest level since the winter of 1988. For the year, the rig  count remains below 1988 levels.    Natural gas appears the most promising, especially if clean air regulations  spur demand and the current oversupply diminishes as hoped. Amoco has made  natural gas development a prime goal of its domestic operations. It became the  largest owner of U.S. natural gas reserves with the acquisition last year of  Canada's Dome Petroleum and part of the Tenneco reserves.    On the refining side, analysts agree that most of the weaker operations have  been weeded out, and improvements have raised operating rates to their highest  levels ever as demand remains relatively strong and profit margins remain  generally good.    Refining capacity is so tight now that prices spike sharply at any disruptions,  such as Hurricane Hugo's destruction to Caribbean refineries or last month's  explosion at a Phillips Petroleum Co. plastics refinery in Texas. And some  observers fear that the high rates of utilization make such disruptions all the  more likely.    All of which is placing a premium on refinery assets, particularly on the West  Coast, where refining margins are highest. Environmental regulations make it  hugely expensive, if not altogether impossible, to build a new plant in  California.    Tight capacity has also renewed interest in other refining assets. Last month,  Coastal Corp. said it would reactivate the closed Exxon plant in Aruba in the  Caribbean.    A number of things keep analysts from being overly optimistic about a strong  rebound in the oil industry's fortunes:    Independent producers still await federal action to return tax benefits lost  during the rewrite of federal tax laws.    Continued oversupply of natural gas could keep prices soft and discourage new  domestic production.    Environmental pressures could keep drilling out of promising areas. A  continuation of moratoriums on offshore drilling could put outer continental  shelf areas off limits to production indefinitely, and post-Valdez concerns  will probably keep exploration out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    A downturn in the economy could mean the loss of refining profits at a time  when many will face upgrades to make cleaner gasolines or alternative fuels.    Looming over everything is uncertainty about where oil prices may go. Most  analysts expect prices to continue at their current levels through the year.  Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet later  this month to discuss their nations' production levels and other matters.      CUTTING BACK    Arco: The firm announced a reorganization plan in 1986 designed to reduce the  size of its domestic oil and gas work force by 23% -- about 2,000 employees --  and to divest itself of refining and petroleum marketing operations east of the  Mississippi River, as well as all remaining non-coal minerals operations.  Money-losing Arco Solar in Camarillo was sold earlier this year.    Chevron: By 1987, the company had eliminated 27,500 jobs since the 1984  acquisition of Gulf Oil. The reductions came through the sale of assets and  consolidation of operations.    Unocal: The company has been selling assets to reduce the heavy debt taken on  in 1985 when it fought a takeover bid by T.

BUT THERE ARE SOME BRIGHT SPOTS.      By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      The oil industry is entering the last decade of the century with the muck of  the 1980s still stuck to its boots like oil from the Exxon Valdez.    The legacy of the Valdez will haunt oil companies in California and elsewhere  that are just emerging from a period of major restructuring accelerated by the  collapse of oil prices in 1986.    During that time, major oil companies pared exploration and production staffs,  closed unprofitable refining operations and improved efficiencies at others,  and shifted emphasis from domestic to foreign oil prospecting as home-grown  sources dwindled.    Now, post-Valdez environmental concerns stand in the way of renewed domestic  oil and gas exploration, and proposed clean air rules threaten to transform the  industry's gasoline refining business forever.    In California, where environmental regulations are strictest, environmental and  financial obstacles to new refinery building are already making existing plants  among the most desirable in the industry -- and this in a place where gasoline  demand is expected to grow the fastest.    The last gasps of the industry's restructuring can be seen in recent industry  developments:    California companies such as Unocal Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., as  well as Mobil Oil Corp. and British Petroleum, have announced reorganization of  exploration and production units, including some staff cuts.    ""I think the layoffs are reflecting the real end of the depression in the  upstream (exploration and production) side of the industry,"" said Edward Morse,  executive publisher of industry newsletter Petroleum Intelligence Weekly.    Several refinery operations have gone on the block recently, many in  California. Southland Corp. said last week that it would sell its remaining  half-interest in Citgo Petroleum Corp., which operates a refinery in Northern  California, to the Venezuelan state-owned oil company for $675 million. Santa  Monica-based Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent refiner, said  last week that it was entertaining offers from at least three multinational  companies for its business. And Unocal is about to close its own deal with the  Venezuelans, a joint venture to operate Unocal's Chicago refinery that would  bring Unocal more than $500 million.    ""I think there's a recognition that this is a good market here,"" said Thomas K.  Nance, Tosco's treasurer. ""The supply-demand balance appears to be very tight,  and the expectation is that the market will only get better.""    The desirability of California refineries contrasts with refining in other  parts of the country. Unocal said last week that it would cease all refinery  production at its 65-year-old Beaumont plant in Nederland, Tex., which makes  lube oil, aromatics and solvents.    ""It was very out of date for the marketplace. . . . And with the margins as  they are, you just can't compete,"" said Unocal spokesman Barry Lane. The Gulf  Coast region's refining profit margins rank last behind those of three other  regions of the country, according to a report by Drexel Burnham Lambert. The  West Coast has the strongest.    In the country as a whole, the restructuring period has resulted in a sharp  drop in domestic oil and gas production.    ""This is really the second round in the long trend of downsizing in the  exploration and production business that started in '84 or '85,"" said Phillip  Ellis, a vice president with Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. ""The idea behind  it was that the U.S. resource base has the highest cost in the world. . . .  There's a lot of oil and gas left here, but very few elephants,"" meaning fields  large enough to reward oil company development.    In 1990, crude oil production will see the sharpest decline since the 1970s,  according to a forecast by the Independent Petroleum Assn. of America.  Production dropped 460,000 barrels per day in 1989 over a year earlier, and is  expected to fall an additional 329,000 barrels per day to 7.4 million in 1990.  Natural gas production remained level in 1989 at 16.6 trillion cubic feet.    The budget for domestic exploration and production, which accounted for about  75% to 78% of total E&P budgets, now constitutes less than half, Morse  said. Amoco Corp., traditionally one of the first companies to announce its  annual exploration budget, says that for the first time in its history, more  than half of its budget will be spent outside the United States in 1990.    ""When today's oil executives calculate and form their strategies for the  future, they confront the fact that U.S. oil production is not likely to occupy  the cornerstone of their operations,"" said Dillard P. Spriggs, president of  Petroleum Analysis Ltd., in a speech at Johns Hopkins University this fall.    But there are some signs that interest in domestic oil and gas exploration is  picking up as prices stabilize, although no one expects such activity to ever  match pre-collapse levels. ""From almost every perspective, there are signs that  (exploration and production) operations are increasing, mostly outside the  U.S., but in the U.S. as well,"" Morse said.    The prime indicator of new drilling activity -- the rig count -- has been  climbing steadily in the past few months, according to Baker Hughes Inc., the  oil services firm.

0,FT931-6548 ,"FT931-6548 _AN-DCACUACWFT 930301   FT  01 MAR 93 / A rich new seam: The UK's latest source of energy      By CLIVE COOKSON   Natural gas trapped in coal seams could give Britain a vast new source of usable energy. Geologists say UK reserves of coalbed methane, as the gas is called, may exceed 1,000bn cubic metres - comparable with the total volume in conventional North Sea gas fields. The oil industry is starting to drill wells to extract the methane, which Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, believes 'could represent a very valuable addition to our future energy supplies'. Yet it has hardly been mentioned in the debate currently raging about coal and gas in the UK. 'There seems to be a conspiracy of silence,' says one operator. 'No one wants to talk about a new huge source of gas at a time when many people think we already have more than we need.' Several technical, fiscal and regulatory obstacles will have to be overcome before Britain can exploit coalbed methane on the same scale as the US, where gas is now flowing at a rate of 30m cu m a day. But it could offer a vital supplement to UK gas supplies early in the next century, when the main offshore reserves are likely to have been used up. The Department of Trade and Industry awarded the first eight exploration licences for coalbed methane in 1991; 27 more followed last year. They cover coalfields in England, Wales and Scotland. UK exploration for methane is led by companies with US experience. Evergreen Resources, based in Colorado, is now testing the first well, Sealand-1 just west of Chester in north-west England, and is drilling a second well south of Rhyl on the north Wales coast. 'We believe Sealand is capable of production but we are still evaluating its commercial possibilities,' says Mr Ian Thompson, Evergreen's UK managing director. A dozen other companies are involved in UK coalbed methane exploration. They include Eastern Electricity, Kirkland Resources, Hillfarm Coal, Puffin Oil, Babcock Energy, Powergen and Conoco. All are drilling well away from collieries which could interfere with gas production. Any well is bound to find some methane because all coal seams contain the gas, adsorbed chemically on the surface of coal particles and filling the tiny spaces between them. The question is whether it can be extracted in commercial quantities. The methane is traditionally regarded as a safety hazard in coalmines. It has to be drained from the seams to prevent explosive quantities building up underground. Although small amounts of gas are sometimes used locally, for example to fire colliery boilers, it is normally vented into the atmosphere  -a waste of energy similar to the flaring of natural gas in an oilfield. From the environmental point of view it is better to extract methane for use as a fuel, because it is a powerful 'greenhouse gas'. Each molecule contributes 50 times more to global warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide. Commercial exploitation of coalbed methane started in the US during the 1970s, stimulated by new federal tax credits for unconventional gas production. Six thousand wells have been drilled in three main areas in Colorado/New Mexico, Alabama and Pennsylvania. The technology developed for extracting methane depends first on creating long fractures in the coal seam to enable the gas to flow more easily. The simplest technique, hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water at high pressure. Then the pressure is reduced at the surface - for example, by pumping water out of the well - to stimulate the flow of gas. Mr Eric Allen, an engineer with LAS Energy, a Canadian methane company, says the technology has improved significantly over the past 10 years. 'With recent advances in completion techniques, many new wells produce at levels which are spectacular by any conventional comparison.' Gas does not flow through coal seams as readily as through conventional sandstone reservoirs, so coalbed extraction generally requires more wells for a given area. But methane enthusiasts say the latest wellhead equipment does not make an obtrusive impact on the landscape. 'Drilling costs are higher in the UK than in the US but all other factors appear to compare favourably with the most productive areas in the US,' says Mr John Garratt, managing director of Puffin Oil, an independent energy company with methane interests in both countries. One attraction of the UK market is that gas prices 'are among the highest in the world'. But Mr Henry Boyd, secretary of the UK Onshore Operators Group, says: 'Coalbed methane will not be a bonanza for anyone. The returns will at best be moderate.' Mr Boyd points out that the outlook for coalbed methane in the UK is overshadowed by uncertainties about the fiscal and regulatory regimes. These are spelt out in a memorandum on coalbed methane prepared by Oil Management Services (OMS), a London consultancy which provides the group's administration. The main fiscal uncertainty concerns the point at which petroleum revenue tax would apply to a coalbed methane field. OMS says the reaction of some US companies is: 'Let us know when the UK works out its tax regime; meanwhile we will go to third-world countries which do know what their tax regime is.' A more fundamental legal question is: who owns coalbed methane? British Coal maintains that its property includes not only all coal in the UK but also the gas trapped within it. The onshore operators, on the other hand, insist that the methane belongs to the crown, although most agree that British Coal's permission is required to drill into its seams. 'Licensees have been outraged at the claims being made by British Coal,' says OMS. 'They did not expect to be required to make substantial additional payments to British Coal as a condition for exercising their petroleum licences.' The operators are lobbying the DTI hard to resolve the uncertainties and encourage methane production. The incentive is not only to provide a new indigenous energy source for the next century; it is also to lay the foundations for a UK industry which could export services and equipment to other European countries seeking to exploit their coalbed methane resources, just as the North Sea fields provided the basis for Britain's offshore oil and gas industry.

Service contracts for oil exploration and production will be open for bidding during September. The government is also soliciting bids for a project to increase the capacity of the country's two oil refineries and the Trans Ecuadorean pipeline. Increasing the capacity of the Refineria de Esmeraldas on the Pacific coast will cost about Dollars 120m, while work on the Refineria Amazonas is expected to cost Dollars 22.6m. Work on the projects is expected to be completed within two years and four years respectively. The pipes leading from the Amazonian rain forest across the Andes to the Pacific ports are to be fitted with higher capacity pumps, enabling them to transport more heavy crude oil, the principal type of crude discovered recently in the region. Ecuador's new foreign investment regulations give foreign and national investors equal opportunities. Foreign oil companies are still subject to a flat 44.4 per cent income tax for repatriated profits compared with 25 per cent for Ecuador companies. A Bill is to be presented to congress shortly in an attempt to equalise this tax structure. Mr Hans Collin, executive president of Petroecuador, said between 40 and 45 foreign and national companies have shown interest in bidding for the projects in this seventh solicitation round. He estimated that the country's oil industry required about Dollars 5bn in capital investment over the next five years to produce the projected 470m barrels a day by 1995, up from 273,000 b/d last year. Several area blocks which are now open for private sector exploitation in the Amazon region as well as on the Pacific coast had previously been reserved for Petroecuador. Mr Henri Bergasse, general manager of the French company Elf Hydrocarbures Equateur, said there were potentially interesting blocks opening up but that there was a risk of encountering heavy crude oil again. Production and transportation costs for heavy crude are considerably higher than for light crude oil and will thus cut in to profits. The solicitation will likely include Block 22, an area that has been subject to considerable controversy due to its importance as an ecological 'hot spot' and one of the last protected areas for indigenous people of the region.

""Kuwait has made a great deal of progress in its  negotiations with India and Pakistan to build large and modern  oil refineries in both countries,"" he said. He reaffirmed that  Kuwait rejects the idea that the Iraqi deputy secretary general  of OPEC, Ramzi Salman, should assume the position of acting  secretary general, and said that ""Kuwait is with the decision of  the international community on the question of reopening the oil  pipeline between Iraq and Turkey.""    The text of the interview follows:    [Taqi-al-Din] You are Kuwait's new petroleum minister; do  you  want to introduce a new plan for the oil sector?    [Al-Mid'aj] The oil sector in Kuwait is constantly  developing  and renewing itself. There are plans put into motion by my  predecessors, and there are new plans whose implementation I  will oversee in the near future, as Kuwait has emerged from a  terrible invasion and the destruction of its oil institutions.  They actually began to rebuild the oil sector after the  liberation. One thing we are doing is to adopt a new strategy  for our oil sector in terms of production, export, and oil  projects outside Kuwait.    [Taqi-al-Din] What are the priorities in terms of your oil  investments outside Kuwait?    [Al-Mid'aj] We have a long history of investment outside  Kuwait; it's nothing new. We have many activities in Europe, the  United States, East Asia, and the Arab countries. We have  refineries in Europe, we are investing in the gasoline  distribution sector, and we are active in oil exploration  through KUFPEC [Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company].  Also, our Santa Fe operations are ongoing abroad--these are  projects that were operating before, and still are.    [Taqi-al-Din] Are there any new ones?    [Al-Mid'aj] We are now looking at some new areas and will  complete our contacts with some of the countries we have  actually begun to consult with, such as the countries of the Far  East, to implement new oil production projects and get into  refining operations. We have now finished one round of  negotiations with India to build oil refineries there, and we  also have contacts with Pakistan to start up similar operations  in the near term. We still have not decided on the capacity of  these refineries, but I believe they will be modern and  high-capacity.    [Taqi-al-Din] What is your current production capacity?    [Al-Mid'aj] We have a production capacity of 2.4 million  barrels per day [bpd], and we are exporting 2 million. Turning  to our refining capacity, in 10 years Kuwait will have restored  its refining capacity to what it was before the invasion.  Refining capacity in our Kuwaiti refineries will increase by  nearly 100,000 bpd. (Refining capacity before the invasion  ranged from 800,000-880,000 bpd.) We are now in the final stages  of rebuilding the refineries that the Iraqi forces destroyed.    [Taqi-al-Din] It appears that the OPEC conference is unable  to choose a new secretary general, because Iran is nominating  its ambassador to Tokyo to that post and rejects the will of the  majority to appoint former Venezuelan minister Alirio Parra. It  is said that if nothing can be worked out, the Iraqi deputy  secretary general, Ramzi Salman, will become acting secretary  general. What do you think?    [Al-Mid'aj] It is absolutely unacceptable to us that Deputy  Secretary General Ramzi Salman be acting secretary general,  because the person who is given the post must be neutral, and  because the economic organization must have nothing to do with  politics. Our view is that the secretary general must be  neutral; he must not engage in politics, nor should he impose  the policy of one country, or be closer to one country than  another. It is a strictly economic organization. I hope we may  arrive at a solution and appoint a new secretary general who is  not aligned with any country.    [Taqi-al-Din] Are you comfortable with current oil price  levels?    [Al-Mid'aj] We will be comfortable if the oil market  stabilizes and if prices are reasonable, so there will be no  upset in the oil market. We do not approve of disruptions in  prices. We always seek to stabilize them, with the cooperation  of both sides: the producers and the consumers. Prices are now  in the process of improving logically and reasonably to the  point where producers are almost satisfied, and yet the prices  are not a burden to consumers.    [Taqi-al-Din] We hear a great deal these days about how the  United States has permitted the reopening of an oil pipeline  from Iraq and Turkey, in order to help Turkey. What is your  position on this?    [Al-Mid'aj] Our position is that of the international  community: There is an economic danger to Iraq, for well-known  reasons. We are with the international community, and if it  makes a decision, we will support it. I believe that the  international community will not put up with any political game  the Iraqis may have in mind, but we are with the international  community in any decision it makes on this subject     "

0,FT943-15503 ,"FT943-15503 _AN-EGHDJAFTFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru gets oil privatisation drive into gear      By SALLY BOWEN      LIMA   Privatisation of the core assets of Petroperu, Peru's state oil and gas company, has finally got off the ground with the release this week of a preliminary information memorandum. The strategy, devised by Merrill Lynch after technical studies by Arthur D. Little and other industry experts, is to split the company into 11 business units. For most of these a 60 per cent stake will be offered to private sector operators, with the state retaining 40 per cent. Auctions, by sealed bids, will start in October. Some analysts still question the decision to dismember the integrated company for sell-off. Its assets are very mixed, with the upstream operations more attractive than the elderly refineries. Two major oilfields, known as Blocks 8 and X, have proven reserves of 100m and 45m barrels respectively. Current output from the former, located in the northern jungle's Maranon basin, is 33,000 barrels a day. Block X, in the northern coastal basin of Talara, produces some 15,000 b/d. For sale separately are four refineries: La Pampilla, the largest, which serves Lima and the coast; medium-sized Talara on the north coast; the small refinery and terminal at Iquitos on the Amazon River; and Conchan, just south of the capital, which is the sole asphalt producer for the Lima market. Conchan twice failed to find a buyer when offered at auction in late 1992. Most important of the remaining five business units is the Japanese-built pipeline, the only means of transporting crude from the northern jungle fields to the Talara terminal. It now operates at about 40 per cent of its 200,000 b/d capacity and will be offered as a renewable concession for 10 years at a time. Other Petroperu assets up for sale are a gas gathering system, with storage facilities and pipeline; marine terminals and airport fuel plants; the liquefied petroleum gas storage facility in Lima's port of Callao; a lubricants blending plant; and electric power generating facilities in the Talara region. In line with the government's objective of creating competition in the local market, bidders will be subject to certain restrictions: the future operator of La Pampilla, for example, will be barred from purchasing Talara, Conchan or the Callao terminal. Petroperu was created in 1969 when General Velasco's left-wing military regime nationalised the assets of International Petroleum Corporation (a subsidiary of Exxon), Chevron and Belco. The company was charged with all Peru's oil-related activities, from exploration through refining to sales and distribution. In the early years, the state made big investments and some major finds. The 200,000 b/d northern pipeline was built with Japanese financing and the refineries at Talara and La Pampilla were expanded. Decline set in, however, when the international oil price slumped in the early 1980s. The state proved a poor manager, swelling Petroperu's payroll with political appointees and pursuing incoherent pricing policies that left the company badly decapitalised. Foreign investment flows dwindled, then disappeared altogether in the mid-1980s. Peru's crude oil production slumped from 1982's peak of 195,000 b/d to 115,000 b/d in 1991. From being an oil exporter, the country became a net importer. Exploration came to a virtual standstill and reserves shrank to 360m barrels at the end of 1993. New oil legislation passed in August 1993 was designed to attract foreign investors back and, to a certain extent, is doing so. Perupetro, a small state agency, now promotes, negotiates and administers contracts for exploration and production, while Petroperu must compete on equal terms with the private sector. Since 1993, 11 contracts have been negotiated by private oil companies - including Petrotech and Maple Gas of the US and China's Sapet, a subsidiary of China National Petroleum. Perupetro has a similar number of further contracts in the pipeline with, among others, Arco of the US, Elf Aquitaine of France and Spain's Repsol. Occidental Petroleum, Peru's old-established and biggest producer, has also embarked on new exploration and development ventures. Modest investments by private operators - and by a now financially-viable Petroperu - are starting to have an impact on output. This year's First quarter production, at 130,000 b/d, was 5 per cent higher than 1993's. But the oil trade deficit for the quarter still cost the country almost Dollars 18m. Perupetro's new president Mr Alberto Bruce is upbeat about prospects. 'Investors are flocking in,' he says, attributing fresh interest to increased confidence in Peruvian economic management, the attractive legal framework and the decline of terrorism. 'At this rate, we'll have to buy bits of Brazil and Argentina to satisfy all of them.' But Peruvian production costs are high and, so far, the promising geology has failed to throw up any major strikes comparable with Colombia and Ecuador's. By far Peru's biggest prospect so far is the huge Camisea gas fields, discovered in 1986 by Royal Dutch Shell. The company is currently updating feasibility studies and could sign a development contract, perhaps worth Dollars 2bn, late next year. Peru's immediate future looks to be in the hands of the smaller international and national operator. Nut that is not necessarily a disadvantage, according to Mr Roger Alderson, chief executive of Great Western Resources, a medium-sized company prepared to invest Dollars 80m in Peru over the next five years. 'As in Colombia, we smaller firms come in, take the risks and attract the big fish once we start showing results,' he says. 'Peru continues to be the great unexplored.'

But in Port Stanley  (Falkland Islands), another research ship, the ""Akademik Ioffe,""  which also belongs to the Institute of Oceanography imeni P.P.  Shirshov of the Russian Academy of Sciences, has been under  arrest since 17 March as a hostage for the ""Vavilov"" that  ""slipped away."" However, the story of the seizure of one ship  and the ""escape"" of another began long before the unpleasant  outcome for the Russian side and it is not yet over.    Just a few years ago research ships of this class performed  an enormous amount of work in the study of the world oceans,  including in the interests of the Russian Navy. For example, it  was only because of the unique equipment and efforts of the  command of the research ship ""Akademik Mstislav Keldysh"" that it  was possible to clarify the situation with respect to the  nuclear submarine ""Komsomoletz"" lying on the bottom of the sea.  For well-known reasons, however, today it is practically  impossible to maintain the unique fleet and to carry out  research through the means of the state budget only. Last year,  therefore, the Institute of Oceanography of the Russian Academy  of Sciences leased the reseach ship ""Akademik Sergey Vavilov"" to  the Russian-German joint enterprise ""Polar Shipping"" out of St.  Petersburg for a period of five years for tourist cruises. Under  the contract, the charterer had the right to make tourist  cruises and to obtain an income from this activity under that  condition that the charterer will assume all of the expenditures  for the maintenance of the ship, including material-technical  supply, the cost of fuel, the payment of the crew, and  registered repairs. As payment for the five-year lease, the  company ""Polar Shipping"" obligated itself to pay the  expenditures of two scientific expeditions on this ship for 100  days each and costing $400,000.    But after just six months of operations, the company refused  to finance the first expedition. Moreover, in the period from  the 8th through the 15th of November of last year in the port of  Bremerhaven (Germany), a German firm carried out a repair of the  research ship ""Akademik Sergey Vavilov"" for the sum of 338,800  German marks [DM]. The company ""Polar Shipping"" assigned an  intermediary firm to perform work in connection with the  repairs, but when it came time to settle accounts there was no  one to pay. On 15 December of last year, the Institute of  Oceanography canceled the contract with the joint enterprise  ""Polar Shipping."" Not having contract relations with the  representative of the German intermediary firm, the institute  naturally could not control his actions and the institute did  not sanction the servicing of the ship on credit.    Meanwhile, the German creditor companies, despairing of the  prospects of somehow getting back the funds invested in the  repairs, turned to the supreme court of the Falkland Islands, in  whose district the research ship ""Akademik Sergey Vavilov"" was  operating in those days, to demand the money from the ship  owner, the Institute of Oceanography. In those same latitudes,  another ship of the institute, the ""Akademik Ioffe,"" made a  cruise with paid passengers on board under contract with a  Canadian tourism company. The captain of the ""Vavilov"" was  warned of the threat of seizure, and, landing his passengers in  one of the ports of Argentina, did not go to the Falklands. The  completely unsuspecting crew of the ""Akademik Ioffe"" stopped  there in Port Stanley. It is now well known how that ended for  them. The ship was seized. It is still unclear what will happen  next. In Russia, they prefer not to talk about the incident, and  in Germany, judging by published articles, they are formulating  prospects that are by no means pleasant for us. In the article  ""Double Freight,"" for example, one German newspaper writes: ""The  scientific research ships ""Akademik Sergey Vavilov"" and  ""Akademik Ioffe"" were built in Finland in 1988 and their cost  exceeded $30 million. Today it cannot be ruled out,"" the  newspaper stresses, ""that the indebtedness of the German company  will lead to the sale of the ship ""Akademik Ioffe"" at auction.""    I tried to find out from Igor Mikhaltsev, doctor of physical  and mathematical sciences and the head of one of the  laboratories of the Institute of Oceanography, what they think  about this in Russia. By directive of the president of the  Academy of Sciences of the Russian Federation, Igor Yevgenyevich  was appointed chairman of a special commission to investigate  this entire story. But through intermediaries I. Mikhaltsev  refused to meet with the correspondent prior to the conclusion  of the trial and the final end of this whole story.    As of today, the captain of the ""Akademik Ioffe"" has sent an  official protest to the governor of the Falkland Islands. A  letter about defense was sent through an English legal firm that  undertook to represent the interests of the Oceanographic  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the ship. At the  same time, the institute appealed to a maritime arbitration  commission in Moscow with an action against the company ""Polar  Shipping"" to prevent the sale of the ship at auction. To ""free""  the ship, it is necessary to make a deposit to the Supreme Court  of the Falkland Islands or to provide a guarantee from a  first-class Western bank and then to proceed with the trial in  accordance with the procedures of the English court. The amount  of the deposit is considerable--about DM400,000 for the claim of  the shipyard, $50,000 for legal services, and $25,000 to pay for  the forced stay in the port. Depending upon the course of the  review of the case in the Supreme Court of the Falkland Islands,  there may be additional claims of other German firms for a total  of DM1,125,985.29. It will then be necessary to make a deposit  for these claims as well.    Of course the ship owners have no idea where they can seek  such funds. But something else is clear. Russian science, which  has made a truly titanic contribution to the investigation of  the world oceans, must not lose its authority and the authority  of a power by degrading itself to the point of transporting  tourists on unique ships. For this reason, the return of the  seized ship is a matter of the honor of Russia and it is in its  interests not to diminish the dignity of domestic scientists  through the temptation of irresponsible business even on behalf  of the noble goals of scientific research.

0," FR940628-2-00109   FR940628-2-00084        A basic feature of T.D. 56487 was that refiners could, at their option, attribute to designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives a quantity of an exported petroleum product in excess of the quantity of that petroleum product actually produced from either the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative or the crude petroleum or petroleum derivative that was substituted for the designated import. This feature, called ``producibility,'' permits drawback to be claimed on a given quantity of designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives up to the quantity of an exported petroleum product which     could     have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. Under the producibility concept, as provided for in T.D. 56487, a refiner is not required to establish that the exported articles were actually produced from the substituted crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives; the refiner need only show that the exported articles     could     have been produced from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative.     The application of the producibility concept to petroleum refinery operations is illustrated in the following example, quoted from the ruling published as T.D. 78419.            Suppose that 100 barrels of crude petroleum are refined into 10 products in equal amounts, including 10 barrels of motor gasoline. One half of the crude is imported duty-paid, which can be designated for drawback, and one half (50 barrels) is domestic of the same kind and quality. Only the motor gasoline is exported.    The production standards for petroleum, unlike those for most chemicals, are subject to variation at the election of the refiner. In other words, the refiner could have produced 91 barrels of motor gasoline from 100 barrels of crude [i.e. Class III], had he wanted to.     To require the refiner to designate a quantity of imported crude sufficient to have produced concurrently each product actually produced, whether or not exported, would either require him to designate more than the 50 barrels of imported crude that was used, or to accept drawback on only 5 barrels (one-half) of the total quantity of motor gasoline exported.     On the other hand, disregarding the nonexported products for the purpose of determining the quantity of imported crude to designate, it is clear that up to 91 percent of the 50 barrels of imported crude could have been refined into motor gasoline. Therefore, the refiner would have to designate only slightly more than 10 barrels of imported crude to cover all of the motor gasoline exported. This is the Treasury Department position.            The quantity of a given petroleum product which could have been produced from a given quantity of crude petroleum or petroleum derivative is determined on the basis of ``Industry Standards of Potential Production on a Practical Operating Basis.'' These standards were published in T.D. 6616. The standards listed the quantity of 17 petroleum products which could have been produced from four classes of crude petroleum and 12 petroleum derivatives (e.g., the producibility percentages for class III crude petroleum for motor gasoline and aviation gasoline are 91 and 40 respectively, meaning that 91 gallons of motor gasoline or 40 gallons of aviation gasoline could be produced from 100 gallons of class III crude petroleum).     In addition to establishing procedures for the use of the concept of producibility for the refining of crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives, T.D. 56487 divided crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives into classes for purposes of determining same kind and quality. (In order to claim drawback under 19 U.S.C. 1313(b) on the exportation of articles manufactured from domestic or other merchandise substituted for designated imported merchandise, the designated imported merchandise and the substituted merchandise must be of the same kind and quality.) Four classes, based on API gravity, were established. Crude petroleum in any one class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality as any other crude petroleum included in the same class and any named petroleum derivative in any class would be considered as being of the same kind and quality as the same named derivative in the same class. As stated above, under T.D. 56487, a refiner was not required to establish that     the     crude petroleum or petroleum derivative used to produce the exported article was of the same kind and quality as the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative; the refiner was required to establish that this     could     have been the case. (I.e., If a refiner used different classes of crude petroleum during a production period subject to different standards of producibility, the refiner was required to establish only that a sufficient quantity, taking into consideration the applicable standards of producibility, of crude petroleum of the same class as the designated imported crude petroleum was used in the refinery during the period; not that it was actually used for the production of exported article.)     Distribution of drawback among the products produced during a production period under T.D. 56487 is based on the relative values of all products manufactured or produced during the production period, as of the time of separation of the products. (The time of separation of the products is considered to be the monthly period of production.) Relative values are stated in terms of drawback factors, which attach to each of the products manufactured or produced during the production period. (E.g., If, under T.D. 56487, crude petroleum was used to produce 50 barrels of motor gasoline valued at $30 per barrel, 25 barrels of distillate oils valued at $20 per barrel, and 25 barrels of all other petrochemical products valued at $80 per barrel, the drawback factors would be: motor gasoline"," FR940628-2-00109   FR940628-2-00084        A basic feature of T.D. 56487 was that refiners could, at their option, attribute to designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives a quantity of an exported petroleum product in excess of the quantity of that petroleum product actually produced from either the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivative or the crude petroleum or petroleum derivative that was substituted for the designated import.

The quantity of crude petroleum which may be designated for the exportation of a particular product is determined by multiplying the quantity of the article exported by the drawback factor. (E.g., In the above example if 10 barrels of motor gasoline were exported, 7.5 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated; if 10 barrels of petrochemical products were exported, 20 barrels of crude petroleum could be designated.)

""It is not a question of making a payment in order to throw  people out. I simply said that compensation could be given for  the transfer (of sovereignty). This is quite normal throughout  the world where this type of transfer has occurred. Although  there have not been many such transfers, there has always been  economic compensation,"" Di Tella said in a radio interview.    The foreign minister had stressed in an interview that he  granted to the British newspaper THE FINANCIAL TIMES that the  Argentine Government would be willing to ""consider financial  compensation"" for the Malvinas residents ""in view of the  psychological distress that would affect them when they handed  over the sovereignty of the islands.""    In view of the repercussions regarding these remarks, Di  Tella made it clear that the proposal to compensate the Kelpers  [preceding word in English] ""is part of a much more complex  negotiation"" between the involved parties.    ""The consideration that must be taken into account first is  how to deal with the way of life of the islanders. If this does  not come first, ""the issue of compensation will seem to be  offensive. The economic part, which also exists and which I  believe to be very important, would come after that,"" Di Tella  said when referring to the government's proposal.    Through the constitutional reform that is under way, the  2,000 Malvinas residents could obtain the legal status of a  ""minority"" and this would legally guarantee respect for their  language, religion, and customs.    This is established in a draft bill that the Foreign  Ministry  is studying and that the executive branch will presumably submit  to the Constituent Assembly, which is sitting in the city of  Santa Fe. The so-called Kelpers [preceding word in English]  would then be considered Argentine citizens, although with the  status of a ""minority"" with their own characteristics as is the  case with the indigenous peoples or the members of some foreign  communities.    The initiative is being developed by officials, politicians,  and technicians of the Foreign Ministry headed by Di Tella on  the basis of a proposal made by Justicialist Party Deputies  Carlos Branda and Florencio Acenolaza. Acenolaza is the  president of the Foreign Relations Committee.     "

Estimates say some 4.6 billion tons of crude oil and 2,480  billion cubic metres of natural gas are contained in the sea.  Combined, they are equivalent to 6.5 billion tons of crude oil.    The exploration, expected to span seven to eight years, will  be carried out by oil firms such as the American-based Exxon,  Texaco and Chevron; the Italian Agip; and the Netherlands' Royal  Dutch Shell.    Reserves verified so far in China's offshore areas ensure  that annual production of oil will increase from last year's 4.6  million tons to 12 million tons within four years, and continue  at 8 million tons thereafter. However, future development will  depend on the size of future discoveries.    On Tuesday, an engineering vessel began seismic work in a  block awarded to a consortium consisting of Texaco, Agip and the  Danish firm Maersk.    It is the first prospecting move by a foreign oil group  there.    As the first winning team in an international bidding  conducted by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC), the three foreign firms were awarded three offshore  blocks, 400 kilometres southeast of Shanghai.    Also on Saturday, some 20 Chinese and foreign technical  firms  moved into Wenzhou, a service centre for oil operations in the  area.    The firms will provide technical services for the project.  Engineering vessels also are to be hauled to nearby ports and  heavy equipment will be installed at the bases for future use.    Other foreign oil firms that won bids are to kick off  seismic  work in the sea later this month or the next. A CNOOC official  said seismic work is likely to begin in all contract blocks  within the next two months.    The bidding for exploring the East China Sea, announced in  l992, ended in January this year with 18 contracts and  agreements signed with 17 firms from seven countries.    The bidding was for 72,800 square kilometres, divided into  20  blocks. All but two of the blocks--7,800 square  kilometres--were snapped up.    Chen, CNOOC's vice-president, last week called the  international bidding a success. ""The results are better than  expected,"" he said.    In the fourth quarter of this year, the Texaco-led group and  another group consisting of Japan Petroleum Exploration Co  (Japex) and Teikoku Oil Co are likely to drill test wells. The  two Japanese firms were awarded two blocks.    According to contracts, foreign oil firms will conduct  20,000  kilometres of seismic lines and drill 50 test wells in the sea.  They expect to use $300 million to finance the exploration.    He attributed the success partly to Chinese offshore oil  firms' good reputations.    To date, CNOOC has signed 94 contracts and agreements with  55  firms from 15 countries. Some $3.4 billion in overseas funds  have been used for oil operations in the South China Sea and the  Bohai Sea.    Chen said China did not open the sea until 1993 because more  work was needed to avoid disputes over the China-Japan ocean  boundary, unsettled in some places.    Chen did not elaborate on that diplomatic matter, but said  CNOOC had successfully handled related issues and could ensure  implementation of the bidding.    The saying is untrue that China had been reluctant to open  the sea to foreign oil firms because that site is the country's  most petroleum-rich offshore area, Chen said.    China opened the South China Sea and the Bohai Sea in the  early 1980s.    China, during explorations of the sea before the  international bidding began, had conducted 120,000 kilometres of  seismic lines and drilled 28 wells there.     "

0,FT942-660 ,"FT942-660 _AN-EF1DKAFAFT 940628   FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Exceptional gain helps Hogg Robinson to Pounds 21m      By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent   Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, announced annual pre-tax profits up from Pounds 13.3m of Pounds 21.5m, including a Pounds 7.25m net gain from the sale of the holiday business to Airtours last year. The group benefited from an upsurge in business travel, with operating profits for the year to March 31 more than doubled to Pounds 4.58m, compared with Pounds 2.04m. Profits from transport, however, were down by 21 per cent from Pounds 6.04m to Pounds 4.76m. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the international trailer, haulage and logistics businesses had done well, despite the recession in Germany and other continental countries. It was insufficient, however, to offset weaknesses in HR Embassy, the UK-based general freight forwarding arm, which suffered from not being sufficiently large to benefit from economies of scale, Mr Perry said. He hoped to move this part of the business out of loss but said it would never make large profits. New management had been installed. He added that although the business was not on the market, he would consider offers. The third part of the transport business, the shipping service to the Falkland Islands, was severely affected by a drop in cargo movements to the south Atlantic. Financial services saw profits rise from Pounds 5.24m to Pounds 5.65m. Mr Perry said this side of the business had strengthened in the second half of the year, as companies recovering from the recession increasingly purchased advice on pensions and employee benefits. Group turnover was down at Pounds 153.8m (Pounds 172.7m) including Pounds 9.48m (Pounds 30.4m) from discontinued activities and Pounds 1.4m from acquisitions. Earnings per share were 23.49p (14p). The proposed final dividend is increased by 8.75 per cent to 4.35p, bringing the total for the year to 7.1p, against 6.6p. COMMENT Hogg Robinson is not helped by the widely-held perception that it is still a holiday company. In fact, this part of the business has since been renamed Going Places by its new owners, Airtours. Nor is it aided by its corporate perversity in managing to run a transport business which does well in recession-hit Germany and badly in the recovering UK. While the business of carrying goods to the Falkland Islands is improving, it is difficult to see its prospects are particularly exciting. The profit increase in financial services is less than impressive in a recovering UK corporate sector and the group will have to demonstrate that the improvement in the second half is sustainable. The only unambiguous good news is in business travel, where the UK upturn has shown through in buoyant profit figures.   Companies:-  Hogg Robinson.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Thus, an earlier (December 1993) agreement may materialize,  which provides for increasing Russian petroleum piping across  Ukraine's territory to Central and West European nations from  5.5 million tons in 1993 to 8 million tons this year.    The issue of transit piping and transshipment tariffs  involving the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility remains  unsettled, though, same as Russia's schedule of export petroleum  piping.    Ukraine has agreed to lower its averaged $3 per ton tariff,  though no exact figure has been divulged. Nonetheless, as  spokespersons of the Ukrainian State Committee for Oil and Gas  maintain, the deal is mutually profitable.    Under the Russo-Ukrainian General Agreement the Koneks firm,  which was co-founded by major Russian petroleum extractors, has  been granted the exclusive right to export Russian crude  petroleum and petroleum products.    Russia's Transneft joint-stock company is in charge of  piping  petroleum to Ukraine's border. The Russian joint-stock company  agreed specific schedules of petroleum delivery to Ukraine's  border with its Ukrainian partner, Ukrtransneft, which is in  charge of further Russian petroleum piping across Ukraine's  territory to the Odessan petroleum transshipment facility. (For  more details see UBN no. 13/1994).    Besides, Ukrtransneft concluded additional contracts with  foreign firms, engaged in Russian petroleum exports, in view of  the Odessan transshipment facility's 15 million tons a year  capacity.    Currently, Ukrtransneft has such contracts signed with  Lukoil, Telf, Stanford and Galaxy.     "

Latest statistics show that Daqing, China's largest  oilfield,  pumped 13.86 million tons in the period from January through  March--100,000 tons more than in the same period last year.    Daqing, whose output accounts for 40 percent of China's  total, will maintain annual production at more than 56 million  tons at least until 1995, and 50 million tons through the year  2000.    Chinese onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of oil  last year.    In the first quarter of this year, the onshore oilfields  produced 34.33 million tons, up 0.58 percent over the same  period last year.    Output of the Liaohe, Xinjiang and Dagang oilfields during  the first quarter were, respectively, 3.6 million tons, up 5.4  percent; 1.95 million tons, up 10.4 percent; and 1.04 million  tons, up 4.1 percent.    However, production at some other major oilfields dropped as  expected. Most of the country's oilfields, concentrated in  Northeast and Central China, have been exploited for decades.    A senior official from the China National Petroleum  Corporation (CNPC) says he is confident production at the old  oilfields can be maintained. Onshore oil production for this  year is expected to be 140 million tons.    The official said measures will be taken to stabilize or  even  increase production.    CNPC, the country's largest oil firm, intends to beef up  investment and technology development in East China, with  approval from the central government.    Old oilfields in this region are expected to be the pillar  of  the country's petroleum industry until at least the year 2000.  CNPC's goal is to keep annual production in the East at more  than 124 million tons, the official said.    East China reports progress in discovering new oil reserves  and working out techniques to exploit heavy-oil reserves and  oilfields where geological conditions are used to limit  production.    In addition, equipment and expertise to develop shallow  offshore waters on the continental shelf have been worked out.    While trying every means to stabilize production in the old  oilfields, CNPC will accelerate exploration and development in  the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar basins in West China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Billions of tons of oil  reserves in the region are expected to benefit by the national  economy in the next century.     "

It is quite certain that he is still  firmly behind President Tudjman, although some in the HDZ  [Croatian Democratic Union] say that up to now he has been close  to what is called the left wing. Greguric is a successful  businessman, an advocate of privatization, managing director of  the most important firm in Croatia, and the president's economic  adviser, and therefore always an interesting and relevant source  of information, even when he is evading ""hot"" political topics.    [Dujmovic] Do you agree with the critics who say that  transformation is showing that the adopted model is defective?  Is there truth in the speculation that Croatian emigres are  being prevented in various ways from taking part in the  transformation?    [Greguric] Debate on the proposal for transformation of  socially owned firms was conducted very temperamentally among  the experts, in the Croatian Government, in the Croatian  Parliament, and in many public discussions before the law was  adopted in regular proceedings. The Law on Sale of Socially  Owned Housing and other laws regulating the issue of commercial  space were adopted at the same time. The law was debated during  1991, and then it was adopted toward the end of the year.    The law has also been supplemented and amended on several  occasions. When military operations spread in Croatia, new  relations were created on Croatian soil, and they required  serious changes in the law; among other things they have  resulted in the gratis distribution of shares to disabled  veterans of the homeland war and families of fighting men who  were killed, and also exemptions in making regular payments that  have come due for shares already purchased. That is why the law  should be viewed dynamically over the period from its adoption  to the present day, and it needs to be said that the Croatian  Government and Parliament have shown an appreciation for the  position of small shareholders, whose position actually is more  and more difficult, and for Croatia's impoverished economy. So,  I cannot accept the assertion that the Law is defective,  especially since there is no ideal law for this subject matter,  just as there is no optimum model of transformation of socially  owned property. Every country that had a socialist system has  been resolving the issue of transformation of ownership of  socially owned and government-owned firms in its own way,  adapting it to its own material and political conditions.    Nor is there any basis for speculation that Croatian emigres  are being prevented from taking part in the transformation. It  is quite certain that there has been a great deal of  misunderstanding on both sides; the emigres expected to receive  better information about possible purchase of shares of small  and medium-sized firms, but the Fund and the firms involved in  transformation proceedings did not have all the necessary  documents prepared for quality transformation. Today the  situation in this area is much better than it was a year or more  ago: The Fund has put together a team of specialists, the  enabling regulations are in place, and there is a readiness to  quickly process the applications of our emigres. For instance,  the Karlovac Brewery was sold to Mr. Luksic in the United  States, Mr. Radosevic has become the owner of the former Zagreb  Bus Factory, and many others have found ways of becoming owners  of real estate in Croatia.    I mentioned the Law on Sale of Socially Owned Housing. Under  that law 157,000 units of socially owned housing have so far  been sold out of a total of 393,000, which under wartime  conditions has also been a considerable contribution to  resolving more rapidly not only the issue of privatization of  the housing stock, but also the issue of replenishing the state  budget.    [Dujmovic] As the president's adviser for the economy,  please  tell us whether there is any serious intention to undertake the  process of denationalization, which has been announced for  months now?    [Greguric] The process of denationalization has been debated  in recent days by the HDZ presidium, at the request of the  Government of the Republic of Croatia. I must say that there are  no good reasons to fear denationalization and that too much  mystery is being made of this term. I would like to recall once  again that in 1991 all private applications for recovery of  nationalized property were recorded in the government office for  denationalization, and an immense job was done, and that is the  basis for material assessment of the consequences of  denationalization. Be that as it may, there is no reason for  initiating a broad debate of the criteria for denationalization,  especially since the beginnings of denationalization were  envisaged by laws adopted in 1991 and 1992 -- the Law on  Transformation of Socially Owned Enterprises and the package of  housing laws. I think that the government has a good concept and  it should be analyzed disinterestedly and submitted to regular  public and parliamentary proceedings.    There is no ideal solution, and it cannot all be given back;  denationalization ought to be carried out in both forms, i.e.  the natural form, the return of real estate and property, where  this can be done without creating new injustices; when that is  not possible because of interests of the state and public  interests, material compensation should be used, as is done by  all countries in the world. In other words, we should not flee  from denationalization but undertake a public debate and  adoption of the law as soon as possible.    [Dujmovic] Will foreign oil companies be allowed to open  service stations, and when might that happen?    [Greguric] The INA [Petroleum Industry] is not alone in  marketing petroleum products on the Croatian market. You know  that during the last quarter of last year we rented out 30  service stations in Croatia, and after the experience we have  had in that connection, we are thinking of renting out another  80 service stations, subject to certain criteria. The criteria  have been published in the daily press. Commissions consisting  of representatives of INA, the zupanijas, and the trade unions  have made the selection, so that in this way we have protected  not only our own interests but also the interests of the  employed personnel and the interests of the local authorities on  whose territories the service stations are operating. At the  same time, you have seen for yourself the emergence of private  service stations; we think that this is a good thing, that it  strengthens competition, raises the quality of services, and  offers something more than what was offered by our stations  alone. The Galic service station as you leave Zagreb on the  Varazdin road is an example; along with a beautiful design,  quality service, and facilities from a restaurant to a small  motel, it offers everything that might attract the public. In  addition to pumping gas, the individual may need to have his car  washed, to buy things he needs on the trip, and to rest. This is  also good because it stimulates a rise in the quality of  services at our service stations.    Now, we already have foreign oil companies in Croatia, for  example OMV Istrabenz, which is owned by three oil companies:  INA, OMV and Istrabenz. Other foreign oil companies will  probably also come, since most expect a definitive peace on our  territory and cessation of the war in our neighborhood. Just as  soon as lasting peace is established in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we  are preparing to undertake intensive reconstruction and  development of service stations on this territory as well as in  the temporarily occupied regions of Croatia.    [Dujmovic] During the debate about tax regulations, some  deputies proposed higher taxation of oil and petroleum products  after the pattern of the Western countries. Are the estimates  accurate that this would augment the budget by 40 percent?    [Greguric] There is a bill in Parliament proceedings  concerning a special tax on petroleum products calling for  taxation of all types of motor gasoline, diesel fuel, heating  oil, mazut and LP gas. We consider it quite natural as part of  the new tax system for value-added taxes to be adopted in the  manner envisaged by the law. We can only speak about whether the  rates of the special tax on petroleum products, so-called excise  taxes, are comparable to similar taxes in other European  countries. I think no reasonable person can object to payment of  the tax, just as no reasonable person can fail to take into  account the available technological condition of refinery  installations for the production and refining of petroleum and  the distribution system. It is often forgotten that we need to  bear in mind that every country in the world must have a minimal  energy independence and self-sufficiency, just as we must have  it in the areas of defense and protection of the state. Under  such conditions Croatia must have secure sources of all types of  energy, from electric power to petroleum products. If that were  not the case, of course, we would have had a hard time during  this war --which, we hope, is behind us -- obtaining sufficient  quantities of energy sources.    Unfortunately, the former system and Yugoslavia  systematically depleted the Croatian oil industry. They put  pressure through the price system on domestic oil and gas  production and favored cheap energy on the territory of the  former Yugoslavia, especially in parts which did not have  sources of oil and gas, which means in Serbia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Now that petroleum production in Croatia  is practically stagnant, and the refineries are worn out because  of low investment, we face a decision on more intense oil and  gas exploration and rapid reconstruction and modernization of  the refineries so that we can make optimum use of the  professional potential and international reputation of the  Croatian oil industry to plug it back into the advanced European  countries. Many say that this is not necessary, since we can buy  oil and petroleum products more cheaply, but I think that such a  simple and one-sided short-term policy would destroy that  industry and make Croatia completely energy-dependent, which  must not be the policy of the young state of Croatia.    [Dujmovic] With respect to peaceful reintegration of the  UNPA  [UN Protected Areas], the issue of INA's entry into the occupied  areas will certainly be raised soon. Do you have a program  prepared?    [Greguric] In late November 1993 we submitted to the  Parliament's commission for relations with the Serbs in the  temporarily occupies aread of Croatia a proposal for gradually  opening service stations. Specifically, we proposed for a start  that service stations be opened in Okucani and Petrinja to  supply the public in that area with INA's assortment of fuel,  obviously at the prices in effect in the other parts of our  homeland. We proposed payment in Croatian dinars or any other  convertible currency. Unfortunately, there has been no response  to that proposal. Now, we are continuing to offer it, we are  reiterating it even through this interview. At the same time, we  offer to use our service stations in the temporarily occupied  areas to market fertilizer and other products that would fill  out the shelves of our stations. It is now up to the Serbs in  the occupied territories and the negotiating teams. The program,  which does not need amendment, envisages delivery of the fuel  and fertilizer and consumer goods in our vehicles, with or  without the support of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces].

0,FT934-12528 ,"FT934-12528 _AN-DJZDHAFQFT 931026   FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: Exxon lifted by asset sales and cost reductions      By RICHARD WATERS and REUTER      NEW YORK   EXXON comfortably exceeded market expectations yesterday with third-quarter profits which were bolstered by recent cost-cutting and disposals of assets. The US energy group's 19 per cent rise in net income for the period, compared with the previous year, came against a backdrop of lower oil prices which has held back earnings at other oil companies. 'These strong earnings were generated despite soft worldwide economic conditions, weak crude oil prices, and provisions associated with the tax rate increase in the US,' said Mr Lee Raymond, chairman. Net income for the period rose to Dollars 1.36bn, or Dollars 1.09 a share, from Dollars 1.15bn, or 91 cents, on sales down to Dollars 27.9bn from Dollars 30.6bn. On Wall street, Exxon's shares rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , by early afternoon. While exploration and production profits in the US remained flat, at Dollars 273m, overseas earnings in this area jumped to Dollars 549m from Dollars 468m. US downstream operations, on the other hand, recorded an increase to Dollars 121m from Dollars 31m, while overseas earnings rose only slightly to Dollars 474m. Falling oil prices, while holding back upstream earnings in the US, had been more than offset by the improvement in margins in petroleum products that resulted from cheaper oil, Mr Raymond said. Exxon said the results benefited from lower operating costs, the effects of its asset management programme, under which it sold assets which were marginal or did not fit its long-term plans, and lower tax rates in some overseas countries. Atlantic Richfield (Arco) said net income in the third quarter fell to Dollars 68m from Dollars 332m in the previous year due to the increase in the US corporate tax rate and the cost of settling a legal action. The results were held back by an after-tax charge of Dollars 115m resulting from the effect of the tax rate rise on deferred taxes. The company recorded after-tax charges of Dollars 50m against the costs of litigation. These mostly related to the decision by the US Court of Appeals to confirm a judgment against the company in a class action suit over breaches of energy pricing regulations between 1973-81. Earnings per share fell to 42 cents from Dollars 2.06, on sales down to Dollars 4.55bn, from Dollars 4.83bn. Arco is to reorganise some of its oil and gas operations, resulting in a 'substantial' charge to fourth-quarter earnings, Reuter adds. The group said that it expected to cut between 900 and 1,000 jobs by the end of the transition period. The reorganisation of Arco Oil and Gas Co should result in annual after-tax cost-savings of about Dollars 100m, the company said.   Companies:-  Exxon Corp.     Atlantic Richfield Co Inc.

China, which expects to assemble 3 million motor vehicles  annually within 10 years, badly needs new kinds of petrol that  can improve vehicle efficiency and reduce air pollution.    ARCO President Mike R. Bowlin said yesterday in Beijing he  is  in the country to conduct negotiations with Chinese government  officials.    ""We'll discuss the possibilities for the cooperation and  market of products to be manufactured,"" said Bowlin, who will be  ARCO's chief executive officer later this year.    China now has 8.3 million vehicles, which consume 25 million  tons of fuel a year. Most of the fuels contain lead.    ARCO, one of the major foreign oil cooperative partners of  China, is the top developer of low-cost petrol in the United  States.    Bowlin said the firm is also interested in coal mining and  generating electricity with coal and natural gas in China.    During his trip, Bowlin is expected to talk with Vice  Premier  Zou Jiahua, high-ranking officials from the State Planning  Commission, and senior executives from the China National  Petroleum Corporation, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation (CNOOC), the China Petroleum Corporation and the  China Huaneng Group, a central-supported energy conglomerate.    A CNOOC official and Bowlin both announced that the two  corporations will join efforts to develop crude oil outside  China.    Bowlin said ARCO, whose revenues last year stood at $20  billion, will continue to target China as one of its key markets.    Although Bowlin came to China expecting only to conduct  negotiations this time, agreements are expected to be clinched  later in the United States.    ARCO began doing business with China in 1978 and has been  one  of the largest partners with Chinese oil firms so far. It has  already sunk $300 million into oil exploration in China and  expects its investment to increase by $1.2 billion by 1996.    ARCO has signed several contracts and agreements with  Chinese  for developing oil and natural gas in the South China Sea and  exploring for petroleum in the East China Sea.    According to the contracts, ARCO, together with CNOOC and  the  Santa Fe Company, are to annually supply Hong Kong with 2.9  billion cubic metres of gas beginning in 1996.    ARCO discovered the Yacheng 13-1 gas field, the largest  offshore field in China, which contains 100 billion cubic metres  of gas.     "
0,FT932-10055 ,"FT932-10055 _AN-DEKCSADSFT 930511   FT  11 MAY 93 / Gamble in the North Sea: UK oil tax reforms raise crucial questions about resource management      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES and DAVID LASCELLES   Few measures in the March Budget created as much of a rumpus as Mr Norman Lamont's proposals to reform the taxation of North Sea oil. Apart from opening up divisions within the oil industry, they raised crucial questions about how the UK should manage this important resource. The repercussions reach parliament today with the debate on the finance bill, for which a senior backbench MP has tabled amendments intended to cushion the impact of the changes. But the government, in the person of Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary to the Treasury, who is responsible for the measure, is refusing to yield. 'I have listened to all the representations we have received, and none of them contained anything that we had not considered before the Budget,' he says. Although the debate will be about the extent to which oil companies should be allowed to set their exploration costs against their oil taxes, the real issue is how the UK should make the most of its remaining oil and gas reserves. Should they be treated as a strategic asset and exploited to the full or only as the market dictates? Mr Lamont, the chancellor of the Exchequer, is proposing to cut the petroleum revenue tax (PRT) on existing large North Sea fields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent, and to eliminate the tax altogether on new fields. But at the same time, he wants to end oil companies' right to set their exploration costs against their total PRT bill. The effect will be to make production from developed fields more profitable, but increase sharply the cost of exploration for companies which have been able to take advantage of the PRT offset. In his Budget speech Mr Lamont described PRT as 'increasingly anachronistic'. It was introduced in 1975 at a time of surging production and high oil prices to ensure that the Exchequer got its fair share of oil profits. Today, with the oil price close to a 20-year low in real terms, there is less incentive to increase production at such a high tax rate. The ostensible aim of the changes, therefore, is to adapt the North Sea tax regime to the requirements of a mature oil province where further large finds are unlikely and interest has shifted to making the most of developed reserves. But the underlying motive is also to boost tax revenues. The Exchequer's earnings from the North Sea have fallen from a peak of Pounds 12.2bn in 1984-85 (more than half of it from PRT, and the rest coming from royalties and corporation tax), to only Pounds 1.35bn last year, of which a mere Pounds 50m came from PRT. Although the Treasury will lose from the cut in the PRT rate, this loss will be more than offset, it says, by the abolition of exploration allowances, leaving a net addition to tax revenues of Pounds 300m next year and Pounds 400m the year after that. A third motive is to bring North Sea taxation in line with the government's overall approach of reducing tax rates and eliminating allowances. According to Mr Dorrell, PRT at 75 per cent is the highest rate of any tax in the country and the abolition of allowances will stop oil companies effectively exploring at the taxpayers' expense. But in trying to boost its revenues and bring oil taxation in line with its fiscal philosophy, will the Treasury actually damage the prospects for the North Sea? There is a danger that Mr Lamont will kill the incentive to explore at the very moment when the UK needs to make that extra push to find its last, difficult, fields. Will oil companies reinvest the savings from lower PRT to squeeze more out of the North Sea or will they just pocket the money and spend it elsewhere? More broadly, there is the question of whether the new tax regime will handicap the UK in the increasingly competitive international market for oil company investment. These various issues depend on how the outlook for the North Sea is viewed. Contrary to popular perceptions, Britain's oil production has not peaked. Output is forecast to reach record levels of more than 125m tonnes in the middle of this decade. As for reserves, the UK has extracted a total of 1.6bn tonnes of oil to date, and has between 610m and 2.1bn tonnes of recoverable reserves left. The Department of Trade and Industry estimates in its latest Brown Book (its oil and gas annual) that there could also be between 530m and 3.3bn tonnes to be discovered. In addition, output and reserves of natural gas, which are playing a fast-growing role in the country's energy balance, are both rising. So while the North Sea may be mature in the sense that it is well explored and developed, it is far from being played out. The Treasury's view is that the days of jumbo discoveries are past, and that the job now is to ensure that known fields produce their maximum yield. This view is supported, predictably perhaps, by Shell and BP, operators of two of the largest fields in the North Sea, Brent and Forties, who stand to gain from the PRT cuts. Mr Chris Fay, managing director of exploration and production at Shell, believes that more than half of the North Sea's oil has either been pumped out already or is currently under development. This leaves a quarter which has been discovered and not yet developed. 'The Budget is rewarding successful exploration by reducing production taxes, but any exploration must be carefully costed and justified rather than be merely a gamble as was often the case under the old regime,' Mr Fay said. However, the Treasury's argument is strongly opposed by smaller companies who have taken the lead in the North Sea exploration effort as discoveries have got smaller. They warn that the abolition of PRT allowances will lead to a sharp drop in drilling and appraisal activity. Where it is currently worthwhile for a company to develop a field of 15m barrels, the new tax regime would quadruple costs and raise that threshold to 60m barrels, these companies say. The consequence will be fewer additions to oil reserves and therefore, ultimately, less tax revenue for the Exchequer, to say nothing of lost jobs and other social costs. 'It means that there will be a tranche of oil and gas reserves that will not be exploited,' says Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer at Lasmo, the independent company with large North Sea interests. 'They'd rather leave that unexploited than give back the tax benefits. I hope that they have struck the right balance.' Judging by the concern shown by many backbench MPs, the public is also worried that the UK will fail to make the most of its oil assets. The combination of low oil prices, rising costs and harder-to-find reserves has already led to a fall in the number of exploration wells being drilled. This suggests that incentives to explore should be sharpened, rather than reduced, these MPs believe. But Mr Dorrell decries what he describes as 'the National Coal Board culture of seeking to recover a resource regardless of the cost'. It is not in the country's interest, he says, to provide tax breaks for companies to develop oil and gas deposits which are not economic in their own right. He believes it is the country's duty to leave them in the ground for future generations to develop when technological advances or rising energy prices make them economic. He wants to change the North Sea from a low-risk, low-reward province to one where oil companies take more of the risk, but also keep more of the profit if they are successful. If this results in oil being left in the ground, that is what the market thinks best, according to Mr Dorrell. The threat of a sharp fall in exploration may have been exaggerated by independent companies who stand to lose their tax breaks. As much as 40 per cent of current exploration activity is being conducted by companies which pay no PRT against which to offset the cost, Mr Dorrell says. The other important uncertainty is whether the government is correct in assuming that oil companies will reinvest their PRT savings in the North Sea. Again, the oil majors are promising big benefits as development projects are accelerated to take advantage of lower PRT. Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum, said: 'The PRT changes will bring more barrels out of the North Sea. Some projects will move up the pecking order of priorities worldwide because of the new tax regime.' BP yesterday announced it would develop nine oil fields in the central North Sea earlier than planned because of the Budget changes. The company said that development of the fields - the Eastern Trough Area Project, which will cost between Pounds 1.5bn and Pounds 2bn over the next five years - was given a 'significant impetus' by the new PRT rules. But the smaller companies take a different line. Mr Francis Gugen, finance director of Amerada Hess, points out that even after the PRT cut, profits from large North Sea fields will be taxed at 71 per cent by the time corporation tax is added in. 'Why invest in something with that sort of tax rate when you could invest elsewhere?' he asks. Amerada has said that it will transfer exploration out of the UK North Sea if the Budget changes go through. Whether a flight of drill rigs out of the North Sea actually occurs depends on how the UK stacks up against other oil producing regions. Under the new regime, the rate of tax on North Sea profits would range from 33 per cent on fields exempt from PRT, to 71 per cent on fields that pay it. This is a relatively low rate by international standards (in Norway companies pay a flat 78 per cent). But the abolition of allowances will put the UK at a disadvantage to Norway which allows full tax relief for exploration and where geologists believe there are still large fields yet to be discovered. In spite of the high costs and maturity of the North Sea, a study by Wood MacKenzie, the oil analysis group in Edinburgh, found that the UK still compares well with other countries in its attractiveness for drilling. The study was completed before the PRT changes, but Wood MacKenzie believes they will not affect the appeal of the UK's oil and gas resources. Wood MacKenzie plotted the number of commercial oil discoveries against the number of wells drilled for nine countries in three distinct regions worldwide: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in south-east Asia; Angola, Congo and Gabon in west Africa; and Norway and the UK in the North Sea. The analysts found that, in the past 20 years, the UK was behind only Norway in the number of commercial oil finds. But because of its increasing maturity, the UK slipped into sixth place when it was ranked on the success of wells in finding commercial oil discoveries in the past five years. The study also compares the countries on a risk-reward basis which ranks the drilling success rate with the attractiveness of the fiscal regime. This was conducted before the PRT changes. The UK ranked joint second with the Congo after Vietnam. But Wood MacKenzie stresses the importance of the host government's attitude to the oil industry in attracting its migratory capital. Mr David Black, an industry consultant at Wood MacKenzie said: 'One of the disappointing features of this PRT change is that the UK was always regarded by the industry as politically and fiscally stable: everyone knew how you played the game, but this has been destroyed at a stroke.' Mr Black said the lack of consultation over the changes and the retrospective nature of the move had shocked the industry. The industry still hopes that the Treasury will agree to transitional arrangements to soften the blow and restore the UK's hospitable image. These arrangements, proposed by Mr John Butterfill, MP for Bournemouth West, and other senior Tory backbenchers, involve continuing tax relief for wells where companies have made commitments to drill but have not yet started work. This will be financed by raising the proposed PRT rate from 50 per cent to 55 per cent until the end of 1996. Mr Lamont is taking quite a gamble with his proposed reforms. If they work, he will have called the oil industry's bluff about their potentially disastrous impact. Britain will enjoy the double benefit of continued exploration and more intensively managed North Sea fields. But if he has misjudged the situation he may not only stifle new exploration, but he could also kiss goodbye to billions of dollars worth of future North Sea investment.

0,FT924-9876 ,"FT924-9876 _AN-CKCCTAGIFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (7): Desert gas for electricity - Only politics mars Algeria's attractions      By FRANCIS GHILES   THE decision of Italy's state electricity company, ENEL, to sign a 20 year contract with Algeria's oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach, reinforces Italy's position as Algeria's principal overseas market for gas. The deal, for delivery of 4bn cubic metres of gas a year starting in 1995, also marks out Italy as the most exciting market for Algerian gas, especially as supplying gas for power stations demands more flexibility from the supplier than other types of contracts. The latest contract confirms the shift in attitude of Sonatrach, a company which has, since 1988, increasingly come to recognise the mutual benefit to be gained from working together with international oil and gas companies and sharing the benefits of their combined resources. The rush of oil companies signing exploration deals with Sonatrach continues. So high is the chance of any company finding gas rather than oil that it was only earlier this year, when exploration terms for gas were improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the risk was worth taking. The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who left the government after the assassination of President Mohamed Boudiaf last June. The policies he promoted have, however, been strongly endorsed by the new minister, Mr Hasen Mefti, and the Prime Minister, Mr Belaid Abdesslem. From 1965 to 1977 Mr Abdesslem was the architect of Algeria's energy policy. Since the new law was passed, Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements with Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, Phillips Petroleum and BP and an important service contract with Halliburton. These come on top of contracts with Total, Cepsa, Agip and Repsol. Apart from the political factor, nearly everything else in Algeria is attractive. The political uncertainty comes from the continuing violence between Islamic fundamentalists groups and the security forces following the cancelling of Algeria's first multiparty elections last January. These events have not affected the guarantees the US, Japan and France are prepared to give for exim-type loans whose proceeds are earmarked for the revamping and extension of the country's existing gas liquefying capacity. Nearly Dollars 1bn worth of loans to this effect have been signed this month. Conditions have changed on two fronts simultaneously. First, Algerian terms for exploration have become more rewarding for gas. Companies searching for oil and finding gas now have a realistic chance of getting a return on their exploration investment. As a result some companies might be willing specifically to look for gas. Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s and the early 1980s, Algeria's drive to assert its own sovereignty over all oil and gas production excluded it from the advanced technology that less closed third world countries such as Indonesia were able to enjoy. Meanwhile, external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's current ability to supply it. Sonatrach is also lucky in another respect. As James Ball, director of Gas Matters points out, in a world where greenfield liquefied natural gas projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of LNG able to produce 5bn cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of increasing capacity by 10bn cubic metres a year for half this outlay must be as frightening to competitors as it is comforting to customers. Through the renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, M. W. Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cubic metres to 32bn cubic metres. Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline which brings gas to Italy through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily is being increased from 16bn to 24bn cubic metres. Two or three extra pumping stations in Algeria could boost that figure further. Exports to Spain are to increase and the first supplies are to reach Morocco. Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG, committed itself earlier this spring to continuing its imports at the current level once the gas pipeline scheduled to run through Morocco and under the Straits of Gibraltar is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cubic metres a year from 1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely driven by a policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of gas fired power. A further 1bn cubic metres will be bought by Morocco. Agreements have already been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece, while newcomers such as Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in buying Algerian gas. The collapse of the US market for LNG, the latest possible victim being a 2.4bn cubic metres contract Sonatrach had signed with Shell US, will free some extra supply for such customers and potential Central European buyers. All in all, Sonatrach has set itself a ceiling of 60bn cubic metres of exports a year by the second half of the 1990s, with commitments of 56bn cubic metres already made. In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of spin offs have produced new joint venture opportunities. One of the first such ventures was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and Sonatrach to extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants. A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo' LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role. The Algerians can only hope political uncertainty will not bedevil their plans, particularly at a time when political and other uncertainties make Russian gas far less secure than it was until the break up of the USSR. Algeria has a window of opportunity which those who manage its oil and gas industry seem intent on exploiting to the full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------            ALGERIAN GAS EXPORT COMMITMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES                   (billion cubic metres per annum)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BUYER                 LNG       LNG            PIPELINE    PIPELINE                       Now firm  possible 1995  firm 1995   possible 1997  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Gaz de France          10.3       10.3 Enagas                  3.8        3.8                        6-7 Distrigaz (Belgium)     4.5        4.5 Distrigas (US)          1.25       1.3 Trunkline (US)          1.0        nil Shell Cove Point (US)*  2.4        nil Botas (Turkey)          2.0        3-4 DEPA (Greece)           0.7        0.7 Portugal                           1.8 Italy (SNAM)                       1.4-3         25.25       25.25 Italy (ENEL)                       1.0            4.0         4-6 Northern Europe                    4.0 Slovenia                                          0.6         1.0 Tunisia                                           0.7         1.0 Morocco                                                       1.0 Others                             3.9 TOTAL                  26.39      34.9-43.5      30.55       38.25-41.25  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Subject to discussions between Shell and Columbia Gas System  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SOURCE: GAS MATTERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page IV  "

Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules        Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses):         Utah Admin. R. 645201323.100 (30 CFR 772.12(b)(8)(iv)), narrative description of the proposed exploration area, and     Utah Admin. R. 645201342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application for a major coal exploration permit.           Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules That Are Substantially Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the Federal Regulations        Utah proposed revisions to the following rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantially identical to the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses):           Utah Admin. R. 645200121 (30 CFR 772.1), coal exploration which is subject to 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487,  Utah Admin. R. 645201200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,   Utah Admin. R. 645202100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents,  Utah Admin. R. 645202232 (30 CFR 815.15(b)), performance standards for roads or other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, and      Utah Admin. R. 645202235 (30 CFR 815.15(i), performance standards which minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance.           Because these proposed Utah rules are substantially identical to the corresponding provisons of the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        3. Utah Admin. R. 645200122, R. 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310, Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area        Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration'' instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in relation to an approved permit area.''    The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 150178; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve, as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application, and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant to the appropriate rules for coal exploration.      Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves these proposed rules.            4. Utah Admin.

The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 772 establish the requirements and procedures applicable to coal exploration operations on all lands except for Federal lands subject to the requirements of 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487. The Federal regulations at 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 pertain to operations for the exploration, development, and production of Federal coal under Federal coal leases, licenses, and permits, regardless of surface ownership, pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, as amended (30 U.S.C. 181,     et seq.    ).

Nonsubstantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules        Utah proposed revisions to the following previously approved rules that are nonsubstantive in nature and consist of minor editorial or grammatical changes (the corresponding Federal regulation provisions are listed in parentheses):         Utah Admin. R. 645201323.100 (30 CFR 772.12(b)(8)(iv)), narrative description of the proposed exploration area, and     Utah Admin. R. 645201342.200 (30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii)), approval or disapproval of an application for a major coal exploration permit.           Because the proposed revisions to these previously approved rules are nonsubstantive in nature, the Director finds that the proposed Utah rules are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        2. Substantive Revisions to Utah's Coal Mining Rules That Are Substantially Identical to the Corresponding Provisions of the Federal Regulations        Utah proposed revisions to the following rules that are substantive in nature and contain language that is substantially identical to the requirements of the corresponding Federal regulation provisions (listed in parentheses):           Utah Admin. R. 645200121 (30 CFR 772.1), coal exploration which is subject to 43 CFR parts 3480 through 3487,  Utah Admin. R. 645201200 through 220 (30 CFR 772.11), notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration,   Utah Admin. R. 645202100 (30 CFR 815.13), required documents,  Utah Admin. R. 645202232 (30 CFR 815.15(b)), performance standards for roads or other transportation facilities used for coal exploration, and      Utah Admin. R. 645202235 (30 CFR 815.15(i), performance standards which minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance.           Because these proposed Utah rules are substantially identical to the corresponding provisons of the Federal regulations, the Director finds that they are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director approves these proposed rules.        3. Utah Admin. R. 645200122, R. 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310, Coal Exploration in Relation to an Approved Permit Area        Utah proposed that its rules at Utah Admin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 setting forth the scope of Utah's coal exploration rules, would apply to ``coal exploration'' instead of coal exploration that occurs ``outside an approved permit area'' or coal exploration that occurs'' ``in relation to an approved permit area.''    The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11, for coal exploration operations removing 250 tons or less of coal, and at 30 CFR 772.12, for coal exploration operations removing more than 250 tons of coal, apply to coal exploration conducted ``outside a permit area.'' In promulgating this language, OSM explained in the preamble for these Federal regulations that a coal exploration permit is not appropriate for coal exploration on lands covered by a surface coal mining permit because exploration within the permit area should have been planned as an integral part of the surface coal mining and reclamation operations (44 FR 14901, 150178; March 13, 1979). The effect of these Federal regulations is that, for proposed coal exploration within the permit area, the State regulatory authority would review and approve, as appropriate, the proposed coal exploration in conjunction with the review and approval of a permit application, and for coal exploration outside the permit area, would review and approve the proposed coal exploration pursuant to the appropriate rules for coal exploration.      Utah's proposed deletions of the phrases concerning approved permit areas are consistent with OSM's regulations and the rationale for them in the preamble to the Federal regulations. Therefore, the Director finds that Utah's proposed revisions to Utah Amin. R. 645200122, 645200123, 645201223, and 645201310 are no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 772.11 and 772.12. The Director approves these proposed rules.            4. Utah Admin. R. 645200220, 645200230, and 645201100 through 645201130, Responsibilities of the Division and Coal Exploration Plan Review        Utah proposed revisions to its rules at (1) Utah Admin. R. 645200220 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and enforce the terms of each notice of intention to conduct coal exploration; (2) Utah Amin. R. 645200230 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review and approve or disapprove major coal exploration applications and issue, condition, suspend, revoke, and enforce major coal exploration permits and coordinate with other government agencies; and (3) Utah Admin. R. 645201100 through 645201130 to provide that it is the Division's responsibility to review coal exploration plans on lands which are not subject to the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487, and to provide that, on lands [Federal lands] where the requirements of 43 CFR 3480 through 3487 apply, the review of coal exploration plans will be guided by the appropriate part of 43 CFR.

In an interim report presented to the trade minister, the  Petroleum Council said the provisional measures law on the  importation of specific kinds of petroleum refined products has  helped perpetuate substantial price gaps between the domestic  and overseas purchase prices of gasoline and other petroleum  products.    If the law is abolished as recommended, businesses such as  trading houses will be able to import petroleum products after  March 1996, when the law expires.    The report also proposed revision of petroleum storage  regulations, in order that new entrants, such as trading houses,  will be required to make provision for a certain level of  petroleum stockpiling when launching an import business.    The report also recommended formulation of a new law  designed  to ensure high quality standards for imported petroleum.    At present, Japanese consumers pay roughly four times as  much  for gasoline as, for example, their U.S. counterparts.    The council said the latest proposal is intended to  introduce  a market mechanism into the Japanese petroleum industry by  promoting competition with foreign products.    The step would put downward pressure on prices of petroleum  products, an official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry (MITI) told a press conference.    In order to compete with cheaper foreign products, refiners  would be forced to make further cost-cutting efforts, which  would in the long run reinforce their financial standing, the  official said.    The proposed reform of the petroleum storage law does not  mean that prospective importers must have a capability to  stockpile petroleum products, he said.    If such a requirement is attached under the proposed import  liberalization, it would be virtually impossible for trading  houses to enter the oil import business, and the status quo  would not change, the official said.    As one way of ensuring stockpiling as required under the new  proposal, prospective importers could rent storage tanks from  refiners, he suggested.    During Monday's Petroleum Council meeting, some council  members voiced concern that scrapping the provisional petroleum  import law could have negative effects on Japan's energy  security, the MITI official said.    But others supported the step as ""most appropriate"" for  deregulating Japan's petroleum market and the industry, he said.    The council report also recommended that Japan's petroleum  distribution system be reformed to make it more efficient.    Specifically, the report called for more competition to be  introduced in operation of gas stations by gradually abolishing  a designation system for building such stations.    Expected restructuring of gas stations, most of them  financially fragile, under competition policy may erode their  profits further, but the interest of consumers should also be  considered, the report said.    Operators of gas stations should listen to public criticism  that they are providing ""excessive services"" at the expense of  price attractiveness, it said.    The report refrained from addressing whether or not  self-service gas stations should be allowed, saying the issue  should be studied by the Fire Defense Agency.    Asked if MITI would accept an expected request by the  refinery industry for increasing prices of kerosene, gas oil and  other daily necessities, the official said the ministry has no  intention to ""intervene in pricing of such products during the  era of free competition.""    If gasoline prices fall under the proposed policy, the  refinery industry is expected to call for raising prices of  kerosene and gas oil, which have been set at relatively low  levels by MITI to balance high gasoline prices in the wake of  the oil crisis during the 1970s.    The petroleum council will create two working panels in  August to study various problems involved in abolition of the  petroleum law, including how to secure a stable amount of  stockpiling by new entrants and to ensure high product quality,  the MITI official said.    The council will work out a final report in December, the  official said.     "
0,FT934-10833 ,"FT934-10833 _AN-DKCDEAF5FT 931103   FT  03 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria's burden of proof - Arrests have been made but the state oil business has still to satisfy the industry that its reforms are working      By PAUL ADAMS   THE interim government's purge of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has stopped some of the racketeering that became rife during former president Ibrahim Babangida's regime - but it will take more than a few arrests to convince the oil industry that a reform of the public sector oil business is under way. After the discovery of unauthorised payments to store fuel in tankers offshore, NNPC's managing director, Mr Edmund Daukoru, finance director Mr O. Okwara, and company secretary Dr Beneni Briggs were arrested last month. Mr Daukoru, Mr Okwara and five other senior officials were formally charged yesterday with stealing Dollars 41m. About 20 senior officials in NNPC have been suspended. The plan to charter two very large vessels for storing about 1m tonnes of fuel through Lenoil, an independent oil and marketing company, was approved by Mr Chu Okongwu, who was oil minister in 1992. Although each ship was costing Nigeria an estimated Dollars 49,000 a day, the so-called strategic reserve never supplied any fuel. Nigeria has adequate storage capacity on shore but its fuel shortages stem from large-scale smuggling, and crumbling refineries and distribution systems run by subsidiaries of NNPC. Mr Philip Asiodu, who became oil minister in January this year, rejected the chartering scheme and ordered instead the purchase of smaller tankers secondhand, also through Lenoil. Although Mr Asiodu blocked a demand by Lenoil for Dollars 62m, it is alleged that most of the payment went through shortly after he left office in August, leading to the arrest of the NNPC directors. Mr Len Adesanya, managing director of Lenoil, was also arrested. Mr Adesanya was to be in the new management following the takeover of Texaco Nigeria in July. The deal was opposed by the minority Nigerian shareholders, who allege that the buyer, TNP Holdings, registered in the British Virgin Islands, was funded indirectly by the military regime. The takeover is under investigation by Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission. Industry analysts say that close links between Mr Adesanya's operations and Mr Babangida's military regime went right to the top and that Lenoil was one of the two main operators in the smuggling of about 100,000 barrels a day of fuel. Since Mr Don Etiebet took over as petroleum minister in late August, the boards of NNPC and its refining and marketing subsidiaries have been dissolved, and the axe has fallen on several other deals agreed by his predecessor. Mr Etiebet has cancelled all the crude oil lifting contracts signed by Mr Asiodu. Mr Etiebet said the contracts were to be renegotiated because 'people are hawking crude oil . . . we want to know the exact number of people who are lifting and whether they comply with our objectives'. Mr Etiebet has invited new applications to buy Nigerian crude oil from companies established internationally as traders or refiners of oil products or which are investing in upstream exploration in Nigeria. The minister has also invited tenders to supply fuel from internationally recognised companies. The minister has cancelled 16 oil exploration licences awarded by Mr Asiodu to indigenous prospecting companies. According to industry sources, the approvals were rushed through without the normal procedures and many of the licencees do not have the technology or resources to carry out exploration. NNPC's acting managing director is reviewing the sale of an extra 5 per cent stake in an oil production venture to one of its equity partners, Elf Aquitaine, for around Dollars 520m. The joint venture is operated by Shell and produces half of Nigeria's 1.8m b/d oil output. July's sale to Elf broke the 40 per cent limit on foreign ownership in oil joint ventures. The private sector in Nigeria and international creditors would like to see the shake-up in NNPC go further. Recommendations by an economic conference chaired by Mr Ernest Shonekan in February, which included a reduction in state control of the oil and gas industry, have not been implemented. In a follow-up to that conference today the private sector will press for the measures to be passed in the January budget. The budget monitoring committee set up by Mr Shonekan to review government spending under the Babangida regime has submitted the report. The document is highly critical of dedication accounts that diverted about 110,000 barrels of oil from central revenue into offshore accounts. Mr Shonekan has made transparency in government revenue one of his government's main target, but he has yet to show that he can bring oil revenue under control.

0,FT922-8798 ,"FT922-8798 _AN-CELA7AAMFT 920512   FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (11): Key to Angola's survival since independence - The oil industry      By CAROLINE SOUTHEY   ANGOLA'S oil industry, largely protected from the vagaries of civil war and political uncertainty, has boomed during the past four years and the success story seems likely to continue for the rest of this decade. Oil has been the key to Angola's survival since independence - the sole underwriter of the war effort and guarantor of its international debts. Within 25 years, Angola has become sub-Sahara's largest producer after Nigeria, with the region's second-biggest reserve base. Recoverable reserve estimates over the next five years for fields in production, under development and those being lined up totals some 4.9bn barrels. Although the oil industry survived the turmoil of independence better than any other sector of the economy, production began to flag in the late 1970s, leading to a reorganisation of the sector between 1976 and 1979. The changes, which included the establishment of Sonangol as the government's business arm responsible for co-ordinating and controlling petroleum activities, resulted in a steady rise in production from 1982. Factors which attracted foreign companies to Angola 10 years ago - low operating costs, prospects for new discoveries and favourable contractual terms offered by Sonangol - are still drawing new investment into the sector. A further attraction is that Angola has never been a member of Opec. This has allowed it flexibility to sell what crude it can produce. Mr Joaquim David, director-general of Sonangol, the state-owned oil company, says with some pride: 'The companies that began with us in the initial years have stayed and new ones have been drawn in.' Peace for the country has coincided with record exploration levels and the discovery of lucrative deep-water wells. Sonangol in turn has begun to offer an innovative licensing regime which is proving highly attractive to foreign companies. Under the regime - known as a 'rate of return' profit oil - the percentage of production left to the investing company varies according to the field's level of productivity. Mr David is optimistic. 'Oil is a growing industry. Our production is five times what it was in the last years of the the Portuguese administration. We have every reason to believe upstream development will grow.' The importance of the sector cannot be over-estimated. Oil accounts for more than 90 per cent of total export earnings. Last year, crude oil exports earned Angola some Dollars 3.15bn compared with Dollars 3.55bn in 1990. The highest level ever of exploration activity in the offshore sector last year is set to assure oil's paramount role in the Angolan economy. A surge of development is now anticipated which should boost output from its 1991 level of 505,000 b/d to 680,000 b/d in 1996. Of the current output of 555,000 b/d, Chevron accounts for 300,000 b/d, Elf 165,000 b/d, Texaco 55,000 b/d, Belgium's Petrofina 30,000 b/d and Italy's Agip 5,000 b/d. In tandem, offshore operators have prepared extensive expansion plans. County NatWest WoodMac, in a report on the the West African oil industry drawn up early this year, estimates that expenditure in Angola will peak in 1993 and 1994 at Dollars 750m each year. Capital investment has grown rapidly over the past 3 years, from Dollars 210m in 1988 to about Dollars 500m in 1991. This compares with a previous high of Dollars 532m (1992 prices) in 1987. Mr Matthew Shaw of County NatWest Woodmac predicts that over the next nine years some Dollars 4.7bn of upstream investment is envisaged, compared with Dollars 3.3bn spent over the past nine years. Those expected to make the biggest commitments are Chevron in Cabinda, Texaco in Block 2 and Elf in Block 3. 'Chevron has a high degree of commitment to our Angola operation. In international terms it is one of the big five. In investment terms it will be at the top during the next three years. After 1995 it should be the biggest in liquid production,' says Mr Bob Connon, managing director of Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (Cabgoc). Cabgoc, in association with Sonangol, Elf Petroleum Angola, and AGIP Angola, operates the offshore concession of Cabinda. Area A of this concession is presently producing 310,000 b/d. The production sharing agreement (PSA) gives Sonangol 41 per cent, Cabgoc 39.2 per cent, Elf 10 per cent and AGIP 9.8 per cent. There is no production yet from the deep-water Areas B and C of the Cabinda concession. However, a three-year contract for the first phase is due to be signed shortly with Setal of Brazil and Lummis of Sweden. The contract covers the structures, treating and pumping equipment and the pipeline to shore. The complete development of the project up to first production, including this contract, is worth more than Dollars 400m. The cost is explained because of the expense of drilling in deeper water of about 350ft. The maximum water depth of current production is slightly over 200ft. The first oil is expected to flow in 1994. Peak production could reach an estimated 100,000 b/d. Mr Connon says the development is comparable to 'three large events in our history in Angola since we started in in 1954.' These included the development of Takula field in 1982, the introduction of waterflooding at Takula and the first development in the Malongo field. Onshore, where activity was effectively stalled by the civil war, drilling is set to be resumed within the next couple of years. In the Cabinda enclave, an area that has not been drilled since Cabgoc relinquished its concession in 1971, BP and Occidental are due to sign new contracts although the first well is not expected until 1994. On the mainland, where the war severely disrupted work, exploration work could resume. Some exploration acreage is already licensed to Fina and in the longer term new areas could be licensed although this is not expected until the end of the decade.

But he also arrived with a  score of 5-0 hanging over his head. He knew that it was his duty  and that he wanted to congratulate the Colombians on the fact  that their soccer team had managed to kick the ball into his  compatriots' goal five times.    What he did not think about was that everyone would ask him  about the Falklands war. Wherever he appears in Colombia,  Lieutenant General (the top rank in the Argentine military)  Martin Antonio Balza, Army chief of staff, spends much of his  time recalling the conflict his country waged with the United  Kingdom in 1982.    Now, 12 years after the lost war, Balza insists that the  Falkland Islands belong to Argentina. ""That is unquestionable,""  he asserts.    ""But,"" he points out, ""that is a political problem. Our  president has made that very clear at numerous international  forums. The matter lies in diplomatic hands, and it is through  those channels that we hope to recover that piece of Argentine  territory.""    Although he did not say whether it could be obtained  militarily, he knows that he is a soldier, that he is obedient,  and that if it were necessary, he would obey orders to fight a  war on those grounds.    The harsh experience of the conflict keeps haunting his  conversation. ""I am not a Falklands war hero,"" he says. The real  war heroes are the men, the officers, petty officers, and  enlisted men in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and our  Gendarmerie who remained behind as a monument to our  sovereignty. The real heroes of the Falklands are those who were  mutilated. I was just one more soldier who went and came back,  after fighting for something very dear to the hearts of all  Argentines.""    He could not say whether there were violations of the Geneva  Convention during the war. Although he was held prisoner for a  month, he claims not to have been mistreated or to have had his  rights trampled.    Looking back, he knows that the war was lost because the  Argentine Armed Forces were very weak compared to those of the  United Kingdom. ""We went into the Falklands war on the basis of  two assumptions of national or military strategy.    ""One assumption was that the United Kingdom would not  respond, and the other assumption or hypothesis was that the  United States would support us or remain neutral. Neither was  true.    ""We went to war on an island territory without controlling  the air or the sea. The British dominated the skies. It was a  war in which there were acts of heroism, acts of operational  efficiency on the tactical level, but that was not enough to win  a conflict with those weaknesses and limitations.""    The Experience    It is now 12 years since that war, he says, and it is more  prudent to live in the present. Relations with the British are  ""excellent,"" Balza declares. ""The war is a thing of the past. We  will never forget our dead, nor will the English; but the best  thing we can do is to pray for our dead, and it does not matter  if our prayers cover the English as well. That is the Christian  spirit,"" he states.    He has not forgotten the experience the Armed Forces gained  in that war, however. ""One of the most important lessons the  Falklands war taught the Army was never again to be forced to  participate in activities beyond the scope of the role defined  for us by the Constitution; never again to participate in  politics,"" he says.    Undaunted, he claims that this experience simply brought the  military back to its original role: obeying the Constitution and  the law, but not intervening in politics.    Moments after the first question on the Falklands, however,  he makes it clear he is interested in leaving the past behind  and thinking of the future. Therefore, it is not a bad idea to  ponder the possibility of a future coup d'etat.    Then his face hardens, and although he says that no one can  guarantee the future, he rejects the notion that the Armed  Forces would try to go against the constitutional order: ""I will  tell you right now: Disrupting the constitutional order in the  Argentine Republic is definitely a thing of the past. We cannot  reconstruct the past, but we can learn lessons from it and  prevent the mistakes of the past from being repeated in the  future. Argentina will never again see disruptions of the  constitutional order. Not because of General Balza, but because  the Armed Forces, the Security Forces, and Argentine society  have incorporated that idea into their culture.""    Now, he says, the Armed Forces' relations with the president  are characterized by absolute cordiality and mutual respect.    General Balza could not fail to mention public order and the  Argentine experience with violent urban guerrillas, the  Montoneros of the 1970's.    ""In the past, the country was the victim of a notorious  aggression, and those were very painful years. This problem  overwhelmed Argentine society, which did not support those who  were threatening national values.""    In view of his country's experience, the commander of the  Army believes that it is possible to defeat unprincipled  guerrillas. ""It is my hope that fellow nations, in this case  Colombia, can overcome this phenomenon.""     "

0,FT932-17197 ,"FT932-17197 _AN-DDACLAIDFT 930401   FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (16): On stream, on time - There's nothing else like the Oso condensate field      By DAVID PILLING   THIRTY-FIVE kilometres off the coast of Nigeria, towards the border with Cameroon, waves lap a gleaming structure of pipes, walkways and funnels. To the uninitiated, the edifice - which resembles an aquatic Pompidou centre - might look like any other oil platform. But to those in the know, the Oso field is something special. First, Oso produces not oil, but condensate. Unlike oil, condensate exists in the ground as a gas. As it is forced to the surface, it cools and takes on the qualities of a light crude. Much of the platform's paraphernalia is needed to separate and stabilise the condensate and to re-inject associated gas. Second, Oso represents that rare thing in Nigeria - a mega-project, worth Dollars 900m, that has come on stream. According to Mobil's Mr Jim Massey, executive director for exploration and producing, Oso has successfully left the drawing board because it is 'simply a very good project, both for Nigeria and for Mobil. The drives were there for all sides to make it work.' Mobil discovered the Oso field, which contains 500m barrels of recoverable condensate, as long ago as 1967. But it was not until 1988, when Opec excluded condensate from its quota system, that exploitation became economically attractive. After several hiccups, the project - a 60:40 joint venture between state-owned NNPC and Mobil - won 65 per cent loan financing from the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation and export credit agencies of Japan and the US. The remaining 35 per cent was provided in the form of equity by NNPC and Mobil. In June 1990, contracts were awarded to a consortium of McDermott of the US, Bouygues of France and Japan's JGC Corporation. Oso came on stream, on schedule and under budget, last December. The first 600,000 barrels of condensate were piped on to the Olympic Symphony tanker on Christmas Eve and delivered to Mobil's refinery in Beaumont, Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico. Condensate, which trades for about the same price as North Sea crude, is refined into petroleum fuel, kerosine and naphtha feedstock for petrochemicals. After nearly four months, Oso was producing 50,000 barrels a day (b/d). On-site engineers were confident that, once 'teething problems' were ironed out, production would reach the planned 100,000 b/d by mid-April. Oso is expected to generate Dollars 12bn during its 20-year lifespan and should recoup its investment within two years. Looking to the future, Mobil has begun engineering work on Oso II, an Dollars 800m project to extract natural gas liquids (NGL) from Oso gas and gas gathered from nearby fields. The NGL would be separated into propane, butane and pentane-plus for export. Oso II has a tentative start-up date of late 1996. But Mobil has so far failed to discover other condensate fields. For the moment at least, Mr Massey says, 'we don't have anything else quite like Oso'.   Companies:-  Mobil Corp.     Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.   Countries:-  NGZ  Nigeria, Africa.

EPA has retained the 1% limit in both cases in today's final rule for reasons discussed in section III.B.2 of this preamble.     EPA received comments from used oil re-refiners (i.e., ``secondary'' petroleum industry_a type of used oil processor) regarding the regulatory status of petroleum refineries that receive used oil from off-site and store the used oil on-site before mixing it with crude oil. The draft rule proposed to regulate petroleum refining facilities as used oil transfer facilities in these circumstances. Commenters stated, however, that petroleum refiners that receive used oil from off-site pose the same potential concerns from receipt of adulterated used oil and improper storage of used oil as re-refiners and should therefore be subject to the requirements for used oil processor/re-refiners prior to mixing. EPA agrees and has revised the draft rule accordingly. These changes are discussed in greater detail below.     EPA also received numerous comments on provisions clarifying what constitutes a used oil processor. Provisions contained in the draft document would have prohibited both on- and off-site burning of used oil generated from specified activities that EPA is today clarifying are not subject to the used oil processor standards. Commenters stated that the used oil generated from these activities would be suitable for burning in accordance with the part 279, subpart G standards and that burning should not be further restricted. In response to these comments, EPA has decided to allow on-site burning of the used oil generated from these activities but has retained the prohibition against off-site burning. The basis for this decision is discussed in section III.C of today's preamble.         B. Section 279.1_Definition of Petroleum Refining Facility         Today's rule establishes a regulatory definition for ``petroleum refining facility.'' EPA believes it is necessary to define this term in order to provide a clear distinction between what the Agency considers to be and regulates as primary petroleum refining facilities and facilities that EPA considers to be used oil re-refiners for regulatory purposes. Under today's rule, ``petroleum refining facility'' is defined as follows:           ``Petroleum refining facility'' means an establishment primarily engaged in producing gasoline, kerosine, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel oils, and lubricants, through fractionation, straight distillation of crude oil, redistillation of unfinished petroleum derivatives, cracking or other processes (i.e., facilities classified as SIC 2911).            A used oil re-refiner, in contrast, is a facility that processes used oil to produce lube base stocks and greases, industrial fuels, asphalt extenders, diesel like fuels, and other products.     EPA is aware that petroleum refiners and used oil re-refiners employ similar production processes and produce similar products. Consequently, the Agency has avoided defining these facilities in terms of the process steps employed to produce a finished product or the type of products produced. As defined by today's rule, petroleum refining facilities and used oil re-refining facilities differ primarily in the material that constitutes the primary initial feed to the process. In order for a facility to be considered a petroleum refining facility, the material fed to the front end of the refining process must be comprised primarily of crude oil. In order to be considered a used oil re-refiner, the material entering the front end of the process must be comprised primarily of used oil.            "

The project equally meets Turkey's and Ukraine's interests,  as allowing both nations to maximally diversify their petroleum  supply sources, and boost their prestige and economic influence  on the European continent.    Considering the project's political and economic  significance  Presidents Kravchuk of Ukraine and Demirel of Turkey gave it the  green light at its early drafting stage and pledged their  personal support for it.    The merger project and its Turkish construction part were  drafted by the Kiev-based Yugnipronefteprovod research  institute. According to its experts, the project's pipe-line  tracing, number of ramifications may be increased or altered,  depending on the number of parties, which might be interested in  its implementation. As tentative estimates suggest, the  original version may cost 2,750 million U.S. dollars.    The existent and under construction facilities of the  transshipment terminal nearby Odessa (the Yuzhny port), which  are supposed to be able to handle 40 million tons of petroleum a  year, will allow Ukraine to not only fully meet its domestic  petroleum requirements, including those of its oil refineries,  but also pipe large amounts of crude petroleum to nations in  East, Central and West Europe, which are, same as Ukraine,  dependent on Russian fuel exports.    Thus, this major alternative petroleum supply source is  expected to lessen Ukraine's dependence on Russia both  economically and politically.    On March 11 President Kravchuk met in Kiev with Vetad  Birlik,  Turkish President Demirel's personal envoy and C.E.O. of the  Birkan firm.    The Turkish official stressed the Turkish pipe-line  project's  significance, while discussing bilateral business relations  between the two Pontic nations, as well the importance of the  two national pipe-line systems' merger.    As Mr. Berlik disclosed, negotiations are underway aimed at  establishment of a Ukrainian-Turkish joint venture, which will  undertake the major pipe-line construction project. According  to Mr. Berlik, the Turkish party intends to maximally rely on  the Ukrainian experts' experience in laying pipe-lines  (Ukrainian research and construction institutions used to take  part in pipe- line construction across the former USSR and in  many foreign countries).    In January, 1994 a Ukrainian delegation met with Turkish  President Demirel, and a tentative agreement was reached on  cooperation and the President's personal support for the project.    As Mr. Berlik further disclosed, Turkey has concluded an  agreement with Iraq on future petroleum supplies for piping  petroleum, extracted in the Middle East, to Ukraine and other  nations in Europe. Eventually, other oil extracting nations may  join the project, primarily Iran, as petroleum exporters.    As the project's architects believe, their brainchild may  attract many OPEC nations by its much simpler route for oil  piping, in particular, those of them, who cannot reach an  agreement among themselves, with European oil producers and with  Russia on export quotas, all of which, taken together, may  greatly contribute to the trend to lower petroleum prices on the  petroleum and petroleum products.

The capital  investment projects required for their modernization will amount  to $3-3.5 million. If we fail to find enough money to finance  these, it is possible that the entire petroleum refining  industry will have to be liquidated. The refineries themselves  should be able to produce a significant share of the funds.  Modernization is a much more urgent priority for this sector of  the economy than ownership transformations.    This view is shared by the leadership teams heading our  industry sectors. An intersectoral group set up by the prime  minister will elaborate a project of restructuring the  petroleum-extracting and -refining industry, which is expected  to require about 100 trillion zlotys [Z]. Experts believe that  the banks, together with petroleum refineries, which at present  make profits on the order of 15 percent, will be able to produce  this sum over the next few years. There is no shortage of  opinions claiming that, if the petroleum sector were to be  privatized, the budget's losses would overtake the revenues from  the sale of selected elements of this industry to foreign  concerns. Only partial privatization would be considered. The  state does not intend to willingly relinquish control over the  fuels market and its development strategy.    Foreign concerns are not particularly interested in  participating in the modernization of Polish petroleum  refineries. They find the prospect of taking over our fuel  market a much more attractive proposition. The Central Agency  for Petroleum Products remains the largest purveyor of fuels in  Poland, selling them at 1,370 gas stations throughout the  country. Private distributors sell much less gas, despite the  fact that they have as many as 2,500 gas stations. Foreign  petroleum concerns invest increasingly large sums of money in  the development of the retail distribution network. Recently,  16 large fuel stations were built by foreign petroleum  companies, including three by Esso and six by the Neste concern.  The U.S. petroleum concern Conoco is very active in Poland. To  date, it has built four fuel stations in Poland. A fifth  station is currently being built in Radom, and the construction  of another three--in Czechowice-Dziedzice, Tychy, and Lublin--is  to be launched in the next few weeks. The Conoco concern has  already invested some $7 million in the expansion of its retail  distribution network in Poland.     "

Last year,  at about this time, another petroleum firm known as Showa Shell  Sekiyu had suffered foreign exchange losses reaching 160 billion  yen. Foreign exchange speculative losses have decreased among  financial institutions and trading firms in recent times, but  such problems have now shifted to the petroleum industry. Rigid  reviews must be performed to determine whether internal  structures of petroleum firms are the cause for the occurrence  of the huge foreign exchange losses.    First, we need to examine why such huge foreign exchange  loss  accumulations were recorded.    During a session of the Foreign Exchange Council in June  1993  a rule was approved which banned, as a matter of principle, any  postponement in the settlement of foreign exchange futures  contracts. When the market rate reflects a higher yen valuation  than the contracted futures rate at the settlement date, a  larger amount of yen must be paid to settle the transaction than  in the case where a conversion takes place on a cash basis.  Businesses often fear the occurrence of such losses in currency  fluctuations and delay settlement to a future date and wait for  the market rate to move to a lower yen valuation.    The reason why petroleum firms suffer huge foreign exchange  losses is that they conclude currency contracts in amounts  exceeding crude oil import costs and undergo repeated delays in  settlement of payments for crude oil transactions of huge  monetary values. You might say that they had involved themselves  in currency speculation. However, the rule change implemented by  the Foreign Exchange Council has put a stop to the delays in  settlement dates, forcing the petroleum firms to reveal their  foreign exchange losses.    The question is, why were the petroleum firms able to delay  their settlement dates over a period of several years? There was  a time when financial institutions engaged themselves in a loan  war targeting petroleum firms which had a need for huge sums of  dollars. As the petroleum firms avoided the surfacing of their  foreign exchange losses and intensified their pace of delays in  settlement dates, their currency losses ballooned.    The normal approach used by Japanese firms is to engage in  currency futures contracts within amounts which equal real costs  of importing raw materials and finished products. Compliance  with such intracompany financial discipline is a matter that  requires both internal and external audit. It appears that  petroleum firms maintained a very lax system which made it  difficult for such audit capabilities to function properly.    Financial institutions of our nation rode the wave created  by  the myth that land values will rise forever, were mesmerized by  the bubble economy and found themselves in a predicament.  However, they were saved by generous industry protective  measures designed under the ""noble cause"" of protecting  depositors.    Similarly, it appears that the petroleum industry has  suffered from a diminishing sense of responsibility amidst  conservative government and industry systems which call for  protection of industry interests under the ""noble cause"" of  ensuring a stable supply of energy.    Prices of petroleum products such as gasoline in Japan which  are higher than those of other nations as well as inflexible  prices are caused by rigid industry structures which have  rejected the decontrol of exports and imports and condoned costs  and margins which are higher when compared on an international  basis. Too much emphasis has been placed on stable supplies,  while neglecting actions to cut costs and increase competition  through the free market entry and departure process.    The deficiencies in management structure which permitted  foreign exchange speculation and the need to pursue measures to  compensate for speculative losses at Kajima Petroleum are not  completely unrelated to conditions in the petroleum industry  nurtured by protective government regulations. There is an  urgent need to convert government and industry so that genuine  use can be made of domestic and international competitive  principles.     "

The conference made recommendations today, stressing the  need  to continue making efforts to cut the economic and social costs  incurred by the growing local consumption of oil. It  recommended the expansion of utilizing natural gas to increase  the portion of exported oil and its byproducts.    The conference that opened last Saturday called for  upgrading  exploration operations to increase Arab oil and natural gas  reserves and thus meet the expected growth in world demand for  oil and benefit from new technologies that have proved feasible  in the field of exploration, drilling, and production.    Organized by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting  Countries, OAPEC, the Arab League, the Arab Fund for Economic  and Social Development, and the Arab Organization for Industrial  Development, the conference called for enhancing opportunities  for exchanging natural gas among Arab states. It also called  for launching a feasibility study on setting up a natural gas  network to link production sites with consuming areas and thus  achieve the optimal exploitation of that source.    The conference praised Arab efforts to use new and renewable  energies and emphasized the need for paying more attention to  the development of Arab capabilities in that field.    Held under the chairmanship of Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi  al-Banbi and with the participation of Arab energy and oil  ministers, the conference called for going ahead with  electricity grid projects in both the Arab Mashreq and Maghreb.    The conference discussed 23 working papers on the oil  industry, electricity linkage, and the expansion in using new  and renewable energies. It called for expanding the exchange of  oil products among Arab states to diversify consuming markets  and for encouraging the private sector to set up companies to  market and distribute oil products in Arab markets.    The energy conference underlined the need to develop  petrochemical industries in Arab states and to expand the  manufacture of basic material needed for horizontal integration  to cope with the demand in Arab markets, increase exports to  world markets, and coordinate among Arab producers in production  and marketing.    The Fifth Arab Energy Conference emphasized the need for  Arab  and international capital to provide the necessary investments  to carry out the needed projects in the various fields of  energy. It called on Arab and international banks and financial  institutions to pay more attention to the preparation of  feasibility studies for energy-related projects. It also called  for providing the necessary investments to develop the oil  sector and for protecting investment-related decisions against  fluctuations in oil prices.    The conference stressed the need for Arab countries to  preserve the environment and take its protection into  consideration in launching development projects. It also urged  Arab countries to sensitize the public about protecting the  environment and curbing pollution.    The conference expressed concern regarding the negative  effects the proposed oil tax might have on oil. It viewed this  suggested tax as an act of discrimination against oil,  maintaining that the actual goal consuming countries seek to  achieve by imposing this tax is to increase their revenues at  the expense of the oil-producing developing countries. It also  expressed its fears that this tax might have a negative effect  on the world economy in general and oil-producing and exporting  countries' economies in particular.    The energy conference called for subsidizing Arab scientific  research centers to study and follow up on the problem of the  changing climate to ensure that the allegations made against  petroleum lack scientific proof and that oil is not the main  reason behind the increase of the carbon dioxide. It urged  research centers to publicize scientific facts, information, and  findings of studies into the problem of changing climates.    The conferees urged Arab and developing states to coordinate  their stance at international gatherings to explain the negative  impacts development programs in these countries might suffer if  discriminative measures are taken against petroleum when  discussing ways to curb the discharge of pollutant gas into the  atmosphere.    It stressed the need for developing a data base on sources  of  energy and the demand for it in the various economic sectors to  use in studies and research. It urged the organizations  concerned to supply the Arab Center for Energy Studies with the  necessary information and data for its studies.    In its recommendations, the energy conference called for  enhancing cooperation among OPEC and non-OPEC states and between  them and consuming countries to provide a suitable climate to  establish market stability and avoid price fluctuation.    The conference welcomed the invitation Syrian Oil Minister  Nadir al-Nabulsi made to hold the sixth energy conference in  Damascus in 1998.    Speaking on behalf of the organizing bodies, OAPEC Secretary  General Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Turki expressed appreciation for  Egypt, its people, president, and government for hosting the  conference. He thanked President Mubarak for helping the  conference and Dr. Hamdi al-Banbi for the efforts he made to  assist the organizing bodies in arranging it.     "

And there are always lines in filling stations and,  alas, there is always a justified expectation: Once the cost of  fuel rises, prices of all the rest will also increase. The  petroleum fever has unwound the flywheel of inflation, devaluing  the ruble, the population's deposits, pensions, and wages. What  is this--inevitability connected with the drying up of  underground storerooms and with the excessive appetites of  petroleum producers or businessmen trading in fuel? We have  managed to reveal some secrets of ""black gold."" The editorial  department has come across strictly confidential material,  sensational in its own way, from the Ministry of Fuel and  Energy, in which this sector's analysts present the most  unexpected data, which make it possible to see the petroleum  problem in a new light.    For example, it turns out that in our country there is an  abundance of petroleum. And what abundance! This is what the  analytic survey ""for internal use"" states in connection with  this: ""... By the beginning of the second quarter more than 6.5  million tonnes of unsold crude petroleum accumulated in the  system of main transport, which exceeded the permissible  technological level. All free capacities of petroleum and gas  producing enterprises and petroleum refining plants are filled  with petroleum and finished products, the remainders of which,  as compared with the end of last year, have increased one and  half-fold. Owing to the lack of free capacities, petroleum  producing enterprises were forced to shut down wells...""    The Russian economy has always been unpredictable and  paradoxical. Even from precious petroleum we have managed to  make unsalable goods. Of course, both the nonpayment  crisis--today consumer enterprises owe the Russian Federation  fuel and energy complex about 20 trillion rubles--and  shortcomings in the implementation of intergovernmental  agreements on mutual settlements for petroleum have led to this.    The wealth of ""petroleum kings"" is also no more than another  myth. We quote the same document. ""Various state taxes make up  about 70 to 90 percent in the structure of the price of  petroleum products. Tax policy leaves enterprises without funds  minimally necessary for their functioning and development. High  taxes and charges make even the export of petroleum products  inefficient. Their price has almost reached the world level  mainly owing to taxes, which has made deliveries to the foreign  market unprofitable...""    That is, in the very near future the ""king"" may prove to be  naked. Of course, it is a matter of professional petroleum  industry workers and producers, not of crafty middlemen, who  manage to extract personal billions from state property. The  entire sector may prove to be unemployed and bankrupt. These are  not merely words. From 1992 until today our export to near  abroad has been reduced to one-half! The reasons are known. The  insolvency of the Commonwealth countries and the existing price  formation system... Forget about them, someone will say, we will  sell petroleum not to the CIS, but to the West for ""pure bucks.""  It is not worth having illusions. In 1993 the volume of exported  fuel and energy resources increased by 23 percent, but prices  dropped by 19 percent.    Commercial structures in the chase after quick ""profits""  sell  strategic raw materials more cheaply. Momentary advantages are  the chief things. Who benefits from this? As a result, world  petroleum prices drop, while our ""domestic"" prices rise. With  such a very wild trend, how to fight for sales markets?    So much was said about Ukraine's strongest dependence on  deliveries of Russian fuel: For the sake of gasoline Kiev will  make any concessions to Moscow. But recently Ukraine has  purchased 2 million tonnes of petroleum products in Rotterdam.  It turns out that there they are cheaper than in our country.  However, the laws of the economy are harsh: Having lost the  market, later you will spend twice as much in order to get it  back.    True, the fuel and energy complex has done a great deal to  solve problems. For example, last year it gave about one-half of  the entire Russian export and, on the whole, ensured the state's  positive foreign trade balance. It also gave about 40 percent of  the revenue part of the federal budget. It did not permit  serious disruptions in deliveries of energy carriers, which  business managers feared so. Professionalism and experience were  manifested in this. However, how to proceed further so that the  failures, at which we have arrived today, do not occur?    In the market world the calculation of the cost of any  commodity--from a necktie to a car--begins from the  determination of the cost of 1 tonne of grain and 1 tonne of  petroleum. Later everything ""starts"" from these two base  figures. And not otherwise. For now this correlation ""walks"" by  itself, causing attacks of the disease in the entire economic  organism. However, if price proportions are set for a long  period, for example, for 5 years, other sectors could then  operate in a stable and calm situation.    What is happening today--a spasmodic rise in the cost of  energy carriers--gives nothing except waves of inflation and an  economic chaos. Of course, it is important for the state to  subsidize this process at the initial stage and to help to  unwind the market mechanism. Later it will begin to produce a  harvest by itself.    Right now, however, without waiting for global shifts, what  has already been adjusted can and should be preserved; for  example, trade ties with near abroad. We should continue to sell  it petroleum, although for some time, on credit; of course,  strictly indexing calculations. Otherwise, competitors will  simply capture the market. Incidentally, property can be  acquired in republics for debts. There are already examples of  this. The Ministry of Fuel and Energy is now acquiring the  controlling block of shares of the Lisichansk Petroleum Refining  Combine, one of the three best production facilities of the  former Union. A new construction of such a complex in Russia  would cost billions...    In brief, everything is not yet lost. However, to wait until  everything is buried, until inflation drags the country to an  abyss, is a folly. We must finally get rid of the constant price  jitters and lack of confidence in tomorrow and begin to live  under conditions of a civilized economy.     "

0,FT922-3549 ,"FT922-3549 _AN-CFKBHAAHFT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexico faces hard choice in keeping oil out of Nafta - In the first of a series on the North Atlantic free trade area / A look at the effect of the proposed pact on the Mexican oil industry      By DAMIAN FRASER   WITH Cuba, Argentina, and the ex-Soviet Union all opening up oil exploration to foreign companies, Mexico's reform-minded government might be expected to do the same. But wary of tackling Mexico's most potent nationalist symbol, the government insists that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) will not allow foreign exploration of Mexican oil, nor lead to the privatisation of Petreleos Mexicanos (Pemex). President Carlos Salinas at Pemex's recent 54th anniversary was clear enough: 'The property of oil stays uniquely and firmly under the control of the Mexican state'. Mexican trade negotiators have repeated this so often, that there can be little doubt that risk, or wildcat, contracts will not be permitted. The US, sensitive to Mexican nationalist sentiment, has in any case stopped short of demanding changes that would allow wild-catting. The government has ordered Pemex to produce plans for radical reform following the Guadalajara gas explosion in which more than 200 people died. The company is likely to be broken up into subsidiary companies looking after areas such as exploration, refining and gas sales, with the core company operating as a giant contractor. While the government does not intend to sell Pemex, at least in short term, the reform is likely to lead Pemex to contract out much more work to foreign companies. Reform details are likely within the next few days. In the meantime, the US is eyeing other opportunities. The petrochemicals industry is calling for direct investment in Mexico's basic petrochemicals; the gas and oil companies want to sell gas and refined products to the Mexican end-user; contract companies want to make it easier to sell Pemex equipment, and to carry out drilling and other services. The US government may also want a secure oil supply from Mexico guaranteed. Pemex has baulked at such demands, but the Mexican government will concede most of them, because they are consistent with plans to turn Pemex into a modern and lean oil company, focused on production and exploration. Plans to modernise Pemex pre-date the latest reform programme as well as negotiations over Nafta. The government cut the number of petrochemicals reserved to the state to 19 in 1989, and has made clear the number will be cut further after Nafta is signed. Likewise, Pemex has already decided to follow the path the big oil independents took in the 1960s and contract out drilling work to specialist companies. These turn-key projects, to be financed by a Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 710m) loan from the US Eximbank, do not break Mexico's constitution, since the company's payment does not depend on the amount of oil found. The first such project was awarded to Triton International last spring, which drilled into the ocean in a record 127 days, half Pemex's normal time. Since then, EPN Sonat, a joint venture between the US company Sonat and the Mexican EPN Arval has won two contracts worth Dollars 100m to drill six wells in the Bay of Campeche. The turn-key projects will not attract the big US oil companies, who rarely do drilling contract work, says Mr Ed Porter of the American Petroleum Institute in Washington. Instead, the market will be left to the small independent engineering and drilling companies. Nafta will make such contracts easier for US and Canadian companies by cutting the paperwork, middlemen, and preference Pemex has in the past shown to Mexican contractors. Perhaps, above all, says Mr Rafael Quijano, of the Petroleum Finance Corporation in Washington, and a former Pemex employee, Nafta will 'create an environment in which contract business can flourish'. But given that total Pemex investment in exploration and production is Dollars 1.7bn this year, the contract work might be worth at most Dollars 500m a year. Many foreign oil companies still hope Mexico will relax regulations against foreign equity investment, but some time after Nafta is signed. Even by the most pessimistic estimates, Pemex has 30bn barrels of crude equivalent in oil reserves, and thus a production reserve ratio of 21-1, double that in the US. Pemex's pressing economic problem is not in finding oil, which is what the big oil independents can offer Mexico, but bringing it up to the ground. That kind of work does not require risk contracts. The US gas producers may have more luck than the big oil independents. Imports of natural gas into Mexico have grown rapidly, because of greater industrial development along the border, and environmental regulations demanding more gas use. Demand is expected to continue to rise, which would require substantial investment in new gas pipelines. Mexico may let US companies build the pipes, but this would require changing current regulatory law. While Pemex may be unwilling to abandon its monopoly in energy exploration, it desperately needs help in refining products; Pemex imported a record Dollars 1.25bn of petroleum and petrochemical products last year. It intends to build a new refinery in central Mexico soon, and expand production at existing ones, at a cost, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, of at least Dollars 8bn. Pemex is looking for a foreign partner in building and financing a refinery, although Pemex will operate the facility. The trouble for Pemex is that little foreign interest has been shown in the schemes Mexico has proposed. Engineering companies do not want to receive payment in refined crude. Oil companies do not want Pemex to operate the final facility, and would like to sell oil they have refined in the Mexican market. One foreign oil executive suggests that as Mexico's import bill for refined products climbs, the government will open up refining and the sale of refined products to foreign oil companies, some time after Nafta is signed. The Guadalajara disaster, for which Pemex was blamed, is increasing the pressure for change. However, opening up exploration and production remain difficult, since the property of oil would still remain 'firmly in the hands of the state'.

Guido di Tella, the urbane Argentine foreign minister is to be guest of honour - the less generous might say sitting target - on one of the BBC World Service's more sensitive shows, Calling the Falklands. The one-hour programme will go out live on June 18 and the Beeb promises that neither questions nor responses will be edited. Whose idea was it? 'That's a bit hazy,' says a member of the BBC production staff. But di Tella clearly has an agenda; he recently sent the Falklanders a letter telling them how nice the Argentines really are. On that occasion they politely told him to sling his hook. On air, they may have some fruitier comments. But di Tella, a former Oxford don, is cooler than a cucumber.

The story  about the wealth which people have amassed overnight explains  the background of this strange prayer.    ""Every day about 200 boats cross the (imaginary) border  between Montenegro and Albania illegally on Lake Scutari,"" says  someone very familiar with the flows of smuggled goods between  Zeta, the rich farming region on the Montenegrin shore of the  lake, and Vraka, the Albanian part of the Scutari region, which  is mainly settled by Serbs and Montenegrins.    So, the southern Yugoslav republic has been managing to  avoid  isolation a full year longer than Serbia and has been regularly  supplying the public with fuel. Since adoption of Resolution  820, foreign tankers, mainly Greek, have had a harder and harder  time running the NATO blockade in front of the port of Bar. Just  before New Year's, the government announced that reserves had  fallen so low that it was forced to ""discontinue gasoline  coupons for individuals.""    Numerous private and government-owned firms became involved  in the smuggling of petroleum products immediately after the  sanctions were introduced toward the FRY; not long afterward,  they were joined by resourceful individuals on both sides of the  Montenegrin border.    The Oil Well    The merchants in Scutari were the quickest to react. They  installed double gas tanks in their cars and used them to carry  gasoline across the border checkpoint at Bozaj for sale in Tuzi  or Podgorica, which is only some 20 km or so from the border.  Thus, the ancient meaning of the name of Tuzi, a small town  midway between Podgorica and the Albanian border, has been  restored. (The town, mostly settled by Albanians and Muslims,  takes its name from the time when caravans carrying salt passed  through, and the town came to be called Tuzi--""salt station."")    Almost every house in the town has become a small gasoline  station. Car owners from Podgorica who need more than the  limited amounts of gasoline (30 liters a month at the beginning  and then 15 liters) go to Tuzi as though it were the nearest gas  station. The reason, of course, lays in the price. The price of  fuel in Tuzi has steadily been 20 to 30 percent lower than at  the open-air markets in Podgorica.    People living in Zeta have been involved since this past  autumn. They have begun to run the blockade in boats. They do  not even need visas, which, because of the restrictions of the  Albanian Embassy in Belgrade, are the greatest obstacle to  crossing at Bozaj, the only border crossing between Montenegro  and Albania. It is simple: You cross Lake Scutari in a rowboat  to the town of Kamenica on the Albanian shore, without any kind  of border or customs inspection; you are met there by your  ""trading partners"" from what until recently was the most  isolated country in the world, and they have drums full of  petroleum products. The boats are used in this way to smuggle  everything--from cigarettes to satellite dishes--but petroleum  products and gasoline are the most common. Here are figures on  how lucrative this entire operation is. The Albanians are paid  between 160 German marks [DM] and DM190 for a 210-liter drum of  petroleum products, depending on the quality, while in Zeta that  same drum ""sells at wholesale from DM210 to DM240 or even DM300.""    The Fleet    The heady rate at which money is earned is attractive for a  great many people. In recent months, new boats are being built  in large numbers or old ones repaired. One reason is that the  traditional rowboats that the people of Zeta have used to fish  Lake Scutari can take only five drums of petroleum products, and  that exceeds the allowed load and presents a risk of capsizing  and sinking in any kind of sea. So now the Zeta rowboats have  sides which are four or five or more planks high, instead of the  previous three, so that they can take a much larger load. Demand  has also increased suddenly for drums, and there is a frantic  demand for the metal plugs used with the drums. They carry a  price of DM10, and the Aluminum Combine in Podgorica is faring  the worst, because its employees are stealing large numbers of  them.    The wind and waves are the greatest danger to the people in  the boats. The boat ride from the Montenegrin to the Albanian  shore in small boats takes an hour to an hour and a half, but  coming back, because they are loaded, it takes about two and a  half hours. Moreover, part of this is away from the shore of the  lake (only 15 minutes or so of the trip), but this is where the  seas are highest and there is a constant danger of sudden winds.  In Albania, the drums containing petroleum products are loaded  by hand, so that often the associates simply exchange full boats  for empty ones.    On the Montenegrin shore, the transshipment technology is on  a higher level. Tractor attachments are used to lift the drums  from the rowboats, much in the way of a crane, and they are  loaded onto trailers or trucks, and from there they are stored  in farmyards.    Tank trucks carry the petroleum products from Zeta to other  regions of Montenegro, Serbia, and the Serbian krajinas. The  petroleum products are drained from the drums very quickly with  a compressor or ordinary water pump. This job, our informants  explained, even involves the Montenegrin government, which  issues special certificates to individuals, according them the  right to purchase and carry the smuggled petroleum products.    Chain    The sudden wealth and the spirit of adventure which go with  smuggling petroleum products across the largest lake in the  Balkans have been generating many ""hunting"" stories about the  exploits of the newly created ""businessmen."" It is thus said  that there is no house in Zeta which has not earned at least  DM10,000 or so from petroleum products. The earnings of a  journalist from Montenegrin Television, who was among the first  to become involved as a buyer and carrier, is estimated at DM2  million. Albanian soldiers, who are said to intercept the  smugglers, occasionally even quite amicably, are collecting  bribes of DM10 per person. In order to dispel our disbelief, one  of our informants pointed with pride to a new Mercedes tank  truck, which he had just bought for DM130,000. ""That came from  petroleum products,"" he said.    The associates in Albania, we were told, are quite  straightforward in their dealings. The Montenegrin and Albanian  smugglers help one another, and it is not uncommon at all for  them to visit one another for even several days (illegally, of  course).    In Albania, it is prohibited to pump petroleum products into  drums at filling stations, so that it is actually sold by the  truckers, whose job comes down to cruising constantly around the  gasoline stations. The petroleum products are usually of very  poor quality. A great deal of kerosene (30 to 50 percent) is  dumped into it, because in Albania it is cheaper--10 pfennigs  per liter. So that engines can operate on this mixture, any kind  of motor oil (usually used) is added to it.    The petroleum products go through five hands before they  reach the ultimate consumer. The job also runs the risk that the  police patrols, who are said to be increasingly numerous, will  seize the petroleum products as they are being carried from Zeta  in canisters. It is a long chain, and the links in it include  both big operators, who order tank trucks by phone, and also  erstwhile high school students waiting for customers in the  open-air markets with plastic containers. Many firms whose  trucks and buses have long been paying visits to farmyards in  Zeta instead of the official Jugopetrol stations also rely on  the newly opened ""oil pipeline.""    There is the smell of petroleum products at every step in  Zeta. As you enter Zeta, our informants joke, there should be a  ""NO SMOKING"" sign, just as there is at filling stations.     "

0,FT934-7685 ,"FT934-7685 _AN-DKRC7AH7FT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (44): Big shake-up under way - Oil and gas industries      By TONY WALKER   MR HAN GENGSHENG, vice-president of the China National Chemicals Import and Export Corporation, seemed remarkably sanguine for a man who had recently seen his organisation lose its lucrative monopoly over the marketing of Chinese crude oil and derivatives. 'Economic reform will inevitably have some unpleasant effects on companies with monopoly positions,' he says. 'But I believe that this kind of reform provides challenges and opportunities for development.' Sinochem, as the giant state trading corporation is known - the company ranked 29th in 1992 on the Fortune 500 list - has been obliged to enter 50-50 joint ventures with the China National Petroleum Corporation for crude exports, and with the China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) for the marketing of refined products. Formation of the new joint venture companies, China Oil and the China International United Chemical Orporation (Unipec), represents one of the biggest shake-ups in China's oil sector in many years, and also coincides with the abolition of the Ministry of Energy under a streamlining of the bureaucracy approved this year by the National People's Congress, China's parliament. Mr Wang Tao, chairman of China National Petroleum Corporation, left no doubt in an interview that he derived particular satisfaction from the new arrangements that will involve CNPC not only in the production of crude, but also in marketing. He plans to use extra revenues from these ventures to further develop CNPC's activities domestically, including investments in refineries. CNPC is also interested in expanding its reach abroad through its China National Development Company, established in 1981, to seek opportunities in exploration and development, but whose activities have been severely curtailed because of lack of funds. Changes in the oil sector also coincide with the beginning of a period of heightened activity involving foreign companies in the search for oil in China's onshore regions, especially in the promising Tarim basin area of far-western Xinjiang region. Mr Wang said earlier this year that in addition to the 11 southern provinces of China which had already been opened to foreign involvement, an additional 12 areas would also be offered, including remote regions of Qinghai province and Xinjiang in the west, and Inner Mongolia in the north-west. China attracted a good response from the oil majors in March when it offered five blocs in the prospective Tarim basin covering an area of 72,730 sq km. EFFORTS to engage foreign companies in the development of China's oil reserves (estimated at 30bn barrels) are being given added urgency by the likelihood that by 1995 at the latest the country will become a net crude oil importer. Mr Wang estimates that exports will exceed exports this year by about 4m tonnes. Onshore production this year is expected to be much the same as last year's 138m tonnes. But he warned that with economic growth anticipated this year of about 13 per cent, it was unrealistic to expect that China could continue to produce more oil than it consumed without big new discoveries. 'The petroleum industry is developing like a tortoise, and GNP growth like a hare,' he observes. Even if good discoveries are made in the Tarim basin, it will be some years, and possibly not until the turn of the century before oil is flowing in large quantities from China's far west. The cost of building a pipeline more than 2,000 kms from the Tarim area across rugged terrain to connect with the national pipeline grid is estimated at about UDollars 2bn. Exploration activity is also continuing in offshore areas; although the crushing disappointment, not to mention huge losses, suffered by Western companies such as British Petroleum in the 1980s in a fruitless search, has dampened much of the early enthusiasm. Mr Chen Binqian, vice president of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), said his organisation was pressing on with its efforts to engage foreign companies in prospective areas offshore, such as the East China Sea, the Pearl River delta, and waters off Hainan Island in the south. Mr Chen expects to have awarded contracts for 13 concessions in the East China Sea by the end of the year. CNOOC itself continues to be active in its efforts to lift production at its own wells in areas such as the Bohai Sea, in China's northern water, where it brought onstream a new field in September. It is also looking forward to Agip, Chevron, Texaco, Philips and Amoco bringing relatively small fields into production between 1994-1996 in the Pearl River area. This year, CNOOC expects oil production from offshore areas to reach 5m tonnes - and to grow to about 12m tonnes by 1997. But disappointed by results of oil exploration offshore, it is looking increasingly to its gas finds to justify its own existence, and to provide energy to fuel China's booming economy, especially in its energy-deficient southern regions, and Hong Kong. By 1996, CNOOC expects to be supplying 2.9bn cu. metres annually to Hong Kong, and 500m cu. metres to Hainan island itself from fields off the island's south coast. More finds are being made in waters off Hainan, and CNOOC hopes to be supplying 20bn cu. metres to consumers in Hong Kong and on the mainland by early next century.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

But the US still takes the biggest share of exploration spending by the major companies, according to the Canadian consultants, Metals Economics Group. Budgets of the 137 companies reviewed total USDollars 1.7bn. Of this, Dollars 345m is directed to the US. Australia gets Dollars 333m, Latin America Dollars 331m, Canada Dollars 295m and the Pacific area Dollars 124m. MEG points out that Canada has dropped from first place in terms of exploration activity in 1989 to fourth this year. Latin American countries receiving the most exploration attention this year are Chile, with about 40 per cent of the total for the region; Mexico, about 20 per cent; and Brazil, about 19 per cent. The percentage of expenditure directed to gold targets has been falling steadily in recent years, according to MEG, while base metals-related spending has been rising after a very low level of activity in the mid-1980s. In this case the consultants reviewed the exploration spending plans of 139 companies, totalling USDollars 1.9bn, and found Dollars 925m (48.7 per cent of the total) being spent on gold this year compared with Dollars 839m or 52 per cent in 1992 and Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent in 1991. Base metals exploration expenditure this year is Dollars 669m or 35 per cent of the total, compared with 32 per cent of the reported spend in 1992. More than half the spending directed at other mining targets is for diamond exploration. Some 29 big companies are involved in the search for diamonds, but the Dollars 111.7m budgetted for diamond exploration and research by De Beers of South Africa remains unchallenged. RTZ Corporation of the UK, the world's biggest mining company, is also the biggest spender on exploration, MEG suggests. Including the budget for CRA, its 49 per cent-owned Australian associate, RTZ is spending Dollars 200m this year compared with De Beers Dollars 111.7m. The third largest corporate exploration budget, Dollars 71.8m, is attributed to BHP Minerals, part of the Australian resources group.

0,FT931-10453 ,"FT931-10453 _AN-DBICOABKFT 930209   FT  09 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amoco narrows exploration focus  -The US oil group is ditching its 'shotgun approach'      By LAURIE MORSE   AMOCO, the Chicago-based oil company and North America's largest producer of natural gas, spent last year cutting both production and administration costs to adjust to lower world energy prices. Now the company is tackling the costs of its international exploration and development operations. .Amoco is narrowing its exploration focus. Where it once had operations in more than 100 countries, it has now reduced this number to 40. 'We had been taking something of a shotgun approach,' said Mr J. C. Burton, group vice-president in charge of international operations. 'Now we're going to focus more on bread and butter things. We've decided we can't be everywhere at once, even though we're a big company.' He said the new strategy was to prospect only in countries where the likelihood of finding reserves was high and where Amoco's competitive advantages could best be deployed. It also entailed managing the group's reserve portfolio more actively, retaining only those assets fitting in with core operations. Last month, for example, Amoco swapped its rights to offshore oil and gas holdings in the western portion of the North Sea with British Gas's offshore parcels in the southern North Sea, thereby consolidating its low-cost holdings there. Amoco is drawing back from risky frontier exploration and concentrating on proven basins where it has competitive advantage. In eastern Europe, Amoco hopes to apply the gasification techniques it developed in its New Mexico operations to Poland's well-explored coal fields. Meanwhile, political and technical expertise is being combined in talks with the Chinese on a Dollars 600m offshore production venture in the South China Sea. In addition, a long-term investment in Trinidad, where Amoco is developing two fields, paid off this year when the company gained tax concessions there, raising profits. Amoco entered the global exploration business later than most of its rivals. While it had longstanding operations in Egypt and Argentina, it did not begin its worldwide expansion programme until the mid-1980s. This meant it had to play an expensive game of catch-up. It found that many low-cost production areas had already been claimed by its competitors. It also moved into politically unstable countries, such as Somalia, and then had to abandon sites, so losing substantial investment. Mr James Murchie, oil industry analyst for Sanford Bernstein, the New York investment house, says Amoco's frantic frontier exploration boosted the cost of finding and developing reserves to more than Dollars 6 a barrel, well above the industry average of about Dollars 5. Frontier exploration is seen increasingly by the world's oil companies as an extremely risky business and Amoco's decision to pull back is in keeping with this trend. While narrowing its world reach, the bulk of Amoco's exploration and development expenditure will still be spent outside the US. The company's 1993 capital spending plan budgets Dollars 3.2bn for exploration and development, of which 70 per cent will be spent overseas. Amoco plans to drill about 50 exploration wells in 1993, 90 per cent of them at foreign sites. This contradicts the pattern of 1970, when 70 per cent of Amoco's Dollars 647m exploration expenditure was spent at home. Those mature domestic operations now generate the cash to finance Amoco's hunt for new reserves overseas. However, that hunt is behind schedule. Mr Burton admits the company has not been replacing production at industry rates over the past two years, but says the exploration cycle has to be averaged over the long term. 'We try not to get excited about a few bad years,' he says. Amoco produces the oil-equivalent of 500m barrels a year. Analysts say annual exploration and development investment of Dollars 2.5bn would be required to replace reserves, assuming the industry average cost of Dollars 5 a barrel. This year, Amoco has earmarked only about Dollars 2bn.   Companies:-  Amoco.   Countries:-  CaZnada.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.     P6719 Holding Companies, NEC.

Vernadskiy, Moscow; UDC543.70]    [Abstract] The control of trace quantities of organic  substances of industrial origin, such as petroleum and petroleum  products, in natural, potable, and waste waters is becoming more  and more significant from the environmental standpoint.  Luminescent methods are normally used to detect contamination  from petroleum products. The visible fluorescence of petroleum  and petroleum products results from the presence of aromatic and  heterocyclic compounds absorbed in the ultraviolet region of the  spectrum. However, it bears noting that modern  spectrofluorometric methods for detecting traces of petroleum  products in water are encumbered with lengthy sample preparation  (extraction, sorption) in order to separate the polycyclic  aromatic hydrocarbons (PAU). In natural waters, PAU fluorescence  is recorded against a background of dissolved organic substances  (ROV) and a spontaneous Raman spectrum of excited illumination  on the water molecules, thus making it impossible to determine  trace quantities of PAU directly without their preliminary  separation. Synchronous spectrofluorometric methods are an  exception, although they require costly equipment and specially  trained personnel. Thus the problem of an express method for  detecting and assaying the degree of contamination remains in  essence the as the isolation of a fluorescence signal of PAU  against a background of ROV illumination. In the present work an  express laser-luminescent technique was developed which makes it  possible to conduct spectral fractionation of PAU contamination  without supplemental treatment of the water sample. The use of  periodic pulsed excitation in conjunction with signal gathering  enables determination of PAU within the range 5 X  10[.sup]-10[/] - 1 X 10[.sup]-7[/] g/ml.

The weekly OPCIONES, which circulates in Cuba to provide  information to tourists and foreign residents, said in its  latest edition that Cuba and Russia ratified an agreement last  December to exchange Cuban sugar for Russian petroleum. Through  this agreement, Moscow would send 2.5 million tons of petroleum  to the island this year in exchange for 1 million tons of  unrefined sugar.    A few days ago, Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello  revealed both countries had signed a letter of intent to  exploit, under a joint enterprise scheme, some 60,000 barrels of  petroleum at the Cienfuegos refinery on the southern coast of  Cuba, and to produce petroleum byproducts for sale on domestic  and world markets.    If the accord signed by Havana and the Mexican state-owned  company Mexpetrol advances favorably, the refined product would  be sold in the Cuban market and the oversupply in other nations.  The origin of the current Cuban economic crisis is related to  energy following the reduction in petroleum supplies from the  defunct Soviet Union, which in 1989 supplied a little more than  13 million tons.    Cuba has been forced to get its economy going with only half  of this amount, because it does not have the financial reserves  to purchase all of its petroleum needs. For similar reasons,  Cuba mothballed its electronuclear program launched with the  Soviet Union in 1980, when investments exceeded $1.2 billion.  For the time being, this has eliminated the possibility of  reducing dependence on imported petroleum. Cuba does not have  plentiful rivers, large forests, or significant coal deposits,  and it only exploits wells of heavy petroleum, whose production  last year hit a record of 1.1 million tons.    National crude oil is used in industry, the production of  cement, and power-generation. Additionally, the country has  resorted to foreign investments to explore new fields of light  petroleum by granting risk contracts. The results of these  contracts will only be known in the future.    Even if the agreements with Russia and Mexico bear fruit,  not  all of the country's needs will be met. Nevertheless, annual  payments on imports would be reduced by using petroleum refined  at the Cienfuegos installation, in addition to securing the  Russian supply in exchange for Cuban sugar.     "

The press release also stated that the exploration cited  above and the potential commercial exploitation plan for that  area will be a continuation of the history of China's research  and exploration in that sea area, which began since time  immemorial, as far back as 200 years B.C.    In view of this matter, a spokesman for the SRV Foreign  Ministry gave the following remarks on 20 April:    Right from the time when the Creston Company signed a  contract on oil exploration and exploitation with the Chinese  Offshore Oil Company in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry  issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and  that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's  sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well  as against international law. The statement also pointed out  that according to international law, Vietnam has long exercised  its sovereignty over that area. As early as before 1975, this  area was divided into lots for bidding to conduct oil and gas  exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional  Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a  statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of  the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12  May 1977 and 12 November 1984, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty  over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the  Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided  for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has  since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas  resources in that area, including its cooperation with many  foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an  economic, scientific, and service detachment has been  established there since 1989 with the presence of a system of  Vietnamese lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station.    A seismological survey by the Creston Company and its  arrogant declaration of its planned oil exploration and  exploitation in the area within Vietnam's exclusive economic  zone and continental shelf -- an area which is, both legally and  practically, totally under Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes  a new, very grave step of escalation.    The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry once again asserted  that the contract of the Creston Company is invalid. Its  actions are illegal. No countries or companies will be allowed  to conduct any exploration or exploitation of natural resources  within Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone  without permission from the Vietnamese Government. The Creston  Company will have to bear full responsibility for the  consequences arising from its actions.     "

The category of major sources for marine vessel loading and unloading operations includes marine terminals which emit chemicals listed under section 112 from the direct loading and unloading of bulk liquids from marine vessels at marine terminals. With the exception of offshore vessel-to-vessel bulk liquid transfer operations (i.e., lightering operations), all marine vessel terminals are included in the category of major sources for marine vessel loading and unloading operations.

The EPA requested comments on whether emissions averaging should be included in the final rule, and on specific features of the proposed emissions averaging provisions.     The petroleum refinery proposed rule addresses only the 4 emission points in refinery operations. The EPA requested comments on the concept of expanding the petroleum refinery source category to include marine vessel loading and unloading operations subject to the requirements of section 112 that occur at refineries. The marine vessel requirements proposed for purposes of compliance with section 183(f), however, would remain unchanged. If the above change is made to the petroleum refinery source category, the source category currently listed in accordance with section 112(c) as Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading Operations would be split into two parts_those which are collocated at refineries and those which are not. The ones collocated at refineries would be combined with and become part of the refinery source category. The source category list would be amended accordingly. The purpose would be to allow emissions averaging between the HAP emissions from marine vessel loading and unloading and the HAP emissions from the refinery emission points identified in the petroleum refinery rule as suitable for emissions averaging. It appears that in some cases, there may be opportunities to control some of these emission points (e.g. storage tanks) more cost-effectively than marine vessel loading and unloading operations. In other cases, it may be more cost effective to control marine vessel operation emissions than the refinery emission points. Integrating marine loading and unloading operations into the refinery category and utilizing emissions averaging may provide an opportunity for more emissions reductions at a lower cost than would occur if the categories remain separate. In addition, because of the 10 percent discount factor, additional emissions reduction will be achieved if emissions averaging is used.     If the suggested approach were adopted, the limitations of the proposed emissions averaging provisions included in the petroleum refinery proposal would also apply to the loading and unloading operations. With regard to calculating the emissions for purposes of averaging, the May 13 marine vessel operations proposal included procedures for determining HAP emissions from marine vessel loading operations for purposes of determining applicability of the rule; the EPA solicited comment on these procedures. These emission estimating procedures will also be considered for the purpose of emission averaging. The promulgation date, and thus the compliance date, for the marine   vessel loading and unloading standard is currently expected to be   earlier than the petroleum refinery standard. The EPA requests   comments on whether and how these compliance dates should be made   consistent, and what legal factors should be considered.              "

This is because the term ``hazardous waste'' is a subset of ``solid waste.'' RCRA Sections 1004 (5) and 1004 (27). The statutory definition of solid waste indicates that ``garbage, refuse, sludge *** and other discarded material'' are solid wastes. The critical issue is when secondary materials (see definition at 50 FR at 616 n. 4, Jan. 4, 1985) that are going to be recycled can be solid wastes. Today's rulemaking addresses this question for certain operations commonly occurring in the petroleum refining and related industries.   The reader should note that EPA is conducting an assessment of the RCRA Definition of Solid Waste, as described in the EPA report, RCRA Implementation Study Update    .    1     This ongoing effort may result in proposed regulatory changes to the definition set forth in 40 CFR 261.2 and related requirements. Today's action, however, is fairly narrow, applying to situations where certain oil-bearing secondary materials are used or reused within the petroleum refining process. EPA will continue its broad policy review of the Definition of Solid Waste, but deemed unnecessary any delay in issuing today's rule.             1     RCRA     Implementation Study Update: The Definition of Solid Waste,     U.S. EPA, July 1992,     #    EPA530R92021.

Cir. 1987) (    AMC I    ), a divided panel of the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Agency's rules defining the statutory term ``solid waste,'' RCRA Section 1004 (27), exceeded the Agency's statutory authority to the extent that the rules asserted RCRA authority over ``materials that are recycled and reused in an     ongoing     manufacturing or industrial process.''     Id.     at 1186 (emphasis original). Because ``these materials have not yet become part of the waste disposal problem'',     id.,     they are not yet ``discarded'' within the meaning of Section 1004 (27) and so cannot be considered to be ``solid wastes.''

Of particular significance to today's action, EPA proposed certain amendments relating to the scope of the regulatory definition of solid waste as applied to operations occurring within the petroleum refining industry. In particular, the Agency proposed to exclude from the regulatory definition of solid waste secondary materials associated with ``on-going fuel production activities in the petroleum refining industry. These activities involve situations where crude oil is refined, and oil-bearing residues from that refining process are returned for further refining as part of one continuous and on-going process.'' 53 FR at 525 (Jan. 8, 1988). The Agency specifically proposed to exclude oil-bearing residues from the refining process when those residues are generated on-site and inserted into that on-site petroleum refining process or coker, provided that these residues are not managed in such a way as to be ``characterized by elements of discard'' such as placement in a disposal unit like a surface impoundment.     Id    . EPA is not taking any action today with respect to the portions of the January 8, 1988 proposal dealing with non-petroleum materials. These issues are being addressed by other on-going Agency activities (see above, Section II.A.). The Agency is, as described below, taking final action with respect to the petroleum materials.         D. Description of Petroleum Exploration, Development  Production, and the Petroleum Refining Process       The presence of petroleum in geologic formations is confirmed by the drilling of exploratory wells. Once located, the development of a petroleum reservoir includes the drilling of additional wells to extract the oil or gas, and well completion and stimulation techniques designed to increase the recovery of oil or gas from that reservoir. Petroleum production generally includes all the activities associated with the recovery of petroleum from the geologic formation. These production activities involve the operation and maintenance of the producing well, and the handling and separation of the recovered crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, and water. The separation of water/crude oil emulsions is performed in tanks by gravity settling, or heat may be added to separate emulsions. Crude oil is then transported via pipeline, vehicle or vessel to stock tanks and ultimately to the refinery.   Petroleum refining involves several manufacturing operations and processes, including crude desalting, atmospheric and vacuum distillation, hydrotreating, catalytic cracking, thermal processing and residual upgrading, light hydrocarbon processing, hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, extraction, isomerization, lubricating oil processing, sulfur removal and recovery, and product blending and inventory. Products manufactured from petroleum refining include hydrogen, fuel gas, sulfur, liquified petroleum gas, butane, aromatic feedstocks, leaded and unleaded motor gasolines, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel, heating oil, fuel oil, and asphalt. See generally, 55 FR at 46359 (Nov. 2, 1990); and EPA's Development Document for the effluent guidelines for the petroleum refining industry.    2                2     Section III of     Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category,     U.S. EPA, October 1982, National Technical Information Service     #    PB838172569.          E. Petroleum Refining Wastewater Treatment       Petroleum refining operations generate large amounts of wastewater that require treatment in order to reduce or remove wastewater pollutants so as to produce effluent that meets discharge requirements of the Clean Water Act. Principal sources of wastewater are refinery process units (where wastewater comes in direct contact with oil), as well as oily cooling waters from cooling towers and heat exchangers. Storm water, which may be subject to minor oil contamination from leaks or spills, is also a type of wastewater at a petroleum refinery.    3                 3         Id    ., and see     Manual on Disposal of Refinery Wastes: Volume on Liquid Wastes,     American Petroleum Institute, 1969, pp. 34 to 35.        Wastewater treatment systems at petroleum refineries generally consist of: (1) a drainage and collection system to collect and carry wastewaters to treatment units; (2) a primary treatment system to separate oil/water/solids, and (3) a secondary treatment system, normally involving biological treatment, to remove soluble biodegradable wastewater pollutants. Some refineries have tertiary treatment systems as well, consisting of water polishing steps before discharge. Secondary and tertiary treatment is frequently conducted using surface impoundments. Primary treatment, i.e. the initial separation of water, oil, and solids, normally occurs in tanks.        "," FR940728-0-00052   FR940728-0-00019        I.

The statutory definition of solid waste indicates that ``garbage, refuse, sludge *** and other discarded material'' are solid wastes.

0,FT942-11689 ,"FT942-11689 _AN-EEDEHAGJFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (10): Sun emerges from the clouds      By FRANK MCGURTY   Philadelphia loves a comeback story. It is a spirit epitomised in the movies by Rocky Balboa, the washed-up palooka who made the most of his last big shot to be somebody. In real life, there is no finer example than the impressive turnround by Sun Company, one of the stalwarts of Philadelphia's old industrial base. In 1991, the 108-year-old energy group - the fourth biggest company in the region - was a flabby under-achiever weighed down by a bloated portfolio of peripheral businesses. Overall, its operations were producing a meagre 2 per cent return on equity. Just two years later, the company is showing a return on equity of 10 per cent, having transformed itself into a lean contender with good prospects of sustained growth. 'They have identified where they have the best chance to be profitable,' says Mr George Baker, an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. 'In doing so, they have gone a long way towards making the company a more focused enterprise.' Sun has gone a long way in setting itself apart from its rivals, too. More than any other big energy group, it has emphasised a commitment to safe and sustainable environmental practices. It was the first Fortune 500 company to endorse the principles of the Coalition of Environmentally Responsible Economies, a non-profit organisation set up after the Exxon Valdez oil-spill to promote green business policies. On a smaller scale, Sun has put a human face on its corporate image with several innovative programmes, including an offer to buy and junk worn-out cars which are heavy polluters. In a small step which may symbolise the fresh approach, its headquarters was brought back to downtown Market Street after 23 years' exile in the suburb of Radnor. Nostalgia, however, had less to do with the relocation than did a desire to cut costs. The move was part of a comprehensive streamlining implemented soon after Mr Robert Campbell took over as chairman and chief executive in 1992. Under the new regime, the company has shifted its focus back to its traditional strengths - refining and marketing in the north-east. In its core operating region, Sun commands 14 per cent of the retail petrol trade, the second largest share behind Mobil. Branded petrol accounts for 37 per cent of total sales, by far the company's most important revenue generator. Sun hopes to build on these strengths. Concurrently, the group has withdrawn from the areas where it was taking a beating. It finally threw in the towel on most of its international exploration operations, after spinning off its US exploration and production in 1988. 'In drilling for oil and gas, we had a horrible record,' admits Mr Robert Aiken, chief financial officer. The company is still involved in international crude production, which remains profitable. Coal mining and real estate were deemed losing propositions, too. In Sun's continuing operations, expenses were slashed and the workforce reduced by 20 per cent to 14,000. So far, the results have exceeded Mr Campbell's goals. Sun posted operating profit of Dollars 193m last year, against Dollars 30m ayear earlier. The figure is well ahead of his target of achieving a Dollars 150m improvement. The company was again able to tap operating income in paying its dividend, another of the chairman's ambitions. Analysts are divided about some of the company's specific moves, and point out that its recovery is part of cyclical upturn by the industry as a whole. But most agree that the overall strategy is sound. Sun wins plaudits for securing long-term leases to operate filling stations along the Pennsylvania turnpike. The company also gained exclusive rights to sell petrol along the New Jersey turnpike, perhaps the most travelled highway in America. The high visibility of operating along such motorways carries benefits that exceed the revenues they directly generate, analysts say. Meanwhile, filling stations in the mid-west have been sold; underperforming outlets in the north-east have been pared from its 3,000-strong network. A move to integrate its branded petrol offerings under a single banner - Sunoco  - is also expected to pay off in higher margins, a critical factor in petrol retailing, where demand at best grows a scant 1 per cent a year. The group also put a feather in its cap by agreeing to buy a Chevron refining plant located on property adjacent to its main Philadelphia facility. The bargain-basement price of Dollars 170m made the deal an easy sell, even though the potential environmental remediation costs which Sun may face have yet to be quantified, says Mr John Hilton, an analyst at Argus Research in New York. 'Such investments are usually just shots in the dark,' says Mr James Murchie, who follows the industry for Sanford C Berstein in New York. He argues that future demand and margins on refined products are nearly impossible to gauge. Refining, a costly necessity for a marketer of petroleum products, continues to be a drag on Sun's bottom line, accounting for Dollars 80m in operating losses last year. Still, the Chevron acquisition was a safe bet, says Mr Murchie. Indeed, if the deal had been completed before this winter's deep freeze, which brought a sharp increase in demand for heating oil, the investment would have already paid for itself.

0,FT931-701 ,"FT931-701 _AN-DC2BZABSFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax proposals will hit small oil exploration companies while benefiting large producers      From Dr MICHAEL F RIDD   Sir, Since the chancellor's budget statement your pages have carried the reactions of two of the biggest North Sea oil companies to the proposed changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax arrangements ('North Sea group may halve exploration after oil tax change', March 24). At the other end of the spectrum is a company like my own, arguably the smallest North Sea oil company and yet one which would be strongly affected if the chancellor's proposals were to be implemented. Over several rounds of North Sea licensing Croft has built up a portfolio of exploration acreage, committing to the government to carry out certain seismic surveys and drilling. Our plans and commitments had been based on a fiscal regime in which our exploration and appraisal costs could be relieved against our PRT liability from the one producing field we have, Claymore. Under the chancellor's proposals the work we shall have to carry out under those commitments to government will effectively quadruple in cost. And, similarly, any discretionary exploration or appraisal work we might wish to carry out in the UK will be made that much more costly. Expressed another way, from 1996 when the PRT changes would begin to bite, our North Sea production revenue (and hence the money available for exploration) will halve. That is how a company largely devoted to exploration and appraisal will be affected. But certain other North Sea oil companies have such large producing interests and pay such large PRT bills that their effective increase in exploration and appraisal costs under the chancellor's proposals will be outweighed by the chancellor's other proposal, to reduce the PRT rate on existing fields from 75 to 50 per cent. Such companies, although few in number, are naturally rejoicing as your March 25 headline points out: 'BP defends oil tax from attacks.' Mr John Browne of BP is reported as saying that for too long the taxpayer has subsidised exploration. The reason he is now rejoicing is because the chancellor is proposing that in future the taxpayer will instead foot the bill for BP's increase in North Sea revenue, estimated at up to Pounds 140m a year. Mr Browne is one of the few North Sea oil company executives to consider exploration levels will not be seriously affected by the proposed changes, reportedly saying that instead it will give exploration a stronger focus and make it more cost-effective. If drilling success rates have declined from 1 in 5 to 1 in 7, as he says, it is not because of inefficient exploration but because with advancing maturity the North Sea is yielding smaller discoveries of which more are falling beneath the threshold of commercial viability. 'Stronger focus' is simply a euphemism for cutting the number of wells drilled, and fewer wells will mean fewer commercially viable discoveries. The government estimates that up to 25bn barrels of oil and 44 trillion cubic feet of gas may remain to be discovered in the UK. Finding those reserves will require sustained high levels of exploration. On the whole, over the past 30 years the fiscal regime has been conducive to such exploration - that could now change.

Kaminskiy, I.T. Kozlov, and S.G. Ashitko,  All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining;  UDC 665.6(470).001.7]    [Abstract] The former Soviet Union was always one of the  world's leading petroleum exporters, and most of its proved oil  reserves were located in Russia. In the mid-eighties, however,  oil recovery in Russia began declining and will likely continue  to decline until the end of the century. In the near future,  Russia may thus anticipate an oil shortage. Because Russia had  never experienced the oil crises encountered in many  industrially developed countries, the development of  energy-saving technologies and intensification of the degree to  which oil is processed were never emphasized as in the West. At  the beginning of the nineties, the depth of oil refining in  Russia averaged just 65 percent versus 82-82 percent in  developed countries. At the same time, many Russian petroleum  products are inferior to their foreign counterparts from both  ecological and performance standpoints. The use of leaded  gasoline, in particular, is a serious ecological problem. Only  59 percent of diesel fuels produced in Russia may be classified  as low-sulfur. Furnace residual fuel oil remains Russia's  highest-volume petroleum product, and it accounts for 13-13.5  percent of the fuel used to produce electric power. The quality  of motor, industrial, and transmission oils produced at Russian  oil refineries is inferior to that of their foreign  counterparts. Russian oil refining industry is capable only of  meeting the fuel needs of its obsolete machine tool park,  vehicle fleet, and inventory of mobile and stationary power  generating units and is not equipped to handle the technological  breakthroughs anticipated in such sectors. The technological  structure of most of Russia's oil refineries cannot support  production of the required amounts of products meeting current  quality levels, much less future ones. The All-Russian  Scientific Research Institute of Petroleum Refining has been  collaborating with leading institutes in the different petroleum  product-using sectors to develop the first scientifically  substantiated forecast of Russia's future petroleum product  needs. The forecast developed to date indicates a face-paced  increase in the number of diesel-fueled motor vehicles and  increases in the quantity and quality of high-octane gasolines.  The following changes in Russia's production and utilization of  petroleum products were recommended: increasing use of winter  grades of diesel fuels until it accounts for 30 percent of all  diesel fuels used, reducing the maximum sulfur content of diesel  fuel used in vehicles driven in cities or areas of high air  exchange from 0.2 to 0.05 percent, increasing the quality of  other petroleum products such as bitumen and coke, and  increasing the depth of oil refining to 72-75 percent within the  next 5 years and to 82-85 percent within the next 20 years.  Meeting these goals will require the construction of new  complexes to process mazut into motor fuels and the redesign of  existing facilities. The enormous capital investments required  for such massive construction/reconstruction can only be  achieved with adequate government support of the sector. Machine  building-related RD and facilities that have been freed up  as a  result of conversion could be used to construct modern  facilities permitting deeper processing of petroleum, which  could in turn reduce expenditures of foreign exchange on  imported petroleum products. The government must protect the  sector's scientific research institutes to keep them from  disappearing; restore destroyed scientific complexes of  scientific research institutes, affiliates, and pilot plants;  and modernize the sector's scientific research and design  institutes and link them with machine building plants in  integrated complexes.

0,FT921-10909 ,"FT921-10909 _AN-CBDCGACKFT 920204   FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Energy giants caught in quagmire  -The continuing turmoil in Canada's oil sector      By BERNARD SIMON   IMPERIAL Oil, Canada's biggest oil company, is set to take the knife to itself within a few days in some of the most radical surgery ever inflicted on a Canadian company. If the analysts are correct, Imperial, 70 per cent owned by Exxon of New York, will announce it is closing two, and possibly three, of its six refineries, eliminating a quarter of its 4,200 filling stations, and laying off more than 1,000 workers. Imperial's restructuring, and similar measures now under way at its arch-rival Petro-Canada, confirm that the turmoil enveloping the exploration and production side of Canada's oil industry for the past few years has now spread to the downstream refining and marketing sectors. The shakeout, in the form of acquisitions, asset disposals and partner buy-outs, is profoundly changing the shape of the Calgary-based oil and gas industry. The brunt of the blow is being felt by the integrated giants of the industry, such as Imperial, Petro-Canada and Shell Canada, which is 78 per cent owned by Royal Dutch Shell. Amoco's Canadian subsidiary is also struggling to digest its acquisition five years ago of Dome Petroleum, the crippled giant of the western Canadian industry. 'The big guys are toast and investing in them is not what you do for growth,' says Mr Verne Johnson, president of Lasmo Canada, a subsidiary of the UK-based oil and gas group. Narrowing operating margins and hefty writedowns have recently put all three of the integrated companies in the red. Imperial's CDollars 36m (USDollars 30.8m) operating loss last year was the first in its history. The pain is only partly due to the dip in oil and natural gas prices and weak demand at the pump. The protracted North American gas 'bubble' and a 10 per cent drop in sales of refined petroleum products over the past two years have probably hastened what was the inevitable. The recession has highlighted the high costs of maintaining a diverse portfolio of exploration and production properties, and a coast-to-coast retail network. 'What pays the bills are the discoveries (the integrated companies) made in the '50s and '60s,' Mr Johnson says. 'Their bureaucracies are not able to exploit the opportunities that remain.' The pace in the industry is being set by a band of smaller and more nimble operators. Headed by a new generation of entrepreneurs, they have snapped up the assets put on the block by the industry's giants. Unlike the bulk of US independents, many of the aggressive newcomers are publicly listed, giving them wide exposure to institutional and retail investors. Corporate finance has become a fast-growing business in Calgary. Among the names that are mentioned most often are Chauvco Resources, Morgan Hydrocarbons, Morrison Petroleums, Tarragon Oil  Gas and Canadian Natural Resources. While the big energy companies are looking for ways to slim down, Chauvco, for instance, boosted oil and gas liquids output by 72 per cent in the first nine months of last year. Chauvco's cash-flow and earnings doubled. These companies get their headstart from lower costs. According to the federal government's Petroleum Monitoring Agency, junior oil and gas producers had operating costs of CDollars 26.93 per cubic metre in 1990, compared with CDollars 38.74 per cu metre for the senior companies. The seniors' costs climbed by 6.6 per cent that year, compared with 2.9 per cent for the juniors. Many of the newcomers are foreign-controlled. Despite lingering restrictions on foreign investment in the Canadian energy industry, the stake of US, European and Far East investors has risen markedly. Mr Johnson says Lasmo is still looking 'quite greedily' to buy light-oil properties. The trend throughout the industry is towards specialisation. On the upstream side, producers are increasingly concentrating on specific products, such as conventional oil, heavy oil or natural gas. Mr Jack Pelletier, a corporate finance consultant in Calgary, notes that many companies are also moving away from the joint ventures which were popular in the 1960s and 1970s, preferring to operate a smaller number of properties themselves. In the overcrowded refining and retail businesses, the most successful companies are those putting the emphasis on a regional rather than national strategies. They include Ultramar in eastern Canada, Suncor in Ontario and Chevron in the west. Last week, Pay Less Holdings, a small company which has waged a fierce petrol price war on Vancouver Island, paid well above prevailing market prices for Canadian Turbo, another regional marketer in the west. Mr Frank Sayer, president of Sayer Securities, a Calgary firm which specialises in the oil and gas industry, says that 'changes in the downstream are just starting to match what's been happening in the upstream sector'. Mr Sayer predicts that it will be another year or two before the deal-making begins to subside.

Kh. Dzhurabekov.    Participants in the meeting were the deputies of the  chairman  of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of Karakalpakstan,  the khokims [administrators] of the oblasts and the city of  Tashkent, and the heads of ministries, departments, concerns,  corporations, and associations.    The question of the situation with execution of the laws  directed to ensuring preservation and rational use of petroleum  products in the sectors of the agroindustrial and construction  complexes was reviewed.    Inspections conducted by the republic procurator's office  and  its organs in the local areas with participation by specialists  showed that measures are being taken at the farms and in the  administrative apparatuses of the Ministry of Water Management,  the Ministry of Agriculture, the state concerns Uzvodstroy  [Hydro Construction], Uzplodoovoshchvinprom  [Fruit-Vegetable-Grape Industry], and Uzpishcheprom [Food  Industry], Uzglavstroydrevprom [Main Administration of  Construction in the Wood Processing Industry], and the  Tashkentstroy [Tashkent Construction] State Corporation to stop  mismanagement in the storage, transportation, and use of  petroleum products. This reduced the number of violations of the  law in the use of fuel and lubricants. At the same time the  proper measures are not always taken with guilty parties. As the  result of connivance on the part of ministries, departments, and  officials at the farms and enterprises there occur cases or  irrational use of petroleum products, unsatisfactory  record-keeping on them, illegal writing off of fuel, poor  technical condition in petroleum storage facilities, and  operation of vehicles with malfunctioning speedometers.  Petroleum products are squandered, stolen, and resold owing to  the neglected state of record-keeping and relaxed monitoring of  their preservation. The sources from which petroleum products  sold by private individuals at speculative prices were obtained  are not identified.    A shortfall of 92,500 liters of various petroleum products  was found at the petroleum storage facilities of just 17 farms  in Andizhan, Bukhara, Dzhizak, Surkhandarya, and Navoi oblasts.    The practice was followed where the customs services would  use confiscated petroleum products for their own needs and sell  them to various organizations instead of turning them in to  state storage areas in Surkhandarya, Andizhan, and Bukhara  oblasts. In just the first quarter of this year more than 88  percent of confiscated petroleum products were used for their  own needs or sold to customs employees and various organizations.    The attention of those at the meeting was called to  compulsory execution of the Cabinet of Ministers decree entitled  ""Establishing Order in the Sale of Fuel and Lubricants.""    The decision adopted noted that many heads of ministries,  concerns, associations, enterprises and organizations, and local  governmental organs did not draw the proper conclusions from  decisions adopted earlier and did not fully ensure their  realization.    The question of the use of gas, boiler fuel, and thermal and  electrical energy at enterprises in Samarkand, Navoi, and  Tashkent oblasts and the city of Tashkent was examined at the  meeting. Study of the state of affairs in this sphere identified  numerous substantial shortcomings, which lead to significant  losses of gas.    In a sample inspection of just 13 percent of the enterprises  of the above oblasts and the city of Tashkent it was established  that about 100 million cubic meters of gas is being lost because  of direct mismanagement. The losses of other types of fuel,  heat, and electricity are very large. The situation with the use  of energy-conserving equipment remains unsatisfactory. The  attention of the executives was directed to the inadequacy of  the steps being taken on questions of the use of fuel-energy  resources.    It was recommended that the heads of khokim [administrative]  offices, ministries, and departments review the personal  responsibility of the officials guilty of offenses in the  questions reviewed, going as far as discharging them from their  positions.    The commission also examined the question of switching  diesel  pumping stations to electric drive. It was noted that  realization of these measures will make it possible to free a  significant quantity of diesel fuel. A schedule was approved for  switching diesel pumping stations to electric drive and  switching machine irrigation systems to gravity flow watering in  1994-1995. Steps to realize this program were outlined.    Deputy prime ministers of the republic A. Voznenko, K.  Tulyaganov, M. Usmanov, and K. Khankulov took part in the  commission meeting.     "
0,FT943-339 ,"FT943-339 _AN-EI2D5AF3FT 940929   FT  29 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taiwanese cast their nets wider  -Pollution and overfishing has hit local catches      By LAURA TYSON   Fishmongers at Keelung port's bustling fish market hawk scaly wares ranging from imported Norwegian salmon to Pacific tuna and squid caught off the Falkland Islands. Pollution and overfishing of nearby waters has forced Taiwanese fishermen to scour ever more distant shores. The catch of neighbouring China nearly tripled from 1981 to 1990 to become the world's biggest fisheries producer. Taiwan will soon sign an accord with the 15-nation South Pacific Forum allowing its fishermen uniform access to waters controlled by those countries, according to the country's ministerial-level Council of Agriculture. The South Pacific is an important fishing ground for Taiwan, especially for tuna and skipjack. Forum members are Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Western Samoa, Fiji, Vanuatu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Cook Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Nauru, Niue Island, the Solomon Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. Since the United Nations switched recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1971, Taiwan has encountered difficulties in securing fishing grounds, especially from countries with which it does not have diplomatic ties. In 1989 the quasi-governmental Overseas Fisheries Development Council was set up to negotiate fishing rights and help settle an escalating number of fishing disputes. The government has already secured fishing rights within the 200-mile coastal zones of South Africa, Tuvalu, Tonga, Solomon Islands and Marshall Islands, all countries with which Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations. Commercial fishing agreements have so far been reached with over 20 countries or territories, of which those with Indonesia, India and the Falkland Islands are the most important. Talks are under way with several other countries including Vietnam and Burma. Although Taiwan does not appear in statistics compiled by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation, it ranked the 18th among fishing nations in 1990, and falls within the top five in production of both tuna and squid. Government efforts to curb growth in the domestic fishing industry cut the total catch to 1.317m tonnes in 1991 from a 1990 peak of 1.455m. But production has risen since. Taiwan, a major fish exporter, sold just over a quarter of its catch overseas in 1993. Tuna dominated exports and the biggest markets were Japan, Thailand and the US. Fish imports have grown to meet increased domestic consumption resulting from economic growth. Official figures show that Taiwan's imports more than doubled over the past decade. Unofficial imports from China are also on the rise. Taiwanese fishermen either pick up their illicit cargo from Chinese ports or buy the fish from Chinese boats at sea and smuggle it into ports such as Keelung. With nearby waters depleted, nearly 60 per cent of the 1993 catch came from distant seas. Tuna caught in distant seas through long-lining jumped 80 per cent in 1993 from 1992. Last year's catch of squid, caught by a type of hook-and-line method called zigging, climbed 22 per cent. The two species combined comprised one-third of the total catch last year. Despite Taiwan's pariah diplomatic status, which prevents it from joining international organisations, the government generally complies with international maritime and fishing conventions. For instance, it banned whaling in 1983 and in 1993, it outlawed drift net fishing following a United Nations resolution against the practice. As competition grows fiercer for fewer fish, Taiwanese fishing boats have encountered numerous disputes over fishing grounds from the South China Sea to the South Atlantic. Recognising the problems of overfishing, the government in 1989 instituted a policy of trying to contain growth of the fishing industry. Through restrictions on boat-building and a boat buyback programme Taiwan's fleet was cut to 28,880 vessels last year from peak of 32,340 in 1990. But remaining boats and those which are being built are more sophisticated and thus have a higher catching capacity.   Countries:-  TWZ  Taiwan, Asia.   Industries:-  P091  Commercial Fishing.

0,FT922-5893 ,"FT922-5893 _AN-CE1BHACXFT 920528   FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extracting the benefits from African oil - Sub-Saharan countries are short of training and investment capital      By ANDREW HILL   ANGOLA IS a good example of the oil-producing potential of sub-Saharan Africa. Endowed with an estimated 4.9bn barrels of recoverable reserves, the country continued pumping during 16 years of fierce civil war, which officially ended less than a year ago. Oil kept the Angolan economy afloat. Now, with new offshore fields being opened to exploration and investment, and more than 500,000 barrels of crude being produced a day, Angola is consolidating its position as sub-Saharan Africa's second largest producer, after Nigeria. But such 'rich' developing countries have fears too, many of which were voiced this month in Luanda, the Angolan capital, at an oil and gas conference aimed at encouraging co-operation between African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) nations and the European Community. ACP oil producers are worried that a lack of adequate training, a shortage of international investment capital, and global environmental pressures may hamper their economic development. 'Countries with large energy resources can't always extract the benefits,' said Mr Fernando Jose Franca Van Dunen, the Angolan prime minister, in his opening address. 'If they are not accompanied by technical transfers, and proper support, more problems, more economic disaster and more poverty can be provoked. Give us help in drawing up inventories of our resources, teach us to exploit them rationally and give us some mechanism so we can solve our balance of payments problems.' At the same time, developing nations without natural energy resources - the majority of the 69 ACP countries - are concerned that in a capricious world oil market they may be hamstrung by their dependence on hydrocarbons. Their anxiety is well-founded: according to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa spends about one-third of its hard currency earnings on petroleum. Energy analysts say the concern should not be one-sided. The buzz-word of the Luanda conference - as at previous EC-ACP gatherings - was 'interdependence'. The developed north will simply store up trouble for itself for the future if it neglects the energy needs and concerns of the developing south, which - together with other non-OECD economies - is exercising an increasing influence over international energy policy. Mr Quincey Lumsden, a director of the International Energy Agency, warned delegates that in 10 years' time, important oil crisis management decisions could be taken beyond the industrialised nations' reach - not in Paris, where the IEA has it headquarters, but in Beijing, Brasilia or New Delhi. The EC's ability to meet the concerns of ACP countries with direct action is limited by its existing political and financial commitments. ACP oil and gas producers, for example, have long insisted that hydrocarbons should be eligible for special loans and export earnings stabilisation funds from the EC. Such assistance is at present provided for most commodities under the Ecu12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) Fourth Lome Convention - the EC-ACP trade and aid agreement - but oil and gas are excluded. Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, told the Luanda conference that such wishes - reiterated by Angola's Mr Van Dunen and by Mr Ralph Maraj, foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago (the only non-African ACP oil producer) - 'did not fall on deaf ears'. But realistically, the European Commission is unlikely to press for changes in the Lome terms to benefit a dozen developing nations that already have greater natural advantages than other ACP members. However, senior commission officials believe existing community initiatives  -applied both to EC members and to central and east European countries - do provide examples of ways in which the framework for energy development in ACP countries could be improved. Recent draft EC legislation to harmonise criteria for granting oil and gas exploration licences contains principles that could be applied to ACP countries. That would ensure equitable conditions for potential international investors, some of which complained at the conference that the contract terms being imposed by developing oil producers were too tough. The European energy charter - designed to help the former Soviet Union and eastern European states exploit their natural resources - could be extended or adapted to ACP countries. As the continued desire to invest in Angolan oil-fields during the civil war indicated, international companies will continue to drill for oil under the most difficult political circumstances. But an African energy charter would provide a level of security for international investors - and reciprocal guarantees for ACP and exploration companies - which would underpin economic development of the developing countries. An ACP-EC working group is now likely to be set up to continue discussion of the issues raised by the Luanda conference. Improved training is one fundamental problem that needs to be tackled, particularly in countries, like Angola, that have suffered severe disruption of regular education. As one aide to the Angolan energy minister put it during the conference, for African oil producers 'money is no problem - but there is a whole generation which has had little education or training'. Similarly, ACP countries are held back by inefficiency in the refining and distribution sectors. That pushes up costs in states that do not produce their own oil, and occasionally forces African exporters of crude to import petroleum products. Theoretical solutions do not always work in such cases: ACP delegates pointed out that the break-up of downstream state monopolies in procurement, refining and distribution - one approach advocated by Mr Miguel Schloss of the World Bank - is not on its own enough to encourage investment in decaying infrastructure. Perhaps the biggest issue the working group will have to tackle is the question of protecting the environment, which commission officials insisted should be a priority for the developing countries as it is now for most industrialised nations. ACP representatives were surprisingly reticent about the impact an EC energy tax might have on their future economic development. But there seems little doubt that if the commission's plans announced this month get the backing of EC members the poorer oil-hungry nations will break their silence.

0,FT931-9045 ,"FT931-9045 _AN-DBPBVAE6FT 930216   FT  16 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US gold explorers head south      By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent   LEADING US gold producers are cutting exploration spending at home while increasing it substantially in Latin America, according to a survey by the Gold Institute, a Washington-based, industry-financed organisation. Worldwide exploration spending by the 18 companies surveyed - which together accounted for 73 per cent of 1991 US gold output - fell by 16 per cent last year from Dollars 280m to an estimated Dollars 235m. Their gold exploration in the US fell by 18 per cent to a four-year low of Dollars 149m. This represented 63 per cent of total exploration budgets, down from 65 per cent in 1991 and 71 per cent as recently as 1989. 'This is the first time spending and share simultaneously declined - clear evidence that the US market is growing unattractive for investment,' the institute suggests. Meanwhile, exploration spending in Latin America, which was only Dollars 14m in 1989, increased by a further 16 per cent last year, from Dollars 30m to and estimated Dollars 35m. 'Latin American nations are taking deliberate and aggressive steps to recruit US investment. Mining is an internationally competitive business and capital will flow to those nations which have mineral wealth and offer an attractive business climate,' the institute says. It admits its survey excludes exploration work by small companies, prospectors and independent exploration companies - an important part of the business - but points out that 'the presence of a senior (big) gold producer in a given country is a sure sign that smaller companies have led the way'. The survey shows spending by US gold producers in Canada remained steady at an average of Dollars 27m a year or 10 to 11 per cent of exploration budgets. However, 'US producers appear to be wrapping up their efforts in Australia where spending (down from Dollars 14m in 1991 to an estimated Dollars 10m last year) and share (down from 5 per cent to 4.25 per cent) declined over the period of the survey'. In 1992 US producers cut spending in the rest of the world by 42 per cent to Dollars 15m. The survey will provide the US mining industry with ammunition as it battles against efforts being made in Congress to impose a national royalty on mineral production and other measures that the industry suggests would discourage investment in mining in the US. The institute points out that during the 1980s the US became the world's second-biggest gold producer and adds: 'As congressional and administration leaders consider measures to reform laws regulating this industry, they must carefully consider how their actions will affect the competitive position of the US'.

The high-ranking official, who returned from Havana today, said  both governments are interested in beginning the transaction.  Nule Amin also indicated that the first shipments of Colombian  petroleum to the Caribbean island will be made some time between  June and July.    ""We expect to finalize some details, such as payment and  timeframe formulas"" very soon, Nule Amin said. The minister  explained that ""these will be direct sales,"" making it known  that the transactions will not involve any type of compensation  or barter mechanisms. Guido Nule Amin emphasized that during  the negotiations it was made clear that Colombia is willing to  sell petroleum to Cuba, but under the same ""conditions that  prevail on the international market.""    The Colombian minister said Cuba currently consumes  50,000-60,000 barrels of petroleum and that, according to what  was agreed upon in Havana, Colombia will initially supply  one-third of Cuba's fuel supply. Colombia produces  approximately 420,000 barrels a day. It consumes half of that  amount and exports the rest.     "

He gave me snow-white long underwear, trimmed at the neckline with lace. Far  too fancy for the Falklands general store, I thought, and then saw the  Nordstrom label.    Christmas lunch was a feast of Smithfield ham and roast turkey, baked yams and  pumpkin pie, homemade ice cream and baklava. It was borne by a Greek named  Babis, who had brought our breakfast tray.    After the last hearty toast, we put on red parkas and walked out on the  sun-splashed deck. It was warmer now, and snow was beginning to fall. Fat  flakes stuck to our hair and wool gloves.    Music began booming from the loudspeaker.    Pa-rum-pa-pum-pum.      Column    "

North Dakota further stated that the ``surface'' used for purposes of travel by land vehicles used in coal exploration are subject to regulation, whether those vehicles are traveling within established rights-of-way or outside of them. Based upon the State's explanation, the Director finds that North Dakota's use of the word ``or'' in its proposed definition of ``road'' is not inconsistent with the Federal definition of ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5.  Second, OSM requested that North Dakota clarify its intent regarding the differences between the proposed definition of ``road'' in the coal exploration portions of the State program and the already-approved definition of ``road'' in the surface coal mining and reclamation operations portions of the State program (NDAC 6905.20102(92)). Specifically, the approved definition of ``road'' at NDAC 6905.20102(92), like the Federal counterpart definition, explicitly includes access and haulroads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in operations, including use by coal hauling vehicles to and from transfer, processing, or storage areas. Proposed NDCC 3812.103(6), however, does not contain a similar list of various types of roads encompassed by the definition.  By letter dated December 3, 1993, North Dakota responded by acknowledging that the proposed definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6) includes all rights-of-way used in coal exploration and was not intended to include exhaustive examples of all types of roads. North Dakota also submitted a proposed revision to its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2). The revised regulation would include a new clause clarifying that:         A road is altered if it is constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way that causes the changes described in this section.         The Federal regulation defining ``road'' at 30 CFR 701.5 insofar as it concerns coal exploration, also includes ``[a]ccess and haul roads constructed, used, reconstructed, improved, or maintained for use in *** coal exploration *** .'' Thus, North Dakota's inclusion of the additional terms ``constructed, reconstructed, improved, and maintained'' into its coal exploration regulations at NDAC 43020120.3(c)(2), when read in conjunction with the discussion above regarding the proposed statutory definition of ``road'' at NDCC 3812.103(6), effectively defines the term ``road'' to include all rights-of-way used in coal exploration as well as roads constructed, reconstructed, improved, or maintained in any way.

The deal boosts Enterprise's net acreage on the Norwegian Continental Shelf by 25 per cent, or 298 sq km, and gives the company a 50 per cent stake in each of the three blocks within the Esso licenses. Domestic analysts said they believed the deal to be the biggest of its kind ever concluded in Norway. Enterprise said that portions of blocks 16/1, 25/8 and 25/20 in the Utsira High area with proven hydrocarbons were specifically excluded from the farm-in. The company explained that it had agreed the farm-in with Esso to make greater and faster progress in building its Norwegian North Sea portfolio than what otherwise could be accomplished under Norway's licensing regime. Enterprise intends to drill three exploration wells - one this year in block 25/8 near Esso's producing Balder field - and to undertake three dimensional seismic surveys over the bulk of the farm-in acreage. Including the farm-in well, the company plans to drill up to 10 exploration wells this year elsewhere on Norwegian shelf acreage, or one-third of all wells to be drilled in the sector, representing its heaviest ever exploration programme since entering Norway in 1989, when it acquired acreage from Texas Eastern. The two companies have already secured approval of the agreement by Norway's industry and energy ministry and finance ministry.   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil Norge.

The public is expressing indignation  over the attitude of the Crestone energy company and its actions  because of the following reasons:    First, the sea area where Crestone is conducting the  seismologial survey is precisely the Tu Chinh coral reef of  Vietnam. This area lies within Vietnam's sacred terrorial sea.  By arrogantly conducting a survey in this area, Crestone has  brazenly and gravely violated Vietnamese sovereignty, thus  tramping on international justice and law, provoking public  opinion, and running counter to the trend of our time which,  promoted by the world community, calls for the respect of the  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of every  country.    Second, the U.S.-owned Crestone company deliberately  distorted the truth and the history to cover up its wrongdoing.  It claimed that its action is a continuation of China's history  of research and exploration in that sea area, which allegedly  began since time immemorial as far back as 200 years B.C.    In view of the wrongful attitude and action of Crestone, we  express our great indignation over the company's action and  denounce it before the public.    Right from the time when the company signed an oil  exploration and exploitation contract with the Offshore Oil  Company of China in May 1992, the SRV Foreign Ministry had  issued a statement declaring that this contract is invalid and  that it constitutes a grave violation against Vietnam's  sovereignty over its continental shelf and economic zone as well  as against international law.    We assert that according to international law, Vietnam has  long exercised its sovereignty over the Tu Chinh area. As early  as before 1975, this area was divided into bid lots for oil and  gas exploration and exploitation. The then Provisional  Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam also issued a  statement asserting its sovereignty. After the unification of  the country, the SRV Government issued its statements dated 12  May 1977 and 12 November 1982, asserting Vietnam's sovereignty  over its territorial seas and continental shelves. In 1988, the  Vietnamese side made public a chart of concession lots divided  for oil exploration and exploitation purposes. Vietnam has  since conducted exploration and exploitation of its oil and gas  resources in that area, including its cooperation with many  foreign companies. As decided by the SRV Government, an  economic, scientific, and service zone has been established  there since 1989 with the presence of a system of Vietnamese  lighthouses and a hydro-meteorological station.    On 20 April 1994, a spokesman for the SRV Government again  clearly pointed out that the seismological survey by the  Crestone company and its arrogant declaration of a planned  exploration and exploitation of national resources in the area  within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and continental shelf  -- an area which is, both legally and practically, totally under  Vietnamese sovereignty -- constitutes a new, very grave step of  escalation; and that the Crestone company must bear full  responsibility for the consequences arising from its actions.    Once again, we asserted that the contract of the Crestone  company is invalid and that its actions are illegal. No  countries or companies will be allowed to conduct any  exploration or exploitation of natural resources within  Vietnam's continental shelf and exclusive economic zone without  permission from the Vietnamese Government.

""China  has irrefutable sovereignety over the Nansha Islands (Spratlys)  and its adjacent waters,"" a foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.  ""Any country's exploration and exploitation activities of oil  and gas there should not damage"" China's interests, he added.    The comment came in reply to a question on the Philippines  allowing Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and U.S. partner  Vaalco Energy Inc. to begin preliminary exploration work near  the disputed South China Sea chain. Philippine energy officials  insisted Tuesday the area where the exploration would be  conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a chain of atolls in  the South China Sea claimed wholly by China and in part by  Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.    The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil  and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. Two  other U.S. firms, Crestone Energy Corp. and Mobil are already  exploring part of the area on behalf of the Chinese and  Vietnamese governments respectively. Both governments  vehemently criticised each other's moves.     "
0, FR940304-0-00123   FR940304-0-00021        5. Section 279.10(g)(5)," FR940304-0-00123   FR940304-0-00021        5. Section 279.10(g)(5)_Used Oil Captured by the Refinery's Hydrocarbon Recovery System or Wastewater Treatment System and Inserted Into Petroleum Refining Process         Section 279.10(g)(5) of today's rule exempts from the part 279 standards used oil that incidentally enters and is recovered from a petroleum refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery system or its wastewater treatment system (e.g., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), if the recovered used oil is subsequently inserted into the petroleum refining process. Oil (that may contain small amounts of used oil) that has been recovered from a refining facility's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system is typically used as a feedstock in petroleum refining to produce more petroleum products. EPA understands that used oil, generated from routine refinery process operations and that incidentally enters a refinery's recovery or wastewater treatment system (e.g., drips, leaks, and spills from compressors, valves, and pumps), represents a small portion of the total oil that enters (and is then recovered from) the recovery or wastewater treatment system. Thus, the oil recovered from the system is more properly characterized as crude feedstock than used oil. Provided the used oil is inserted into the petroleum refining process, EPA believes that regulation under part 279 standards is unwarranted. This exemption from the part 279 standards does not extend to used oil which is intentionally introduced into a petroleum refinery's recovery or wastewater treatment system (e.g., pouring collected used oil into any part of the hydrocarbon recovery system, storm or process sewer system or into wastewater treatment units). Used oil may not be introduced to the refinery's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system as a way to avoid meeting the conditions specified in 279.10(g)(4).     For the purposes of the exemption in today's rule, the examples cited in the existing     de minimis     wastewater exclusion (279.10(f)) provide guidance on what types of releases to a refinery's hydrocarbon recovery or wastewater treatment system would be considered ``routine'' or ``incidental''. The exemption is intended to cover losses from drippage, minor spillage, etc., that cannot be reasonably avoided. For example, used oil that has been collected from equipment or vehicle maintenance activities and intentionally introduced into a refinery's wastewater treatment system would not be exempt under 279.1(g)(5) from the part 279 standards once recovered. Similarly, used oil that is generated off-site and is brought to the refinery may not be added to any portion of the refinery's wastewater treatment system (i.e., process sewer, storm sewer, or wastewater treatment units), and still be exempt under 279.10(g)(5) once recovered; such oil is clearly not ``incidentally captured'' by the refinery's wastewater treatment system. In fact, unless specifically exempted under 279.10(g)(2) or 279.10(g)(3) of today's rule, this type of activity would meet the definition of used oil processing under the existing used oil management standards (see 40 CFR 279.1).     Today's rule does not preclude intentional introduction of used oil in to the facility's recovered oil tanks. EPA is aware that used oil from both on- and off-site is often added directly to the petroleum refining facility's recovered oil tanks. Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain greater than 1% used oil are regulated as used oil. Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 used oil management standards under 279.10(g)(2). Mixtures of used oil and recovered oil that contain less than 1% used oil and are inserted into the petroleum refining process after crude distillation or catalytic cracking are exempt from the part 279 standards (under 279.10(g)(4)) only if the used oil meets the used oil specification prior to mixing with recovered oil.         6. Section 279.10(g)(6)_Stock Tank Bottoms         Section 279.10(g)(6) of today's rule exempts tank bottoms from stock tanks containing exempt mixtures of used oil and crude oil from the part 279 standards. Like the actual mixtures of used oil and crude oil, the bottoms from these mixtures are expected to contain insignificant amounts of used oil. Therefore, the Agency does not believe that the bottoms from tanks (or other units) containing mixtures of used oil and crude oil should be subject to the used oil management standards. The tank bottoms are subject to all other applicable requirements, i.e., the 262.11 requirement to determine if they are hazardous waste.         D. Used Oil Transportation         Section 279.1_Definition of Transfer Facility         Today's rule revises the definition of transfer facility to allow used oil to be held at a location (i.e., a transfer facility) temporarily prior to activities that are not subject to the processor standards as a result of today's rulemaking. In the September 10, 1992 final rule, a transfer facility was defined as a transportation-related facility where shipments of used oil are held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the normal course of transportation. Today's rule expands that definition to allow used oil to be held for more than 24 hours but less than 35 days during the normal course of transportation or prior to an activity performed pursuant to 279.20(b)(2). Under the amended definition, as discussed below in section F of this preamble, a site to which used oil from oil-bearing electrical transformers is transported for filtering prior to reuse would be considered a transfer facility under today's definition.

ICRC legal adviser Louise Doswald-Beck told a press  conference that ""civilisation would take a step backwards if it  tolerated such weapons,"" which could blind a person irreversibly  at a distance of one kilometre (1,000 yards).    In presenting the 300-page report, [written] by experts  engaged by the ICRC since 1991, Beck said ""the laser weapon is  silent, its ray is invisible and its effect is instantaneous.""    The ICRC wants the weapon banned when the 1980 Geneva  Convention is reviewed at the end of this year.    Doswald-Beck said individual shoulder-fired laser weapons  costing just $100 were already being tested in the United States  and could go into production next year.    The British specialist magazine JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY  revealed in 1990 that laser weapons were used by the Royal Navy  against Argentine pilots during the 1982 Falkland War and could  have caused the unexplained crash of three aircraft.    The ICRC also wants much tighter control on the use of  anti-personnel mines which tend to kill more civilians than  combatants.     "

Galveston County officials expect to begin construction early next year on a  necklace of artificial fishing reefs using 1,000 feet of 10-inch pipe dug up  from a products pipeline and donated by Conoco Inc.    ""To my knowledge, these are the first artificial reefs in the Galveston area,  perhaps anywhere on the Gulf Coast, to be constructed for this specific  purpose,"" said county Commissioner Eddie Barr.    Conoco also has offered to deliver another 4,500 feet of 24-inch pipe to  Galveston as soon as county workers are ready for it, Barr said.    The 24-inch pipe was fabricated as tethers for Conoco's tension-leg well  platform but became scrap when it was damaged during transport in rough seas.    The pipe will be cut and welded into 20-by-20-by-15-foot structures and sunk at  various sites off the Galveston shore.    In a separate project, Transco Exploration Partners plans to sink a portion of  an inactive production platform in the offshore High Island field early next  year in deeper U.S. waters.    Transco stopped production in the High Island field in 1988 and plans to move  the rest of the platform. The state has received permission from the Corps of  Engineers to establish reefs in that field.    Since offshore oil exploration started in the late 1940s, it has been common  knowledge that marine life cluster around drilling and production platforms to  feed on tiny organisms clinging to the rigs.    A few weeks after rigs sink in the gulf, artificial reefs become crusted with  marine organisms that attract many species of fish, including red snapper,  amberjack, Spanish mackerel, kingfish and barracuda, said Tom Kessler,  Galveston County assistant engineer.    ""Fish prefer lots of shaded nooks and crannies in which to school and feed on  these organisms. These reefs will serve as good facilitators in the food chain  cycle. They will provide more spawning ground for fish, which can then become a  managed resource,"" Kessler said.    The oil industry views Texas' rigs-to-reefs program as a way to benefit the  environment.    ""Since we take petroleum from beneath the sea, it is only natural that we give  something in return -- especially in our own back yard,"" said Bob Walker, vice  president of Conoco's supply and transportation division.    ""Helping create a feeding ground for marine life is an excellent opportunity  for everyone involved. A series of artificial reefs like this could produce  important economic benefits for the tourism and fishing industries,"" Walker  said.    Other cities use sunken ships, retired oil platforms and junked cars to attract  marine life, Barr said.    Barr said county officials are working to coordinate their efforts with the  Texas Artificial Reefs Committee, which is drawing a map outlining the best  spots for artificial reefs.    County officials want to sink artificial reefs along a rocky ridge that runs  parallel to the island where water depths range from 25 feet to 70 feet. Barr  hopes that the reefs can be put close enough to the island for access by sport  fishermen in power boats and scuba divers.    County commissioners have applied for a $50,000 grant from the Moody Foundation  to pay for construction and transportation of the first reefs, which are  expected to be completed and sunk offshore in the spring.

Galveston County officials expect to begin construction early next year on a  necklace of artificial fishing reefs using 1,000 feet of 10-inch pipe dug up  from a products pipeline and donated by Conoco Inc.    ""To my knowledge, these are the first artificial reefs in the Galveston area,  perhaps anywhere on the Gulf Coast, to be constructed for this specific  purpose,"" said county Commissioner Eddie Barr.    Conoco also has offered to deliver another 4,500 feet of 24-inch pipe to  Galveston as soon as county workers are ready for it, Barr said.    The 24-inch pipe was fabricated as tethers for Conoco's tension-leg well  platform but became scrap when it was damaged during transport in rough seas.    The pipe will be cut and welded into 20-by-20-by-15-foot structures and sunk at  various sites off the Galveston shore.    In a separate project, Transco Exploration Partners plans to sink a portion of  an inactive production platform in the offshore High Island field early next  year in deeper U.S. waters.    Transco stopped production in the High Island field in 1988 and plans to move  the rest of the platform. The state has received permission from the Corps of  Engineers to establish reefs in that field.    Since offshore oil exploration started in the late 1940s, it has been common  knowledge that marine life cluster around drilling and production platforms to  feed on tiny organisms clinging to the rigs.    A few weeks after rigs sink in the gulf, artificial reefs become crusted with  marine organisms that attract many species of fish, including red snapper,  amberjack, Spanish mackerel, kingfish and barracuda, said Tom Kessler,  Galveston County assistant engineer.    ""Fish prefer lots of shaded nooks and crannies in which to school and feed on  these organisms. These reefs will serve as good facilitators in the food chain  cycle. They will provide more spawning ground for fish, which can then become a  managed resource,"" Kessler said.    The oil industry views Texas' rigs-to-reefs program as a way to benefit the  environment.    ""Since we take petroleum from beneath the sea, it is only natural that we give  something in return -- especially in our own back yard,"" said Bob Walker, vice  president of Conoco's supply and transportation division.    ""Helping create a feeding ground for marine life is an excellent opportunity  for everyone involved. A series of artificial reefs like this could produce  important economic benefits for the tourism and fishing industries,"" Walker  said.    Other cities use sunken ships, retired oil platforms and junked cars to attract  marine life, Barr said.    Barr said county officials are working to coordinate their efforts with the  Texas Artificial Reefs Committee, which is drawing a map outlining the best  spots for artificial reefs.    County officials want to sink artificial reefs along a rocky ridge that runs  parallel to the island where water depths range from 25 feet to 70 feet. Barr  hopes that the reefs can be put close enough to the island for access by sport  fishermen in power boats and scuba divers.    County commissioners have applied for a $50,000 grant from the Moody Foundation  to pay for construction and transportation of the first reefs, which are  expected to be completed and sunk offshore in the spring.

Mr Jorge Bande, Codelco's planning director, said he would invite 20 mining companies this week to study the projects on offer. Two are copper deposits in the Atacama desert, and two are gold prospects close to La Coipa and El Hueso, gold mines already in operation. Mr Bande said these were the first of several prospects Codelco wanted to explore as joint-ventures, following the passage of recent legislation that authorised the state-owned company to forge partnerships with the private sector. Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, owns about a third of the registered mining property in Chile. Its exploration work, however, has been limited by budget constraints dictated by the finance ministry. Mr Bande sees the joint-ventures as a way of tapping the vast mineral potential that Codelco is unable to develop on its own. 'We are opening a whole field of exploration that was previously closed to the private-sector mining industry,' Mr Bande said. 'It will also allow Codelco to share the risk of exploration ventures.' Mr Bande did not name the mining companies that had been selected to consider the first four mining prospects. He would only say that they were companies already established in Chile with active exploration projects. They are being invited to bid for risk contracts. Codelco will effectively be a sleeping partner: it will offer its mining properties, while the partner will be responsible for meeting the costs of exploration work. This, Mr Bande said, would give Codelco's partners the right to acquire a share of the mining property if the deposits were judged to be worthy of commercial exploitation. Several mining multinationals in Chile have expressed an interest in teaming up with Codelco for exploration work. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia, which operates the huge La Escondida copper mine in the Atacama desert, recently opened its offices for South America in Santiago. It has earmarked Dollars 3m a year for prospecting projects in Latin America, just under half of which will be spent in Chile. Mr Jose Cabello, BHP's explorations manager, said he hoped his company would be included in Codelco's list of potential partners. Placer Dome and Falconbridge of Canada are also locating their exploration headquarters for Latin America in Santiago, supporting Chile's claim to being the top country for mining exploration in the region.

0,FT932-9438 ,"FT932-9438 _AN-DEMB5AG5FT 930513   FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (4): Exporter will join the importers - Energy shortages loom for an oil-rich country      By VICTOR MALLET      THE INDONESIAN archipelago is famously rich in sources of energy   oil, gas, coal and geothermal and hydroelectric power - but the country faces some hard decisions about where to invest the billions of dollars that will be needed to provide more fuel for its economic development in the next century. Oil exports have financed Indonesia's rapid industrialisation since the 1960s, and Indonesia has been a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries since 1962. But within the next 10 years or so Indonesia is likely to become a net importer of oil as domestic consumption grows and production falls. Latest projections from the central bank in Jakarta show the net current account contribution of oil dropping to Dollars 930m in the 1993/94 financial year from Dollars 2.19bn in 1992/93. Oil output last year fell to about 1.5m barrels a day, six per cent below the level in 1991. In recent years there has been plenty of exploration by the scores of oil companies operating in Indonesia, but few substantial discoveries. Whereas the first wave of contracts awarded in the 1960s and 1970s proved to be remarkably successful - about a dozen out of 55 are still estimated to be profitably producing today - the more recent results have been miserable; of more than 130 contracts agreed since 1976, only one is thought to be both producing and making a profit. 'Clearly the industry has been spectacularly unsuccessful over the last 18 years,' said an oil company executive. It is rare in any oil-producing country to find a foreign oil company which would be so rash as to declare itself satisfied with the profit-sharing conditions of the host government, but there does appear to be a genuine concern about the high costs and low rewards of operating in Indonesia - a concern acknowledged by the government's decision to improve incentives three times in the last five years. The latest round of incentives announced in September last year were aimed principally at encouraging companies to look for gas and to explore for hydrocarbons in deep water and in remote areas, but the response from the oil companies has been unenthusiastic. A few companies closed their offices in Indonesia last year or reduced staff, and others are looking with renewed interest at other prospects in Vietnam, China, India, the Philippines and the former Soviet Union. Existing oil producers want Indonesia to scrap its 'ring-fencing' of production sharing contracts, a change which would allow them to offset costs in new exploration areas against their earnings but would also unfairly disadvantage oil companies without any current production in Indonesia. For Indonesia, the benefits of such a step - which the authorities have shown no sign of taking - would be to promote the search for oil and gas in eastern areas hitherto only thinly explored. With wells in remote, deep water areas costing up to Dollars 30m each, it is hardly surprising that about 80 per cent of exploration at present takes place in existing production areas, mostly in the west. Gas is as crucial as oil to the wellbeing of the Indonesian economy. The country is the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), shipping about Dollars 4bn worth a year to Japan and other countries, and the government is keen to promote domestic use of natural gas to reduce local demand for oil and so free more crude for export. The largest known deposit of gas in Indonesia - and south-east Asia - is the Natuna field in the south China sea. Its size presents both opportunities and problems. Pertamina, the state oil and gas company, and Exxon of the US have yet to finalise terms on developing the giant field, and even when they do they will face daunting technical and financial challenges before being able to make the first LNG shipments eight years later. Natuna, with an estimated 45 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, represents about half of Indonesia's known reserves. But 70 per cent of the corrosive mixture to be extracted from the wells is carbon dioxide, requiring costly separation and re-injection facilities and special corrosion resistant materials. About 700,000 tonnes of steel would be required for the offshore facilities, and the valves and fittings for the treatment platforms would be among the largest available. The total cost of the project is likely to be more than Dollars 16bn. The more mundane business of developing smaller gas deposits for domestic power stations and other consumers is less daunting, but not without its own obstacles; there are at least 79 known fields too small to be exploited for export. Oil companies are sometimes reluctant to admit they have found gas because they fear they will not be able to develop it profitably. The French company Total has made finds off Borneo, which may help to extend the life of Indonesian LNG exports, but some scattered gas deposits found elsewhere years ago have never been developed because they are too small for LNG and too far from domestic consumers to justify the construction of a pipeline. The Indonesian government is struggling to develop a coherent domestic gas distribution policy, but Pertamina is said to be unwilling to give up too much influence to Perum Gas Negara (PGN), the state gas distributor which is expected to develop gas transmission systems. Indonesia has complex bureaucracy as well as complex geology. 'It's becoming urgent because of the high demand,' said a senior PGN official. 'It's very urgent and I hope that this will be fully understood by all the bureaucrats in the government.' Some steps, however, have been taken. After more than a year's delay, a pipeline from an Arco-operated field off east Java is being built to supply a new power station at Gresik near Surabaya. Future projects may include pipelines from south Sumatra gas fields south to energy-hungry west Java and north to the huge Duri field operated by Caltex - to replace oil currently burned in making steam which is injected into the reservoir to heat and lift the heavy crude. Another strategy adopted to conserve oil has been to increase the domestic retail price of fuel - which had been below world prices. Most petroleum product prices were raised by more than 20 per cent in January, and although the authorities are concerned about the inflationary effects of the increase, further rises may follow in coming years to suppress growing demand and promote the use of gas. The man responsible for the sensitive task of directing energy policy is Gen IB Sudjana, who is said to have a background in army logistics and no experience of the oil and gas industry. He was appointed minister of mining and energy in the March cabinet reshuffle. 'It came as a surprise to a lot of people, probably including the minister himself,' said a leading Jakarta businessman. One energy source he can look to with confidence, both for domestic use and for exports, is coal. Production is rising fast following the welcome given to foreign investors in the 1980s. Indonesia has 32bn tonnes of coal and lignite reserves. Exports doubled last year to 15m tonnes. By 1995, Indonesia should be producing 35m tonnes, of which about 21m will be exported. This year, Indonesia is expected to overtake Colombia as the world's fourth largest coal exporter, behind Australia, South Africa and the US.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NON-OIL/GAS EXPORTS (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DESTINATION       1988     1989      1990     1991     1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US                1.98      2.06     2.33     2.70     3.61 EC                2.08      2.40     3.20     3.82     4.59 Japan             2.69      3.64     3.27     3.68     3.

The result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration activities. Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be capitalised and depreciated against eventual production. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house' between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups. Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where it drilled a dry hole. Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a 'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds 11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m. Mr Gourlay said that 'robust' cash inflow from operations of Pounds 26.7m demonstrated Clyde's underlying strength. Clyde hopes to increase production to about 39,000 b/d through development of the North Sea Gryphon field, expected to get government approval by the end of the year. It has also been buoyed by recent discoveries at Rhu, offshore Malaysia, and a new exploration award in Syria. Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending. Analysts do not expect resumed pay-outs until Gryphon is well-established, in 1994 or 1995.

ICRC legal adviser Louise Doswald-Beck told a press  conference that ""civilisation would take a step backwards if it  tolerated such weapons,"" which could blind a person irreversibly  at a distance of one kilometre (1,000 yards).    Presenting a 300 page report of experts engaged by the ICRC  since 1991, Beck said ""the laser weapon is silent, its ray is  invisible and its effect is instantaneous.""    The ICRC wants the weapon banned when the 1980 Geneva  Convention is reviewed at the end of this year.    Doswald-Beck said individual shoulder-fired laser weapons  costing just $100 were already being tested in the United States  and could go into production next year.    The British specialist magazine JANE'S DEFENCE WEEKLY  revealed in 1990 that laser weapons were used by the Royal Navy  against Argentine pilots during the 1982 Falkland War and could  have caused the unexplained crash of three aircraft.    The ICRC also wants much tighter control on the use of anti-  personnel mines which tend to kill more civilians than  combatants.     "

0,FT941-3065 ,"FT941-3065 _AN-ECQDGAGCFT 940317   FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: The glittering prize that was almost overlooked - Kenneth Gooding talks to the British-born lady geologist who in 1972 found Australia's first diamond      By KENNETH GOODING   Companies scrambling to take part in Australia's biggest diamond exploration boom for many years owe a great debt to Ms Maureen Muggeridge. This British-born geologist earned a place in geological history when she found Australia's first diamond in 1972 - before that many experts believed there were no diamonds to be found in the country, despite its huge size, because the geology was wrong. She was also part of the team that seven years later located the Argyle AK1 deposit in the far north of Western Australia, one of the country's most important mineral discoveries and now the world's largest diamond producer, at least in terms of the weight. Ms Muggeridge, now 46, was born in Croydon, near London, and is the niece of the late Mr Malcolm Muggeridge, the eccentric British writer. She spent her childhood in Nigeria and earned her geology degree at St Andrew's University, Glasgow. She recalls she then set out for Australia 'to get some sunshine unquote'. She was given a job by Tanganyika Holdings, which then was the only company seriously exploring for diamonds in Australia, apart from, inevitably, De Beers, the South African group which dominates the industry, via its subsidiary Stockdale. Tanganyika was eventually absorbed by CRA, one of Australia's big mining groups and one capable of finding the large sums required to finance a diamond mine. Ms Muggeridge recalls that the vital clues to the massive Argyle deposit were nearly missed. 'I was a bit pushy and insisted we leave no gaps in the exploration work.' So with only one geologist assistant she set out in a helicopter on what proved to be an immensely profitable sortie for CRA. One consolation was that her assistant on that trip was Mr John Towie, now a director of rival Australian diamond exploration group, Triad Minerals, whom she had then just wed. The 38 diamond grains in the sample they sent back for testing could have fitted easily on the head of a match. Once those traces had been found, however, it was an easy task to trace them back to the Argyle deposit. 'Searching for diamonds is much worse than looking for a needle in a haystack,' says Ms Muggeridge. 'At least you can burn down the haystack and use a metal detector. Success in diamond exploration depends heavily on the expertise of the people involved and, because diamonds and their host rocks are so rare, they are extremely hard to find and a long term approach is an absolute necessity.' For the past five years she has been exploration director of Moonstone Diamond Corporation, which last November raised ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.6m) on the Australian Stock Exchange, enough for two year's exploration work. Ms Muggeridge was among the speakers at the first Australian Diamond Conference here in Perth last week. The standing room only event was one indication of how diamond fever has taken hold in Western Australia. Another came from Mr Michael Thomson of stockbrokers Eyres Reed when he estimated that in the past year diamond exploration companies in Australia had raised at least ADollars 72m. As usual in mining booms, many of the companies involved are as interested in bulling up their share prices as in looking for gem stones. This has led to some unease and complaints, particularly about the way some report their exploration results - so far no set procedures have been fixed for this. At the conference Mr Wolf Marx, convener of the diamond reporting committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, read from a number of recent explorers' reports that left out crucial information such as the value of diamonds found or referred to values or even connotations of value (such as 'gem' or 'near gem') of a small number of diamonds that were potentially misleading. 'Diamond exploration geologists, exploration managers and even chairmen of mining companies are unlikely to have sufficient expertise to give accurate assessments of diamond values,' he explained. 'This is made worse if the stones are micro diamonds which, by definition, cannot be considered to have any value other than scientific.' Delegates cheered up, however, when Mr Chris Jennings, an international explorer associated with the discoveries in the North West Territories that caused Canada's recent diamond rush, said new technical expertise and knowledge justified more exploration in Australia, including in those areas already studied for diamonds. 'Since Argyle there has been no intense exploration in Australia,' he said. 'There are probably big areas where there is some sort of potential for diamonds - I feel confident about it.' Nevertheless, finding those diamonds will not be easy. Mr Yannic Mercier, Geneva-based chairman of Ms Muggeridge's Moonstone Corporation, jokingly told delegates that when he was first invited to invest he replied: 'Setting up a diamond exploration company raises only two questions; how much money you want to lose and how long will you give yourself to lose it'.

Rationale for Not Excluding Recovered Oil That Is Inserted Into the Petroleum Refining Process After Crude Distillation or Catalytic Cracking (i.e., Into a Petroleum Coker)      Today's final rule is narrower in scope than the January 8, 1988 notice in that the Agency is not finalizing the proposed exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke. EPA is deferring the exclusion at this time because EPA lacks data assuring that hazardous constituents from petroleum refining do not end up in the product in quantities that, when such product is utilized as a fuel, could be harmful to human health and the environment. EPA is also concerned that toxic constituents, such as heavy metals, can be discarded by simple incorporation into the coke product. In effect, the product would be used as a disposal medium for toxic constituents, and so could be part of the ``waste disposal problem.'' The Agency also lacks sufficient data to show whether oil recovered from refinery wastewater treatment systems contains toxic metals that are not present in the normal feed to a petroleum coker. Such metals could end up in the coke product.  In contrast, the Agency is excluding recovered oil inserted at or before a point in the refining process designed to remove toxic metal and organic contaminants,     i.e.,     prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. See 50 FR 28725 (July 15, 1985) and 50 FR 49169 (November 29, 1985). As explained there, the distillation process splits the feedstock into fractions based on the differing boiling points of feedstock components. Data submitted by API at that time indicated that most metals concentrate in the heavier petroleum fractions, thereby increasing the probability of contaminant removal from many fuel fractions produced using distillation (and other contaminant-removing processes). See 50 FR 49170.  Although the proposed exclusion of recovered oil that is converted to petroleum coke is not being finalized in today's rule, for different reasons EPA is slightly amending the regulatory exemption at 261.6(a)(3)(vii) (redesignated 261.6(a)(3)(vi) in today's rule) for petroleum coke produced using oil-bearing refinery hazardous waste. The exemption states that such coke is subject to regulation only if it exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste. (The exemption recites the provisions of RCRA section 3004(q)(2)(A).) The purpose of the statute, and the exemption, is to allow petroleum companies to recycle their oily refinery waste to their petroleum coker, without automatically subjecting the coke output to the rules applicable to hazardous waste fuels. (Such automatic effect could occur without the exemption, if listed wastes are being reinserted into the coker, because of the derived-from rule.) S. Rept. No. 298, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. 39 (1983).  Both the statutory and current regulatory exemption, however, are worded so as to apply only to situations where petroleum coke is produced from hazardous wastes ``at the same facility at which such wastes were generated ***''. EPA believes that this limitation is unnecessarily narrow, and does not foreclose a regulatory expansion. In particular, so long as a petroleum refinery is coking its own wastes, it should not matter whether the coker is located at the site where wastes are generated or at a different facility. Since the generator and coker operator remain the same entity (or ``person'', as defined in 260.10) there is sufficient guarantee that hazardous wastes of unknown or uncertain composition will not be used in the coking process, which is the evident concern behind the limitation in the statute. Cf. 50 FR at 28725 (July 15, 1985); 50 FR 49170 (Nov. 29, 1985). Since the hazardous wastes would remain regulated under RCRA when they are generated, transported, and stored prior to recycling,     id.,     potential concerns regarding tracking are also addressed. EPA also sees no difference in the composition of coke produced partially from on-site and off-site hazardous wastes when the coke is produced by the same entity. Consequently, the Agency is slightly broadening the current regulatory exemption so that it applies to coke produced by a single petroleum refining entity, even if the coker is located at a different facility from where the hazardous wastes are generated.  Finally, the coking process itself continues to be exempt from RCRA regulation as a recycling unit, provided this recycling is legitimate. Section 261.6(c)(1) (``The recycling process itself is exempt from regulation except as provided in 261.6(d).''). Today's rule does not affect this provision.      VII. Rationale for Not Excluding Other Oil-Bearing Hazardous Materials      Just as EPA is not excluding oil-bearing wastewaters from the definition of solid waste, it is not excluding other similar types of oil-bearing materials, such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges. These materials are not composed primarily of oil; they are unlike raw materials normally used in the petroleum refining process; and the units in which they are managed"," FR940728-0-00058   FR940728-0-00019        VI.

Rationale for Not Excluding Other Oil-Bearing Hazardous Materials      Just as EPA is not excluding oil-bearing wastewaters from the definition of solid waste, it is not excluding other similar types of oil-bearing materials, such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges. These materials are not composed primarily of oil; they are unlike raw materials normally used in the petroleum refining process; and the units in which they are managed_API separators, DAF units, land treatment units and surface impoundments_are not parts of the refining process, but rather function as waste holding and treatment units. In addition, there have been many damage incidents associated with management of such materials as toxic sludges from wastewater treatment, confirming that these materials are part of the waste disposal problem, rather than part of an on-going manufacturing operation. (See, for example, the Listing Background Documents for Hazardous Wastes K048052 and F037038.) For these reasons, the Agency continues to classify these materials as discarded, within the meaning of RCRA Section 1004 (27). Recovered oil that is obtained from such wastes, however, is excluded from the definition of solid waste under today's final rule (assuming the rule's conditions are satisfied).  The Agency is also aware of various types of units designed to treat wastes K048K052 and F037F038, in order to reduce the volume and toxicity of these wastes, as well as to recover oil. See, e.g., 57 FR 37198 (August 18, 1992). EPA does not view these units as part of the manufacturing (i.e., refining) process, because such units are not part of a continuing series of unit operations that crack/distill/fractionate crude oil. The input to these units are materials such as wastewater treatment sludges, that contain relatively small amounts of oil. A different determination frustrates the Congressional objective that hazardous waste be treated properly. These types of units are the basis for treatment standards under the land disposal restrictions for K048K052 and F037F038. If the sludges treated in these units are no longer hazardous waste, they would not need to be treated by application of BDAT so as to minimize the threats they pose. Cf.     API    , 906 F. 2d at 741742. Thus, excluding such sludges from jurisdiction until properly treated could contribute to the waste disposal problem that Congress sought to remedy. Finally, although EPA is not excluding these types of oil-bearing materials (such as hazardous wastewater treatment sludges), the units in which the recovery of oil is occurring may still be a type of recycling unit, and therefore may be exempt from RCRA permitting requirements under 40 CFR 261.6(c)(1).

Three versions of the petroleum benzin-refining process were  studied: 1) catalytic enrichment; 2) removal of the  70ëC-90ëC benzene fraction from the petroleum benzin for  subsequent enrichment; and 3) removal of the benzene fraction  for petrochemical purposes, removal of the low-boiling through  70ëC (l.b.-70ëC) fraction for subsequent etherification  by C[.sub]1[/]-C[.sub]3[/] monohydric alcohols, and  removal of the 70ëC through catalytic cracking  (70ëC-c.c.) fraction for catalytic enrichment and subsequent  mixing with the l.b.-70ëC fraction after etherification. The  catalytic enrichment was conducted on a consolidated laboratory  unit with a fluidized bed of zeolite-containing catalyst such as  Tseokar-2 at a temperature of 100-120ëC and pressure of  2.5-3 MPa. When petroleum benzin was subjected to catalytic  enrichment under stringent conditions (i.e., at 520ëC), a  yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85 according to the  motor method (98 according to the research method) of 82.9  percent was achieved; however, the said gasoline had a high  aromatic hydrocarbon content (49.2 percent). Under less  stringent conditions (i.e., at 480ëC), the gasoline yield  increased to 87.2 percent and the content of aromatic  hydrocarbons dropped to 37.2 percent (the said gasoline had an  octane number of up to 83.5 according to the motor method and  94.5 according to the research method). Catalytic enrichment of  petroleum benzin without the 70-90ëC fraction resulted in an  84.8 percent yield of gasoline with an octane number of 85  (motor method) and with an aromatic hydrocarbon content of 39  percent. The third version of the process resulted in a 5  percent increase in gasoline yield. The said gasoline had a  reduced aromatic hydrocarbon content and an oxygen-containing  compound content of 2.5-2.6 percent. In addition to boosting  aromatic hydrocarbon production efficiency, the new process flow  also eliminates a number of the problems involved in producing  high-octane fuels.

It will be the first international tender of its kind by Cuba, which has suffered severe oil shortages since the collapse of its preferential trade links with the former Soviet Union. The Cuban state oil company Cubapetroleo (Cupet) announced that the tender inviting bids would be officially presented in Calgary and London on February 10 and 17 respectively. On offer for production sharing contracts were seven onshore and three offshore blocks, with one block straddling land and sea. Foreign oil companies had until August 1 to present their bids. A British company, Simon Petroleum Technology, would help organise the tender. Cupet officials said the blocks were in various parts of the island, including one in the western province of Pinar del Rio and another in south-eastern Granma province. These were areas which were either unexplored or where past exploration data were now out of date, the officials said. A second tender offering more exploration blocks was planned for later. Over the past two years, Cuba has awarded contracts for seven exploration blocks.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P1311  Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Premier Li Peng sent a congratulatory letter  wishing the congress success.    The World Petroleum Congress, an international oil  representative organization, was founded in London, England, in  1933 and has 40 major members from oil producers and consumers.  The World Petroleum Congress, which is held every four years,  has become an important international event that attracts utmost  attention from petroleum companies worldwide. China won the bid  to host the 15th congress in March of 1993 and will host the  grand gathering of worldwide oil industries in Beijing in  October 1997.    In his congratulatory letter, Premier Li Peng said: ""The  World Petroleum Congress is a large-scale and high-level  international scientific conference with wide-ranging topics and  great influence. China is happy to host the 15th World Petroleum  Congress in Beijing. Hosting this congress fully represents the  achievements of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries  in developing oil-related science and technology. I believe  this meeting will strengthen the scientific and cultural  exchanges and cooperation of world petroleum and petrochemical  industries, and it will have a significant and profound bearing  on China's further opening up and promotion of the socialist  modernization.""    Zou Jiahua, vice premier of the State Council, attended the  inaugural meeting and gave an important speech. He said: To  convene the 15th World Petroleum Congress in Beijing is a  significant event for both Beijing Municipality and China,  reflecting that China's petroleum and petrochemical industries  have reached the world's forefront. The continuous and stable  development of China's petroleum and petrochemical industries is  inseparable from acquiring and developing advanced technology.  The World Petroleum Congress provides us a good opportunity to  learn from and conduct exchanges with international  counterparts. Moreover, it will promote further cooperation. He  hoped that all sides concerned would coordinate well with one  another and accomplish various preparatory tasks carefully and  thoroughly to make this congress a success.    Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum  Corporation, will be the chairman of the organizing committee of  the 15th World Petroleum Congress. Speaking at the meeting,  Wang Tao; Sheng Huaren, president of the China National  Petrochemical Corporation; Wang Yan, president of the China  National Offshore Oil Corporation; and Zhang Baifa, executive  vice mayor of Beijing Municipality; said they would make  vigorous efforts to make this congress a success.

0,FT941-1932 ,"FT941-1932 _AN-ECWDJAETFT 940323   FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Clyde Petroleum cuts loss to Pounds 23.4m      By PEGGY HOLLINGER   Clyde Petroleum, the lossmaking oil and gas exploration company, yesterday warned that a return to profitability was uncertain as long as the oil price remained at historically low levels. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said that in a climate of weak oil prices, a return to profit and to the dividend list depended on two main factors: the speed at which Clyde could build up production and the level of exploration write-offs. This latter factor, which writes off unsuccessful exploration as incurred, was 'unpredictable,' said Mr Gourlay. The group was seeking to reduce the exposure to such factors by reining in exploration. Expenditure on new pros-pects was Pounds 18m last year, against Pounds 30m previously. Clyde was further reducing exploration investment to Pounds 10m this year. The group spent Pounds 93.6m on development, against Pounds 17.46m last time. Some Pounds 36m was budgeted for development this year. Clyde reported lower net losses of Pounds 23.4m for the year to December 31, against a Pounds 39.8m deficit last time. Sales were 2 per cent lower at Pounds 81.6m. The company enjoyed a series of one-off gains which helped to reduce losses. These included an Pounds 8.3m fall in exploration costs to Pounds 34m, a tax clawback of Pounds 5m, and lower provisions of Pounds 7.2m (Pounds 11m) on the carrying value of assets. The company also benefited from the hedging of 80 per cent of its production at an Dollars 18 oil price. Some 24 per cent of this year's output was hedged at Dollars 17, Mr Gourlay said. Clyde expected to increase production by 60 per cent this year, largely because of the inclusion for a full year of output from the North Sea Gryphon field. Last year Clyde staged a Pounds 34m rights issue to develop this field. 'At the moment we are disappointed that benefit comes in juxtaposition with a historically low oil price,' Mr Gourlay said. Analysts greeted the results with a certain degree of resignation. Borrowings of Pounds 188.7m, representing 110 per cent of shareholders' funds, remained higher than expected. The group was also not showing a great deal of success in the exploration carried out to date, even though it has been attempting to reduce the risk through farming out interests. As in previous years, there was no dividend. Losses per share were halved to 6.2p. Proven and probable reserves fell by 8 per cent to 164.4m barrels of oil equivalent.

Even though the country was very well-endowed with copper, gold and other minerals, it had been left behind when the rest of the world was experiencing a gold-driven exploration boom. This presented mining companies with 'a window of opportunity which no longer exists in many parts of the world'. The Philippines had missed out mainly because of the political instability associated with President Marcos's removal from power. Mr Robbins said there had been no systematic, grass roots exploration since the early 1970s since when significant advances had been made in technology. He was speaking at a seminar in London on to mining opportunities in the Philippines and organised by the United Nations' Department of Technical Co-operation for Development, and Mining Journal. Mr Robbins said that, despite the lack of recent exploration activity, the country remained among the world's big metals producers, ranking eighth in gold, tenth in copper and sixth in chromite. The country also had deposits of nickel, iron, lead, zinc, platinum, manganese, molybdenum, cobalt, aluminium and mercury. However, although Western Mining was exploring in the Philippines in preference to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, there were disadvantages. Most important was that it was enshrined in the constitution that Filipino companies had to be 60 per cent domestically-owned. 'The result is that in the Philippines the foreign investor has to carry all the risk and all the costs and only receive 40 per cent of the prize if the exploration is successful,' he said. However, a strong body of responsible opinion in the country recognised the detrimental impact of the ownership rule and he hoped the new government would change it after the May elections.

0,FT921-13091 ,"FT921-13091 _AN-CAWAWACVFT 920123   FT  23 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chorus of disbelief greets Mexican oil reserves claim - Industry experts agree the official figure is twice as high as it should be      By DAMIAN FRASER   PEMEX, MEXICO'S giant oil monopoly, is no stranger to criticism. But rarely can it have been as hard to take as when the company's former vice-president for exploration and production accused the company late last year of 'perfectly consciously' lying about it reserves, recording them at above double actual levels. Mr Francisco Inguanzo, who had been vice-president of Pemex's exploration and production from 1964 to 1976, claimed in an interview with the news magazine Proceso to have been commissioned in 1988 by the director of Pemex to write a report on Mexico's reserves. After eight-month of study he put Mexico's reserves at just 33.1bn barrels, subsequently reduced to 29.9bn barrels for December 1991, compared with the official estimate of current reserves of 65.5bn barrels. Mr Inguanzo's findings, while denied strenuously by Pemex, are supported by almost all other independent studies. As is shown in the accompanying table, drawn up by Mr George Baker of the University of California, Los Angeles, all but one study reckons Pemex's crude reserves are between 20bn and 30bn barrels. Pemex's figure of 65.5bn barrels includes the crude equivalent of natural gas and condensates reserves. The figure that appears to support Pemex, by the US Geological Survey refers to 'identified reserves'. This includes undiscovered reserves - which are not proven. The differences between the Pemex estimates and all the others depend in part on the classification of the huge Chicontepec field. According to official Pemex figures, the field holds 10.9bn barrels of crude oil and 6.7bn of oil equilavent, or 25 per cent of proven reserves. Pemex is not producing oil from this area, never has, and has no plans to do so in the future - and thus, according to Dr Charles Masters of the Geological Survey, Chicontepec should not count it as a proven reserve under internationally accepted standards. Pemex says it is sufficient that Chicontepec could in theory be profitably exploited. But even this is by no means certain. According to those questioned it is extremely doubtful. Mr Inguanzo, said that if Mexico was an honest country even the most unqualified engineer in Pemex would conclude that the figures for Chicontepec were 'ridiculous'. Mr Joseph Riva, a geologist at the Congressional Research Service in the US says: 'Chicontepec may never make economic sense', because the field is not uniform, and thus would require 20,000 small wells to extract all the oil. Dr Masters, who after much heart-searching finally included Chicontepec as an identifiable reserve last year, said: 'I have always had the idea that Chicontepec never is going to be used. It is not a proven researve by any means at all'. The field, he says, is 'very irregular' and 'will be a very difficult thing to produce'. The Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company, in a study commissioned by the US Department of Energy in 1990 concluded that 'the 11 per cent recovery factor used by Pemex (for Chicontepec) far exceeds the established practice for that kind of geology', and assumes a recovery factor of just 5 per cent. The difference between Pemex and independent experts does not just depend on interpreting Chicontepec. Mr Inguanzo's estimate for Pemex's oil and equivalent is a full 35.6bn barrels less than the company's, and only half the difference can be explained by Chicontepec's exclusion. Mr Inguanzo is not specific about where the other differences lie and in a detailed analysis of the Proceso interview, Mr Baker concludes that Mr Inguanzo may be referring to reserves that are supported by current production, rather than future production. Still, there is agreement among those interviewed that the number of wildcats made by Pemex in the late 1970s is not consistent with the huge increase in reserves at this time. Mexico's reserves figure jumped from 16bn in December 1976 to 72.5 bn in 1982. Mr Riva, who puts Pemex's crude reserves at 26.4bn barrels, concurs. 'I was always giving Pemex the benefit of the doubt,' he says. 'If this engineer (Mr Inguanzo) says 21bn barrels, I believe him'. Furthermore, Mr Inguanzo claims that subsequent excessive drilling has lead to a loss of water pressure in many wells, and damaged productivity. The Petroleum Finance Corporation says independent estimates of reserves in the off-shore Campeche zone are lower than Pemex's because of a sharp pressure drop in wells occasioned by a lack of water injection in drilling. None of these engineers or geologists deny that Mexico is rich in oil. Pemex's daily production is 2.7m barrels a day, or about 1bn barrels a year. It is thus, by the worse estimate of its reserves, operating at a production to reserves ratio of 21 to 1, double that of the US. Further there is a general consensus that much more oil lies undiscovered - another 35bn to 40bn barrels, Mr Riva believes. Mr Bernie Picci, an oil analyst at Salomon Brothers in New York says 'vast areas of Mexico have not been touched which are thought by statistical extrapolation to have large amounts of oil'. But bringing these undiscovered reserves to the surface is going to require money (and in the deep sea areas expertise) that Pemex does not have. As it is, Pemex will probably have to spend at least Dollars 2bn a year to maintain exports at current levels of 1.3m barrels a day. (Production is split equally between exports and domestic use. But with domestic demand increasing by 10 per cent a year, Mexico will become a net importer in 7 years unless production rises). Strapped for cash, and with reserves falling, the Mexican government will find it increasingly tempting to drop the constitutional ban on foreign companies wild-catting for oil. Mr Inguanzo's revelations, by showing that Mexico is not as rich in oil as many Mexicans thought, may hasten that day.  ------------------------------------------------------- ESTIMATES FOR PEMEX RESERVES (billion barrels)  -------------------------------------------------------              Crude             Total                oil         petroleum                        equivalent(a)  ------------------------------------------------------- Pemex         44.6          65.5 USGS(b)       44.9         (66.2) Riva          26.4         (41.7) Inguanzo     (20.9)         29.9 Baker         22.9          38.1 PFC           32.5  ------------------------------------------------------- Sources: George Baker and Mexican Policy News.  ------------------------------------------------------- (a) At Pemex conversion rate, which is more favourable than the standard US rate.

'The pressure from Britain is there, but we think it is being overcome,' Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, told a radio interviewer. 'We hope it will not succeed.' He was commenting on a report in the daily Clarin which said London was pressing Washington to ban the sale of advanced radar to equip three dozen ageing Skyhawk fighter aircraft. Mr Oscar Camilion, the defence minister, made similar charges in a separate radio interview, blaming London for what he described as US reluctance to allow Argentina to purchase the radar together with the aircraft. 'The objections are coming from the US State Department. . . this is apparently due to British pressure,' he said. The British embassy in Buenos Aires declined to comment. Argentina is buying the Skyhawks from the US to replenish its forces, decimated during the 1982 conflict with Britain over the Falkland islands.

The result was after a write-off of Pounds 7.9m from unsuccessful exploration activities. Net profits for the first half of 1991 were Pounds 6.3m. However, the company decided from this year to write off the cost of failed exploration immediately on its profit and loss account, to give a fairer representation of its financial position. Successful exploration will continue to be capitalised and depreciated against eventual production. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said this was a 'half-way house' between full cost accounting, common among smaller oil companies, and successful efforts accounting, used by leading groups. Clyde wrote off the Pounds 7.9m costs of the withdrawal from Myanmar, where it drilled a dry hole. Mr Gourlay said earnings were in line with expectations given a 'historically low' oil price of Pounds 10.59 per barrel, down from Pounds 11.38 in 1991. Although production increased from 23,651 to 26,170 barrels of oil equivalent a day, turnover fell from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 43.7m. Losses per share came through at 1.7p (2p earnings). Clyde confirmed it was suspending dividends to allow increased exploration spending.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

Some IPounds 27m of the losses, or 90 per cent, are the result of the disposal last August of the company's Colombian oilfield interests to Coplex Resources, an Australian exploration company, for IPounds 5.6m in a cash and share deal. Mr Duncan McGregor, who recently replaced Mr Neil O'Donoghue as Tuskar's chairman, explained that the loss was due to deferred exploration expenditure in the Rubiales oilfield in Colombia which had been held in the books. That loss was realised upon disposal of the field to Coplex, he said. In its 1991 annual report, the company reported a total of IPounds 29.5m deferred expenditure relating to its Colombian exploration licences. A further IPounds 1.23m has been written off in exploration expenditure, primarily in the UK and Turkey and there was a IPounds 1.29m loss on the sale of its investment in Tuskar (Texas). In April this year, Tuskar entered into a share-swap deal with Coplex to dispose of 54 per cent of its Colombian acreage, following a takeover bid by Coplex. The bid was rejected by shareholders, and led to the revised deal under which all of Tuskar's interests in the Piriales field were sold in August to Coplex. The company's shares, which trade on the USM, were then suspended at 1p. Losses per share increased to 11.71p (4.06p).  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

Unacceptable substitutes"," FR940318-0-00205   FR940318-0-00023        Radiation curing is a production technique for drying and curing adhesives with   radiant energy in the form of ultraviolet (UV) or infrared (IR) light, electron beams (EB), and   gamma or x-rays. The binding agents that can be cured with radiant energy are acrylics,   epoxies, urethanes, anaerobic adhesives, and polyester resins. In many cases, if the materials   are either heat sensitive or opaque, radiation curing cannot be employed.     Radiation-dried coatings are applied as either a powder or as a high-solids form and   dried using the same radiant energy forms as used in radiation-cured adhesives. The binder   systems that can be dried with radiant energy are also similar. In cases where the radiant   energy is harmful to a component, such as sensitive electronic equipment, radiant-dried   coating cannot be employed.     Moisture-cured, chemical-cured, and reactive liquid adhesives are still not widely used   because they are still being developed or because performance or application problems still   have to be addressed. They will not be widely commercially available for several years.         3. Comment Response         a.     Acceptable substitutes.       It was suggested that the acceptable substitutes cited for MCF could also be extended   to other ozone-depleting solvents, such as CFC113. Depending on the specific application,   EPA believes that it is probable that the same substitutes would apply and has addressed such   substitutes as appropriate.

EPA agrees and believes that ``Oxygenated organic solvent'' is more   specific. This phrase was substituted in the final rule.     b.     Unacceptable substitutes_no comments received.       c.     Pending substitutes.       One commenter suggested that other chlorinated solvents, glycol ethers, glycol ether   acetates and N-methyl pyrollidone be forbidden as substitutes. EPA believes that when used   as directed and within the specified controls, these substances are safe alternative processes.     d.     Other related issues_    One commenter stated that ``coatings'' needs to   be clarified to mean paint type coatings and not other coatings such as lubricants and mold   releases. The phrase coatings is defined in the overview section to mean durable and   decorative coatings such as paint to clarify this application.     4. Preliminary Listing Decisions     a.     Acceptable substitutes.       (1) Solvent substitutes.   (a) Petroleum distillates.   Petroleum hydrocarbons are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives, coatings, and   inks. The principal concern with these substitutes is over risk to workers during manufacture   and use of the alternative solvent. However, the Agency's analysis of these alternatives   indicated that risks from use of petroleum hydrocarbons are well understood and already   subject to necessary controls. For instance, although these solvents are flammable, industry   has a good record of safe use of these substitutes. Additionally, certain of the petroleum   hydrocarbons, for example n-hexane, have low Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs), but the   Agency's survey of exposures in the workplace found that these levels can successfully be   attained if adequate ventilation and appropriate work practices are implemented.     The Agency's analysis of the potential for risks to residents in nearby communities did   indicate the potential for adverse effects near a site with industrial use of petroleum   hydrocarbons if a relatively toxic petroleum hydrocarbon is used. However, the Agency does   not believe that the risk screen describes the true risk presented by these chemicals. First, the   agency has determined that petroleum hydrocarbons used in this sector are rarely as toxic as   n-hexane. Second, the screen used as past MCF emissions as a proxy for emissions of n-hexane. This approach does not account for other regulatory controls, such as VOC controls,   that limit emissions of hydrocarbons from industrial sites, and would consequently also serve   to lower any other health risks to the general population from these chemicals.     For this reason, the Agency believes that petroleum hydrocarbons merit use as   substitutes, although it encourages manufacturers to formulate products where possible with   compounds with lowest inherent toxicity.     (b) Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters.   Alcohols, ketones, ethers and esters are acceptable substitutes for MCF in adhesives,   coatings, and inks. The concerns for use of these solvents parallel the concerns associated   with petroleum hydrocarbons. In this case, two of the typical oxygenated hydrocarbons   examined in the Agency's risk screen, methyl ethyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone, also   have comparatively low toxicity. For the same reasons described in the section on petroleum   distillates, the Agency is approving these compounds as substitutes for MCF. This approval   also includes the same guidance to manufacturers_to select chemicals for product   formulations with lowest inherent toxicity.     (c) Chlorinated solvents.   Perchloroethylene, methylene chloride and trichloroethylene are acceptable substitutes   for adhesives, coatings, and inks. Use of these solvents merit special caution, since they are   suspected human carcinogens. However, as with other solvents, the Agency's risk screen   indicates that proper workplace practices significantly reduce risks in occupational settings.   The Agency's examination of risks to the general population determined the highest potential   for adverse effects to be associated with use of trichloroethylene, since it has the greatest   cancer potency. Clearly there is a need for further assessment of the hazards from use of this   chemical, and the Agency notes that authorities exist to address any risks determined from   such analyses under Title III of the Clean Air Act. Title III lists all three of the chlorinated   solvents as Hazardous Air Pollutants, and mandates development of Maximum Achievable   Control Technology standards to control emissions of these chemicals in various industrial   settings.

The Virginia-based oil company said it had received a licence from the Treasury Department to take part in the exploration of the Blue Dragon block, off the coast of Vietnam. However, under current US regulations Mobil would not be able to take part in any future production from the field. Mobil said it hoped US restrictions would be relaxed further in future. If not, it would have to dispose of its interest should the field prove commercially attractive. Mobil's 50 per cent interest in a consortium formed to explore the area, alongside three Japanese companies, follows the oil group's involvement in Vietnam in the early 1970s. At that time it conducted the exploratory drilling in the White Tiger field, a moderately sized off-shore development which is now the Vietnam's only oil-producing field. Vietnam's award of the exploration contract to the Mobil consortium, and the US's decision to grant a licence, comes at a time when US energy groups are investing heavily overseas in search of large-scale finds to replace their dwindling US reserves.

Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the United States. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year. In the first nine months of this year, Amoco's net income was Dollars 222m, against Dollars 1.33bn in the same period of last year.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "
0,FT934-2581 ,"FT934-2581 _AN-DLMDEAEGFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): From China to Mexico - Explorers target new and old territories      By ROBERT CORZINE   The Tarim basin in northwest China, the Caspian Sea and Azerbaijan are among the exotic locations which have drawn the attention of the world's oil and gas companies during the past year as they seek to secure new reserves for the 21st century. They and dozens of other remote areas figure prominently in the 'frontier strategies' under which a growing number of companies are ranging beyond their traditional operating areas. But the focus on trying to find very large oil and gas fields in frontier areas has diverted attention from a surge of renewed interest in mature regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Advances in both exploration and production technology combined with the desire to maximise the heavy investment in the infrastructure of such areas is driving the trend. It has been most evident in the past year in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil production began more than 40 years ago. Exploration of the area dropped sharply in the late 1980s as some of the bigger companies began to look abroad for new reserves. But buoyant US natural gas prices have attracted a large number of independent companies to the region. Their success rate has been enhanced by their ability to gain relatively cheap access to three-dimensional seismic data. This technique, combined with the much greater power of the latest generation of computers, has enabled geologists to 'see' through structures such as salt domes. These structures had blocked views derived from the earlier two-dimensional seismic techniques. The new seismic technology has also helped in the discovery of smaller satellite fields close to existing platforms. Many of these can then be tapped by horizontal drilling from an existing platform. The technique can reach reservoirs as far away as 6km, eliminating in many cases the need and cost of building a new platform. Other new technology, such as tension leg platforms, is allowing companies to move into deeper water. The Mars field, described by Shell and British Petroleum as the largest discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the past 20 years, lies in 2,933 feet of water. Technology has also played a key role in maintaining production in the North Sea where early fields such as Ekofisk, off Norway, and Brent and Forties in the UK are being re-engineered to prolong their production life. The re-engineering of the Brent field, the UK's largest oil producer, by Shell and Esso, includes a shift in emphasis to gas production. The work, which will cost Pounds 1.3bn and take five years to complete, will add 10 years to the field's production life. Mr John Browne, managing director of BP Exploration, believes the life of North Sea production could extend well into the next century 'even if prices never rise again in real terms'. He says that new technology could push recovery rates as high as 70 per cent of reserves within 20 years, compared with the 50-55 per cent achieved in only a few fields at present. Companies are only now beginning to realise the full scope for cost reductions in the North Sea. The UK Offshore Operators Association, whose membership includes all 36 companies producing oil and gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, believes savings of up to 30 per cent in capital costs of offshore platforms could be made if more attention was given to standardisation of designs and equipment. A recent report contained a series of recommendations detailing new codes and practices. It predicted that substantial cost savings were possible within two or three years if the basic proposals were implemented. Mr Browne believes that a 30 per cent cut in capital costs and a 50 per cent cut in operating costs over the next 20 years 'could raise the total volume recoverable from the North Sea by 25 per cent - from around 60bn barrels of oil equivalent to around 75bn'. The way in which technology and higher productivity can prolong the life of mature areas is unlikely, however, to lead to any sharp falloff in oil company interest in frontier areas. But their sheer distance from the world's main markets and lack of local infrastructure make them a long-term proposition. China's Tarim basin, for example, is 2,500 miles from the coast. Studies suggest it could cost as much as Dollars 6 to move a barrel of oil through a proposed pipeline to China's main markets. A similar level of transportation charges is likely in other promising but landlocked areas, such as Kazakhstan. The political uncertainty surrounding the future of such countries and the need to move oil or gas across sometimes unfriendly borders complicates their development, even if the per barrel cost of producing oil or gas is attractive. The growing competition among countries for foreign investment to help develop their petroleum resources is also likely to exert a strong influence on where oil companies look next. Much of the interest in the world's more remote areas can be traced to the withdrawal or exclusion of many western oil companies from Middle Eastern and Latin American countries as a result of nationalisation. There is no prospect that the old concession system in the Middle East will be revived, but some of the barriers to western oil companies in the region are being lowered. There were reports this year that Kuwait was discussing exploration prospects with western companies, while French companies in particular are positioning themselves to take advantage of opportunities in Iraq once United Nations sanctions are lifted. The prospect that western oil companies could become more deeply involved in the Middle East in years to come has been boosted by the fact that many countries in the region cannot afford to develop on their own the new reserves needed to maintain, let alone enlarge, their capacity. The relatively low cost of much oil in the area has obvious appeal to western companies, but the political risks of the region remain relatively high despite the peace agreement between Palestinians and the Israelis.

The exploration, jointly undertaken by China National  Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOC) and Texaco, of the United  States, started at the end of March, according to a spokesman  from CNOC.    The Sino-U.S. team completed a seismic survey 100 meters  down, despite harsh weather conditions at the sea.    The East China Sea Oil Exploration Project is a new frontier  for the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in 750,000  square km of sea. Before this, China had independently  conducted seismic surveys in 150,000 square km since 1979 and  drilled five experimental wells, four of which have shown  excellent oil prospects. About 1,000 oil-bearing structures  have also been found.    To speed up the development of oil exploration in the East  China Sea, China conducted the Fourth International Invitation  for bids for 20 locations in 72,800 square km of sea from June  1992 to June 1993. Some 73 companies from 19 countries competed  for the projects and 15 oil exploration companies from seven  countries succeeded in the bidding, with the total risk  investment of 300 million U.S. dollars.    The successful end of this phase of prospecting in the  contracted area will provide scientific basis for the upcoming  drilling of the first well this October, the spokesman said.    About 21 experimental wells are expected to be drilled by  the  end of 1996.     "

Today he will meet with the leadership of Azerbaijan.  Questions of cooperation in oil exploration, and specifically  AMOCO's participation in the oil field exploration in the  Caspian will be discussed during the sessions.    More than three years have passed since the Azeri Government  declared its in?ent to begin exploration of oil fields with  participation of foreign companies. But political instability  and the frequent change in political regimes prevented the  signing of the contracts.    A representative of one of the oil companies told TURAN that  a few weeks ago the members of the oil consortium appealed to  the Azeri Government for a final answer concerning the contract.  Also, it became known that the companies have given an  ultimatum: They will leave Azerbaijan should if they do not  have a clear answer by that spring. [sentence as received]    A few days ago, Tim Hartnet, AMOCO's representative in Baku  told TURAN that ""we are on the eve of signing a contract. We  think it will be signed in the near future.""    The so-called ""Russian factor"" prevents an earlier signing  of  the contract. Russia, which has neither technology nor capital  to offer Azerbaijan, nevertheless wants to participate in the  distribution of Azeri oil. In November 1993, after the most  recent successful offensive of t?e Armenian army, President  Geydar Aliyev invited R?ssian Secretary for Energy Yuriy  Shafranik to Baku to sign an agreement allowing Russian  participation in exploration of Azeri oil fields. Baku agreed  to give 10 percent of Azerbaijan's s?are in the exploration  project of the Azeri-Chirag oil field to the Russian LUKOIL  company.    This gave Azerbaijan a needed break at the front. But the  planned December final signing of the contract with LUKOIL did  not take place.    At this time, Aliyev visited Paris where he proposed to  President Mitterrand that France use its capital in  reinvigorating the Azerbaijani economy. At present,  representatives of the French Elf oil company is looking into  possibilities for participation in the exploration of Azeri oil.  Meanwhile, AZADLIG newspaper writes, citing the well-informed  sources, that a massive transportation of arms and ammunition  from Russia to Armenia is taking place with the intent of  further transport to Karabakh. Evidently, on the eve of the  signing the contract with the Western oil consortium, the world  will soon hear about the next large-scale offensive by the  Armenian Army into Azerbaijani territory.

Egypt has advised all international oil companies that Sudan has no authority to sign exploration agreements for acreage north of their 'political' boundary delineated by latitude 22 degrees north under an 1899 treaty. Egypt was reacting to an agreement signed last month between Sudan and the Canadian-registered International Petroleum Corporation for seismic work in waters north of 22 degrees in an area Egypt claims as sovereign territory. Sudan, however, believes an 'administrative' boundary, agreed in 1902, which runs north of the political boundary, entitles it to allow exploration north of 22 degrees. The dispute could hardly come at a more awkward moment, with relations between moderate rulers in Cairo and the Islamicist-dominated military regime in Sudan under severe strain. It also coincides with reports of recent troubles between Egyptian and Sudanese patrols in the triangle formed by the 'political' and 'administrative' boundaries. The 'political' boundary came into effect with the Anglo-Egyptian condominium agreement of 1899. It was followed three years later by an amendment that gave Sudan administrative responsibility for tribes north of 1899 boundary in the east. Egypt was given responsibility for a small section south of the line about half-way between the Red Sea coast and the Nile. It is unclear whether the 'political' or 'administrative' boundaries have international boundary status. This issue may in the end require international jurisdiction. In the meantime Egypt, which is keen to promote offshore exploration in the Red Sea, is offering a large block which runs south to its 'political' boundary with Sudan, and in fact includes acreage targeted for exploration by International Petroleum. In Geneva, International Petroleum said it was planning to go ahead with its seismic survey in its 10,000 square kilometre Halaib block. A spokesman said that until the Egyptians had complained he had not been aware that the area was in dispute. Egypt, through its embassy in Ottawa, informed the Canadian government, and through it International Petroleum, that it regarded exploration in waters off the area under dispute latitude as 'illegal.' In Cairo, a spokesman for the Canadian embassy said the issue was under discussion with both Egypt and Sudan. He said the Sudanese were insisting they had a right to enter into exploration a greements for areas in their 'administrative' zone.  The Financial Times   London Page 4 Map (Omitted).  "

Nine companies are listed in the RTZ group, including CRA of Australia, which budgeted Dollars 86m exploration spending for last year. Other big exploration spenders last year included Canada's Noranda, with a budgeted Falconbridge) and the 11 companies knit into the combine comprised of MIM, Asarco, Cominco, Teck and Metallgesellschaft,which between them expected to spend Dollars 125m. Placer Dome budgeted to spend Dollars 60m, as did the Anglovaal group.

MEG says the Hanson conglomerate's US gold subsidiary, Gold Fields Mining Corporation, expected to maintain its exploration budget at Dollars 17m. The survey covered 153 mining companies with annual exploration budgets of more than Dollars 1m. MEG estimates these accounted for 80 per cent of all worldwide spending on non-ferrous metals exploration (the survey excludes iron ore, bauxite, coal or oil and gas exploration). It says there was an 8 per cent fall in expenditure by the companies surveyed compared with 1990. Of the Dollars 1.8bn total, Dollars 430m was directed to projects in Canada, Dollars 353m to Australia and Dollars 341m to the US. MEG points out that, although it is still attracting most spending, Canada's exploration level has fallen sharply from 1987 and 1988 when favourable tax treatment for investors boosted spending to more than Dollars 1bn in each year. US expenditures have remained relatively stable but Australian spending has fallen steadily since 1987. Rough estimates put spending in South Africa at Dollars 245m, in South America at Dollars 200m, the south Pacific region at Dollars 125m, Europe at Dollars 80m and Africa outside South Africa at Dollars 70m. Gold exploration attracted more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of total spending while base metals exploration, having recovered from the depressed levels of the mid-1980s, accounted for 31 per cent.

According to sector businessmen, ever since the Economy  Ministry made the decision to freeze fuel prices, they have been  registering losses amounting in the millions.    Augusto Gigerbaud, manager of Distribuidora de Productos  Derivados del Petroleo (DIPPSA) [a petroleum byproducts  distributing company], has said if government officials do not  reply to them within the next 48 hours, fuel rationing will  commence nationwide beginning 6 June.    They Demand the Government Take Measures    Gigerbaud has added they can no longer register such losses;  therefore, it is necessary for the government to take immediate  and extreme measures. Either our cost of the product is taken  into consideration, or they must sacrifice their profit margin,  he has said.    As to the freezing of fuel prices, the businessman has  termed  the measure as arbitrary and dangerous, due to the repercussions  that could adversely affect importing companies.    Gigerbaud has reiterated the measure is arbitrary, because  whenever the government has asked us to make a sacrifice or  help, we have agreed to do so.    In this regard, the businessman has said that before  President Carlos Roberto Reina made his presentation via  television to mark his first 100 days in office, a member of his  economic cabinet had called them three days before requesting  that fuel prices not be increased.    Gigerbaud has said they are often asked to do this type of  favor, and this is why they consider it unjust for the  government not to make the correct decision, thereby creating a  crisis.    Texaco and Esso Will Join    The DIPPSA manager has said he is certain the multinational  companies Esso and Texaco will also agree not to continue  importing petroleum and to initiate rationing.    They cannot continue to support losses in the millions, as  it  is occurring with us, because these losses already total in the  millions, the businessman has said.    EL PERIODICO has wanted to find out the opinion of the  representatives of the multinationals, but the security  personnel of both companies only stated the executives did not  want to disclose any information, adding they had been ordered  not to allow any members of the media inside the installations.    The Government Does Not Know How To Handle the Petroleum  Sector    Meanwhile, Henry Arevalo, DIPPSA executive president, has  said that by freezing the prices of petroleum byproducts the  government is demonstrating it does not have the capability to  handle the petroleum sector. It has changed its petroleum  policy several times within two months    A Crisis Draws Near    According to Arevalo, these measures demand too much a  sacrifice from them, cornering them to the extent they can no  longer support these losses. Thus, the companies can no longer  export petroleum. [sentence as published]    Arevalo has warned that if the situation persists, a large  crisis could be created in the fuel supply, and the government  would be solely responsible for not taking the correct measures.    He has said if additional purchases of petroleum abroad are  not confirmed within the next three days, they will have to  start rationing to stretch their inventories. Consequently,  alarming situations will be produced.    Arevalo has reiterated that, until the government assumes  its  responsibility, they will no longer continue to import fuel.  This would force the public sector in turn to supply the demand  for which it does not have the capability.    The businessman has explained they do not wish to cause  additional problems for the current administration; to the  contrary, they would like to cooperate in every way possible so  as not to adversely affect the community.    The only thing at which the government measure is aimed is  not allowing them to recover their investment in importing  petroleum. To recover the investment, fuel prices must be  deregulated, because the value of this sector on the  international market continues to rise, Arevalo has said.    In conclusion, the businessman has said the government's  problem is ""it starts to look for medicine when the patient is  already in a coma.""    [Tegucigalpa EL PERIODICO in Spanish on 4 June 94 on page 1,  in a similar item, adds: ""Economy Minister Delmer Urbizo Pating  has warned the government will not negotiate anything under  pressure, given the importers' decision not to continue the  supplying of fuel. The minister has added that based on advice  from a consultant of the World Bank, the price of fuel will be  negotiated with the petroleum importers.""]     "

Despite defeat in the 1982 conflict, Argentina never surrendered its claim to the islands. Today, it is continuing the struggle by economic warfare, rather than by force of arms. Just before Christmas, after fishing talks with Britain, Argentina said it would start selling fishing licences of its own, breaking the islands' lucrative fishing monopoly. The Falklands began issuing licences in 1987, mainly to squid-fishing ships from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. After knowing only hardship and austerity, the islanders were soon taking in more than Pounds 20m a year in licence fees, making them some of the wealthiest people on earth. The illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the South Atlantic's most lucrative species. Already, Argentina has attracted most of the Falklands' best customers by offering 45 cut-price, three-year licences, valid for an extended fishing season. Mr John Barton, the Falklands' director of fisheries, says that 'the impact is pretty dramatic'. Last year, he sold between 140 and 150 licences, half of them to Japanese vessels. Argentina has however sold all its licences to Japanese ships that used to fish in Falklands waters. The islanders always knew that Argentina would eventually break their monopoly. The only surprise was the time it took. For years after the war, Argentina would not even negotiate with Britain. As it was, nationalistic laws banned foreigners from fishing in its waters, even though the small local industry showed little interest in the South Atlantic. All this changed with the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990. Argentina recognised the Falklands' fishery conservation zones and the two sides started swapping data and controlling illegal fishing. Last October, Argentina changed its laws to allow foreign ships into its waters, as required under a USDollars 1bn five-year fishing agreement with the European Community. From there, it was only a short step to selling squid licences, which had the attraction of depriving the islands of revenue while increasing Argentina's. Mr Guido di Tella, Argentina's Foreign Minister, says: 'The bonanza is over. The islanders can look back to the past wistfully, but the future will be different'. He says Argentina will press its rights to the full in future negotiations about a medium and long term fishery arrangement. If the talks become deadlocked, he will appeal to international arbitration, which he says will favour Argentina. Mr Barton fears Argentina could allow over-fishing in its waters to cut the islands' income instead of co-operating to conserve the illex. 'I am not terribly optimistic,' he says. 'If everyone was working on a conservation basis, it would be relatively straightforward to ensure long-term sustainability.' He says that Argentina's political stance makes 'it very difficult to see eye to eye on very simple things'. Mr Hurd underlined the Falklanders fears this week and warned Argentina against using the illex as a 'political toy'. British officials doubt, moreover, that Argentina can police its waters or monitor fish stocks adequately. The illex has a one-year life cycle, so overfishing could wipe it out forever. Mr Barton says the Falklands have an outstanding record on conservation. He has restricted licence sales to prevent overfishing - and to avoid glutting the squid market, which would eventually lower the Falklands' licence revenues. He even hints that a 'squid war' could be in the offing. 'We will have to look at how to make things more attractive for ships to fish in the Falklands,' he says. 'But we see no long term winners. If we take the moral high ground, Argentina could devastate the resource and we would not even see any revenue.' Argentine diplomats dismiss the Falklands' conservation policies. One official accused them of 'depredation' and presenting 'data that is just not serious'. He said Argentina was only taking its fair share of a common resource. The claims and counter-claims are part of the cut and thrust of negotiations and the Argentines are bound to use the squid dispute to press for compromises on issues such as oil exploration. Argentina's ultimate objective is to negotiate the islands' sovereignty - which London refuses even to discuss. Argentina says it wants to 'recover' the Falklands by winning over the islanders' hearts and minds. Distrust of the Argentines runs deep, and Argentina's squid strategy will do nothing to persuade the islanders of its good intentions.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The government is repealing an oil recovery duty imposed five years ago, and is increasing the rate of its petroleum profits tax from 45 per cent to 50 per cent. Under the recovery duty, oil companies paid rates of 1 per cent if their taxable income was below Dollars 5m a year, 2 per cent on income between Dollars 5m and Dollars 15m, and 3 per cent on income in excess of Dollars 15m. According to Mr Wendell Mottley, the finance minister, the change in the legislation will cost the country about Dollars 35m this year. He said, however, that this loss was a sacrifice for the longer term benefit to the country in anticipated increased investment in the petroleum sector. He said the government intended to provide incentives 'for increasing activity in the petroleum sector, particularly activity which will help to arrest the declining trend of production'. The country needed to attract major oil companies which would be willing to drill to depths of 20,000 feet if necessary, the minister said. 'At that depth we are looking at costs of Dollars 20m per well, and such capital is not available to our small companies.' Trinidad and Tobago's crude oil production has fallen steadily from an average of 168,999 barrels a day in 1986 to an average of 138,900 b/d in the first half of this year. The country's petroleum sector is to benefit from a Dollars 411m project for secondary oil recovery and refinery expansion, which is being financed by the Inter-American Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, the European Investment Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the state-owned oil company.

If Argentina were to gain sovereignty from the UK, he might offer cash to any of the 2,100 Falklanders who didn't want to stay. 'It's one of many issues under consideration . . . don't forget that Alaska was bought from Russia,' says Menem. It was indeed, in 1867, for Dollars 7.2m. Given there's strong evidence of black gold reserves round the islands, what price has he in mind? Meanwhile, his brother Eduardo, president of the Argentine senate, has popped across to the UK. Today he watches the Duke of Edinburgh unveil a monument to Argentine general Jose de San Martin, liberator of Argentina, Chile and Peru from the Spanish yoke, who also lived in London. Eduardo - the most senior Argentine official to visit the UK since the resumption of diplomatic relations in 1990 - is also getting lunch from Douglas Hurd. His schedule includes meetings with other UK government ministers - those who are left, anyway - but oddly enough, not John Major. Maybe some deal could be done whereby the islanders are temporarily housed in the Ritz in Paris, in exchange for which the Menems negotiate a truce between The Guardian newspaper and the Tories?

Date of Filing: October 25, 1994        Case Number: VEF0003             December 12, 1994.              On October 25, 1994 the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the Department of Energy (DOE) filed a Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA), to distribute $10,700,000 remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration  Production Co. (collectively referred to as ``Murphy''), pursuant to the Consent Order entered into between Murphy and the DOE on July 15, 1994. In accordance with the procedural regulations codified at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V (Subpart V), the ERA requests in its Petition that the OHA establish special procedures to make refunds in order to remedy the effects of alleged regulatory violations which were resolved by the present Consent Order. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's plan to distribute these funds.            I. Background            Murphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oil and a full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federal price controls. As such, it was subject to the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During that time, the ERA conducted an extensive audit of Murphy and issued an issue letter to Murphy on September 29, 1976. ERA issued a Notice of Probable Violation to Murphy on January 28, 1981. ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986, which Murphy contested before the OHA.        On February 9, 1987, Murphy and the DOE entered into a Consent Order which resolved disputes regarding Murphy's refined petroleum product operations during the period the petroleum price and allocation regulations were in effect.     See Murphy Oil Corp.,     17 DOE 85,782 (1987) (the first Consent Order). The first Consent Order left the issue of Murphy's alleged violations as a producer of crude oil unresolved. Those issues were decided by the OHA on June 17, 1992 when the OHA issued a modified version of ERA's PRO as a Remedial Order (RO).     See Murphy Oil Corp.,     22 DOE 83,005 (1992). Murphy subsequently appealed the OHA's determination to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). On January 24, 1994 a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a Decision and Proposed Order (DPO) which modified the RO.     See Ocean Drilling  Exploration Co., et al.,     66 FERC 63,002 (1994).        On July 15, 1994, Murphy and the DOE entered into the present Consent Order, the second between Murphy and the DOE. This second Consent Order, which does not modify or affect the terms of the first Consent Order, resolves all existing or potential civil and administrative claims against Murphy for alleged violations of the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations left unresolved by the first Consent Order. Under the terms of this second Consent Order, Murphy has remitted $10,700,000 to the DOE, and all outstanding or potential claims by the DOE against Murphy have been extinguished. These funds are being held in an interest-bearing escrow account maintained at the Department of the Treasury pending a determination regarding their proper distribution.            II. Jurisdiction and Authority            The Subpart V regulations set forth general guidelines which may be used by the OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution for funds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. The DOE policy is to use the Subpart V process to distribute such funds. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,     see     The Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (PODRA), 15 U.S.C. 450107;     Office of Enforcement,     9 DOE 82,508 (1981);     Office of Enforcement,     8 DOE 82,597 (1981).        We have considered the ERA's Petition that we implement a Subpart V proceeding with respect to the second Murphy Consent Order fund and have determined that such a proceeding is appropriate. This Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the OHA's tentative plan to distribute this fund.            III. Proposed Refund Procedures            A. Crude Oil Refund Policy            We propose to distribute the Murphy funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy in Crude Oil Cases, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). The MSRP was issued as a result of a court-approved Settlement Agreement.     In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,     653 F. Supp. 108 (D. Kan.), 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines 90,509 (1986) (the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement). The MSRP establishes that 40 percent of the crude oil overcharge funds will be remitted to the federal government, another 40 percent to the states, and up to 20 percent may be initially reserved for the payment of claims by injured parties. The MSRP also specifies that any monies remaining after all valid claims by injured purchasers are paid be disbursed to the federal government and the states in equal amounts.        The OHA has utilized the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involving alleged crude oil violations.     See     Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986). This Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of comments or objections to our proposed use of the MSRP as the groundwork for evaluating claims in crude oil refund proceedings. Following this period, the OHA issued a Notice evaluating the numerous comments which it received pursuant to the Order Implementing the MSRP. This Notice was published at 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987) (the April 10 Notice).        The April 10 Notice contained guidance to assist potential claimants wishing to file refund applications for crude oil monies under the Subpart V regulations. Generally, all claimants would be required to (1) document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981 crude oil price control period, and (2) prove that they were injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges. We also specified that end-users of petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have been injured by the alleged crude oil overcharges and need not submit any additional proof of injury beyond documentation of their purchase volumes.     See City of Columbus, Georgia,     16 DOE 85,550 (1987). Additionally, we stated that crude oil refunds would be calculated on the basis of a per gallon (or ``volumetric'') refund amount, which is obtained by dividing the crude oil refund pool by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the crude oil price control period. The OHA has adopted the refund procedures outlined in the April 10 Notice in numerous cases.     See, e.g., Texaco, Inc,     19 DOE 85,200 (1989);     Shell Oil Co.,     17 DOE 85,204 (1988) (    Shell    );     Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,     14 DOE 85,475 (1986) (    Mountain Fuel    ).            B. Refund Claims            We propose to adopt the DOE's standard crude oil refund procedures to distribute the monies remitted by Murphy. We have chosen initially to reserve 20 percent of the fund, plus accrued interest, for direct refunds to claimants in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for injured parties. This reserve figure may later be reduced if circumstances warrant.        The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims in a manner similar to that used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges.     See Mountain Fuel,     14 DOE at 88,869. Under these procedures, claimants will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.

This reserve figure may later be reduced if circumstances warrant.        The OHA will evaluate crude oil refund claims in a manner similar to that used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges.     See Mountain Fuel,     14 DOE at 88,869. Under these procedures, claimants will be required to document their purchase volumes of petroleum products and prove they were injured as a result of the alleged violations.          "

Figures from China's customs office show that so far, the  total exports this year have jumped by 13.6 percent to 10.43  billion U.S. dollars while gross imports represented an increase  of 20.5 percent to 11.67 billion U.S. dollars.    In the first two months, the general export trade reported a  rise of 16.3 percent, and exports for the processing industry  maintained a steady increase of 15.7 percent, hitting 5.17  billion U.S. dollars, while exports through bartering and border  trade were reduced by about 41 percent.    The figures also show that exports of primary products  tended  to go up with an increase of 24.4 percent, despite a sweeping  export reduction of petroleum and petroleum products.    Exports for industrial end-products continued to rise apace,  with electro-mechanical products, textiles, garments and  chemical products surging by 10 percent, and steel and  non-ferrous metal starting to pick up.    The total exports for foreign-funded companies jumped by  44.4  percent to 3.16 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 30 percent  of the country's total. The exports of other ventures rose by a  modest 4 percent, totaling 7.27 billion U.S. dollars.    The main influence on hefty imports came from  foreign-financed firms, whose total imports for equipment  accounted for one-fifth of the country's total. Another factor  was the booming processing industry, whose imports for raw  materials and machine parts in the first two months this year  accounted for 35.7 percent of the country's total.    The main goods imported by a wide margin in this period  include machinery, plastics, petroleum and petroleum products,  ships, paper and metal products.    The imports of steel, autos and other staples including  grain  and flour, fertilizer, airplanes, copper, aluminum and lumber  saw very small increases or were cut slightly.     "

0,FT944-18771 ,"FT944-18771 _AN-EJBBDAEZFT 941001   FT  01 OCT 94 / Fishing: Trout that grew and grew      By MICHAEL WIGAN   When Darwin landed on the Falkland Islands in 1834 he was unimpressed. Wild cattle roamed a trackless waste otherwise devoid of mammal life. But Darwin was not a fly fisherman. Even if he had been, the meandering estuaries and thin, curling rivers would have stirred no tremors in his casting arm, for the only freshwater fish in the Falklands were two small species of no account. The estuaries were dominated by bulbous-headed, slim-tailed grey mullet which slipped in and out on the tide, not a sportsman's target. Darwin's genius lay in looking back in time, not forward. Even the pioneers of the 1940s, who changed the Falklands fishery, had no idea what their actions would produce. Brown trout eggs were imported from England and Scotland, making the 8,000-mile sea journey in trays of ice. On arrival in sub-Antarctica they were transferred to milk-churns, strapped to horses, and hauled to the interior. There they were put in the sweet waters of the slow-moving, spring-fed rivers. Brown trout are a resilient, adaptive, tough and invasive species. Originally found only in Europe, today's map reflects their colonisation of the rest of the globe. Wherever Europeans went they took fish with them, and there are now naturalised populations as far apart as Japan, New Guinea, Peru and Pakistan. Within 10 years of the brown trout introductions, Falklanders found themselves catching trout which had turned silver and grown immeasurably bigger than their impoverished brethren. The questing brown trout, finding inadequate food in the rivers, which were also prone to dry up and lose essential oxygen, had migrated to estuaries and the sea, where protein-rich krill swarmed. The present record for a Falklands sea trout, winkled on to the bank of the San Carlos river in 1992 by Alison Faulkner, a British angler, is nearly 23lb. Scale analysis showed it to be a remarkable 10 years old and to have spawned at least five times. Sea trout have this advantage over the Atlantic salmon, their rival gamefish: they are better able to recover from the rigours of spawning, they spawn more often and, because the core stock remains in fresh water, they cannot, like salmon, so easily be exploited to the verge of extinction. It is a curious fact of the brown trout's sea-going urge that it principally motivates the female; males stay at home. When the female returns, silver and big and bursting with ova from the tremendous larders in the salt, two or three share a communal nest. The diminutive resident brown male can then fertilise the eggs of several females. Enough biology. The proper concern of all self-respecting Falklands visitors is how to attach this gleaming silver maiden to a fly manipulated by a fishing rod. The answer is, as it should be, with difficulty. The really big fish in any migratory run need special attention. In the Falklands the sea trout run into rivers from January until the end of the fishing season in April. The best fishing month is February. But the big fish tend to run together, towards the end of the season, and waste as little time as possible in freshwater. On the Chartres river, in West Falkland, ghillie Tony Blake said he and Alison Faulkner had seen sea trout so big they could have eaten her record-breaker. Blake is a fishing phenomenon himself. Everything that happens as you fish the pool under his eagle-eye relates to his search for the big fish. A 2lb trout jumped. He said: 'Right. The big fella won't be here. He would have chased that minnow out. Try there.' I did. He was there. Meantime my fishing partner had caught 27 sea trout, averaging 2 1/2 lb, in three hours. Blake particularly likes the story of the American fly-dresser who came to report on which of his 200 flies Falklands sea trout would take. 'How are you getting on?' Blake inquired. 'Badly,' replied the American. 'They take them all.' If the Falklands was situated where the Canaries are, British fishermen would be trampling the grass flat on the banks. As it is, virtually no one goes there. For more information: Go Fishing Canada, Swan Centre, Fishers Lane, London W4 IRX. Tel: 081-742 3700.   Countries:-  FKZ  Falkland Islands.

0," FR940607-0-00051   FR940607-0-00016        Pneumatic testing with carbon dioxide or inert gas poses a greater risk than hydrostatic testing because of the high pressures at which supercritical carbon dioxide pipelines operate.     The alternative of MOP reduction would dramatically reduce enhanced oil recovery rates.     As for carbon dioxide distribution lines, the two operators said these pipelines generally are smaller than transmission lines, and only affect isolated areas in oil production fields. The commenters said pressure testing of carbon dioxide distribution systems would seriously disrupt oil field operations. One of these operators said that over 50 separate tests may be needed to minimize disruption, depending on the layout of the distribution system.     In view of these comments, RSPA has reviewed both the need to apply the proposed rules to carbon dioxide pipelines and the burden of compliance. Carbon dioxide pipelines have not been subject to part 195 long enough for us to develop an accident history for them. Still, because of their similarity to hazardous liquid pipelines, untested or inadequately tested carbon dioxide pipelines can fail in service from the growth of physical defects, whatever the pipeline's age. Although carbon dioxide is non-polluting and nonflammable, any failure that releases large quantities of carbon dioxide would expose nearby persons to the risk of suffocation.     This risk is less, however, for production field distribution lines that transport carbon dioxide than for transmission lines that transport carbon dioxide. Compared to transmission lines, which move large volumes of carbon dioxide over long distances, individual pipelines in a production field distribution system carry smaller volumes over localized areas. Normally these areas are rural. In addition, the burden of compliance would be greater for field distribution systems than for transmission lines. Testing field distribution systems could disrupt oil production and require a multiplicity of tests to minimize that disruption. RSPA believes this combination of decreased risk and increased burden of compliance justifies excluding from the final rule production field distribution lines that are in a rural area. As defined in 195.2, the term ``rural area'' means ``outside the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area such as a subdivision, a business or shopping center, or community development.''     In the final rules, 195.302(b)(2)(ii) reflects our decision to exclude older carbon dioxide field distribution lines in rural areas from the 25-percent-safety-margin requirement. Consistent with the present pressure testing requirement, any portion of these older lines that is replaced, relocated, or otherwise changed on or after July 12, 1991, or any older line converted to carbon dioxide service under 195.5 would have to be pressure tested to at least 1.25 times its MOP.         Test Pressure        In the NPRM, RSPA proposed to redesignate existing 195.302(c), concerning the level and duration of test pressure, as new 195.303. RSPA received no comments on this proposal, and has adopted it as final. However, the term ``hydrostatic test'' is replaced by ``pressure test'' because under existing requirements, carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure tested either pneumatically or hydrostatically.         Test Medium        In most cases, operators must use water as the hydrostatic test medium for hazardous liquid pipelines (195.306(a)). However, under specified conditions, onshore pipelines may be tested with petroleum that does not vaporize rapidly (195.306(b)).     This exception allowing operators to use petroleum as the test medium was established when only newly constructed pipelines were subject to hydrostatic testing under part 195. Newly constructed pipelines are less likely to rupture during a hydrostatic test than pipelines that have been in operation for a number of years and never tested or inadequately tested. Therefore, RSPA is concerned that if existing pipelines subject to testing under the final rule were tested with petroleum, operators would not be able to contain all the petroleum that would spill from ruptures. To preclude this outcome, RSPA has revised 195.306(b) to prohibit the use of petroleum as a test medium in pressure testing pipelines to meet the final rule.     Although RSPA's NPRM did not propose to limit the use of petroleum, the NPRM asked operators to estimate the pipeline mileage they would test with petroleum to learn the extent to which operators might use petroleum instead of water as the test medium. Only four operators responded, and the answers ranged from none to practically none. Based on this information and RSPA's experience in administering the hydrostatic testing rules of part 195, disallowing the use of petroleum as a test medium under the final rule should not significantly affect the burden of compliance with the rule.     Although RSPA believes this action is within the scope of the NPRM, because we did not specifically propose it, 195.306(b) will be effective August 8, 1994, unless by July 7, 1994, RSPA receives comments that illustrate that this final rule is not in the public interest. Upon receipt of such comments, RSPA will withdraw 195.306(b) before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent documents. One document will withdraw this section of the final rule. The other will announce a proposal to disallow the use of petroleum as a test medium for pressure testing required by this rulemaking and establish a new comment period. If RSPA does not receive comments that illustrate that 195.306(b) is not in the public interest, RSPA will publish a notice advising that 195.306(b) will be effective on August 8, 1994.

Smiths said yesterday it 'has offered to supply' avionics updates for the aircraft and was discussing sale terms. The sale of both the aircraft and the avionics was strongly opposed by the British government, which claimed they would threaten the security of the Falkland Islands. A Smiths Industries official said yesterday: 'You can be assured that this company would not proceed without keeping the appropriate authorities fully informed.' He said that although Smiths had not made a formal request for UK government clearance, it maintained informal contacts with the government on the subject. It first emerged in October that a wholly owned US subsidiary of Smiths Industries had begun talks with Argentina's air force to sell an avionics package. McDonnell Douglas and Lockheed, both of the US, also entered discussions on the deal. The Argentine Defence Ministry is understood to have preferred the Smiths approach, hoping this would underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the British arms embargo, still in place since the 1982 Falklands conflict. On February 1, Washington said it would sell the aircraft to replace some of the 60 Argentina lost in the conflict. But it agreed to UK requests that the 1970s vintage Skyhawks would not be equipped with state of the art avionics.   Companies:-  Smiths Industries.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.

The western world's big mining groups will spend about Dollars 96.4m less on exploration this year than they did in 1991 - which itself showed a Dollars 122.8m decrease on the previous year - according to Metal Economics Group, a Canadian research organisation. It says in a new report that gold this year is attracting Dollars 839m or 52 per cent of total spending by the 158 companies that provided this information. This is down from more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of the total in 1991. In 1989, when the gold price was much higher than at present, gold exploration spending at Dollars 1.2bn reached 68 per cent of the total. On the other hand, says MEG, budget shares devoted to base metals exploration have increased steadily during the past few years. Base metals and/or polymetallics programmes are attracting Dollars 525m this year, or 32.6 per cent of the surveyed total, compared with Dollars 576m in 1991, or 31 per cent, and only Dollars 305m or 18 per cent in 1989. Expenditures for other metals and minerals - primarily diamonds, titanium-bearing and other industrial minerals and platinum - are also rising, with Dollars 248m being spent this year (15.4 per cent of the surveyed total) compared with Dollars 242m or 13 per cent last year. The exploration budgets of the 161 companies world-wide that were surveyed total Dollars 1.7bn. The US still attracts most of the spending, taking 21.4 per cent, followed by Australia (19.1 per cent), Canada (17.8 per cent) and Latin America (15.1 per cent). Mining companies' growing interest in Latin America is reflected in the fact that exploration expenditure there is scheduled to rise by 28 per cent this year. Spending in the US is up by 6.5 per cent but it is down in Canada and in Australia by 30 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. Eleven companies in the RTZ Group, the world's biggest mining company, are spending about Dollars 209m, according to MEG's calculations.

North Sea operators drilled only 116 exploration and appraisal wells last year, compared with more than 170 in 1991, as persistently low oil prices and an adverse exchange rate - world oil trade is priced in dollars - forced them to cut capital expenditure. The brokerage group expects low levels of exploration to continue this year and estimates that about 120 wells will be drilled. Exploration budgets are one of the first expenditures to be trimmed when companies experience hard times. Oil prices were at a 20-year low in real terms last year, with an average sterling price of Pounds 11 a barrel. At the same time, development spending on existing fields rose significantly. That should have a positive effect over the longer term because money spent on developing newly discovered fields will generate more revenue in the next five years as production rises. Producers' cashflow was low last year at Pounds 800m compared with an average of Pounds 2.5bn over the previous five years, largely as a result of the increasing development spending. Cashflow calculated by Wood Mackenzie is an estimate of companies' total revenues in the North Sea minus exploration and development costs and taxation.

Amoco said it planned to spend Dollars 3.2bn on capital investment and exploration next year, a budget that is largely unchanged on the spending level authorised for this year. Some Dollars 1.85bn of this amount will be devoted to exploration and production, of which 70 per cent, or some Dollars 1.3bn, will be outside the US. Last year, the company spent Dollars 1.275bn on exploration and production overseas. A growing number of US oil and gas companies have decided recently to redirect exploration efforts away from the US. This trend results partly from congressional and local restrictions on drilling offshore of Florida and California and the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Last July, Amoco announced cost-cutting plans to take an Dollars 800m restructuring charge in the second quarter and to reduce its workforce by 8,500 employees, or 16 per cent, by the end of next year.

However, it has caught world  attention with the discovery of China's largest shallow sea oil  field--the Chengdao oil field, which has recently been put into  development. The development of this oil field not only presents  a bright future for China's eastern oil industry, it also opens  a new era in the development of China's shallow sea oil fields.    About 100 kilometers north of the famous oil city of  Dongying  in eastern China and out into the sea where the Huang He enters  the sea, one sees four offshore oil rigs. According to the  Shengli Shallow Sea Company, this oil field has a daily output  of 1,500 tons. It has produced, up until late August this year,  42,000 tons of crude oil. This is very encouraging news as the  oil field has just been put into production.    The change from long-term exploration alone to exploration  and development at the same time in the Chengdao oil field was  necessitated by the development of the Shengli oil field and  also the development of Eastern China's oil industry. The  Shengli oil field is China's second largest oil field, with an  output last year of 33.50 million tons, about one-fourth of the  nation's total oil output. The Chinese government, in its Eighth  Five-Year Plan, states the strategy of ""stabilizing the east and  developing the west"" in oil development. However, it is no easy  task to stabilize and maintain the current level of output in  the east. The development of the Chengdao oil field has  significance as a backup oil field to Shengli and also as a  reserve area. This is an integral part of China's oil industry  development strategy.    The Tarim Basin and Bo Hai Wan are China's two brightest  stars in the oil industry. Bo Hai Wan, adjacent to Shengli, is a  shallow sea area with an average depth of less than 20 meters.  The layer of sedimentary rocks lies flat on top of each other on  the sea bed. Bo Hai Wan has rich oil reserves. It is also a  strategically important area in China's oceanic development.  China views the continental shelf oil development and Tarim  Basin oil development in the west as the keystone in its oil  industry.    Bo Hai Wan is about 80,000 square kilometers in area and it  is an integral part of the North China oil and gas area. The  Chinese government started specific gravity measurement and  exploration in Bo Hai Wan as early as 1965 and this work has  never stopped. For the Shengli oil field, ever since the latter  half of the 1980's, exploration has focused on the Bin Hai area,  with the discovery of Gudong and other oil fields. In 1988, in  the Bo Hai Wan area where the Huang He enters the sea, the  Chengdao oil field was discovered. This field controls an  oil-bearing area of 36 square kilometers. It was discovered and  verified that the oil field has oil and gas reserves exceeding  100 million tons, and by the year 1995 its capacity could be  developed to an annual total of 1 million tons of oil. The  annual increase of oil geological reserve is about 30 percent of  Shengli's annual increase of reserve. Its long-term reserve is  expected to reach several hundreds of million tons. The  discovery was ranked as one of China's top 10 technological  achievements in 1988 and is highly regarded by China's oil and  technological circles. Shouldering the task of exploring and  developing China's largest shallow sea oil field at present is  the Shengli Oil Field Shallow Sea Exploration and Development  Company. This is the only company in China capable of shallow  sea and ultra-shallow sea oil exploration and development. The  company not only undertakes the exploration and development of  Chengdao oil field, it also dispatches oil rigs and ships to  Liaodong Wan and North Bay to work in the shallow waters there.  The company is a significant force in the exploration and  development of continental shelf and shallow sea oil development  in the eastern part of China.    The company has about 2,600 employees, three docks, five  offshore oil rigs, a floating platform and 34 auxiliary vessels  including two triple-purpose vessels equipped with  satellite-guided navigational aids. The special-purpose wharf  was completed and put into operation at the end of July. The  dock can accommodate all ship and platforms.    With the decision in 1984 by the Chinese government to set  up  the Shengli Oil field Shallow Sea Oil Drilling Company, Shengli  Oil Field Shallow Sea Development Company also underwent  corresponding changes to keep up with the development. Its scale  of operation expanded continuously. The technology of oceanic  oil development went to new highs. This is particularly so since  last year when good news came in oil drilling. Eight oil wells  each with a daily output of 100 tons were drilled one after the  other, greatly increasing the oil-bearing area of Chengdao oil  field and also the geological reserves of the oil field.    Wei Xueyi, deputy general manager of Shengli oil field, is  also general manager of the Shallow Sea Company and the person  responsible for the development of the Chengdao oil field. He  remarked that the change from exploration alone to exploration  and development together is an historical change. Chengdao will  be responsible for 30 percent of the increase in production in  the Shengli oil field and this is very significant in the  nation's oil development strategy of stabilizing and maintaining  the east. However, he said, because of various limitations such  as capital, the pace of development cannot be pushed too fast.  The task this year for Chengdao oil field is to have eight  exploration wells and three production wells and to have an  additional geological reserve of 20-30 million tons. The company  takes ""the easy one first, the high output ones first, early  development and early harvest"" approach. The company is taking a  pragmatic approach of building smaller and easier drilling  platforms and trying to put into production as soon as possible  the wells that have been drilled.    In order to expedite the development of shallow sea oil,  Shengli Shallow Sea Oil Exploration and Development Company  relentlessly explored new technology and has successfully raised  the technological level of oceanic oil exploration. Over 100  technological achievements were made. One of the technological  achievements is the self-designed and built ""Shengli No. 2""  shallow sea ""Walking"" oil rig, which can walk in ultra-shallow  waters at a speed of 60 meters per hour--the world's first  ultra-shallow sea walking oil rig--and is ranked as one of the  top 10 technological achievements for 1992.    In order to develop the rich reserves of this shallow water  oil field, Wei Xueyi and his management team are traveling  throughout the nation and also overseas for the purchase of  offshore oil drilling platforms, oil rigs and various transport  vessels and equipment so as to expedite the development of this  oil field. This is also the golden opportunity for foreign  companies to sell equipment and technology to China.    Obviously, the development of Chengdao oil field opens up a  new road for the development of Bo Hai Wan and China's Shallow  Sea oil development. A new horizon and new hopes are now  visible. A lot of human resources and material and capital will  be put into the Bo Hai Wan and the continental shelf development  between now and the advent of the next century.     "

The one-year arrangement favours Argentina, which will increase its share of a substantially extended fishing effort next year - raising its catch of the prized illex squid by 70 per cent to 220,000 tonnes. The Falklands will retain its present quota of 150,000 tonnes. The agreement is to be signed in London early next month during an official visit by Foreign Minister Guido di Tella, in which Argentina's claims to the islands will inevitably feature prominently on the agenda. The accord will increase pressure on the islands' financial revenues, which depend heavily on the sale of fishing licences. The islands' government forecasts a 35 per cent fall in licence revenue next year to between Pounds 15m and Pounds 15.5m. Argentine negotiators say, however, that 'the islands could not delude themselves that we would never develop our fishing industry. This agreement allows them to plan ahead'. Argentina is likely to continue increasing its share of the catch in future years. Britain had hoped to strike a long-term agreement with Argentina that would protect the islands' revenues. But Argentina is tying such an agreement to concessions by London over shared development of the islands' possible oil reserves and the lifting of the UK's arms embargo, imposed during the 1982 Falklands conflict.

0,FT944-4341 ,"FT944-4341 _AN-ELHD0AG0FT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia puts its oil industry on the back burner - The country could soon become Opec's first net importer      By ROBERT CORZINE and MANUELA SARAGOSA   Fifty years ago this week Japanese troops in the jungles of central Sumatra used abandoned American equipment to drill the only wildcat exploration oil well in Indonesia during the long Pacific war. The oil-soaked sand that the drill bit struck during the night of December 4 1944 turned out to be the Minas field, the largest oil accumulation east of Iran and east Asia's only 'super-giant' field. Its discovery came too late to change Japan's military fortunes. But in the 42 years since commercial production began Minas's low sulphur crude oil has helped to fuel Japan's economic transformation. It has also helped to pay for Indonesia's ambitious industrialisation plans. But just as south-east Asia has become the fastest growing international oil market, Indonesia is about to lose its status as a net oil exporter. Many western companies say the day could be staved off if the government eased the conditions under which they operate as contractors to Pertamina, the state oil company. But the government appears to be betting that it can be the first member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to switch its energy exports from oil to natural gas, the world's fastest growing fossil fuel market. A recent World Bank report predicted that the oil sector's share of gross domestic product would drop to about 6 per cent by the year 2010, compared with 18 per cent in 1990 and 28 per cent in 1980. Last month President Suharto told the Opec meeting in Bali that oil 'no longer plays an important role' in the Indonesian economy. But in spite of such statements there is considerable sensitivity about when the country will become a net oil importer. The government says Indonesia can maintain its current status well into the next decade. Oil industry executives say it is likely to become a net importer before 2000, in spite of some easing last year of exploration terms. 'The government is not seriously encouraging exploration,' said one US oil company executive in Jakarta. 'Even if they change their terms now they might find they have done so too late because the exploration cycle takes so long.' A British executive said: 'Pertamina understands the need to modify their exploration terms, but the government does not.' Some executives say Indonesia's success in diversifying its export base has had a big impact on the government's thinking about the importance of the oil industry. The World Bank predicts that the decline of oil export earnings means that non-oil exports will need to generate about 85 per cent of Indonesia's total export earnings in 2000. Textile and timber products, the two main non-oil exports, are not showing substantial growth. Textile exports are actually slowing down. But there are fast-growing sectors, among which the World Bank lists ceramics, non-ferrous metals and electronic goods, which are poised to take over from oil. Oil industry dissatisfaction with the government's current terms are reflected in the downturn in recent exploration activity. A report by Mackay Consultants of the UK says the number of offshore exploration and appraisal wells drilled this year has fallen to 45, compared with 48 in 1993. Other analysts, such as Mr Gavin Law of international oil consultants Wood Mackenzie, say the downward trend is likely to continue, even though Indonesia has attractive frontier acreage, especially in the eastern part of the country around Irian Jaya. He believes part of the problem is that Jakarta does not allow companies to offset high frontier exploration costs against their more mature production elsewhere in the country. A single exploration well in Irian Jaya can cost Dollars 20m or more because of the remote location and harsh conditions, compared with Dollars 2m or so in more developed areas. The lack of exploration success has caused some western companies to reduce their presence in the country, concentrating, in preference, on neighbouring Malaysia and Vietnam where they say terms are better. Other companies, however, are responding to the government's greater emphasis on gas. The signing last month of the Dollars 40bn contract with Exxon, the US energy group, to develop the giant Natuna gas field should help Indonesia to maintain its status as the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Other gas fields are being developed for power generation within Indonesia, although questions over future government policies on electricity pricing and regulation could still hamper plans for gas to increase its share of domestic primary energy consumption to 32 per cent by 2000, from the current level of 25 per cent.

[Alonso] And how will Cuba pay for it, Minister? What are  the  terms?    [Nule] Well, the idea is that Cuba will purchase the  Colombian petroleum under normal commercial conditions; that is,  at international prices; and Cuba will pay for it in hard  currency. But there is the possibility of giving [word  indistinct] for the payment.    [Alonso] When will these exports begin?    [Nule] Well, the idea is to begin exports as of July this  year.    [Alonso] How much petroleum will be sold to Cuba, Minister?    [Nule] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day.    [Alonso] Between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels a day. Very well.  We have thus confirmed this report. In conclusion, Minister, we  would also like to know whether it is in the interest of  Colombia to sell this petroleum to our country?    [Nule] Yes, of course. And this is what Cuba needs there.    [Alonso] Very well, thank you very much, Minister.    [Nule] Well, so long.    [Alonso] So long.     "

(See Letter from Michael J. Spear, Assistant Director, Ecological Services, FWS to Ms. Ana Sol Gutierrez, Research and Special Projects Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, April 11, 1994.) The FWS expressed concern with ENVIRON statements suggesting that edible oils and fats pose no real risk to fish and wildlife. FWS states that although petroleum oils may pose greater risks than vegetable oils for acute toxicity to fish and wildlife from ingestion and inhalation of petroleum oil's hydrocarbon component, both types of oil pose chronic effects from the fouling of coats and plumage in wildlife, which often leads to death. FWS also stated that in some circumstances, edible oils can persist in the environment for extended periods of time, forming mat and encrustation similar to petroleum products, potentially causing chronic adverse effects to fish.   NOAA also has evaluated the effects on the environment of spilled non-petroleum oils, including coconut, corn, cottonseed, fish, and palm oils. (See a Memorandum for the Record, date June 3, 1993, from NOAA Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division.) The NOAA assessment, based on literature research, addresses physical and chemical properties and toxicity of these and other oils, and indicates that some edible oils, when spilled, may have adverse environmental effects. Some of these effects seem to contradict conclusions in the ENVIRON study. According to NOAA, coconut and palm oils are very viscous; in most coastal waters, these oils probably would persist for over a decade. By contrast, ENVIRON concluded that animal fats and vegetable oils ``are easily biodegraded by bacteria,'' and that the physical impacts of non-recoverable animal fats and vegetable oils ``would be of limited duration.''

(See Vol. 4, No. 1-Winter/Spring 1994.) In the summary, TSBR makes the following observation: ``While edible oils do not contain the toxic components of many of the polyaromatic hydrocarbons, they do have many of the same physical properties as petroleum oils; the animals and birds will suffer the same physical effects from edible oils as they would from contamination with petroleum products.''

General Program Requirements"," FR940203-2-00137   FR940203-2-00068            Discussion:     The Secretaries agree that, in many cases, students do not receive the guidance and counseling needed to make important decisions related to education and training leading to meaningful employment. It is for this reason that career exploration and counseling is required as an important activity in the school-based learning component of the notice. States seeking to receive a grant under this competition must demonstrate that the school-based learning component of their School-to-Work Opportunities systems will include career exploration and counseling. In addition, however, in response to the commenter's concerns, the Secretaries have revised the School-based Learning component to require, among other stated elements, ``career awareness and exploration and counseling (beginning at the earliest possible age)'' in order to help those students who may be interested, to identify and select or reconsider, their interests, goals, and career majors, ``including those options that may not be traditional for their gender, race or ethnicity.'' By this change, the Secretaries wish to emphasize the importance of career awareness and exploration at an early age. The determination of the actual age or grade level at which this activity should begin, has been left to the States.           Changes:     The School-based Learning component has been revised to require, among other stated elements, ``career awareness and exploration and counseling (beginning at the earliest possible age)'' in order to help those students who may be interested, to identify and select or reconsider, their interests, goals, and career majors, ``including those options that may not be traditional for their gender, race, or ethnicity.''           General Program Requirements_Connecting Activities               Comment:     One commenter believed that the description of information collection and analysis in the connecting activities component of the ``General Program Requirements'' of the priority is too general to provide useful information. The commenter believed that the information should include annual participation and post-program outcomes, and that the data should be ``disaggregated'' by gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability, so that any lack of participation or achievement by one group would not be masked by the success of the program for the general population.           Discussion:     The Secretaries agree with the commenters that disaggregated data is likely to be important for determinations of the success of the program for all groups. They would expect that the information collected and analysis provided under the connecting activities component to describe student participation in the program. This may include information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability.           Changes:     A change has been made to the ``General Program Requirements Connecting Activities'' section of notice so that it is specified that among the information that may be collected is information on gender, race, ethnicity, socio-economic background, limited-English proficiency, and disability.           Comment:     One commenter requested that the Secretaries add the following additional requirement to the list of connecting activities in the priority: ``Providing job coaching services to youth with disabilities within a supported employment model.'' The commenter believed that job coaches could help students acquire job skills and could help employers achieve the workplace accommodations that may be necessary to job success.           Discussion:     As is provided for in the school-based and work-based learning components respectively, career exploration and counseling, as well as workplace mentoring, must be provided to all students. In addition, the notice requires States to describe in their applications how they will ensure opportunities for all students, including students with disabilities, to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. While the Secretaries believe that funds awarded under this competition may be expended to cover the costs of what the commenter has referred to as job coaching for disabled students within a supported employment model, States may also seek to utilize funds available from other sources to meet what may be the special needs of disabled students participating in their School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Indeed, under paragraph (b)(4) of the priority, States are specifically required to describe how their School-to-Work Opportunities systems will coordinate the use of education and training funds from State and private sources with related Federal program funds.           Changes:     None.              "
0," LA081390-0025   261004    August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 1; Column 5; Foreign Desk      2489 words      POLICY ON OIL: A CONTINUING U.S. DILEMMA      By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Risky though the embargo of Iraq and Kuwait is for Western economies, some say  the military confrontation might stand as a mere dress rehearsal for a true oil  crisis that could be far harder to defuse.    The real oil crunch draws closer every day that the world's reliance on oil  from the unstable Middle East grows, these oil watchers say -- a dependence  that has reversed course and climbed dramatically in the last five years.    A steep fall in oil prices that began in late 1985 has made oil more attractive  to use but less rewarding to produce, with the result that demand is up and  production outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is flat.  Thus, the daily appetite for OPEC oil has surged by nearly 50% since then, to  23 million barrels.    In this country, domestic oil output has tumbled to a 29-year low, and imports  of crude have jumped to 50% of consumption -- most of it from OPEC nations --  surpassing the previous high of 45% that prevailed at the time of the 1979 oil  shock. Already the world's oil nations are producing about 90% of the oil they  can, the highest percentage since 1973. And the only nations whose oil output  can be significantly expanded are members of the fractious OPEC cartel, whose  hand is thus growing stronger by the day.    These conditions are widely seen as a recipe for rising oil prices and all the  ills that can result.    ""This one is military,"" says analyst Daniel Dreyfus of the Gas Research  Institute and former staff director of the Senate Energy Committee, referring  to the crisis caused by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. ""The next one will be  economic. It won't take an invasion.""    The invasion has already renewed the familiar debate over U.S. energy policy,  which critics consider to be almost non-existent.    Various segments of the energy industry have proposed a floor on oil prices,  greater access to public land for drilling, dollar incentives to capture more  oil from old fields, a new generation of nuclear reactors, subsidizing oil  exploration in foreign countries friendly to the United States, more federal  funds for energy research and getting clean-coal technology to market.    Consumer and environmental groups want stiffer auto gas-guzzler taxes and a  gas-sipper rebate, higher gasoline taxes, tougher efficiency standards for  motor vehicles, appliances and buildings, a ""carbon user's fee,"" protection of  public lands from drilling and research funds and subsidies for solar, wind and  other renewable forms of energy.    ""We have to look at the whole litany,"" says Philip Verleger Jr. at the  International Institute for Economics in Washington. ""We have to move in lots  of directions.""    But unless oil prices continue to climb, skeptics doubt that this latest  incident will trigger any lasting effort to cut usage, find more crude or wean  the nation from oil toward other fuels -- all of which carry a price tag.  History suggests that the public isn't willing to pay the price until a crisis  is upon it and the damage is done.    Says Dreyfus, ""If somebody assassinated Saddam (Hussein) tomorrow and his  troops staggered back to Baghdad, in two weeks you wouldn't even know it had  happened other than a few people making speeches, the same speeches they've  been making for 10 years.""    Nor is there unanimity that anything dramatic needs to be done. Advocates of  the free-market approach that has stood for U.S. energy policy over the past  decade say that -- given the reality of the Middle East's oil riches -- it has  served the nation well.    ""I frankly think the policy was right. It has avoided pain and cost for the  consumer,"" says Fereidun Fesharaki, once an oil adviser to the Shah of Iran who  heads energy research at the U.S. government-funded East-West Center in  Honolulu. ""We have to accept (the need for OPEC oil) and try to do things to  make sure their economies and ours have mutual interests.""    This predicted oil crunch down the road reflects the same geologic dilemma that  has helped to drive U.S. foreign policy since vast amounts of oil were  discovered in Saudi Arabia in the 1930s, just in time to fuel the world's  burgeoning fleet of cars, trucks and planes.    The Middle East holds about 70% of all known, economically recoverable crude  oil, not counting the old East Bloc nations. The fields are not only the  world's biggest but also the most prolific, the oil is the highest quality and  the cost of producing it is the cheapest.    That imbalance has steadily worsened as the United States, the world's biggest  user of oil, depleted its own once-plentiful reserves. The nation's reliance on  imported oil has since become one of the facts of life that define America's  place in the world.    This dependence has changed complexion from time to time, as oil strikes in  Mexico, China, Canada, Venezuela and other regions outside the Middle East  bolstered the big Alaska discovery of 1968 to help ease the U.S. vulnerability  to the political uncertainties of the Arab world.    But those were minor discoveries -- Alaska's biggest field has already begun  its natural decline -- compared to the oil riches of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  Iraq, Iran and other Middle East members of OPEC, whose oil politics twice  rocked the Western economies in the 1970s.    The oil jolts of 1973 and 1979 reduced actual supplies by a relatively minor  amount, making them a particularly dramatic illustration of America's need for  other people's crude.    The six-month Arab oil embargo that began in October, 1973, removed an average  of less than 3% of the oil production from world markets while the Iranian  revolution in 1978-79 represented an average cutback of about 4%. By  comparison, today's blockade of Iraq and Kuwait is apparently costing up to 4.5  million barrels of crude per day -- roughly 8% of world production including  the old East Bloc.    The first energy shock bumped crude oil prices from $4 to $12 a barrel, the  second from $13 to $37. The dramatic events helped bring down the presidency of  Jimmy Carter, tore up the landscape with double-digit inflation and soaring  interest rates and triggered a deep worldwide recession that fundamentally  changed the industrialized economies.    But the energy shocks also generated a dramatic response, starting with fuel  economy standards for cars and extending to changes in the personal habits of  Americans. The government imposed conservation programs and subsidized new  industries to develop alternative forms of energy. While the oil industry got  rich from the high prices, it used some of the money to find more oil.    Conservation, fuel substitutions and the recession itself caused oil  consumption to plummet, while supplies surged. The need for imported oil was  reversed, undercutting the OPEC cartel. Prices began to slide in late 1981 and  inflation oozed out of the economy, giving way to the Reagan-era prosperity  that has continued into 1990.    But an outright price collapse at the end of 1985 unleashed forces that have  undone much of the progress on energy efficiency and slowly narrowed the gap  between the world's need for oil and ability to supply it, setting the stage  for the panicky run-up in oil and gasoline prices that greeted the invasion of  Kuwait.    As 1986 unfolded, the price for a 42-gallon barrel of oil nose-dived from $30  to as low as $9 a barrel, sowing the seeds for greater consumption of oil while  putting a damper on oil production and exploration. The low prices and a  free-market philosophy led the U.S. government to relax automotive fuel economy  standards, raise speed limits and dismantle non-nuclear energy research and  subsidy programs.    Meanwhile, thousands of U.S. oil wells were closed as unprofitable, and  industry exploration efforts tumbled. The remaining exploration outlays were  redirected toward the most promising overseas areas where there is often less  environmental opposition of the type that has kept oil producers out of the  Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and some offshore California regions.    The resulting big jump in imported oil entering the United States doesn't worry  everybody.    The Japanese and West German economies have thrived despite their almost total  reliance on imported oil. Free-market economists say Americans should sit back  and enjoy the imported crude because it is cheaper to produce than our own, and  thus save whatever reserves lie under Alaska and off the California shore to  use when foreign sources finally dry up. Meanwhile, the decontrol of prices  since the oil shocks of the 1970s will tend to self-correct the swings in oil  markets, driving down demand and boosting supplies when prices surge.    But many argue there is no free market in oil as long as OPEC is in operation,  withholding oil from the market to prop up prices, and as long as other  governments -- including Japan -- are in the business of subsidizing oil  exploration and development.    ""If the U.S. treated oil as a national security issue and supported oil  production in some way, U.S. production would be a lot higher than it is and  imports would be lower,"" says Joseph Story, a Washington consultant to  oil-producing nations who has long experience in the Middle East.    The 50% oil-import benchmark has been suggested by politicians such as Sen.  Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.) as a ceiling for the United States on the grounds of  national security -- an argument bolstered by such incidents as the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait.    Such initiatives have attracted little support in recent years. But the  invasion of Kuwait, after the resurgence of the environment as a major issue in  the United States, could foster debate once again on longer-term energy  solutions.    Under President Bush, a former oilman who also considers himself an  environmentalist, congressional aides see a slight shift away from a Reagan  energy policy described as one of benign neglect. The Bush Administration  restored the maximum fuel economy standards for cars, for example, after the  requirements had been relaxed annually for several years.    ""They're talking a better game on conservation and efficiency, but they haven't  actually done much yet,"" says Jack Riggs, staff director for the House  subcommittee on energy and power.    Bush has ordered the Energy Department to propose options by next year for a  ""national energy strategy"" that would attempt to make sense out of various  contradictory federal policies.    But the Bush Administration made the familiar free-market argument in resisting  demands that the nation tap its 590-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserve  (SPR) to defuse last week's run-up in oil prices -- a position that has been  roundly criticized by the energy community.    ""It says a lot about energy policy,"" says Verleger, who argues that merely  declaring an intent to use the reserve would have undercut the sharp run-up in  gasoline prices. ""The petroleum reserve is the only significant element of our  energy policy, and the Administration didn't use it.""    For all the appeal of such renewable forms of energy as solar and wind power,  which are now being used to make electricity in Southern California, the nation  would have to cut into cars and trucks to make major inroads in oil  consumption. More than 60% of the oil consumed by the United States now goes  for transportation. Despite fuel-economy gains to date, cars and trucks alone  use up the equivalent of the entire output of the nation's oil fields.    One of the few things everybody agrees about is the virtue of natural gas,  which is plentiful and burns more cleanly than oil. It has been described as a  bridge fuel between the oil age and whatever comes after oil. But only a major  role for natural gas to fuel cars -- which is now being attempted on an  experimental basis -- would make a big dent in oil exploration.    Meanwhile, the use of oil to make electricity has been making a comeback  because it has become so cheap, undermining progress made by nuclear,  hydroelectric, natural gas, wind, solar and other cleaner and more plentiful  sources.    Just how much enthusiasm the nation could muster for another round of  investments in alternative energy is open to question. A rash of such ventures  subsidized by the federal government in the early 1980s later collapsed when  they either didn't work or couldn't compete with traditional fuels. It remains  to be seen whether many would take the plunge again unless oil prices climb  much higher than they have so far.    The biggest such undertaking was Unocal Corp.'s oil-shale project in Parachute  Creek, Colo., which has relied on federal price supports that guarantee a  whopping $45 for every barrel of oil that the company manages to squeeze out of  rocks. It has cost Unocal nearly $1 billion and the taxpayers up to $400  million.    Just as a continuation of this week's higher oil prices would tend to make the  economy use less oil, it should encourage oil companies to explore for more  oil. Today's leaner oil industry can find oil more cheaply and be profitable at  lower prices than it could before the mid-1980s price collapse.    The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have raised hopes that an influx of  Western oil technology could sharply boost oil production there. But Fesharaki,  recently returned from the Soviet oil fields, says it will be decades before  declining production there can be reversed. Experts blame poor drilling  practices, deteriorating equipment, improper maintenance and antiquated  technology for the bleak outlook.    Geologists say that even the best luck in turning up new oil reserves in  Alaska, offshore California, the Far East, the Soviet Union and other promising  areas would not change the overwhelming dominance of the Middle East. The  region's control of an estimated 70% of the 808 billion barrels of oil left in  the world doesn't even include unexplored areas such as the world's only known  ""mega-province,"" in geologists' parlance. That alone is thought to exceed 700  billion barrels -- almost half of it Iraq's.    Already, the only significant oil nations not producing oil flat-out are  members of OPEC. Historically, the higher their share of world markets, the  greater their power over prices. And except for Venezuela and Nigeria, the only  ones that can readily boost output are in the Persian Gulf.    ""This is a long-term problem,"" says G. Henry Schuler, a former Middle East  oilman now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  ""It is not something you can meet with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or with  surge capacity in Venezuela. The problem is over-reliance on the Middle East.""      How Americans Use Oil    Oil accounts for 42% of all U.S. energy needs.

Today's leaner oil industry can find oil more cheaply and be profitable at  lower prices than it could before the mid-1980s price collapse.    The dramatic changes in the Soviet Union have raised hopes that an influx of  Western oil technology could sharply boost oil production there. But Fesharaki,  recently returned from the Soviet oil fields, says it will be decades before  declining production there can be reversed. Experts blame poor drilling  practices, deteriorating equipment, improper maintenance and antiquated  technology for the bleak outlook.    Geologists say that even the best luck in turning up new oil reserves in  Alaska, offshore California, the Far East, the Soviet Union and other promising  areas would not change the overwhelming dominance of the Middle East. The  region's control of an estimated 70% of the 808 billion barrels of oil left in  the world doesn't even include unexplored areas such as the world's only known  ""mega-province,"" in geologists' parlance. That alone is thought to exceed 700  billion barrels -- almost half of it Iraq's.    Already, the only significant oil nations not producing oil flat-out are  members of OPEC. Historically, the higher their share of world markets, the  greater their power over prices. And except for Venezuela and Nigeria, the only  ones that can readily boost output are in the Persian Gulf.    ""This is a long-term problem,"" says G. Henry Schuler, a former Middle East  oilman now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.  ""It is not something you can meet with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or with  surge capacity in Venezuela. The problem is over-reliance on the Middle East.""      How Americans Use Oil    Oil accounts for 42% of all U.S. energy needs. Foreign oil imports have  increased 14.9% since the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and now represent 50% of  U.S. oil consumption.    1973:    Transportation: 53%    Industrial: 25.9%    Heating and Cooking: 12.9%    Electrical Power: 8.9%      1990:    Transportation: 63%    Industrial: 24%    Heating and Cooking: 7.8%    Electrical Power: 4.9%      Chart, How Americans Use Oil, AP/Los Angeles Times      OIL -- UNITED STATES; OIL PRICES; OIL -- MIDDLE EAST; OPEC; ENERGY -- UNITED  STATES; ALTERNATIVE ENERGY; UNITED STATES -- GOVERNMENT; UNITED STATES --  ECONOMY; IRAQ -- FOREIGN RELATIONS -- KUWAIT; MILITARY CONFRONTATIONS; IRAQ --  ARMED FORCES -- KUWAIT    "

0,FT923-8984 ,"FT923-8984 _AN-CHKBOAD1FT 920807   FT  07 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Developing the last great oil frontier - Western moves to exploit ex-Soviet reserves are gathering pace      By NEIL BUCKLEY and REUTER      MOSCOW   THE PROBLEMS and risks may still be legion, but moves by western companies to exploit oil reserves in the former Soviet Union are gathering pace. While the floodgates have yet to open, almost all major western companies have involvement of some kind - and a number of smaller companies have proved that they too can do deals with the former Soviet republics. Only this week, it was announced that a venture that is seeking to become the first integrated Russian oil company with a listing on the London stock exchange had been officially registered. The Siberian Oil Company (Sinco) has been formed by Eurosov Petroleum, a private company backed by US and Australian oil interests, together with 16 Russian shareholding enterprises. It has licences to exploit 20 fields in the Tyumen region with recoverable reserves estimated at 1.74bn barrels. Joint ventures with local producers remain the most popular means of entry into the former Soviet industry. The first was Yuganskfracmaster, made up of Canadian Fracmaster, Shell, and the west Siberian producer Yuganskneftegaz. This undertakes well treatment at fields in the Yugansk region and has managed to make satisfactory profits by exporting incremental oil production as payment for its work. The first US-Soviet venture to get approval to pump Siberian crude oil to the world, the much-trumpeted White Nights project, has had more variable fortunes. Formed in 1990 between US oil companies Phibro Energy and Anglo Suisse and the western Siberian producer Varyeganneftegaz, it began producing last year from the Tagrinskoye and West Varyegan fields near Raduzhny, 2,400 km (about 1,500 miles) north-east of Moscow. It was, however, hit hard by the high costs of employing expatriate workers and the effects of the Ecu26 a tonne (about Dollars 5 a barrel) export tariff imposed by the Russian government just before Christmas - from which it was only recently granted exemption. Undaunted, the White Nights partners are still preparing to embark on a bigger project, called Golden Mammoth, to develop four fields in western Siberia. Reserves are estimated at 400m barrels, and Mr Gil Labbe, president of Anglo-Suisse, recently said investment was planned of between Dollars 150m and Dollars 200m. The recent offer by the Russian government to exempt 'serious' foreign investors from the punitive export tariff may help take the brakes off investment. Other joint ventures to benefit from exemption are Conoco's Polar Lights project, a Dollars 3bn development of three oil basins in the autonomous republic of Komi, west of the Ural mountains and close to the Arctic Circle. The other is KomiArcticOil, for which Gulf Canada is the operator, with partners British Gas and local producer Komineft. This has been producing about 8,000 b/d from Komi's Vozey and Upper Vozey fields since last December. Komi has been a centre of interest for western companies that are beginning to go beyond production-boosting agreements, to sign new exploration and development deals. Total, the French oil group, signed a production-sharing contract with Komineft in May, to develop the 250m-barrel Khariaga field in Komi's Timan Pechora basin. The company expects to invest Dollars 400m over two and a half years to bring the field on stream, and a total of Dollars 1bn over the life of the field. Occidental Petroleum, the US major, had long-established links with the former Soviet Union through its founder, Mr Armand Hammer, once a friend of Lenin. The company announced in June that a subsidiary, Occidental of the Republic of Komi, would begin exploration activities as soon as possible on a 1.5m-acre (600,000-hectare) block in the Timan Pechora basin, after winning exclusive exploration and exploitation rights with local petroleum enterprise Ukhtaneftegasgeologia. Another US major, Texaco, is negotiating a significant production-sharing agreement in Timan Pechora. Several other joint ventures have been announced since the demise of the Soviet Union. Pennzoil, the Texas-based natural resources company, said in January that it was forming a joint enterprise with Agansk Geological, to be called the Siberian American Oil company. The venture will develop the 45m-barrel West Mogotlorsk field in the Tyumen region of western Siberia - Russia's biggest oil-producing area. In the transition towards competitive tendering for licences, however, some companies are running into problems. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, the UK independent, secured exclusive rights to study the Caspian Sea's 100m-barrel Inchke More field last October and hoped this would lead to a full development contract. Instead, a competitive tender has been called, although Premier remains confident that its early work will give it a competitive advantage. Premier is not the first western company to find the rug apparently pulled from under its feet. The so-called 3M group, consisting of US companies Marathon Oil and McDermott and Japan's Mitsui, carried out a feasibility study on developing oil and gas offshore of Sakhalin island in the Russian far east. This was superseded by a competitive tender, only to see 3M come out the winners. There is, apparently, no such threat to the deals reached by the French major Elf Aquitaine, which was the first western company to sign significant exploration deals with both Russia and Kazakhstan, after nearly three years of painstaking negotiation. Elf has two blocks of almost 20,000 sq km (7,700 square miles) between the cities of Saratov and Volgograd in Russia, and south-west of Aktyubinsk in Kazakhstan. The Russian deal was recently ratified by the Russian parliament, and Elf has said it expects up to 20 per cent of its reserves to lie in these regions by the end of the century. In the race to attract western investment, Kazakhstan has scooped up by far the biggest deals. Three months after the Elf deal, it reached a long-awaited agreement with Chevron, the fourth largest oil company in the US, to develop the huge Tengiz and Korolev fields with estimated recoverable reserves between 6bn and 9bn barrels. Less than two months later, British Gas and Agip, the Italian state-owned oil company beat off competition from British Petroleum and Norway's Statoil to win exclusive negotiating rights to develop the Karachaganak field. The field contains 20 trillion (million million) cubic feet of gas, and 2bn barrels of oil and condensate. Kazakhstan also has deals with Oman and with the privately-owned Turkish engineering company United BMB group, which signed a Dollars 1.7bn deal to exploit four oilfields and construct a gas-fired power station at Aktyubinsk. Moreover, Mobil, BP and Chevron are said to be negotiating with Kazakhstan on the Tesh-Tali in the Caspian Sea. Kazakhstan's southern neighbour Uzbekistan also recently reached agreement with the Stan Cornelius Consortium, a group of US investors, to develop its Mingbulak field, with estimated reserves of 800m barrels. Even before the break up of the Soviet Union, the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan, which also has extensive reserves,selected US major Amoco, together with partners Unocal and McDermott, to develop the Azeri field in the Caspian Sea, together with local producer Kaspmorneftegaz. Most experts agree that it will be the end of the century or beyond before these new ventures start producing enough oil to influence world crude prices. But the development of the last great oil frontier is well under way. This is the final part of a series on the oil sector of the former Soviet Union. Earlier articles appeared on July 24 and 31. THE RUSSIAN government has exempted some joint ventures in the key oil and natural gas sector from tough export taxes, but western companies and energy advisers in Moscow said the new rules did not go far enough, reports Reuter from Moscow. The rules, applying to joint ventures set up before January 1, 1992, say firms will not have to pay the tax until they have fully recovered initial investments on energy projects. 'It is certainly better than nothing, but it means there is not much hope any more for ventures registered this year,' said Mr Richard Lewis of Ernst and Young Vneshaudit in Moscow. 'Newer joint ventures will still be looking for help,' said another Western adviser. 'It is prohibitive to conduct business here with export tariffs so high.'  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

Idle CO           Summary of the proposal:     Until the methanol emission standards were promulgated in 1989, idle CO standards were only applied to Otto-cycle engines. EPA reasoned that diesel vehicles always operate at such lean fuel/air ratios that their idle CO emissions would always be well below the standards. The methanol rule applied idle CO standards to all methanol-fueled vehicles because the Agency was aware of diesel methanol vehicles which were throttled at idle. This same reasoning was applied to gaseous-fueled vehicles, and EPA proposed that idle CO standards apply to all gaseous-fueled vehicles, not just Otto-cycle vehicles.       Summary of the comments:     The few comments EPA received on this issue were in opposition to idle CO standards for engines which operate at lean fuel/air ratios. The commenters stated that lean burn engines emit very low CO levels, and that there is no need to regulate and test for emissions which are inherently low.       EPA response to the comments:     The Agency recognizes that lean burn engines do traditionally have much lower CO emissions than vehicles operating at stoichiometric fuel/air ratios. However, EPA believes that not enough data yet exists on diesel gaseous-fueled vehicles to justify their exemption from the idle CO standards. The Agency is especially concerned about those diesel designs which employ throttling at idle. It is likely that these vehicles will have no problem meeting the idle CO standards by virtue of their design and that, this being the case, the only burden this standard presents is that of the actual certification testing and reporting. Thus, certification testing waivers for diesel gaseous-fueled vehicle idle CO standards will be available to manufacturers that can demonstrate through emissions test data or other engineering data that a vehicle will, by virtue of its design, always emit at levels well below that of the applicable idle CO standard.       2. Crankcase Emissions           Summary of the proposal:     Currently, all vehicles and engines, with the exception of non-naturally aspirated petroleum heavy-duty diesel engines (HDDE), are prohibited from discharging crankcase emissions into the atmosphere. The current prohibition is not applicable to non-naturally aspirated petroleum HDDEs due to concerns that the routing of oil mist-laden crankcase gases through turbochargers and other air handling equipment may foul this equipment. With the issuance of the methanol vehicle emission standards in 1989 this prohibition was applied to all methanol HDDEs whether they were naturally aspirated or not. The reasoning was that methanol engine crankcase gases were expected to be cleaner than petroleum diesel engine crankcase gases, and closer to gasoline engine crankcase emissions which are been routinely routed through turbochargers. Given that gaseous-fueled vehicles are also expected to have cleaner crankcase emissions than petroleum diesels, this prohibition on crankcase emissions was proposed to be applicable to all gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines as well, with no exemption for non-naturally aspirated, gaseous-fueled HDDEs.       Summary of the comments:     In general, the comments received in this area were in opposition to crankcase controls for gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines. Some commenters suggested that crankcase controls only be applied to naturally-aspirated gaseous-fueled engines, as is currently the case with petroleum HDDEs. Others stated that, due to their inherently low emissions, gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines should be exempt from all crankcase emission provisions. One commenter expressed concern about crankcase gases possibly fouling turbochargers, and then went on to say that gaseous-fueled vehicle crankcase emissions will be inherently clean and thus do not need to be regulated.       EPA response to comments:     In the absence of compelling data showing that gaseous-fueled vehicle crankcase emissions are cleaner than those of their petroleum-fueled counterparts, the Agency believes it is prudent to extend the coverage of the current prohibition on crankcase emissions to include gaseous-fueled HDDEs. Additionally, EPA believes that, since the crankcase prohibition for methanol-fueled HDDEs is not limited to naturally-aspirated engines, as well as the fact that crankcase emissions are routinely routed through gasoline engine turbochargers, there is no reason to exempt non-naturally aspirated gaseous-fueled vehicles and engines from the crankcase emissions prohibition. As was noted in the leadtime discussion, the Agency expects that current technology gaseous-fueled engines will be able to meet these standards, and therefore the minimum amount of leadtime to allow for certification has been given. However, since turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs are generally derived from turbocharged petroleum HDDEs they do not tend to have crankcase emission controls. The Agency believes that, while the four year leadtime requirement in section 203(a)(3)(C) of the Act is not legally binding in the case of gaseous-fueled heavy-duty engines, in circumstances where the manufacturers must make changes to engine designs similar to those made to comply with changes in gasoline or petroleum diesel requirements, section 203(a)(3)(C) may constitute a proper default period. In order to allow for the early introduction of gaseous-fueled HDDEs, the Agency is providing four years leadtime for crankcase controls on turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs in the absence of factors indicating that another period is more appropriate. Thus, this provision will take effect for the 1998 model year. It should be noted that the four years of leadtime only applies to turbocharged gaseous-fueled HDDEs, and that the crankcase emission provisions for all other classes of gaseous-fueled vehicles will take effect with the 1997 model year mandatory certification, as well as for vehicles and engines certified optionally prior to the 1997 model year.

The plan is contained in a draft of the subcommittee's  interim report, which will be officially finalized on June 20,  the sources said.    Under a current oil products import law, only oil refiners  can import such oil products. The report, however, will propose  the law be scrapped in March 1996, they said.    Instead, the report will call for the government to  introduce  a new law to liberalize imports of petroleum products with some  limitations.    The import liberalization will allow trading firms having no  oil refining facilities to import petroleum products to help the  government promote deregulation of the petroleum industry.    When the interim report is officially adopted, the Ministry  of International Trade and Industry and the Agency of Natural  Resources and Energy will begin drafting a new law with the aim  of it being enacted at an ordinary Diet session next year, they  said.

It also breaks the monopoly of state-owned Petroecuador in some sectors. Oil companies will receive a percentage of their crude production to sell in the domestic or international market. Industry analysts say cutting bureaucratic ties between the oil companies and the government will allow Ecuador to compete with oil-producing neighbours for scarce investment capital. The country has not secured an exploration contract in five years. Contracts for the exploration and production of natural gas in the Gulf of Guayaquil in the south-west will be auctioned. Winning bidders will have up to five years to develop the field and find a market.

The ""interim draft  compilation"" of the mired details of the discussion so far will  be submitted in a ""concentrated form"" at the sixth meeting of  the subcommittee on 9 June. It is expected that only a harsh  refutation led by petroleum side members will result, the  compilation of ""an interim report"" on the same day will be  difficult, and it is certain that ""final compilation"" will be  carried over until 20 June. Although the ""compilation draft""  that will be submitted to the subcommittee on 9 June is  considered ""to have the appearance of a mosaic"" (Petroleum  Department, Agency of Natural Resources and Energy), it seems  that they have clearly worked out the direction toward  relaxation of regulations on the whole. The concern with the  contents is that the ""basis"" is the ""Memo of Major Discussion  Points"" in the form of a consolidation of previous discussions  submitted by the Secretariat to the subcommittee meeting held on  19 May. The ""draft compilation"" will probably be created  referring to this memo. Therefore, one can attempt to anticipate  the ""compilation"" via the ""Memo of Discussion Points""...    For the first point of discussion, ""In what direction should  we aim for a stable supply guarantee policy in the long term,""  noted in the memo are both the assertion that 1) ""An oil crisis  is generated every 10 years, and in the future, dependence on  the Middle East will rise, tight supply and demand are  anticipated, and we should aim at a stable supply for the future  by a consumer-site refining method,"" and the idea that 2)  ""Considering the trend toward internationalization of the  petroleum products market, especially the progress in  integration of the Asian market, it will be impossible to close  the domestic market forever, and also inappropriate from the  viewpoint of opening up future prospects for the petroleum  industry. Along with planning for internationalization of  product price levels and price structure by liberalizing  imports, we should consider a stable supply within an  international market."" However, it appears that the ""trial  draft"" on 9 June will be closer to the second point.    Concerning the second discussion point, ""Should the  consumer-site refinery method be secured by the Designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law,"" the memo  asserts: 1) ""From the importance of a stable supply, it is  necessary to secure systematically a consumer-site refinery  method by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional  Measures Law, and the insurance premium for that should properly  be borne by the public."" 2) ""The framework of the designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law has become  such that imported goods do not flow directly into the domestic  market, and it impedes the efficiency of the market and hinders  the elimination of price structure distortion and the foreign  and domestic price differential. Insurance premiums are too high  in the current arrangement."" 3) If there is an obligation for  storage of imported products to guarantee a stable supply, that  is sufficient and the law should be abrogated."" 4)  ""Consumer-site refining is both economical and efficient and,  considering that Japan's petroleum industry has international  competitive power at the refining stage, it is excessive to  guarantee the consumer-site refining system by the Designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law."" Among  these, ideas 2, 3, and 4 will probably be incorporated.    On the third point, ""Will it be necessary to review the  storage system in case of expanding imported products,"" this  issue perceives the necessity of storage and it does not appear  that it will result in a large dispute.    On the fourth point, ""To what extent should we  systematically  guarantee the quality of petroleum products in the case of  expanding imported products,"" it says: 1) ""It is necessary to  make a systematic guarantee in order to maintain the  environment, safety, and existing high quality, including  performance covering that."" 2) ""Supplying only high-quality  products robs the consumer of the opportunity of selection, and  we should supply products with diverse product quality."" 3)  ""Based on the trends of various countries of Europe and the  United States, we should continue to study in detail to what  extent it is necessary to guarantee systematically the current  high level of quality."" This issue will probably be mentioned in  the ""compiled draft"" with points 1 and 3 as the axis.    Three assertions are listed for the fifth point, ""Is it  necessary to manage the domestic distribution routes in  peacetime from the viewpoint of response in an emergency,"" but  as a whole, in preparing for a crisis and carrying out  compulsory constraints on demand, there is a strong possibility  that the direction will be indicated toward the necessity for  service stations to accurately manage supply routes.    For the sixth and final point, ""Shouldn't we proceed with  distribution efficiency,"" the focus has been on assertions that:  1) ""Service station (SS) sales are one-fourth that of the United  States and one-half that of Europe. The cost per sale is great  and we should promote further efficiency."" 2) ""Expansion of  imports is necessary for overall efficiency in the distribution  system."" 3) ""We should indicate the direction of abolishing the  designated district system based on the Gasoline Sales and  Distribution Business Law."" 4) ""It is necessary to pursue  cutting services in response to the criticism of excessive  service, and safety regulations preventing introduction of the  self-service method are excessive."" 5) ""By promoting  distribution efficiency, 400,000 people have been hired  centering on small service stations, which exerts a considerably  bad effect on service station management itself."" Here, it is  certain that a tendency is shown toward the promotion of  efficiency while being mindful of point 5. Viewed thus, the  ""interim compilation draft"" which each member will have in his  hands on 9 June will probably be rather remote from the  assertions of the petroleum industry which considers that ""the  Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law is  absolutely necessary"" (Petroleum Federation chairman, Yasuoki  Tateuchi). In any case, the ""settlement"" of ""heated argument""  anticipated by the subcommittee on 9 June will determine the  future direction of the relaxation of petroleum industry  regulations.     "

Since its foundation, development of naphtha/kerosene  utilization technology for fuel cell systems has been one of the  main programs.    The program consists of three subprograms to develop PAFC,  MCFC and SOFC systems using light petroleum fraction such as  naphtha or kerosene as raw fuel.    1. Development of PAFC    1.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for PAFC    PEC conducted a technology development program in order to  utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for  PAFC from 1986 through 1990.    Seven petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and  one  engineering/construction company participated in this program.    Main topics of the technology development are as follow:    (1) developed catalysts for hydrodesulfurization, partial  cracking hydrodesulfurization and adsorbing desulfurization of  naphtha and/or kerosene;    (2) developed noble metal based catalysts for reforming;    (3) demonstrated naphtha-fed PAFCs (50, 80, 100, 200kW).    1.2 Technology Development for Commercialization of  Naphtha-fed PAFC    Based on technologies developed in the above mentioned  program, we are now practicing a 5-year technology development  program for commercialization of petroleum-fed PAFCS. In this  program, six petroleum companies participated and two fuel cell  manufacturers cooperate with PEC.    We have manufactured two naphtha-fed commercial prototype  PAFCs (50, 200kW).    The differences between these two prototypes are seen in the  types of the reforming catalysts, reformer types, fuel cell  itself and so on.    The sizes of the prototypes were chosen because these are  generally used in cogeneration in the market.    The 50kW prototype started its operation in this past July  and is now continuing stable and satisfactory operation. It is  located in Chiba prefecture, in an ``aqua-house'' which has fair  number of Japanese type public baths in the building.    Electricity and heat are used for their water heating.    The 200kW prototype is going to start in this October and it  is located in the research facilities area of RITE (Research  Institute of Innovative Technology for the Earth) situated in  Kansai Science City in Kyoto. This 200kW prototype is one of new  energy facilities in RITE consisting of fuel cell solar energy  and wind energy test facilities.    The main stress of this project is put on catalysts  development and total fuel cell system engineering.    The reforming catalysts used in these prototypes are the  ones  developed by PEC in the preceding 5-year program and improved  later on. Also for improving the compactness of the fuel cell  packages, PEC has developed a new ejecter type naphtha  vapourizer.    The items to be verified are:    (1) demonstrate the activity and life of the  hydrodesulfurization catalysts and reforming catalysts;    (2) demonstrate the reliability of the fuel cell;    (3) for the total system, demonstrate reliability, operating  flexibility, maintenance ease, economics and so on.    1.3 Technology Development for Commercialization of  Kerosene-fed PAFC    As a raw fuel for fuel cells, kerosene is much harder to  desulfurize and reform and needs newly developed catalysts.    In a catalysts evaluating pilot plant in the Advanced  Technology  Research Institute which is an organization of  PEC,  several catalysts developed by PEC are being tested now to  decide the best one to the kerosene-fed PAFC.    The 200kW kerosene-fed experimental prototype is now being  manufactured and will start its operation in the above mentioned  laboratory in late 1994.    2. Development of MCFC    2.1 Development of Naphtha Utilization Technology for  External Reforming MCFC    PEC conducted a technology development program in order to  utilize light petroleum fraction such as naphtha as raw fuel for  External Reforming MCFC from 1986 through 1990.    One petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one  engineering/construction company participated in this program.    Summary of the technology development is as follows:    (1) developed reforming catalysts for MCFC;    (2) investigated effect of sulfur compounds and water  included in reformed gas on fuel cell components;    (3) improved materials for wet seals and electrolytes;    (4) demonstrated a naphtha-fed External Reforming MCFC  (10kW)  attaining the target efficiency of 45.    2.2 Development of Light Petroleum Fraction Utilization  Technology for Internal Reforming MCFC    PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development  program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as  naphtha for internal reforming MCFC since 1990.    Two petroleum, one electric appliances manufacturer and one  engineering/construction company have been taking part in this  program.    Outline of the technology development is as follows:    (1) demonstrated 10kW direct internal reforming MCFC stack  and test data are now checked against the design. The size is  one of the biggest in the world;    (2) 30kW direct internal reforming MCFC system will be made  in 1994 and a continuous run is planned;    (3) the mechanism of catalysts poisoning by molten carbonate  has been studied and been minimized both from liquid phase and  vapour phase. From this development, the single cell is  continuing its run beyond 6,000 hours.    3. Development of SOFC    PEC has been conducting a 5-year technology development  program in order to utilize light petroleum fraction such as  naphtha for SOFC since 1990.    Three petroleum companies have been taking part in this  program.    Outline of the technology development is as follows:    1) Tubular SOFC System    (1) Developed a thin layer electrode and electrolyte by  plasma spray which is a method to give good possibility of large  cost-down in the manufacturing of SOFC cell compared with the  ECVD method.    (2) Developed a reforming catalyst which gives methane rich  reformed gas. This reformed gas has an internal cooling effect  in a fuel cell by its heat absorption in a reforming reaction to  hydrogen and can improve the total heat efficiency by decreasing  external cooling medium.    2) Planar SOFC System    (1) Improved properties of electrolyte, electrode, and  separater and thus demonstrated a 1.3kW stack at 50 fuel  utilization, 0.2w/cm,    (2) Attained power density of 0.19w/cm at 5cm square single  cell at 40 efficiency,    (3) A 10kW stack will be attained in 1994.

0,FT944-4352 ,"FT944-4352 _AN-ELHD0AGPFT 941208   FT  08 DEC 94 / Survey of Vietnam (5): Winners yet to appear - Foreign exploration indicates gas could have greater potential than oil      By PAUL GAUNTLETT   A string of disappointing results from oil blocks in Vietnam's southern waters has punctured the optimism of the foreign energy companies which have been prospecting since 1992. Indications are that gas, not oil, could be the country's fuel of the future. None of the eight foreign operators that have drilled in the Nam Con Son basin (an area 350km south of the coastal town of Vung Tau) has struck commercially viable amounts of oil. Many, including big names such as Shell, Total and British Petroleum (BP), are still committed to drilling exploration wells as part of contractual arrangements with state oil agency PetroVietnam, but a major discovery of natural gas by BP in September has shown that the region is not as rich in oil as many firms expected. BP said when it announced the find that recoverable reserves could be about 2,000bn cubic feet, enough to generate electricity for the southern industrial centre of Ho Chi Minh City for 25 years at current levels of consumption. 'The fact that the Nam Con Son Basin is more gas prone than was first thought has become clearer and it could yield more gas discoveries,' said Michael Yeldham, BP chief executive in Vietnam. Vietnam plans to pump 7.1m tonnes of crude this year, up from 6.3m in 1993. Most of it comes from the Bach Ho (White Tiger) field, operated by the Russo-Vietnamese joint venture VietSovPetro and which was the country's only producing field until Australian operator BHP started producing small amounts at the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field in October. BHP hopes to have tapped 250,000 to 350,000 tonnes by year's end. Nearly all the crude is exported to Japan and is Vietnam's largest source of foreign currency revenue. However, these amounts are not enough to ensure Vietnam achieves targeted double digit economic growth by 2000. Hanoi is therefore keen to develop gas as fast as possible to increase foreign currency earnings and has charged the State Planning Committee with mapping out a master plan for the gas industry. Under a 'fast track' programme, priority is being given to building the infrastructure needed to bring commercially viable amounts of gas onshore. The first phase was the installation of Vietnam's first gas pipeline early this year by Korea's Hyundai Heavy Engineering. The 107km undersea pipeline runs from the Bach Ho oilfield and is designed to tap gas being flared off at a rate of 3m cubic feet a day. Test flows, due to start in November, were delayed because of an accident which damaged the pipe. The second phase involves the construction of an offshore compression platform and a liquefied petroleum gas plant on the coast near Vung Tau. British Gas and Mitsui last month finished work on a feasibility study for the Dollars 450m project. Industry sources say the speed at which Vietnam can develop its energy sector will depend on financing. Although the technical aspects of the British Gas study are clear, industry sources say there are doubts about how the second phase of the project, and any others, will attract project financing without government support. Vietnam's sovereign debt risk is still high and there is no precedent for large-scale financing. Projects would have to demonstrate sufficient foreign exchange revenues to justify any financing. 'The gas that comes ashore will be two and a half times as expensive as (that in) Indonesia or the Middle East because of the infrastructure needed to bring it ashore,' said Marie Belsey, British Gas Vietnam country manager. BP told the communist party daily Nhan Dan that it and its partners could spend as much as Dollars 1bn building production facilities offshore and an undersea pipeline to make use of the gas in Block Six, where it found gas. Up to a further Dollars 1bn could be needed to develop a market for the gas onshore, it said. Although Vietnam needs the gas domestically for power generation and fertiliser production, the government is also keen to export as much as possible, possibly to Thailand, which is known to be looking at further import sources. However, Hanoi will probably have to wait until next year to see how much gas is offshore. US firm Mobil, returning to Vietnam after a 19-year absence, is testing for gas at the Thanh Long (Blue Dragon) field but with no luck so far. Foreign firms say government planning will be crucial to successful exploitation of the country's gas. Late last month Vo Van Kiet, the prime minister, decided PetroVietnam should carry out a feasibility study looking into building Vietnam's first oil refinery in the poor province of Quang Ngai in the country's central region. The province, 525km north-east of Ho Chi Minh City, is hundreds of miles away from the offshore oilfields. Foreign oil firms were puzzled. A consortium of France's Total and Taiwanese partners had been working on a feasibility study, commissioned by state oil agency PetroVietnam, for a Dollars 1bn plant near Khanh Hoa, close to the oil industry hub of Vung Tau. The issue underlines the difficulty foreign firms prospecting for oil and gas sometimes have in gauging whether commercial priorities take precedence over political considerations as Hanoi decides how best to harness the country's energy resources. The country is also spending huge sums importing refined crude to fuel industrial growth and desperately needs its own refining capacity. PetroVietnam officials hope that as much as a third of the 6m tonnes of crude to be refined at the planned Quang Ngai plant will be shipped from Indonesia or the Middle East. But Danang, the nearest port, is too small to accommodate the kind of traffic anticipated and is not linked to major shipping lanes. Transporting the country's own crude northwards to the refinery from offshore fields off the southern coast of Vung Tau will add further costs. Meanwhile, bids have just closed on a promising oil block in the Mekong basin, closer to Vietnam's coast than the Nam Con Son basin and next to blocks with modestly encouraging finds by Japanese and Malaysian firms in June. 'The game's by no means over yet,' said BP's Mr Yeldham. 'There's still a lot of competition and the shakeout has yet to occur. 'We're not at the stage where you can say there are obvious winners and losers.'   Countries:-  VNZ  Vietnam, Asia.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Gloosy coffee-table books featuring the Caribbean island lie in the reception area. Geological maps of Cuba dot the walls, and pictures of Cuban government officials line the chairman's bookshelf. The company last summer became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Its exploration manager and another geologist will move there soon in the hope of striking rich on the three properites, totalling 1.2m acres, to which Joutel now has exploration rights. Joutel is by no means alone. BHP of Australia, the UK's RTZ, and Inco, the Toronto-based nickel producer, are among others rumoured to be seeking a foothold in Cuba. US companies are barred from direct involvement by Washington's long-standing economic embargo. Metall Mining, a subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, has already agreed to spend CDollars 1m (USDollars 756,000) over four years to acquire a 25 per cent interest in one of Joutel's properties. Another junior Canadian company, Caribgold Resources, also recently signed a joint venture with Geominera. As in the Joutel deal, costs will be equally shared by the Canadian and Cuban partners. Summing up both the risks and rewards, Mr Barry Allan, mining analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Toronto, describes Cuba as 'a promoter's dream'. It is 'genuinely an under-explored area', he says, while cautioning that 'you're talking about very early grassroots exploration and that's a high-risk activity'. Mr Hugh Harbinson, Joutel's chairman, says that 'our ambition is to find three deposits in three years.' Joutel will be looking primarily for gold, but also for a variety of base metals. Under the agreement with the Cubans, the company has up to eight years to prepare a mine feasibility study. It plans to start an airborne geophysical survey in January. Pointing to the geological map on his wall and to some colourful rocks on his desk, Mr Harbinson notes that Russian geologists have already done a good deal of preliminary exploration work in Cuba. Joutel and Caribgold each claim that several hundred mineral occurrences have been catalogued on their properties. As further evidence of Cuba's mineral wealth, the Canadians point to three nickel mines in Oriente province, on the south-east tip of the island, which have been sizeable suppliers to the former Soviet Union. The Canadian companies are being backed by a group of securities firms, including Gordon Capital and Thomson Kernaghan of Toronto and Yorkton Securities of Vancouver. They are in the process of raising CDollars 4m, mostly from Europe, to finance Joutel's share of exploration costs. Caribgold recently raised CDollars 8m. Thomson Kernaghan described Cuba in a recent research report as potentially 'one of the best new places to invest in Latin America'. It cited the island's volcanic origin, educated population and the willingness of the Castro government to allow foreign investors to repatriate profits and dividends. Mr Harbinson is unconcerned by the threat of political instability. He says that no other claims have been registered against Joutel's properties and 'we're going on the assumption that any new government will honour our contracts'.

So for the first time Latin America is emerging as the most favoured area for mining exploration, jumping from third place in 1993 to top this year. At the same time spending in the US is falling, according to the latest annual survey of mining exploration expenditure by Metals Economics Group, the Canadian consultancy. Total expenditure budgeted for this year by the 151 companies surveyed by MEG is up by a net USDollars 206.4m from the 1993 level to Dollars 9.13bn - the second successive annual increase and conclusively reversing the trend for budget cuts seen at the end of the 1980s and in the early 1990s. MEG says its survey covers about 80 per cent of world-wide expenditures. The consultants attempt to exclude from the totals any portion of diversified company budgets devoted to energy minerals, iron ore or aluminium-related exploration. Companies with budgets totalling Dollars 2.05bn give a geographic split of their spending. MEG says this shows 26.5 per cent (Dollars 543.7m against Dollars 331m in 1993) will be spent in Latin America, with Chile the most-favoured country followed by Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Peru. Meanwhile, spending in the US, which has ranged between Dollars 340m and Dollars 350m, is dropping below Dollars 325m this year, marking 'the first time that the perceived constriction caused by the more stringent US regulatory environment has actually manifested in company budget allocations'. Of the Dollars 9.13bn of total spending covered by the survey, 56.4 per cent (Dollars 1.2bn) is going towards gold exploration, up from 49 per cent (Dollars 925m) in 1993. Base metals exploration is down to 31 per cent (Dollars 660.3m), from 35 per cent (Dollars 669m). Some 57 per cent of base metals expenditure is being directed this year at copper. Grassroots spending - as distinct from exploration at or near existing mine sites - is accounting for 53.5 per cent (Dollars 1.1bn) of the total. MEG says junior companies are back in force this year and it was obliged to change its cut-off for budgets included in the survey to Dollars 2m instead of the Dollars 1m used in previous years. It estimates that about 85 junior companies not included in its survey may be spending between Dollars 1m and Dollars 2m each on exploration for non-ferrous metals and minerals this year.

Zeng Xingqiu, vice-president of China National Oil and Gas  Exploration and Development Corp. (CNODC), said exploration work  was carried out in the first, second and fourth blocks, with  AGIP, Esso and BP being the respective operators.    The three blocks, situated in the south-east of the  Taklimakan Desert, totalled 38,765 square kilometers, Zeng said.  The operators will work out exploration details and implement  them in the light of the contracts, he added.    CNODC concluded two oil contracts and one agreement on a  geo-physical survey with the three operating groups formed by 14  foreign companies after they won the bidding.    A total of 68 companies from 17 countries had expressed  interest in the five blocks China offered, although fewer tabled  tenders afterwards.    Zeng said he was satisfied with the result of the bidding,  China's first for onshore oil and gas exploration. He said the  harsh natural conditions in the desert pose severe challenges to  exploratory operations there.    The Tarim Basin, with an area of 560,000 square kilometers,  is one of the few ""virgin areas"" in the world for oil and gas  exploration. However, most of it is covered with dunes or even  sand hills, and often referred to as a ""sea of death.""    ""At a time when oil prices are stagnant, so many companies'  participation in the bidding indicates their deep interest in  China's oil and gas prospects,"" he added.    Zeng said China's second round of onshore international  bidding has fared well. This time China exposed 26 blocks for  risk exploration and 11 projects for enhancing oil recovery.    So far 76 companies from 17 countries in the world have  registered and are studying data packages. Some of them have  even made field tours, he said.

But since 80 per cent of Libya's gross domestic product derives from trade, and 97 per cent of its trade is oil exports, mostly to Europe, few analysts believe Col Gadaffi could afford to enact any self-imposed oil export embargo. Libya's oil revenues are roughly Dollars 9bn a year. Indeed, yesterday journalists from Europeo, the Italian magazine in which Col Gadaffi was reported to have made the threat of a retaliatory trade embargo, denied that the Libyan leader had specifically mentioned a cut-off of oil at all. 'Gadaffi did not actually pronounce those words,' said a Europeo spokesman. However, the dependence of some European countries on Libyan crude also makes it certain that they would oppose any tightening of sanctions against Tripoli to include a trade embargo against a supplier of rare crudes and easily reachable across the Mediterranean. According to oil industry officials, Italy, Germany and Spain privately made it clear to the US in November, when the furore over Libya's alleged role in the Lockerbie bombing came to a head, that they would not back a trade embargo against Tripoli. Their non-compliance would make any such embargo toothless. Libya sells 95 per cent of its oil and petroleum products to Europe, mostly to Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the UK - its five main trading partners  -a total of 1.33m barrels a day. There is no trade with the US since Washington imposed its own trade embargo in 1986, again over alleged Libyan complicity in a terrorist attack. Moreover, the oil imported is of a light, sweet quality upon which several refineries in Italy, Germany and Spain depend and it would be extremely difficult for these countries to replace the oil. Although the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is producing a surfeit of oil, extra capacity is only available generally in high-sulphur, heavy crudes. 'You cannot say there is any spare light, sweet crude capacity in the market,' says one analyst. 'Most light, sweet producers are operating to capacity.' Italy is at most risk from any threat of halting oil sales and other commercial activity and is viewing with concern the international community's worsening relations with Libya. Italy imports 27 per cent of its crude from Libya and is the country's principal EC trading partner. Rome has given its full backing to the UN resolutions penalising Libya for failing to hand over the two suspects in the Lockerbie bombing; but in private Italian officials have been urging caution and the need to avoid a break-down in communications with Tripoli. Italian ambivalence underlines official fears that Italy risks suffering far more from any Libyan retaliatory measures than Britain, France or the US, which have pressed hardest for sanctions. Last year Italy imported 17.4m tonnes of crude from Libya worth L5,480bn (Pounds 2.54bn), a 2 per cent drop in volume on the previous year but still 27.6 per cent of total oil imports. This is more than double the oil imported by Libya's next largest European client, Germany. It also represents 41 per cent of total Libyan oil sales. At the same time Italian companies, notably via ENI, the state oil concern, are involved in all aspects of the Libyan industry from exploration and production through to construction of refineries. Italy is studying the possibility of importing gas from a Libyan offshore field via a pipeline to Sicily. Libya is also a useful market for a wide range of Italian consumer and industrial goods which last year increased 30 per cent to L1,687bn. Alitalia, the national carrier, transported 17.6m tonnes of goods by air freight last year and more than 31,000 passengers; and the Tripoli-Rome air link is regarded as one of Libya's most important air connections. Spanish officials are also watching anxiously. Libya supplies Spain with about 10 per cent of its imported crude, though this is decreasing as Spain's three refiners have begun to secure their own upstream supplies. But about 19 per cent of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) Spain imports is Libyan. Barcelona and much of the rich industrial territory around it are heavily dependent on Libyan LNG, which is supplied under long-term contracts the Spanish have with Tripoli and Algiers. Spanish diplomats were warning yesterday that any decision to increase pressure on Tripoli would place Spain in a difficult position. 'We would be very concerned if these sanctions were hardened into a full economic embargo,' one official said. Germany, which depends on Libya for 16 per cent of its oil imports, appeared relatively unperturbed by Libyan threats. 'We have been dealing with Gadaffi since 1958 and we have been though our share of bilateral and multilateral quarrels, and not once has he interfered with our supplies,' one industry leader said yesterday. The economics ministry was equally sanguine. 'We expect no supply problems,' an official said. 'There is no shortage of oil on offer, although we cannot of course rule out price repercussions.' Swiss officials were equally unflustered. Libya supplies 15 per cent of the country's 2.6m tonnes of annual crude imports. 'If it had come a year or so ago, I would have said it was very serious,' Mr Baptist Gehr, economic adviser of the Swiss Petroleum Association, said yesterday. Since then, Libyan interests have invested heavily in oil refining and distribution activities in Switzerland, and so Mr Gehr thinks it unlikely that the Libyan government would want to damage its own operations. 'I think it is unlikely that after all this investment Libya will then refuse to supply us,' he said. In June 1990, Tamoil (Suisse), a Libyan controlled consortium, purchased a 65 per cent stake in Gatoil, Switzerland's fourth-largest oil company then in bankruptcy administration, for SFr201.25m (Pounds 77.7m). It later bought the remaining 35 per cent stake from Sasea Holding, the investment banking group headed by Mr Florio Fiorini. Britain, despite having severed diplomatic links with Libya, also imported 1.6m tonnes of Libyan refined petroleum products in 1991 while exporting Pounds 255m worth of goods, mainly machinery, to Libya. But given Britain's own domestic supplies of light oil and its political determination to bring the Lockerbie suspects to justice, the UK would likely not be as worried about a Libyan oil ban - imposed either from without or within.

0,FT942-13792 ,"FT942-13792 _AN-EDVCVAHKFT 940422   FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (12): 'About to enter a gas era' - Heady news in the hydrocarbons sector      By MARK NICHOLSON   It would have sounded unlikely even a year ago, but in the past few months oil ministry officials have begun talking cautiously about Egypt becoming a gas exporting nation by the end of the decade. There has been much excited talk - most loudly from Israel - about gas pipelines feeding Egyptian gas to its neighbour, which is already the biggest single consumer of Egypt's crude oil exports. It remains early days for all this yet. But Egyptian officials believe they have reasons to be cheerful. The cause is a sudden flush of good gas finds which led Mr Hamdi al-Banbi, Egypt's petroleum minister, to raise earlier this year, almost at a stroke, the official figure for Egypt's gas reserves from 12.8 trillion (million million) standard cubic feet to 21 trillion. Moreover, after further recent finds, particularly offshore in the Mediterranean, and the recent allocation of new and potentially gas-prone concessions, ministry officials are confident that this official reserve figure could double again. 'You can say that Egypt is about to enter a gas era,' says Mr Wafik Meshref, the state petroleum company's vice chairman for agreements. All this is heady news for a hydrocarbons sector which previously had offered little to cheer about. Egypt's oil industry, for instance, continues to pump at about its capacity of 900,000 barrels a day (b/d). Oil executives say they are doing better than they expected at prolonging the life of mature fields, but tend to rule out the prospect of big new oil finds. According to many in the industry, given present trends, significant crude production looks commercially sustainable in Egypt for little more than a decade. The oil ministry is doing what it can to squeeze life into the oil sector. Under Mr al-Banbi, the government has increased the flexibility and terms of production sharing agreements with foreign oil companies, offered bigger concessions and kept up a rolling series of bid rounds. The present round, launched in January and scheduled to close at the end of September, offers tracts in North Sinai, West Ismailia, Beni Suef basin, Abu Aradik and Sidi Barrani, near the Libyan border. All but the last of these are considered more likely to be oil than gas prone. Some oil executives in Cairo say there are 'initially encouraging' results from the application of 3-D seismic tests beneath the hitherto opaque salt layers under the Gulf of Suez, the source of most of Egypt's crude. But such promising avenues are few. Most people in the industry argue that with greater prizes available in Central Asia, Latin America and elsewhere, the continued attraction of Egypt for oil exploration alone will depend critically on yet further improvements in the terms of production sharing agreements. Gas, therefore, appears to be Egypt's best bet. According to Mr Meshref, most of the concessions awarded in the preceding bid round, which formally closed last December, are either known to have gas or seem to be gas prone. Of the five areas awarded, British Gas and Shell won the shallow Mediterranean Rosetta bloc; BG and Edison the deepwater West Delta, International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), the Agip arm; and Amoco the Rasal-Bar bloc in the eastern Mediterranean. (IEOC looks as if it may win the operating agreement for the deepwater East Delta tract.) Any real talk of prospective exports will hang crucially on the results of drilling in these concessions. But according to one of the foreign companies involved: 'There is already enough encouragement, from what we see out there, to be talking about possible exports eventually'. At present, Egypt is in no position to sell gas. For the past several years the country has been engaged in a long term policy of replacing fuel oil with gas in the country's power stations, essentially to release further crude for export. The country presently has about 170,000 b/d available for export, and crude sales last year earned Dollars 2.13bn, according to Mr al-Banbi, making it one of Egypt's main hard currency earners. By the end of this year some 75 per cent of the country's power stations will have been converted to gas, according to ministry officials, consuming roughly 64 per cent of the country's gas output. This stands presently at around 1.2m s cu ft daily. The remainder of Egypt's gas supplies the local fertiliser industry (15 per cent of the total), other industries and household consumers (a mere 1 per cent). But with domestic gas consumption rising by about 14-15 per cent a year, and at least three new gas fuelled power stations planned, proveable gas reserves will have to rise well above present levels before export plans can go much beyond their present early discussions. Nevertheless these have taken place - particularly with Israel. Egyptian officials, however, are reluctant to say anything in public (or much even in private) about these talks, beyond confirming that Mr al-Banbi has discussed possible long-term export prospects. Several foreign companies are also known to be examining the possibility of an export pipeline, notably ENI, the Italian group, which has held discussions on a link from Port Said into Gaza with a capacity of about 200m cu ft a day and a possible construction cost of Dollars 800m. Bankers in Cairo say that other proposals are being discussed but, given the continued political sensitivity of deals with the Jewish state, remain for now 'a bit hush hush,' as one banker put it. Israel and perhaps also Jordan would be a natural market, given the geography of Egypt's present and likely gas finds. Of present reserves, 38.5 per cent lie in the Mediterranean, 14 per cent in the Nile Delta and 16.8 per cent in the Gulf of Suez, with the remainder in the Western Desert. Further big finds in the Mediterranean and Delta would give real impetus to an Israeli pipeline deal. Nevertheless, Egyptian officials say cautiously that they require more detailed data on the size of a prospective Israeli market for their gas before talks with the Israelis can go much further. Moreover, the ministry is also studying Turkey as a prospective market and, possibly, Italy. For the latter, however, exports would almost certainly be feasible only through an LNG scheme, for which Egyptian officials say they would need a minimum of 5t s cu ft of gas available for export.

The emphasis is on finding more natural gas. PanCanadian holds the biggest land base for exploration in western Canada. Mr O'Brien said although the company's debt level was low, PanCanadian preferred to grow internally because of the high cost of acquisitions. PanCanadian is reducing its investment in a joint venture oil project in Russia because production was not profitable. The blended price available for Russian crude was about USDollars 13 a barrel, well below the current world price for conventional oil, said Mr O'Brien. PanCanadian's total oil production rose 30 per cent in 1993 and gas output was up 20 per cent. In the first quarter this year oil output rose 20 per cent while gas was little changed.

0,FT931-900 ,"FT931-900 _AN-DC1AGABUFT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Tory MPs urge help for tax-hit oil companies      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THERE IS growing political pressure on the government to provide transitional relief for oil companies affected by changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget. Some Conservative politicians are calling for help for smaller oil exploration companies, which stand to lose most from the tax changes. The government plans to reduce the rate of the tax on existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it on new fields. It has also removed the tax allowances for exploration and appraisal, which will hit the small independent companies hardest. The industry is split on the issue and some oil exploration companies such as Amerada Hess have mounted intense lobbying campaigns against the tax changes. Others, such as British Petroleum, have stressed the benefits of the new regime. In a written reply to a parliamentary question, the Treasury said yesterday that: 'offshore activities deemed to be commercially viable prior to the tax changes should be unaffected by the changes'. But Mr George Kynoch, MP for Kincardine and Deeside, told Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that some of the smaller companies would need transitional relief in the move to the new regime. 'I'm making sure I convey the difficulties some companies are incurring in the transitional period so that the chancellor can make some fine-tuning at the committee stage,' Mr Kynoch said yesterday. He is gathering evidence from a range of companies to present to the Treasury after the Easter recess. Present arrangements for the move to the new tax regime state that any companies with outstanding contracts for drilling work will still be able to claim exploration and appraisal relief. Many independent companies want those arrangements not only to include firm contracts, but also obligations for drilling programmes made to the government.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

EPSTEIN, Samuel S. Epstein, MD, is a professor of occupational and  environmental medicine at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at  Chicago.      With today's vote of the South Coast Air Quality Management District on its  20-year plan, and in light of new federal regulations on ozone-related gasoline  volatility, the time for tough, fundamental decisions on motor fuels is long  overdue.    The relatively low retail price charged the U.S. taxpayer for gasoline totally  fails to reflect its hidden costs. Apart from the strategic and security costs  of dependence on foreign imports, the environmental and public-health costs are  prohibitive. These include:     -- The contribution of gasoline combustion to global warming.     -- Spills from offshore and tundra drilling and marine accidents.     -- Contamination of surface and ground waters by drilling muds, hazardous  refinery wastes and effluents and leaking storage tanks.     -- Leukemia and brain and other cancers in refinery workers.     -- Atmospheric emissions from refineries responsible for cancers in  neighboring communities.     -- Emissions from the gasoline distribution system and vehicle refueling,  evaporative and exhaust emissions producing carcinogen-laced urban smog  responsible for cancer as well as heightened respiratory and cardiovascular  disease.    Gasoline is more dangerous than ever. With the phase-out of lead additives, the  aromatic content of gasoline has doubled, particularly in super premium (93  octane) gasoline. The principal aromatic hydrocarbons -- benzene, toluene and  xylene -- make up more than 40% of gasoline. Benzene is also produced by  combustion of aromatic hydrocarbons even in benzene-free gasoline.  Automobile-related emissions are responsible for 85% of the increasing national  benzene emissions, about 130,000 tons per year.    Consumers are now routinely exposed to 1 part per million (p.p.m.) benzene  during full-service gasoline refueling, and 3 p.p.m. at self-serve pumps. This  exceeds the 1 p.p.m. exposure standard above which the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration requires that workers be warned and protected. Based on  inhalation tests in rodents, the Environmental Protection Agency estimated in  1984 that the probability of developing cancer following lifetime exposure to 1  p.p.m. benzene or gasoline is about 1% and 0.1%, respectively. The Senate  Environment and Public Works Committee recently concluded that exposure to such  levels is responsible for about 220 extra cancers per year in the Los Angeles  Basin alone.    Apart from the excess risk of leukemia and cancer, Dow Chemical Co. in 1980  reported genetic damage in workers exposed to only 1 p.p.m. benzene. It is the  overwhelming consensus of the independent scientific community that there is no  way of setting safe exposure levels or tolerances to any chemical agent such as  benzene that can induce genetic damage or cancer. It is clear that gasoline, in  all phases of production, use and disposal, is a major source of environmental  and occupational carcinogens and preventable cancers.    In 1984 the American Petroleum Institute identified a new class of carcinogens  in gasoline even more potent than benzene. Long-term inhalation of unleaded  gasoline by rodents induced liver and kidney cancers that were associated with  isoalkanes in gasoline. The significance of these findings, which API initially  suppressed and subsequently trivialized, is underscored by the 142% increase in  kidney cancer in American males from 1950-1985.    Aromatic hydrocarbons, especially xylene, also contribute to the formation of  the urban ozone soup, a major cause of respiratory disease, particularly in the  young and elderly. Ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds react in the  presence of heat and sunlight.    Are these problems the price we must pay for efficient transportation and  progress? Despite industry propaganda, few modern automobiles need 93 octane  gasolines, costing 10 to 20 cents per gallon more than regular (87 octane)  unleaded. The bottom line: The petroleum industry sells gasolines we don't need  that are slowly killing us and destroying the environment.    Economical and safer alternatives to gasoline are readily available.  EPA-approved alcohol and ether fuels can replace aromatics and improve octane  in our cars with little adverse effect on human health or the environment.  Eventually, these fuels could completely replace gasoline. Fuel ethanol, used  in Brazil for years, has been sold in this country as ""gasohol,"" 10%  agriculturally derived ethanol and 90% gasoline. Despite the petroleum  industry's claims that ethanol and methanol are too expensive, compared to the  retail and hidden price we pay for gasoline, these fuels are a true bargain.    The problem lies in the petroleum industry's resistance to fuels not produced  from a barrel of crude oil. Much of today's petroleum industry is free-ranging  and multinational, indifferent to the security interests of their customer  nations, especially when supplies are cheaper elsewhere. Yet, according to the  National Security Defense Council Foundation, the petroleum industry expected  U.S. taxpayers to ante up an extra $36.25 to defend every barrel of oil that  came out of the Persian Gulf, a cost never included in the price of gasoline at  the pump. On an annual basis, this totaled $14.7 billion or roughly the annual  budget of U.S. Department of Energy.    These true externalized costs of gasoline must be reflected in tough  legislation and incentives for the expanded use of safer, clean-burning fuels,  coupled with draconian penalties on ""dirty"" fuels. Such measures would improve  public health, enhance air quality, reduce dependence on foreign oil, boost  U.S. agriculture and reduce the federal budget deficit.    In the last analysis, the multinational petroleum industry is a reckless  corporate citizen that holds the world at ransom. Time and again, when a choice  between profit and human health or the environment or national security must be  made, the industry will choose profit every time. The expeditious phase-out of  runaway petroleum technologies and ultra-hazardous, obsolete, gasoline fuels  must become an immediate national priority.

Yet, according to the  National Security Defense Council Foundation, the petroleum industry expected  U.S. taxpayers to ante up an extra $36.25 to defend every barrel of oil that  came out of the Persian Gulf, a cost never included in the price of gasoline at  the pump. On an annual basis, this totaled $14.7 billion or roughly the annual  budget of U.S. Department of Energy.    These true externalized costs of gasoline must be reflected in tough  legislation and incentives for the expanded use of safer, clean-burning fuels,  coupled with draconian penalties on ""dirty"" fuels. Such measures would improve  public health, enhance air quality, reduce dependence on foreign oil, boost  U.S. agriculture and reduce the federal budget deficit.    In the last analysis, the multinational petroleum industry is a reckless  corporate citizen that holds the world at ransom. Time and again, when a choice  between profit and human health or the environment or national security must be  made, the industry will choose profit every time. The expeditious phase-out of  runaway petroleum technologies and ultra-hazardous, obsolete, gasoline fuels  must become an immediate national priority.      Opinion    "

Its shares are expected to start trading on the Luxembourg stock exchange in mid-June. Most of the money raised will be used to bring into operation the Sanyati mine, 190km west of Harare in northern Zimbabwe. This is predicted to produce 2,500 tonnes of copper annually for the first four years, and then 5,000 tonnes for another six years. Costs will be very low, at about 45 US cents a lb. Reunion will own 75 per cent of the mine but carry all the costs. The rest will be owned by the Zimbabwe government. Reunion is also one of the most active exploration companies in Zimbabwe, concentrating on diamonds. The company says it had completed regional exploration of 43,570 sq km, representing 11 per cent of the surface of Zimbabwe.   Companies:-  Reunion Mining.   Countries:-  LUZ  Luxembourg, EC.

The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's   Rule         EPA is promulgating UTS for organics in nonwastewaters as   proposed with the exception of the standards for m- and p-cresols. These are the only organic constituents for which   commenters provided data supporting changes to the proposed UTS.   Although organic nonwastewater UTS differ in some cases from the   previously promulgated standards, the same technology basis,   combustion, can meet the limits. In the previous standards as   well as the UTS, the organic standards are based on a detection   level in a combustion residue (adjusted upward by a variability   factor accounting for analytic and process variability). Differences between UTS and previous standards reflect a more   consistent assessment of achievable detection levels for various   constituents in combustion residues, and continue to be   achievable using BDAT, combustion. Because the essential   technical issue at the heart of these adjustments is the value of   the detection limit, most of these changes reflect analytical artifacts rather than absolute differences in the quantities of   toxics available for release following land disposal.         ii. Modifications to Universal Treatment Standards Made in   Response to Comments         A petroleum refiner involved in building a biological   treatment system submitted data on organic nonwastewaters, and   indicated their concern about the lower treatment standards for   certain organic constituents that were proposed as UTS. The   Agency evaluated the commenter's data and found, in some cases,   the commenter was requesting that UTS levels be set at levels   higher than the maximum levels in their untreated wastes.   Furthermore, the commenter's data did not represent proper   monitoring. The Agency was able to determine from their data,   however, that one limit, the proposed m- and p-cresol limit,   should be raised from 3.2 mg/kg to 5.6 mg/kg. This adjustment is   based on other factors described below.     The proposed UTS for m- and p-cresol was 3.2 mg/kg, which   differed from the proposed UTS for o-cresol, which was 5.6 mg/kg.   Today's rule promulgates 5.6 mg/kg for both o-cresol and m- and   p-cresol. The proposed limits for cresols were based on a   detection limit of 2 mg/kg for o-cresol and 1 mg/kg for m- and p-cresol from an incinerator ash study used to develop nonwastewater standards in the Third Third rulemaking. The differences in detection limits occurred because EPA used different treatment tests to set the limits for o- versus m- and   p-cresol. Examination of the same test runs revealed that where   o-cresol had a detection level of 2 mg/kg, the detection level   for m- and p-cresol was also 2 mg/kg. In addition, where the   detection level for m- and p-cresol was 1 mg/kg, the detection   level for o-cresol was also 1 mg/kg. Upon further review of   other data, the Agency observed that within a test, o-cresol and   m- and p-cresols had the same detection levels. The numbers for   o-cresol and m- plus p-cresol promulgated in today's rule were   calculated with the same detection limit, as justified by the   data review, and the same recovery factor. The resulting   identical treatment standards reflect the fact that incineration   treats both of these isomer groups to the same level, within the   existing analytical constraints.         iii. Use of Alternative Treatment Technologies to Combustion         In establishing numerical treatment standards, the Agency   allows the use of any technology (other than impermissible   dilution) to comply with the limits. Some previous standards,   namely those for petroleum refining wastes, were based on   combustion as well as thermal desorption and solvent extraction.   Under UTS, organic nonwastewater standards are based on and   achievable by combustion. As for other technologies, EPA   assessed whether the changes in limits disrupted commitments made   to use these other technologies. With regard to thermal   desorption, EPA examined comments on the proposed levels by three     vendors of thermal desorption units (Seaview Thermal Systems   (STS), Separation and Recovery Systems, Inc. (SRS), and Ecova   (formerly Waste Tech Services)), BDAT Background Development   Documents for treatment standards applicable to petroleum wastes,   the Marathon delisting petition, and other available literature.     These data demonstrate the achievability of UTS by thermal   desorption for petroleum refining wastes. This was an expected   result, given the comments on the Phase I LDR rule which   addressed F037 and F038 petroleum refining wastes. In these   comments, a thermal desorption company called for limits lower   than today's UTS limits (these data reflected lower detection   levels, not necessarily better treatment than today's UTS). Also   important in the use of thermal desorption are the operating   conditions: raising the temperature, and/or the detention time   increases the amount of hazardous organic constituents desorbed.     As for solvent extraction, the data used for development of   the K048K052 treatment standards achieved UTS levels for about   half of the demonstration runs. Operating conditions, such as   solvent selection, solvent to waste ratios, detention time, and   number of treatment passes significantly affect treatment   results, and the agency believes these parameters can be adjusted   to comply with the UTS. There may, however, be other factors   which result in this technology not being selected, and based on   information available to the Agency, no petroleum refining   facilities are utilizing solvent extraction.     EPA requested comments on the achievability of the proposed   UTS for petroleum refining wastes when treated via noncombustion   technologies. (See 58 FR 4810648107.) EPA also requested   comments on whether the industry has invested in non-combustion   technologies, including those designated as BDAT in previous   rules that cannot meet the UTS. In particular, EPA requested   information on the type of treatment, performance data, and an   explanation of why existing treatment could not be adjusted and   operated more efficiently to comply with the UTS. EPA also   pointed out it was willing to revise the proposed UTS, if data   indicated that appropriate noncombustion technologies could   achieve slightly higher levels than those proposed for UTS.     Only one commenter, Valero, Inc., submitted comments with   regard to a contractual agreement for the construction of a full   scale bioslurry reactor and data from a bench scale treatability   study. None of the other petroleum refining commenters indicated   they had invested in noncombustion technologies. Valero, Inc.,   and two remediation companies, Retec Technologies and OHM   Corporation, submitted data on biotreatment of organic   constituents. They reported treatment efficiencies from 40 to 60   percent for some PNAs and questioned whether the proposed   treatment standards can be routinely achieved by biotreatment   technologies. EPA does not generally consider such treatment   efficiencies adequate for organic constituents. As indicated   previously, facilities can use any technology other than   impermissible dilution to comply with the treatment standards.   If design and operating conditions can be adjusted to meet the   limits, this could be full compliance. If not, the technology   may still be appropriate for remediation wastes, for which   standards are currently being revised in the development of HWIR.         "

Britain wants to replace a one-year accord struck last December with a long-term agreement that protects the Falkland islands' revenues, while Argentina wants to increase substantially its fishing effort. The unresolved dispute over the Falklands, which Argentina claims despite defeat in its 1982 conflict with Britain, charges the talks with considerable political significance. Argentina began issuing fishing licences in competition with the Falklands this year for the first time. Although it agreed in December to sell only 45 licences, it still forced a 12 per cent drop in the islands' licensing revenues. In the financial year ending in June, the Falklands raised Pounds 23.5m in licensing revenues, compared with Pounds 26.8m in 1991-92. The Falklands Fisheries Directorate is planning to lower the price of its licences further and forecasts revenues this year of only Pounds 15m to Pounds 15.5m. Argentina also protested against London's decision earlier this year to extend to 200 miles the territorial waters surrounding the British-held South Georgia and South Sandwich islands, which Argentina also claims. The UK has introduced a licensing regime similar to the Falklands for the two islands. Buenos Aires is also using the fisheries talks to press for a role in the development of possible oil and gas reserves in waters surrounding the Falklands. The islanders have so far rejected oil talks with Argentina and last year licensed two companies to carry out preliminary seismic surveys. The islands plan to offer acreage to companies in 1994.

But Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the withdrawals had not significantly affected the success of the latest offshore licensing round, which was the largest for 20 years. The government yesterday awarded 110 blocks for offshore oil exploration out of the 484 put on offer as part of the largest range of offerings since 1972. Oil companies showed much interest in important new areas for exploration such as the area west of the Shetland Isles, and Cardigan Bay off the Welsh coast. Mr Eggar said he had particularly strong hopes for the area west of Shetland. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new province which will be very significant for the future of the industry and UK oil production,' he said. But oil companies have been protesting about the government's proposed changes to North Sea taxes. Mr Eggar said that, with the seven withdrawals, some companies had altered their original work programmes in response to the tax change. The PRT reforms would reduce the rate of tax paid on existing fields but abolish tax relief for exploration work. Companies had committed themselves to drill 93 wells, but this was lower than had been expected before the tax changes, Mr Eggar said. The Department of Trade and Industry has imposed stringent new environmental requirements on many companies which have been awarded blocks close to the coast. This affected 35 blocks and Mr Eggar announced measures to monitor closely companies' adherence to their environmental plans. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it was alarmed by Mr Eggar's announcements yesterday. It said the UK was in the process of implementing a directive from the EC to protect natural habitats which could ban industrial activity in some coastal waters.

The plan to allow four exploration wells in the Skagerrak is part of a wider project to increase offshore exploration acreage by 16 per cent in a bid to offset a steep decline in crude oil production expected after 1996 by Norway. The proposals are due to be voted on by the Norwegian Storting by June 15. But opposition is also mounting within the parliament to allowing any drilling in the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern Norwegian coast. Environmentalists and fishermen have rallied support for their objections, despite the government's intention to restrict drilling to one well at a time and to bar drilling during the summer prawn harvest.

The two sides are negotiating an accord under which community vessels would be allowed to fish in Argentine waters, at present closed to foreign ships, in exchange for reduced tariffs on its exports to EC markets plus an aid and investment package. A community diplomat said the two sides had 'reached a substantial level of agreement on the text and both sides are looking at the text with a view to initialling it before the end of the year'. An Argentine official was more optimistic, saying it should be signed by the end of this month. Negotiators have been searching for a form of words that circumvents Argentine law banning foreign fishing vessels from its waters. The treaty is expected to allow EC vessels to operate in Argentine waters on a joint venture, charter or temporary lease basis. The difficulty is that flying the Argentine flag would force EC ships to submit to restrictive local regulations. Under previous accords EC ships sail under their national flags. Another delicate item involve Argentina's claim to the Falkland islands, which are held by Britain. The British have apparently won concessions that exclude the Falklands' waters from the accord and limit the quota of Illex squid available under the community accords. Argentina last month announced that it would compete with the islanders for the lucrative squid catch, at present monopolised by the Falklands.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

However, the negative impact of recent UK tax changes resulted in after-tax profits sinking by 17 per cent to Pounds 3.83m (Pounds 4.63m). The company yesterday confirmed that the government's removal of tax concessions for exploration activities in last March's Budget was affecting short-term cash flow and earnings. Its Petroleum Revenue Tax credit in the period was Pounds 1.69m, against Pounds 4.1m. Mr Douglas Baker, chairman, said the change had 'adversely affected the risk/reward ratio of exploration in the United Kingdom continental shelf'. He added that Hardy would continue to explore in UK waters, but 'opportunities there will have to be more rigorously justified'. The effect of the UK tax changes were partially offset by Hardy's strong position in the US, which accounted for half of group operating profits, which almost doubled to Pounds 6m (Pounds 3.2m). The US contribution was Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 984,000), the result of higher volumes, stronger US gas prices and positive foreign exchange movements. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 2.14m (Pounds 527,000). Earnings per share were 3.8p (5p). Mr Baker noted that Hardy's high levels of gas production, accounting for two thirds of current output, had reduced its vulnerability to low oil prices. He predicted that Hardy would continue to benefit from rising gas production in the US, where prices remained buoyant because of seasonal high demand. 'The group's operating cash flow, even at current levels, should substantially exceed that for last year,' he added. The company also pointed to exploration successes in Canada and Pakistan as positive factors for future growth.   Companies:-  Hardy Oil and Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Resources would  be distributed, and prices fixed by the state in a unified  manner.    In the past few years, the issue of Liaoning's irrational  management system as well as unreasonable prices of oil products  has become more conspicuous with each day. Dispersed resources  of oil products, overlapping in management, failure in price  control, and chaos in the market have become more and more  serious, thus providing the soil for speculators, profiteers,  and law and discipline violators to take the opportunity to reap  staggering profits and engage in corrupt practice. Therefore,  it is necessary to take effective measures to reform the current  circulation system of crude oil and refined oil, to strengthen  the macro-management of the production and circulation of crude  oil and refined oil, to rationalize the prices of oil products,  to rectify the order of circulation, to reduce circulation  links, and to establish, step by step, a standardized, vigorous,  and orderly circulation system of crude oil and refined oil  which meets the demands of a socialist market economy.    The major content of this reform is to achieve reasonable  distribution of resources, letting the refineries belonging to  the Petrochemical General Company process land crude oil and  imported crude oil in a unified manner. For the marketing of  refined oil, distribution will be made under state guidance to  change the duplicate and decentralized management. The prices  will be fixed by the state. The state's control of the producer  prices, wholesale prices, and retail prices of crude oil and  refined oil not only ensures the profits of the producers and  consumers but also keeps the prices stable. Categorization of  taxes and rate of taxation will be unified. Unified tax  categories and tax rates will be applied to all the coastal  areas, inland areas, special zones, and development zones as  well as state-owned, collective, ""three types of  foreign-funded,"" and individual enterprises which deal in crude  oil and refined oil. Governments at all levels should not give  them preferential treatment by reducing or exempting their taxes  or fix their tax quotas. Sale channels should be made  reasonable, and intermediate links should be reduced.  Provincial, city, and county petroleum companies should be the  main channels of selling refined oil, and the resources of  refined oil should be distributed by the petroleum companies at  all levels in a unified manner according to plans. All  refineries should sell petroleum only to petroleum companies.  Current refined oil wholesale organizations should be screened  and reorganized, and retail gas stations (spots) should be  rectified. Party, government, and army organs at all levels are  not permitted to engage themselves in the wholesale and retail  sale of crude oil and refined oil. The wholesale organizations  which have been reorganized will be brought into the main sales  channels. Gas stations, which prove qualified to engage in the  business after joint investigation and rectification, should  phase in the system of sales on a commission basis. They should  replenish their stock from the local petroleum companies and  sell according to the retail price set. Those who do not sell  at the set price, pass the bad off as the good, give short  measure, and evade taxes will have their oil supplies stopped  and their status as sales agents canceled.     "

Operating revenues were ADollars 276.4m, compared with ADollars 330.9m a year earlier. The move into the red was blamed on weak prices and demand. Renison said that tin prices were more than 20 per cent lower than a year ago while copper was down by 15 per cent, and that prices for titanium dioxide feedstock products were also depressed. The effect of these significantly lower prices was partially offset by strengthening zircon and gold prices, and the Namara open-cast coal mine made a ADollars 6m profits contribution, meeting its contracted sales since the mine started up. But, although there were no abnormals charges in either first-half period, the latest results do include ADollars 3.8m of restructuring costs, related to both the exploration division, which was overhauled during the first half, and the head office. Renison said yesterday that the changes to the exploration side would mean more effort being expended on exploring for gold, base metals and mineral sands in specific regions of Australia. Offshore activities would 'concentrate on the identification of advanced exploration targets'. Its Canberra exploration office is being closed and the division will be managed from Perth. Both the mineral sands and the tin interests were loss-making in the first half as was the Mount Lyell copper mine. On the gold front, the group's interest in the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea - which was reduced from 30 per cent to 25 per cent at end-February 1993 - contributed ADollars 35.7m, compared with ADollars 40m last time. Mr Tony Cotton, the Hanson director who was appointed deputy chairman of Renison in October, will become chairman of the company on March 1. He takes over from Mr Max Roberts, who is retiring.

In January, Korean oil companies imported petroleum for 13  to  14 U.S. dollars per barrel, but as the current price is 15  dollars it is necessary to reduce oil prices by 4 to 5 percent,  Director General Han Chun-ho said.    Han announced on Friday at a seminar sponsored by the Korea  Petroleum Association that the government would adopt a policy  linking domestic oil prices to the average price of petroleum  imported the previous month and to exchange rates. Han added  that the government will adjust domestic oil prices on the 15th  day of every month.    Under the plan, the government will announce oil prices on  the 14th of every month through the Korea Petroleum Association  and apply the new prices on the 15th. The government plans to  limit its involvement in deciding oil prices, but if a sudden  international incident arises like the Gulf crisis and prices  increase sharply, it will intervene in setting prices to prevent  economic disorder. However, the government will continue to  control the price of liquefied petroleum gas.     "

Today, Mexico is a country that owns its future  more. It follows specific paths, it is better organized, more  sur of itself and its enormous potencial for advancement. You  have undertaken your duties with patriotism and are fulfilling  the responsibilities given to you by the people.    As in past years, in 1993, Mexican Petroleum [Pemex] worked  following the main guidelines of your policy, the defense of  oil. All actions taken follow these main guidelines. This  explains the efforts made to make Pemex efficient and make it  highly competitive. An in-depth administration reorganization  was conducted. The four Pemex subsidiaries are working normally.  Pemex reported a reduction in its debt by $68 million. In other  words, the total plan for investment was carried out with our  own resources.    For a third consecutive year, the production level for total  liquid hydrocarbons surpassed the record reached in 1982. The  total production for 1993 reached 3.131 million barrels per day,  of which 1.794 million barrels were assigned for domestic  consumption and 1.337 million barrels for exports. In the past  three years, an increase in the reserves of hydrocarbons allowed  restoring three-quarters of the production extracted during that  period, thus reversing a long-standing trend.    The creation of Pemex-Gas and Basic Petrochemicals  [Petroquimica Basica] was a prelude to the significance the use  of clean fuels and basic raw material will have in processing  petrochemicals in Mexico and worldwide. The production of  natural gas reached 3.576 billion [figure as heard] cubic feet a  day while that of liquefied gas reached 103,000 barrels a day.    Environmental protection, industrial safety, and energy  savings have been placed at the forefront of Pemex's program.  Several preventive and active programs have been encouraged in  close cooperation with the Social Development Secretariat and  the Metropolitan Commission for the Prevention and Control of  Environmental Pollution to the Valley of Mexico. During the last  fiscal period, more than 215 installation safety inspections  were carried out by insurance companies and specialized  corporations, as well as more than 1,000 environmental impact  studies. Following strict budgetary constraints, Pemex has been  able to improve its financial position, meet its production and  marketing objectives, and implement internal restructuring. In  addition, it has promoted a new institutional culture through  the adoption of modern operational practices in a state owned  enterprise.    At the end of this administration, Pemex will have  transferred to the Treasury $106 billion over a six year period.  Pemex's assets totals $50 billion and the value of proven  reserves, valued at $13 per barrel is approximately equal to  $850 billion. In addition, Mexican sovereignty over subterranean  resources and revenues from crude oil exploration assures energy  security as well as an instrument to realize structural changes  in the Mexican economy. The question we should now ask is if we  Mexicans are willing to transfer ownership, management, or use  of this patrimony to private interests? PEMEX workers have  expressed solidarity with the companies' institutional  objectives, and cooperated in moving forward toward goals of  modernization.    The workers union has been intransigent in defending its  collective contract, but it has preferred the collective  interest over outdated demands for economic concessions and  political power. Now, one year after the law was promulgated, we  can feel satisfaction to report that Pemex's new organization  system has been implemented and is working; the four subsidiary  companies are operating normally; and the benefits of the  reforms are beginning to capitalize.    Noteworthy is the fact that efficiency has reduced operation  costs by 39 percent during 1981-93, 29 percent for the current  six-year period. Yearly savings for 1994 represent 60 percent of  the investment plan. Not only has the oil community put an end  to the waste of the past, but it has also organized the true  defense of the nations's institutional interests for the future.  [passage omitted]     "

The deal marks a welcome success for the Transitional Council, which had pledged to end months of delay over the signing and clear the way for more foreign and private sector investment in the sector. Similar deals are expected shortly with other foreign oil companies, including Elf Aquitaine, Mobil Corporation, Chevron and Agip and with the alliance of Statoil and BP, whose Nigerian assets were nationalised in 1979. If exploration agreements were made for the 65 new areas, it would help Nigeria to hit its target of 25bn barrels of recoverable reserves by 1995 with no initial outlay by the government. Shell has set up a new company for exploration and production in new areas, operating purely as a contractor and taking all the risk in developing five new exploration blocks awarded by the government in December 1991. Under the new agreement, there is no guaranteed minimum nor any upper limit on the foreign operator's earnings. The Nigerian government will receive signature bonuses of Dollars 30m each for licensing the two deep offshore blocks and less than Dollars 1m each for three large onshore permits in the Benue basin. The new terms replace the joint ventures with the state-owned National Petroleum Corporation in which foreign companies hold minority stakes. Shortage of cash recently forced NNPC to cut investment in these ventures. Oil Secretary Mr Philip Asiodu said: 'Exploration sharing is better for Nigeria because we can save scarce funds for more pressing needs'. These include the state monopoly on oil refineries and distribution, which is near to collapse, leading to fuel shortages in most parts of Nigeria. The new signing is also a boost for Shell, the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, which has been caught up in controversy as the technical adviser on the delayed Liquefied Natural Gas project.

Indicia of Ownership      EPA is proposing that ``indicia of ownership'' means ownership or evidence of an ownership interest in a petroleum UST or UST system. EPA is not proposing to limit or qualify type, quality, or quantity of ownership indicia that may be held by a person for the purpose of the regulatory exemption. The nature of the ownership interest may vary according to the type of secured transaction and the nature of the holder's relationship (such as that of a guarantor or surety). Accordingly, indicia of ownership may be evidence of any ownership interest or right to an UST or UST system, such as a security interest, an interest in a security interest, or any other interest in an UST or UST system. For purposes of this proposed rule, examples of such indicia include, but are not limited to, a mortgage, deed of trust, or legal or equitable title obtained pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents, a surety bond, guarantee of an obligation, or an assignment, lien, pledge, or other right to or form of encumbrance against an UST or UST system. Accordingly, it is not necessary for a person to hold actual title or a security interest in order to maintain some indicia or evidence of ownership in an UST or UST system.      3. Primarily To Protect a Security Interest      EPA is proposing that the term ``primarily to protect a security interest'' as used in this proposed regulation means a holder's indicia of ownership are held primarily for the purpose of securing payment or performance of an obligation. EPA intends this phrase to require that the ownership interest be maintained primarily for the purpose of, or primarily in connection with, securing payment or performance of a loan or other obligation (a security interest), and not an interest in the UST or UST system held for some other reason.  A security interest may arise pursuant to a variety of statutory or common law financing transactions. While a security interest is ordinarily created by mutual consent, such as a secured transaction within the scope of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code, there are other means by which a security interest may be created, some of which may or may not be the result of a consensual arrangement between the parties to the transaction. In general, a transaction that gives rise to a security interest within the ambit of this proposed rule is one that provides the holder with recourse against an UST or UST system of the person pledging the security; the purpose of the interest is to secure the repayment of money, the performance of a duty, or of some other obligation.     See generally     J. White  R. Summers,     Handbook on the Uniform Commercial Code     22 (2d Ed. 1980);     Restatement of Security     (1941).  As a matter of general law, security interests may arise from transactions in which an interest in an UST or UST system is created or established for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation, and includes mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, and title held pursuant to lease financing transactions. Security interests may also arise from transactions such as sale-and-leasebacks, conditional sales, installment sales, trust receipt transactions, certain assignments, factoring agreements or accounts receivable financing agreements, consignments, among others, provided that the transaction creates or establishes an interest in an UST or UST system for the purpose of securing a loan or other obligation.  In contrast, ``indicia of ownership'' held ``primarily to protect [a] security interest'' do not include evidence of interests in the nature of an     investment     in the UST or UST system, or an ownership interest held primarily for any reason other than as protection for a security interest. The person holding ownership indicia to protect a security interest may have additional, secondary reasons for maintaining the indicia in addition to protecting a security interest; maintaining indicia for reasons in addition to protecting a security interest may be consistent with the exemption and this proposed rule. However, any such additional reasons must be secondary to protecting a security interest in the secured UST or UST system. EPA recognizes that lending institutions have revenue interests in the loan transactions that create security interests; such revenue interests are not considered to be investment interests, but are considered secured transactions falling within the proposed security interest regulatory exemption.      4. ``Holder'' of Ownership Indicia      A ``holder'' as used in this proposed regulation is a person who maintains ownership indicia primarily to protect a security interest, however acquired or held. The term ``holder'' includes the initial holder (such as the loan originator) and any subsequent holder, such as a successor-in-interest, subsequent purchaser on the secondary market, loan guarantor, surety, or other person who maintains indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest. The term also includes any person acting on behalf of or for the benefit of the holder, such as a court-appointed receiver or a holder's agent, employee, or representative.  Finally, it should be noted that lending institutions, which typically hold a large number of security interests, may also act in some trustee, fiduciary, or other capacity with respect to an UST or UST system. However, this rule does not address circumstances in which a lending institution or any person acts as a trustee, or in a non-lending capacity, or has any interest in an UST or UST system other than as provided in this rule. Because this proposed regulation, as well as the exemption in section 9003(h)(9), addresses only persons who maintain a ``security interest,'' any discussion of persons with other interests or involvement in an UST or UST system is beyond the scope of this proposed rule. Of course, a trustee or other fiduciary with respect to an UST or UST system (or any person who independent of the status as trustee or fiduciary) who holds indicia of ownership in the UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest may fall within this proposed security interest regulatory exemption.

The executives, in interviews at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum  Institute, said they are basing their plans for modest increases in spending  next year on expectations that oil prices will stabilize in the low  $20s-per-barrel range once the crisis is resolved.    Such prices would be higher than before Iraq invaded Kuwait, but lower than  they are now.    On Monday, crude oil for December delivery closed down $2.02 a barrel at $31.87  in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.    Although increased oil revenues have prompted some companies -- including  Unocal Corp. and Chevron Corp. -- to speed up drilling plans, executives said  their long-range strategies remained unaffected by the crisis, which has driven  prices as high as $40 in recent months.    ""This is a long-term business, and you don't turn the money on because the oil  price spikes,"" said Lawrence G. Rawl, chairman of Exxon Corp.    Although spending plans vary from company to company, many of the executives  said they would boost spending on exploration and production of oil,  particularly overseas. In refining and marketing, there is a complicating  factor as oil companies prepare their 1991 budgets: the unknown costs of  retrofitting refineries to meet requirements of the proposed federal clean air  act.    Rawl said Exxon, the nation's largest oil company, would probably spend a  little more than the $8.3 billion it expects to spend in 1990.    Exxon plans few changes in its current allocations, with about 20% to 25% of  the budget going to refining and marketing, 10% to chemicals and the rest to  exploration and production. About 65% of Exxon's exploration and production  budget is spent overseas, the rest in the United States.    As for the effects that the clean air act might have on spending, he said Exxon  had not placed a figure on it -- ""but it's going to cost a lot.""    No. 2 Mobil Corp. will spend more than $6 billion in 1990, considerably higher  than before, said Chairman Allen E. Murray, who also is API's board chairman.    ""We have a very aggressive budget that we adopted for the year 1990, one of the  highest we've ever had, because we think things look good for the oil industry,  and the basics seem to be coming back into line,"" Murray said.    But for next year, he added, ""if you're asking me if I'm suddenly going to set  our exploration people loose assuming (that the price of oil is $40 a barrel),  the answer is we are not.""    Texaco Inc. plans to spend about $3.1 billion in 1991, an increase over 1990's  estimated $2.9 billion and 1989's $2.3 billion, said James W. Kinnear,  president and chief executive. About two-thirds of that will go to exploration  and production, he said. Texaco will spend another $600 million through  affiliated companies, he added.    Chevron Corp.'s 1990 capital spending will come in at $4 billion. Next year,  ""it will be up a not-insignificant amount,"" said Chairman Kenneth T. Derr.    Much of the exploration and production money will go overseas, he said.    He estimated that the company also must spend more than $500 million in the  next five years just to meet initial requirements of the clean air act, though  he declined to guess total costs.    British Petroleum will increase capital expenditures ""something more than  inflation"" from current levels of about $6.5 billion worldwide, said James  Ross, president of subsidiary BP America Inc.    Ross expects spending in the United States, which is more than $2 billion a  year, to go up slightly next year.    At Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., ""we're going to be drilling more  wells next year, so our spending will be up some,"" said Chairman Lodwrick M.  Cook.    He estimated that spending would increase to around $3.5 billion, with  expenditures heavily weighted to Arco's U.S. operations in Alaska and the lower  48 states.    Unocal Corp. will boost capital spending more than $1.1 billion above 1990's,  said Chairman Richard J.

Philippine officials in May gave the green light to Alcorn  Petroleum and Minerals Corp. and US partner Vaalco Energy Inc.  of Houston, to begin preliminary exploration work on the Reed  Bank, an undersea structure near the South China Sea chain.    The six-month, non-exclusive contract includes ""research and  library work"" on aeromagnetic surveys and other data held by the  Department of Energy.    Philippine energy officials insist the area where the  exploration would be conducted is not part of the Spratlys -- a  chain of atolls in the South China Sea claimed wholly by China  and in part by Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and  Vietnam.    The Spratlys are believed to sit atop vast deposits of oil  and natural gas and also straddle strategic sea lanes. All  claimants but Brunei have stationed troops on islets in the  chain.    Analysts say Manila's recent move would strengthen its  sovereignty over islets, reefs and atolls it has garrisoned, but  could also have a political and diplomatic impact on efforts to  peacefully resolve the territorial dispute and suggestions for  joint development of the area.    ""It's a response to what the Chinese and Malaysians are  doing,"" Julius Cesar Parrenas, director of the International  Institute for Strategic Studies, told AFP.    He was referring to Beijing's granting of a contract to the  US-based Crestone Energy Corp. to explore for oil in the area,  prompting vehement protests from Vietnam. Malaysia has also  embarked on a project to develop a resort in the Spratlys.    ""One means of strengthening sovereignty is by already having  activity there, such as a contract of government or development  plans,"" he said, adding that exploration was a good move by the  Philippines.    Noel Morada, an analyst with the Institute for Strategic and  Development Studies, said what is crucial to the Philippines'  move is the reaction of China and Vietnam.    ""Since we are taking this particular action, we should be  prepared of the possible consequences,"" he said. ""This is an  economic move which has political implications.""    Energy Secretary Delfin Lazaro and Undersecretary Rufino  Bomasang on Tuesday sought to forestall trouble by insisting the  permit granted to Alcorn was limited to the Reed Bank and did  not include areas in the Spratlys.    The Reed Bank is an underwater structure between the  Philippine island of Palawan and most of the Spratlys.    Lazaro and Bomasang said Manila had done exploratory  drilling  there in the 1970s, which had not been disputed by other  claimants, adding that political and diplomatic repurcussions  had been considered before the permit was granted.    Alcorn said in a statement the research permit only covered  the Reed Bank and excluded the disputed areas of the Spratlys.    But the statement said the area of coverage also includes  Patag and Lawak islands -- two of the eight small islands and  reefs garrisoned by Philippine marines and collectively referred  to by Manila as the Kalayaan (Freedom) group.    The group was annexed in a presidential decree by the late  dictator Ferdinand Marcos.    The Philippines has become an attractive site for oil  exploration with news of recent oil strikes off Palawan,  confirming the country's potential. It has programmed 18 wells  for drilling this year, many in frontier areas.     "
0,FT921-23 ,"FT921-23 _AN-CC4BOAFWFT 920331   FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Write-downs mar Santos year      By KEVIN BROWN   SANTOS, the Australian energy group, yesterday reported a net loss of ADollars 111m (USDollars 85m) for the year to the end of December after writing down the value of its Timor Sea and US activities by ADollars 225m. Santos said its pre-tax operating profit of ADollars 223m was a record, with the exception of 1985 and 1990, when oil prices exceeded ADollars 40 a barrel for part of the year. Oil prices averaged ADollars 28 in the year to December. The group said net profit before abnormal items was ADollars 114m, compared with ADollars 137m in the previous year. However, the result was struck after foreign exchange losses of ADollars 11m, compared with ADollars 1m in the previous year. The 1990 result also included a profit of ADollars 12m from the sale of UK operations. The write-downs, which were foreshadowed in the 1990 annual report, follow a disappointing exploration programme in the Timor Sea. Of 12 wells scheduled to be drilled during the year, eight were dry and the remainder were postponed or abandoned. The biggest write-down was ADollars 154m against unsuccessful exploration expenditure in a number of permit areas which will be relinquished this year or next. A further ADollars 80m related to producing licences acquired with Peko Oil. The group said it would maintain an active exploration programme in the Timor Sea. However, it plans to drill only five exploration wells and carry out 15,000 kilometres of seismic testing this year. Santos said it would begin exploration efforts this year in the North Sea, Cambodia and Colombia, where interests had been acquired since June 1991. Exploration would continue in the US and Malaysia, but would be reduced in the Timor Sea and the Cooper Basin in South Australia. The US write-down of ADollars 40m reflects a lower valuation for the group's gas assets. The board said the group's US assets were now centred on Weeks Exploration, a growing exploration company with good growth potential. Sales revenue fell 7.6 per cent ADollars 656m from the 1990 record of ADollars 709m. The fall was caused by lower crude oil prices compared to 1990, when the Gulf war inflated prices, and lower volumes for all products except naphtha. The directors declared an unchanged final dividend of 10 cents per share, fully franked.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

The contract awards exploration rights for six years over an 880,000-hectare (2.2m-acre) area of the Peruvian Amazon, attractive for its proximity to the north eastern oil pipeline. Occidental is Peru's oldest established private operator, responsible for almost half of the country's present crude output of about 120,000 barrels a day. The signing underlines a new willingness by the Peruvian state to speed up approval for contracts with private operators. Petroperu's president, Mr Jaime Quijandria, points out that Peru, although almost virgin territory in oil terms, 'is not the only petroleum-rich country in the region, nor the most important. We have to compete for investment with Ecuador and Colombia to name but two'. Petroperu aims to sign exploration contracts worth a total of at least USDollars 110m a year until the end of the century, according to Mr Quijandria. This will boost both the flagging reserves position and current output. 'Peru must aim at supplying all its internal oil requirements and becoming a medium-sized exporter,' he says.

ACTION:     Notice and request for data.            SUMMARY:     The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is publishing a notice and request for data regarding issues concerning the Clean Water Act section 311 (as amended by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990) requirements for facility response plan preparation as applied to non-transportation-related, onshore facilities that handle, store, or transport animal fats and vegetable oils. This notice is, in part, in response to a Petition for reconsideration of EPA's final facility response plan rule (Final Rule), (59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994), submitted to EPA by seven agricultural organizations. The Petition asserts that EPA does not adequately treat these oils differently from petroleum and toxic non-petroleum oils in the Final Rule. In support of their Petition, these organizations rely on studies that draw several conclusions concerning the physical, toxicological, and chemical properties of animal fats and vegetable oils compared with other types of oil. This notice summarizes the Petition, and asks for data and comment to assist EPA in determining whether and how the differences in properties of various oils warrant further different treatment, including possibly creating separate facility response plan regulatory regimes for these oils beyond the regime established in the July 1, 1994 Final Rule.

Background       A. Introduction       On July 1, 1994, EPA published its Final Rule amending the Oil Pollution Prevention regulation (40 CFR part 112) to incorporate new requirements to implement section 4202(a)(6) of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), amending section 311(j)(5) of the Clean Water Act (CWA). (See 33 U.S.C. 1321(j)(5).) (Oil Pollution Prevention; Non-Transportation-Related Onshore Facilities; Final Rule, 59 FR 34070, July 1, 1994.) The Final Rule directs certain facility owners and operators to prepare plans for responding to a worst case discharge of oil, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge. Under authority of section 311(j)(1)(C) of the CWA, the Final Rule requires planning for a small and medium discharge of oil, as appropriate.   Under section 4202(a)(6) of the OPA, these planning requirements apply to owners and operators of all offshore facilities and any onshore facility that, ``because of its location, could reasonably be expected to cause substantial harm to the environment by discharging into or on the navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or the exclusive economic zone.'' OPA directs owners and operators of these facilities to prepare a plan for responding ``to the maximum extent practicable, to a worst case discharge, and to a substantial threat of such a discharge of oil or a hazardous substance.'' The July 1, 1994, Final Rule establishes requirements for plans for responding to discharges of oil from certain onshore facilities within EPA's jurisdiction.   EPA published the proposed facility response plan rule on February 17, 1993 (58 FR 8824). One of the issues on which the Agency received comment was whether EPA should establish separate response plan requirements and selection criteria for owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils. Among other things, some commenters argued that fundamental chemical and physical differences between petroleum and non-petroleum oils indicate the necessity for different response techniques and equipment. At least two comments on the proposed rule asserted that lack of toxicity was a property distinguishing some non-petroleum oils both from petroleum and other non-petroleum oils. (See letters commenting on the February 17, 1993, proposed rule from the National Renderers Association [SPCC2P21248]; and on behalf of the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Institute of Shortening  Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association, [SPCC2P2L34].) The letter on behalf of the seven agricultural organizations [SPCC2P2L34] asked EPA to ``provide for a different approach to response and removal methodologies for these substances than that required for petroleum oil.''   EPA's Final Rule for non-transportation-related facility response plans provides a strategy for petroleum oils and non-petroleum oils that gives a considerably greater degree of flexibility to owners and operators of non-petroleum oil facilities than to owners and operators of petroleum oil facilities in designing their plans. The Petitioners contend that EPA should avoid treating the category animal fats and vegetable oils with the category toxic, non-petroleum oils. EPA addressed the likely differences in responding to petroleum oil as opposed to non-petroleum oil, and created an approach that allows owners or operators of facilities that handle, store, or transport non-petroleum oils flexibility to determine appropriate response equipment levels within the framework established by the regulation (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112). The Agency provided further flexibility by allowing the Regional Administrators (RA) to assess the adequacy of response plans including those for non-petroleum facilities, recognizing the greater knowledge RAs have about facilities and geographic-specific environmental areas within their Regions.

The following amplifications are being proposed: For exploration applications where 30 CFR 772.12 applies, 903.772(b) would require that upon receipt of notification from the regulatory authority of the submission of an administratively complete application for an exploration permit, the applicant shall publish one public notice of the filing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of the proposed exploration area, and provide proof of this publication to the regulatory authority within one week after the newspaper notice is published.    Section 903.772(c) would allow thirty (30) days after publication of the public notice for persons adversely affected to file written comments. Section 903.772(d) would require the regulatory authority to act upon a complete exploration application and any written comments within 15 days from the close of the comment period unless additional time is necessary due to the number of, or complexity of the issues.    In 903.773,     Requirements for permits and permit processing,     proposed subsection (b) would list Federal laws and corresponding or relevant State laws that need coordination by OSM to prevent or minimize duplication of effort with Arizona. Section 905.773(c) as proposed contains the stipulation that no person may conduct coal exploration or surface coal mining and reclamation operations without first obtaining all other necessary permits from the State. This section, which lists State laws with which the Secretary will endeavor to coordinate when issuing a permit under this Federal program, is based on the list published on October 6, 1982, (47 FR 44194) and may have to be updated in a final rule establishing a Federal program for Arizona. The State laws requiring coordination are summarized below:    (1) Arizona towns and cities are given long-range development and planning responsibility for their jurisdictions, are authorized to issue zoning ordinances and regulate the industrial use of municipal land and establish special zoning districts (A.R.S. Section 9461 to Section 946201). Arizona counties have general permitting authority and violation of a county building permit is a petty offense. A.R.S. 11322 et seq. Each County's Board of Supervisors has responsibility for promulgating and enforcing the zoning ordinances for the county, and it is unlawful to use land in violation of a zoning regulation, ordinance or permit; violation of such regulation, ordinance or permit is a misdemeanor. A.R.S. Section 11808, Section 11803, and A.R.S. Section 11821.    (2) The Arizona law concerning the perfection of mining claims and the establishment of claims to mineral rights is found in A.R.S. Section 27201 to 27210. Notice of such a claim must be recorded within 90 days in the appropriate office of the County having jurisdiction over the recording of land claims. A.R.S. Section 27203.    (3) A mineral exploration permit is required before prospecting is allowed on public land. A.R.S. Section 27251 to Section 27256.    (4) A permit from the Department of Health Services is required for the discharge of solid wastes and air pollutants. A.R.S. Title 49, Chapters 1 and 2.    (5) An installation permit is required before any pollution-causing equipment may be installed. Before the equipment can commence operation an operating permit is required. The permits are not automatically transferable. It is a misdemeanor to violate any air pollution permit, ordinance or statute, and criminal intent is not an element of proof. A.R.S. Title 49.    (6) The Department of Health Services has the responsibility for issuing water pollutant discharge permits. A.R.S. Title 49, Chapter 2.    (7) It is unlawful to discharge wastes or drainage into State waters or reduce water quality below water quality standards or discharge pollutants into waters without a permit from the Department of Health Services, A.R.S. Title 45.    (8) The Department of State Lands has the responsibility for issuing mineral prospecting permits for State lands. A.R.S. Section 37231.    (9) The waters from all sources belong to the State and are subject to appropriation and beneficial use. In order to appropriate water or make a beneficial use of water, a permit is required from the Director of the Department of Water Resources. The approval of the Director is required before such a permit may be transferred. A secondary permit from the Director is required before use may be made of reservoir waters. A.R.S. Title 45.

The agreement gives RTZ exploration and potential development rights to half of Burundi's prospective nickel belt which is 300km long and 40km wide in places. This is the first agreement signed by the government of Burundi with a big mining company. However, Burundi is also having talks with Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's biggest natural resources group, about a potential exploration deal covering the other half of the nickel belt. At present RTZ's only nickel interest is the Empress refinery in Zimbabwe which toll refines about 6,000 tonnes a year of the metal for BCL, Botswana. An RTZ official pointed out that its exploration policy excluded no commodity but the group was interested only in world-class deposits. The deal with Burundi followed an RTZ review of the mining potential in African countries, carried out since 1990. Most of the potential resources are nickel but Burundi also has deposits of gold, phosphate and industrial minerals such as kaolin and cement raw materials.   Companies:-  RTZ Corp.

But the UK independent exploration and production company predicted that output would jump from 14,200 barrels a day at present to 20,000 b/d by 1996. Mr Charles Jamieson, chief executive, said a planned maintenance shutdown last April at the Wytch Farm field in the UK and declining production at the offshore Angus field accounted for much of the fall in net profits. The shutdown caused average first half production to fall to 11,000 b/d, which was reflected in lower turnover of Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 26.3m) and operating profit of Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 9.7m). Earnings per share were 12 per cent down at 0.84p (0.95p). The company said three areas - Wytch Farm, the Fife oil field in the North Sea and the Qadirpur gas project in Pakistan - would help boost production to a peak of 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 1996. Mr Jamieson said the first successful horizontal well at Wytch Farm extending under Poole Bay would ensure that the company's higher production level would be maintained this year, with Fife and Qadirpur coming fully on stream in coming years. Mr Roland Shaw, chairman, said the company was also well placed to carry on with its 'aggressive exploration programme' despite current low oil prices. But the option of 'purchasing reserves is still there,' according to Mr Gerry Orbell, exploration director. He said that although there would be no fall in Premier's overall exploration spending, in the short-term the emphasis would be on lower-risk exploitation and appraisal of existing discoveries. In the past five years one in eight of Premier's wildcat wells drilled outside the UK had proved to be commercial. The record in the UK was one in 10.   Companies:-  Premier Consolidated Oilfields.

According to  Latvian police estimates, Russia has lost as much as half a  billion U.S. dolalrs in this way in the past 18 months.  Latvia's losses resulting from illegal shipments of gasoline  and diesel fuel through its territory are on a scale comparable  to the republic's annual budget.    One of the main intermediaries is the Swedish-Latvian firm  TESS Petroleum. During an investigation of this joint venture,  a criminal business plan was uncovered. The mechanism is  brilliantly simple. For example, the chief of a Kaliningrad  trawler fleet base or the leader of a certain enterprise in that  oblast suddenly rejects petroleum products that are in transit,  using any excuse you like, and asks that the goods be  readdressed to TESS Petroleum in Riga or some other front firm.  Meanwhile a firm in Tallinn belonging to the TESS conglomerate  has already paid for the petroleum products on the  Kaliningraders' behalf. An order then comes down the Lithuanian  Railroad, and the cargo turns around in mid-journey and goes to  Latvia, from where it is most convenient to send the oil onward  to the West by way of well equipped terminals. Naturally, nobody  pays any dues for this devious transit route. And all the time  Kaliningrad Oblast is suffering a constant fuel shortage.    The Latvian police alone do not have the resources for a  detailed analysis of this ""black-market bookkeeping."" However,  it is now quite clear that the roots should be sought in Moscow,  at the highest government level. It was only from there that  huge deliveries of petroleum products from various regions of  Russia could have been organized and authorized.    The staffers of the Latvian MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] directorate for combating organized crime approached  their Russian colleagues and provided them with copies of bank  documents in which various Russian figures appear. However,  nobody from Moscow has turned up.    ""It seems our colleagues are simply afraid to take it on,"" a  Latvian MVD staffer told me. ""We know what a bombshell we have  in our hands. And the criminals know it very well, too. I  would not be surprised if they try to put a stop to the whole  thing at the outset, and they will stop at nothing.""     "

0,FT932-10557 ,"FT932-10557 _AN-DEJCKAFGFT 930507   FT  07 MAY 93 / Britain extends S Georgia waters      By Our Parliamentary and Foreign Staff   BRITAIN is to extend from 12 to 200 miles its territorial waters around South Georgia and the South Sandwich islands, neighbours of the Falklands in the South Atlantic, because of concern about over-fishing, the British Foreign Office said yesterday. Senior officials in Argentina said last night it would protest at the move, once formal notification had arrived from London. Argentina has long claimed the two more distant archipelagoes, as well as the Falklands themselves. It was Britain's expulsion of a team of Argentine workers from a whaling station on South Georgia that triggered the Argentine invasion in 1982, leading to the Falklands war. Warned of the British move, Mr Fernando Petrella, Argentine deputy foreign minister, had said earlier: 'Argentina does not agree and nor does it seem constructive to us.' Announcing the move in London, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, foreign office minister, said that there was a need to reinforce conservation arrangements in the area. Chile, Russia and Japan are among the nations fishing in these waters. The anxieties about fish conservation had been discussed with the Argentine government, 'with whom we have extensive exchanges on South Atlantic matters', and ministers looked forward to pursuing this dialogue, he said. The Foreign Office said that the UK government did not believe the extension of jurisdiction to be provocative. Argentina had been consulted because of its claim (disputed by the UK) to sovereignty over the islands, not because Argentine boats were seen as mainly responsible for over-fishing. The foreign office also emphasised that no rules had yet been made under the extended jurisdiction, and that the proclamation to be made today simply gave the UK the right to make rules.

'Just our developments in the North Sea alone will propel us to that target,' said Mr Robert Evans, chairman. 'We are now producing oil and gas in eight countries overseas and could see more than 40 per cent of our profits coming from international exploration and production by 2000.' Mr Howard Dalton, managing director of the exploration division, said he would have a 29 per cent share of the capital expenditure budget this year amounting to Pounds 754m. British Gas would spend this on its exploration efforts in Tunisia, Russia and Argentina, among other countries. In 1991, exploration and production contributed Pounds 221m to British Gas' overall after-tax profit of Pounds 1.16bn. Mr Evans said that the group was ready to take advantage of acquisition opportunities in the oil and gas sector where share prices were severely depressed by low oil prices. COMMENT The City showed little reaction to British Gas's profits for last year and the shares slipped 1p to 258p. That could be due to the difficulty of making comparisons between last year and the previous one since the group has changed its financial accounting year. But the shares are currently more vulnerable to political or regulatory announcements about the future of competition in the UK gas business than to small changes in British Gas's profit levels. The company raised its dividend by 7 per cent to 10.25p for the nine months from April - giving a notional level of 13.4p for the year as a whole. British Gas is committed to raising its dividend and, for the past few years, has increased the pay-out at a rate of 8 to 10 per cent a year - well above the rate of inflation and the rest of the market. While there is a great deal of regulatory risk to be taken on when investing in the shares, the company is set for substantial growth in its international exploration and production business which is outside the jurisdiction of UK regulators. It is expected to triple its oil and gas production by 1995 compared with slight increases of about 1 per cent for the leading oil companies. In addition, although the new domestic pricing formula will bite into UK profits, Mr Evans is commited to a programme of cost reduction that aims at minimising its effect. If the government and regulators go ahead with an oft-threatened break-up of the company, that could also release significant value for shareholders.

By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LAGUNA BEACH      Worried that oil companies may use the threat of war in the Middle East to try  to increase oil exploration off the California coast, Orange County coastal  cities have agreed to step up lobbying efforts in Congress for a legally  binding, 10-year moratorium on offshore drilling.    Although President Bush this summer ordered a 10-year ban on new offshore  drilling leases, local officials said Wednesday that the moratorium must be  made into law because the executive action is not legally binding and can be  undone by Bush or a future President.    ""We have got to do something that's more than just a presidential press  release, because we have read his lips before,"" Laguna Beach Councilman Robert  F. Gentry said in urging congressional action.    A spokesman for the oil industry, however, said there are no immediate plans to  take advantage of the Middle East crisis by seeking a reversal of Bush's  10-year ban.    Jeff Wilson, an official of the Western States Petroleum Assn., also said that  it would take 10 to 15 years to develop new offshore drilling operations as a  result of the confrontation in the Persian Gulf.    But he also said that there is a pressing need to increase domestic oil  production.    ""This instance simply underlines the dangers of being dependent on foreign  energy sources,"" Wilson said. ""We would hope people could see that increasing  our domestic petroleum sources would (keep the United States from becoming)  involved in conflicts that we are seeing right now in the Middle East.""    But San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard pointed out that the amount of oil  believed to be available off the Orange County coast equals only three days of  the total U.S. consumption -- not enough to risk ruining the environment.    ""We certainly realize that foreign oil dependence is a problem"" Haggard said.  ""But we do not see drilling off our shores as the answer to that problem.""    The Laguna Beach City Council took the lead in the renewed lobbying effort when  it voted this week to send Gentry and Mayor Lida Lenney to Washington.    ""My gas (price) has gone up,"" Gentry said. ""It says to me the oil industry has  reacted and reacted quickly. They (oil companies) are not stupid. They are  going to see this action as an opportunity to try to open up the California  coast.""    Laguna Beach is a member of the Orange County Coalition of Coastal Cities,  which also includes Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach,  San Clemente and the county. The coalition has invited representatives from the  business community and an inland city to testify before the House  Appropriations Committee in support of the 10-year ban on new drilling leases.    Gentry said the action would be directed at the appropriations committee, which  controls funding for the U.S. Interior Department, the federal agency that  oversees offshore oil exploration.    ""The executive order by Bush sets the policy for the executive branch of the  government, and it's strong and it's good,"" Newport Beach City Manager Robert  Wynn said. ""However, it is not binding in any way, shape or form.""    Federal and state officials said they had not seen any increased activity by  oil companies to seek new offshore drilling permits.    ""I think we are all going to have to wait and see what happens in Iraq and  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before we see what happens,"" said Susan Hansch, energy  resources manager for the California Coastal Commission.    ""It would definitely provide very important protection in new areas that never  have been leased,"" Hansch said about the proposed legislation. She added that  most of the leases are in the Santa Barbara area, with others located near  Huntington Beach.

By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      LAGUNA BEACH      Worried that oil companies may use the threat of war in the Middle East to try  to increase oil exploration off the California coast, Orange County coastal  cities have agreed to step up lobbying efforts in Congress for a legally  binding, 10-year moratorium on offshore drilling.    Although President Bush this summer ordered a 10-year ban on new offshore  drilling leases, local officials said Wednesday that the moratorium must be  made into law because the executive action is not legally binding and can be  undone by Bush or a future President.    ""We have got to do something that's more than just a presidential press  release, because we have read his lips before,"" Laguna Beach Councilman Robert  F. Gentry said in urging congressional action.    A spokesman for the oil industry, however, said there are no immediate plans to  take advantage of the Middle East crisis by seeking a reversal of Bush's  10-year ban.    Jeff Wilson, an official of the Western States Petroleum Assn., also said that  it would take 10 to 15 years to develop new offshore drilling operations as a  result of the confrontation in the Persian Gulf.    But he also said that there is a pressing need to increase domestic oil  production.    ""This instance simply underlines the dangers of being dependent on foreign  energy sources,"" Wilson said. ""We would hope people could see that increasing  our domestic petroleum sources would (keep the United States from becoming)  involved in conflicts that we are seeing right now in the Middle East.""    But San Clemente Mayor Candace Haggard pointed out that the amount of oil  believed to be available off the Orange County coast equals only three days of  the total U.S. consumption -- not enough to risk ruining the environment.    ""We certainly realize that foreign oil dependence is a problem"" Haggard said.  ""But we do not see drilling off our shores as the answer to that problem.""    The Laguna Beach City Council took the lead in the renewed lobbying effort when  it voted this week to send Gentry and Mayor Lida Lenney to Washington.    ""My gas (price) has gone up,"" Gentry said. ""It says to me the oil industry has  reacted and reacted quickly. They (oil companies) are not stupid. They are  going to see this action as an opportunity to try to open up the California  coast.""    Laguna Beach is a member of the Orange County Coalition of Coastal Cities,  which also includes Dana Point, Laguna Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach,  San Clemente and the county. The coalition has invited representatives from the  business community and an inland city to testify before the House  Appropriations Committee in support of the 10-year ban on new drilling leases.    Gentry said the action would be directed at the appropriations committee, which  controls funding for the U.S. Interior Department, the federal agency that  oversees offshore oil exploration.    ""The executive order by Bush sets the policy for the executive branch of the  government, and it's strong and it's good,"" Newport Beach City Manager Robert  Wynn said. ""However, it is not binding in any way, shape or form.""    Federal and state officials said they had not seen any increased activity by  oil companies to seek new offshore drilling permits.    ""I think we are all going to have to wait and see what happens in Iraq and  Kuwait and Saudi Arabia before we see what happens,"" said Susan Hansch, energy  resources manager for the California Coastal Commission.    ""It would definitely provide very important protection in new areas that never  have been leased,"" Hansch said about the proposed legislation. She added that  most of the leases are in the Santa Barbara area, with others located near  Huntington Beach.    An Interior Department official in the Los Angeles regional office said that  113 leases are still in effect off the California coast, compared to 135 a year  ago.

By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      With gasoline prices less than a penny per gallon below the all-time record,  consumers have responded by cutting back on their use of gasoline and switching  to less-pricey grades.    Driven by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 11 weeks ago, the price of regular  unleaded self-serve gasoline has risen on average more than 30 cents a gallon  nationally since Aug. 1 to nearly $1.38 a gallon, the American Automobile Assn.  reported this week.    In Los Angeles, the price for the same grade of gasoline climbed more than 23  cents a gallon to about $1.34 as of Oct. 5, according to the latest figures  from the Lundberg Survey.    Meanwhile, federal investigators are trying to nail down proof that oil  companies colluded to raise prices. Earlier this month, they issued subpoenas  to oil companies and refiners for internal documents.    Legislators and consumer groups continue to accuse the industry of  price-gouging and profiteering, because gasoline prices rose so quickly and so  sharply after the Aug. 2 invasion.    Connecticut and Massachusetts quickly enacted emergency anti-price gouging  measures similar to one already in force in New York, and Sen. Joseph I.  Lieberman (D-Conn.) is pushing a federal anti-gouging bill designed to prevent  a future gasoline price shock.    For their part, oil industry officials have steadfastly denied charges of  price-fixing, arguing that the price hikes merely reflect the workings of the  marketplace.    ""We believe (the investigations) will show, as they have in the past, that the  market is working, and that there are just too many transactions involving too  many people to engage in collusive activity,"" said Joe Lastelic, a spokesman  for the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade group.    Industry officials added that gasoline price hikes have failed to keep pace  with the rapid run-up in prices of crude oil, from which gasoline is made.  Refiners and marketers of gasoline, they note, are now losing money.    On Wednesday, the price of light, sweet crude oil for November delivery fell  $2.17 a barrel to $36.72 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The  sharp drop was only the latest move in a volatile market characterized recently  by dramatic increases and declines almost daily.    Even if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pulls out of Kuwait tomorrow and crude  prices plummet, gasoline prices are expected to lag by weeks. That would give  refiners time to recover losses incurred during the period of high crude  prices, analysts said.    ""On the upside, everyone says that gasoline prices move up immediately, but on  the downside, they move with a lag"" behind crude oil prices, said John  Lichtblau, president of the industry-funded Petroleum Industry Research  Foundation in New York. ""This time, they will follow with a considerable lag.""    The automobile association reported that the nationwide increase in gasoline  prices has slowed. Still, the average national price of $1.379 a gallon is just  a hair short of the record price of $1.388 a gallon reported the weekend before  Easter, 1981, during the Iran-Iraq war.    As a result, demand for gasoline is off. Demand last month was 1.5% lower than  a year ago, a higher-than-usual drop attributable in part to the higher prices,  the petroleum institute reported Wednesday.    Meanwhile, drivers reportedly are switching in droves from higher-priced  premium blends to regular gasolines, though there's no clear data on the trend.    Prices are expected to continue rising to make up for the continuing run-up of  crude oil prices.    Compared to the 30-cent-a-gallon hike in retail gasoline prices, the cash price  of the benchmark U.S. grade of crude oil has risen more than 42 cents a gallon  since Aug. 1. As the price of crude oil goes up, the cost of making gasoline  goes up. If the price of gasoline does not follow, the profit margin for  gasoline shrinks.    Because the hike in gasoline prices has not kept pace with crude prices,  international oil companies are expected to report that refining and marketing  profits fell 52% in the third quarter, which included August and September,  according to a report by Salomon Bros.    That would more than offset the 50% increase expected in earnings from  exploration and production operations, due to higher crude oil prices.    Still, industry critics charge that the oil industry conspired to unfairly  raise gasoline prices. Wholesale and retail gasoline prices jumped as much as  10 cents a gallon within days of the invasion, even though that gasoline was  refined from crude oil purchased weeks earlier at much lower prices.    The industry argued at the time that such rapid increases were intended to  cover the anticipated higher replacement costs of crude oil and to reflect the  greater influence of spot and futures markets, where prices react almost  instantaneously to world events.    But such explanations didn't satisfy regulators.    The Department of Justice launched an investigation into the price hikes on  Aug. 6. After interviewing industry executives, the department took the further  step of issuing subpoenas for company records.    Several states have pressed similar investigations, though California deferred  to the feds. ""All of the prices were going up pretty much in unison, and the  question arose: Was there a possible antitrust violation? Did they get together  and raise their prices in a conspiracy?"" said Joe Bizzaro, spokesman for  Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth. Florida issued subpoenas to 16 major oil  companies operating in that state.    Analysts and industry observers doubt that the investigations would turn up  evidence of an actual back room conspiracy. ""They don't need to collude,"" said  Ed Rothschild, director of energy policy for Citizen Action, a Washington-based  consumer group. ""Communication is so readily available, they are aware of the  pricing decisions they and others make in the marketplace all the time.""    Short of finding conspiracy, there's little the federal government can do about  the rapid price run-ups.    Lieberman is proposing a federal law that would regulate price hikes, similar  to a law in New York that prevents retailers from raising prices faster than  their costs increase. The industry opposes the measure.    In New York, the state attorney general's office is investigating whether  petroleum refiners or marketers violated the price-gouging law, and subpoenas  were issued to service station operators.    But initial results of the investigations suggest the limits of such laws.  Investigators found that retailers were merely passing on wholesale price  hikes, said Edward Barbini, a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams.  ""We don't see a widespread pattern of (price-gouging) at this time,"" he said.  The state's law does not extend to wholesale price hikes, said Edward Barbini,  a spokesman for New York Atty. Gen. Robert Abrams.    PUMP PRICES: Average retail and wholesale prices of regular and premium  unleaded gasoline in Los Angeles, including cash and credit card prices and  taxes.

0,FT931-8557 ,"FT931-8557 _AN-DBRCKAF2FT 930218   FT  18 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China invites explorers to prime oil areas      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination China yesterday invited foreign oil companies to explore in promising onshore areas, including the vast Tarim basin in the country's remote north-west. Mr Wang Tao, president of the China National Petroleum Corporation, said yesterday that exploration bids for five blocs covering 72,730 square km (28,000 square miles) in the south-eastern sector of the Tarim basin would be called in March. There would be a second round of bidding for additional acreage by early next year, he said. Worries about flagging domestic production - China may become a net importer by 1995 - and the need to speed exploration in remote areas apparently dispelled lingering reservations about opening up territory to foreign explorers. The booming economy - GNP growth reached 12 per cent last year - is putting added strain on dwindling oil reserves. Oil company representatives welcomed China's decision to open its 'wild west' to exploration - Shell and BP in particular expressed strong interest  -but they indicated caution about commiting resources to such a remote region. Transporting oil to the coast would require a 2,000 km pipeline across some of the world's roughest terrain. Many offshore explorers had their fingers badly burnt in China in the 1980s. A representative of Australia's BHP Petroleum noted ruefully yesterday that the company had drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and the Pearl River Delta. China had previously allowed foreign participation in onshore exploration, but restricted this to relatively unpromising areas in 11 southern provinces. The extension of foreign exploration leases to northern and western regions is certain to excite considerable explorers'interest. Based on fairly sketchy seismic data, China claims that the Tarim basin contains massive reserves of perhaps more than 100bn barrels. Even if only a fraction of such deposits are recoverable at reasonable cost the region would become one of the world biggest oilfields. Mr Wang Tao also announced the opening of existing oilfields to foreign participation. China's 'mature' fields face increasing difficulties maintaining production without sophisticated enhancement techniques. China at present produces about 2.8m barrels a day and its exports are hovering around 400,000 b/d. The country ranks sixth in the world in oil production.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.

(See 33 CFR part 154. The docket includes a chart comparing USCG plan resource requirements for petroleum and non-petroleum oil facilities, and referencing the applicable sections of the USCG facility response plan rule.) As with the USCG Interim Final Rule, the EPA approach gives these facility owners and operators substantial latitude in calculating required response resources for their non-petroleum facilities.     To calculate resources for non-petroleum oil facilities, an owner or operator is not limited to using emulsification or evaporation factors in Appendix E (the Equipment Appendix) of the Final Rule, as required for petroleum oil facilities. Rather, these owners and operators must: (1) show procedures and strategies for responding to the maximum extent practicable to a worst case discharge; (2) show sources of equipment and supplies necessary to locate, recover, and mitigate discharges; (3) demonstrate that the equipment identified in the plan will work under the conditions and in the areas that the plan covers, and reach the area within required times; and (4) ensure the availability of required resources by contract or other approved means. EPA does not prescribe the type and amount of equipment that response plans for non-petroleum oil discharges must identify (See Section 7.7 of Appendix E to 40 CFR part 112).     EPA's Final Rule is consistent with the CWA section 311(j)(5) (as amended by section 4202(a) of the OPA), which requires facility response plans to ``remove to the maximum extent practicable'' a worst case discharge of oil or a hazardous substance. In many responses to discharges of oil, response personnel may need to employ containment boom, skimmers, or other equipment to contain oil and remove oil from water. Responders also may employ other strategies appropriate for the area. These strategies apply to all oils and do not distinguish among types of oil (i.e., petroleum and non-petroleum or toxic and non-toxic oils).     As EPA stated in the Final Rule (59 FR 34088), when results from research on such factors as emulsification or evaporation of non-petroleum oil are available, the Agency may change the rule regarding the type of response resources for which an owner or operator of a non-petroleum oil facility must plan.         II. The Organizations' Petition         By a letter dated August 12, 1994, EPA received a ``Petition for Reconsideration and Stay of Effective Date'' of the OPA-mandated facility response plan Final Rule as that rule applies to facilities that handle, store, or transport animal fat or vegetable oils. The Petition was submitted on behalf of seven agricultural organizations (``the Organizations'' or ``Petitioners''): the American Soybean Association, the Corn Refiners Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Institute of Shortening  Edible Oils, the National Cotton Council, the National Cottonseed Products Association, and the National Oilseed Processors Association.     To support their Petition, the Organizations reference an industry-sponsored study titled ``Environmental Effects of Release of Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils to Waterways'' (prepared by ENVIRON Corporation, June 28, 1993) and an associated study titled ``Diesel Fuel, Beef Tallow, RBD Soybean Oil and Crude Soybean Oil: Acute Effects on the Fathead Minnow,     Pimephales Promelas''     (prepared by Aqua Survey, Inc., May 21, 1993). Both of these studies had been submitted to EPA during the facility response plan rulemaking as enclosures to a comment filed over nine months after the close of the comment period.     The ENVIRON study concludes that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are significantly different from petroleum oils in their effects on the aquatic environment and so merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.'' Among other things, ENVIRON concludes that ``animal fat and vegetable oils are orders of magnitude less toxic than petroleum oils to aquatic life;'' that ``there are no accumulating or otherwise harmful components in animal fats and vegetable oils that are irritating, toxic or carcinogenic;'' and that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are easily biodegraded by bacteria using them as food.'' The study also concludes that these oils can coat aquatic biota and foul wildlife, causing hypothermia when fur or feathers mat; and that these oils have a high ``Biological Oxygen Demand'' (or BOD), which may result in oxygen deprivation where there is a large spill in a confined body of water with a low flow and low dilution rate. The ENVIRON study's ultimate conclusion is that animal fats and vegetable oils are sufficiently different from petroleum oils and other hazardous materials that they merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.     The Aqua Survey, Inc. study presents the results of Aqua Survey's tests of the acute toxicity of the test substances on the Fathead minnow at five concentrations of each test substance.

To support their Petition, the Organizations reference an industry-sponsored study titled ``Environmental Effects of Release of Animal Fats and Vegetable Oils to Waterways'' (prepared by ENVIRON Corporation, June 28, 1993) and an associated study titled ``Diesel Fuel, Beef Tallow, RBD Soybean Oil and Crude Soybean Oil: Acute Effects on the Fathead Minnow,     Pimephales Promelas''     (prepared by Aqua Survey, Inc., May 21, 1993). Both of these studies had been submitted to EPA during the facility response plan rulemaking as enclosures to a comment filed over nine months after the close of the comment period.     The ENVIRON study concludes that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are significantly different from petroleum oils in their effects on the aquatic environment and so merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.'' Among other things, ENVIRON concludes that ``animal fat and vegetable oils are orders of magnitude less toxic than petroleum oils to aquatic life;'' that ``there are no accumulating or otherwise harmful components in animal fats and vegetable oils that are irritating, toxic or carcinogenic;'' and that ``animal fats and vegetable oils are easily biodegraded by bacteria using them as food.'' The study also concludes that these oils can coat aquatic biota and foul wildlife, causing hypothermia when fur or feathers mat; and that these oils have a high ``Biological Oxygen Demand'' (or BOD), which may result in oxygen deprivation where there is a large spill in a confined body of water with a low flow and low dilution rate. The ENVIRON study's ultimate conclusion is that animal fats and vegetable oils are sufficiently different from petroleum oils and other hazardous materials that they merit separate treatment in environmental regulations.     The Aqua Survey, Inc. study presents the results of Aqua Survey's tests of the acute toxicity of the test substances on the Fathead minnow at five concentrations of each test substance. Based on the study results, the Organizations assert that animal fats and vegetable oils_unlike petroleum-based oil and toxic non-petroleum oils_``are non-toxic, readily biodegradable, not persistent in the environment, and, in fact, are essential components of human and wildlife diet.''

Becirovic: ""Dragoslav Avramovic Speaks With  Montenegrin Energy Officials: 19 Million Dinars for Power Plant  Repairs""]    [Text] The governor requested a precise specification  of costs; national income must double over the coming months;  demand that petroleum be exempted from all duty.    Niksic, 6 Jun--In order to perform essential repairs on  Montenegrin electric power plants--at Perucica, Pivo, and  Pljevlja--19 million dinars must be secured in the shortest  term. The electric power industry does not have the money, and  if all the deposits in Montenegrin banks were devoted to the  repairs, the electric power installations would barely be put in  order. But the demand that prices be increased will not be  popular with the government.    The governor of the NBJ [National Bank of Yugoslavia], Prof.  Dragoslav Avramovic, listened politely to energy officials and,  wielding figures, he ""slightly lowered"" their demands as he  went. Because the repairs must be made to the installations,  Avramovic and Montenegrin Deputy Prime Minister Krunoslav  Vukcevic said that the energy officials should precisely  calculate the costs and send those figures to the government and  governor so that this work, which cannot wait, is done solidly  and on time.    The energy officials also mentioned the possibility of  paying  off debts by increasing the price of electricity. However,  Avramovic said that his program looked at the infrastructure as  a whole, but that it is now obvious that there are major price  imbalances in this area. Although prices of electric power are  low (one-third of the world price), the prices of  telecommunication services and railroad transportation are  equally above prices in the world, and something must be done in  that sector.    One of the sore spots in Montenegrin economic life is  petroleum. Energy officials are seeking to secure from the  national energy pool the quantity of petroleum provided for  Montenegro, while ""Jugopetrol"" director Nikola Dragomanovic put  forward the demand that petroleum derivatives, which we import  at prices two to five times higher than the price on the world  market, be exempted from customs duty and that the market for  petroleum in our country be free.    ""If we got rid of customs duty, excise taxes, and controls  over petroleum, what would happen then?"" the governor asked.    ""The supply would probably be better, with lower prices,""  Dragomanovic responded.    In response the comment by some of the participants in the  meeting that food is expensive in our country, more expensive  than in the world, Avramovic said that those calculations are  not accurate, which does not mean that food cannot be cheaper.    There was also discussion of wages, whereby the governor  said  that it is inexplicable that wages have risen enormously for  some structures in Serbia, even though they are still low  compared to world levels.

BP's presentation coincided with news of an exciting gas discovery off the coast of Vietnam, a story which had been circulating in the market for some time, and went down very well with analysts. One of the leading oil sector researchers described the presentation, delivered by Mr John Browne, head of BP's exploration and production, as the best he had ever attended and the first time BP 'has ever demonstrated a credible long term growth plan in exploration; in the past, BP has talked about managing a decline in its exploration business, today it was full of information on its expansion plans'. Another analyst said he was 'well satisfied' with the presentation but added that he would like to see evidence of renewed US support for BP shares. BP will deliver the same message to US investors today. BP ended 3 up at 420 1/2 p on turnover of 9.3m. Shell improved marginally to 722 1/2 p.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

0,FT943-6543 ,"FT943-6543 _AN-EH2B3ABJFT 940829   FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: Digging deeper and wider - BHP is moving further afield but it will not forget its Australian roots      By NIKKI TAIT   Broken Hill Proprietary's presentation to shareholders in Sydney could have been taken from a modern marketing manager's manual. Held in a giant auditorium, it had overhead slides, bold graphics and plenty of razzamatazz. Then, as the meeting was thrown open to questions, a gentlemen in the audience rose to his feet. 'I can remember when you were running the Newcastle (Australia) steelworks in the 1970s . . .' he told Brian Loton, BHP's chairman, as he launched into a long reminiscence. The BHP executive, half-charmed and half-embarrassed, listened patiently, before quickly steering the meeting back to business. The incident last year, although trivial, seemed to sum up the dichotomy which surrounds the Australian resources group. On the one hand, it runs an ADollars 30bn (Pounds 14.2bn) portfolio of businesses worldwide, ranging from coal mines in Indonesia to oil rigs in the Irish Sea. A fifth of its shares are held internationally and in key divisions - such as petroleum - much of the staff and management are outside its home country. On the other hand the tug of BHP's roots is also strong - and not always entirely welcome. There is, for example, a peculiarly Australian share structure, which has BHP owning half of another company which in turn owns almost 20 per cent of BHP. There is an ADollars 2.2bn investment in Fosters, the Melbourne-based brewing group, which is carried in the books at significantly more than its current market value and has nothing to do with BHP's core operations. 'It's a big credibility question,' says one analyst. In addition, although overseas interests are growing by leaps and bounds, the fact remains that the bulk of BHP's money is still made in its home country. About 70 per cent of group assets are held there. There is nothing unusual about a formerly domestic company reaching a point where its growing international interests create a string of dilemmas over expansion and diversification strategy, and over organisation structure. But BHP's case is interesting for two reasons. First, the company is curiously bound up with Australia's national psyche. 'For 50 years, BHP has held a dominance in Australian economic life such as no company, to my knowledge, had ever exercised over the US economy,' Geoffrey Blainey, a historian, has commented. Even now, the company accounts for 1.5 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, and is frequently referred to as the 'Big Australian'. This status adds quite significantly to management responsibility. 'We are always being asked to do this or that nationally by industry organisations, and government,' says John Prescott, managing director. 'It's usually far more than we can handle. We try to speak when asked.' That, however, does not mean that the group escapes criticism for not doing more. Some mining industry players, for example, wondered whether BHP should have taken the lead more forcibly during last year's debate over Australia's Native Title legislation and the issue of Aboriginal land rights. Second, BHP is the only Australian company that can fairly claim to be making a 'global' leap at present. Other groups of comparable size and status include News International, the media company, and National Australia Bank. But the former remains the personal fief of Rupert Murdoch, while NAB operates only in the Australian, Irish and UK markets. BHP admits that being out on this sort of limb brings unique pressures. The company, says Prescott, has used management consultants 'sometimes for extended periods, particularly to help us overcome the isolation of BHP in Australia, to understand what the rest of the world is doing by way of best practice'. Most of BHP's development outside Australia has occurred during the past decade. During the first four years of this period the company's management was also wrestling with rival takeover attentions from Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources and John Elliott's Elders IXL. Peace was finally bought in 1988, although the price is still evident in the controversial Fosters holding and the circular share structure. In spite of belated changes made to this last week, it could still provide takeover and management protection and hence could retard share price performance. All the same, many observers believe in retrospect that the long and complex struggle with the two entrepreneurs also brought benefits - forcing BHP to take a more aggressive management approach and shaking up a complacent bureaucracy. Whether or not this is an accurate assessment, the tussle did coincide with a sharply increased international focus at the resources group. In 1982, BHP's sales from operations outside Australia were just ADollars 87m. By 1992-93, helped by a mixture of acquisitions, investments and exploration work, they had grown to more than ADollars 5bn. Even today, however, the extent to which BHP has 'globalised' its operations varies markedly between divisions. The company has four main operating areas: steel, minerals, petroleum and 'services', which includes a range of businesses from shipping to engineering consultancy. This structure was put in place in 1985, although there have been refinements since. 'The broad thrust is to organise on product lines - generally based on worldwide groupings of products,' says Prescott. The petroleum division, which includes Hamilton Oil, is generally seen as the most internationally-focused. About 70 per cent of employees are based outside Australia and recent chief executives have been recruited from outside the company. (Peter Willcox, who stepped down earlier this year, came from Amoco; his replacement, John O'Connor, from Mobil). The minerals side, too, is highly diversified and much of the management conducted from San Francisco, thanks to the purchase of Utah International's mining interests from US General Electric in 1984. Steel, by contrast, is described by one analyst as 'more or less Australian'. The current generation of top head-office executives has also been drawn heavily from this division's ranks: Loton, Prescott and two divisional bosses all worked their way up through steel. In financial terms, BHP's structure and its range of interests has served shareholders quite well recently - in contrast to the performance a decade ago - and most pundits acknowledge that the spread of interests and their slightly different business cycles are advantageous. Earnings dipped in 1991-92, but have since risen steadily. In the latest 12 months, to end-May, operating profit after interest rose by almost 30 per cent, to ADollars 1.28bn. The BHP share price has also been strong, outperforming the Australian stockmarket by 120 per cent since 1988 and the mining sector by a similar amount. In the current year the company admits it will have its difficulties. Nevertheless, analysts seem fairly confident that another year of steady performance is in sight. Barring sudden commodity price movements, market estimates suggest that profits of ADollars 1.4bn could be achieved. Looking longer-term, much will depend on the scale and efficiency with which BHP spends its development funds. To achieve a 10 per cent profits growth and using a target rate of 15 per cent for return on equity, David Rubin at ANZ McCaughan calculates that BHP needs to commit around ADollars 1bn to new projects each year - on top of the replacement capital expenditure to replenish depleting assets. In fact, over the past five years, the total capital and investment programme has topped ADollars 12.5bn. Gearing, meanwhile, has come down about 35 per cent, and the company has been at pains to stress that it intends to avoid a 'lazy (underused) balance sheet'. 'We have the capacity to fund any substantial new investment opportunity that should arise,' Graham Heely, the finance director, told analysts at the results presentation in July, prompting speculation that a multi-billion deal could be in sight. BHP has enthused about two potential channels for expansion. The first is direct reduced iron (DRI) - a process which involves the reduction of high-grade iron ore concentrate using natural gas. The resulting iron is made into small, transportable briquettes, which can be fed directly into the new generation of mini-mills. Ideally, the production system requires high-grade iron ore and natural gas to be in close proximity - a situation that exists in Western Australia's Pilbara region, but is only becoming a feasible option with the opening of the gas market. This month, BHP announced it was seeking environmental approvals for the construction of an ADollars 750m DRI plant in the region, indicating the final feasibility studies are in progress. The second is power generation, predominantly offshore, and probably in the growth markets of Asia and South America. This attracts some scepticism, since it would take BHP into a new area of operation. The company, however, claims such a move is a fairly natural progression from existing energy-related activities. Indeed, while BHP is only examining possibilities at present, Prescott does not quarrel with the notion that power generation might eventually form a fifth leg to the business. 'It could be a self-contained entity, although it would have to work closely with the rest of the group. But it may well be a core operation,' he says. On the organisational front, Prescott recognises that some changes will probably be necessary as the company comes to terms with its growing global spread. BHP, he suggests, may need to move from its divisional structure towards a 'matrix' of the sort especially common among big US multinationals, where the product divisions and a geographical management network are superimposed on each other. Because of their complexity, such structures are often controversial and difficult to operate. 'The current structure may not give the best means of promoting BHP in a new part of the world,' he continues. 'It might be better if we had a structure which allowed us to present our credentials collectively in a country where we were not well known. Rather than have our steel business go in separately, then our minerals business, then our petroleum business . . . perhaps there should be a 'Mr BHP' who would be the single focus of contact in each particular country.' The company is already tending 'to move a little bit in that direction', Prescott adds. Its president of BHP Japan serves as a single point of contact for all businesses there, and it is implementing the same concept in China and Russia. But what nationality is 'Mr BHP Japan'? Prescott admits that he is Australian - 'well, actually a Scotsman' - but quickly adds that on the divisional side of the structure the senior iron ore, coal, transportation and steel salespeople are locals. 'It's only in recent years that I could say that - it's a bit of a change,' he remarks. For BHP, it is really a revolution.   Companies:-  Broken Hill Proprietary.   Countries:-  AUZ  Australia.

The Los Angeles school board has approved plans to cover the playground at Park  Avenue Elementary School with a layer of asphalt to prevent the sludge of  petroleum chemical compounds and its vapors from rising to the surface.    School officials hope to have the school reopened at the beginning of the  school year in September, school board member Leticia Quezada said Wednesday at  a meeting of parents, teachers, residents and state and school officials.    Although the petroleum-contaminated soil and sludge will not be removed,  parents, teachers and administrators said they are satisfied that the covering  will protect the students. They said they are tired of waiting for some kind of  solution to be found to clean up the ooze, and want to get back to their own  school.    The elementary school, at 8020 Park Ave., was closed last summer after parents  and teachers raised concerns about health hazards associated with the tar-like  petroleum sludge that appeared in tiny puddles on the surface of the asphalt  playground.    Since then, Park Avenue students have been divided and sent to Teresa Hughes  Elementary School and Clara Street Primary Center, which operate year-round.  Administrators and parents said Park Avenue students who have been attending  these schools, which were overcrowded before Park Avenue was closed, have  become much like guests who have overstayed their welcome.    ""We need to go back to our own school,"" said parent Maria Castillo, who has  three children diverted from Park Avenue. ""We're not wanted (at the other  schools) and we don't want to be there.""    Principal Jose Velasquez, who has been forced to try to keep track of his Park  Avenue students sent to two other campuses, said the whole experience has been  an administrative nightmare. ""What's important now is (that) we get back to our  school,"" he said.    According to an environmental report released in January, Park Avenue school  was built on an old city dump that contained petroleum-contaminated soil and  several pockets of tar-like petroleum sludge.    But the report by Angelo Bellomo, director of an environmental engineering firm  that conducted a series of tests last November and December, concluded that  students would not face any health hazards as long as they did not have  prolonged contact with the sludge. The report also found no dangerous traces of  hazardous vapor in the air.    Although the report concluded that it would be safe for students to return to  the school immediately, district officials have held off until they get a firm  recommendation from the state Department of Health Services.    Richard Hume, an environmental engineer with the Health Services Department,  said a decision will be made as soon as department engineers in Sacramento give  their decision. That decision is expected late this week, he said. Once the  state has reached a decision, a meeting will be held with Bellomo to discuss  the details of construction.    At Wednesday's meeting, a group of about 25 parents, teachers, administrators  and residents were presented with two options for covering the playground.    Both plans involve digging about 12 to 20 trenches in the playground, filling  them with gravel and laying pipes to vent gas to the surface, where it will be  monitored for hazardous vapor.    One plan calls for a thick plastic liner to be sandwiched between layers of  sand over the trenches, and a new asphalt surface poured on top. The other plan  would leave out the plastic liner and instead pour a thicker layer of new  asphalt over the trenches. Both, Bellomo said, would keep the petroleum sludge  from percolating to the surface, and keep gases from seeping to the surface  except through the ventilation system.    Both plans would take an equal amount of time to complete, but the option  involving the plastic liner will cost about $750,000 -- twice as much as the  other, Bellomo said.    Parents said they favor the more expensive measure.

Chevron, meanwhile, saw operating earnings drop in both upstream and downstream operations. Earnings reports from the big US oil groups this week have generally reflected an increase in earnings from exploration and production on the back of higher oil prices. Profit margins from refining and marketing, although below the high levels of a year ago, have caused less damage to earnings than generally expected, giving a fillip to oil stocks. Texaco's shares climbed Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 63 while Exxon rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 . Shares in Mobil, meanwhile, jumped Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , following an announcement that the company was moving ahead with a restructuring programme to reduce costs. At Texaco, international exploration and production profits rose to Dollars 83m from Dollars 15m a year ago (before one-off items). This was due to higher production of both oil and natural gas in the UK sector of the North Sea, lower exploration expenses and higher oil prices, the company said. Upstream income in the US slipped to Dollars 127m from Dollars 138m. Marketing and refining profits, meanwhile, slid to Dollars 167m from Dollars 200m. After one-off items in both periods, Texaco reported net income of Dollars 281m, down from Dollars 317m in the 1993 period. At 98 cents a share, earnings were well ahead of most forecasts. Chevron, meanwhile, said earnings in upstream operations to Dollars 255m in the latest period fell from Dollars 332m, while downstream businesses recorded a fall to Dollars 163m from Dollars 243m (all figures are before one-off items). Although operating earnings rebounded from the second quarter, benefiting from higher refined product margins in the US and the absence of refinery operating problems, overall profit margins fell short of the strong 1993 third quarter, said Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive. One bright spot was provided by Chevron's chemical business, which reported earnings of Dollars 68m, up from Dollars 6m a year ago.

Smiths' US unit says it 'actively competed' for the contract, even though a British arms embargo imposed during the conflict remains in force. The company's avionics division, based in Grand Rapids, Michigan, said this week it had held meetings in Buenos Aires with local defence ministry officials. More talks were planned this week in the US with Mr Oscar Camilion, Argentine defence minister, who will make a counter-proposal to the bid. UK and Argentine government officials agree there is little chance that Smiths will win the contract unless the embargo is relaxed. By negotiating with a British company for a defence contract Argentina may be trying to underline the 'anachronistic' nature of the embargo. Smiths in the UK said: 'This is a responsible company. It is not one that is going to break any embargoes or sanctions imposed by governments.' Smiths was 'not going to supply anyone that does not have the approval by the government agencies involved.' Argentina is negotiating to buy 36 second-hand A4M Skyhawk fighter bombers from the US Navy. The US agreed to sell the aircraft to Argentina in 1992, but bowed to requests by the UK that they should not be equipped with electronics or weapons systems that might threaten British forces based on the Falkland Islands. A senior Smiths executive was in Argentina last week 'answering questions' from the air force. A marketing director involved in the talks said Smiths had informed both Washington and London it would make an 'initial top-level presentation' in Argentina concerning the contract.

He insists that much potential remains in Yemen, while acknowledging that more information is needed before 'the secrets' of the region can be disclosed. 'We are maintaining an active exploration programme in the concession area where we are already producing. There are smaller structures still to be tested and we are actively pursuing these since they are close to our facilities,' Mr Isautier said. With depressed oil prices affecting exploration budgets CanadianOxy is currently placing less emphasis on the possibility of large discoveries in remote areas of its 37,500-square-km concession and more on smaller finds that can be joined economically to its existing facilities. Located at al-Masila in southern Yemen, CanadianOxy's oil fields and central processing facility are linked by a 138km pipeline extending southwards to export facilities at Ash-Shihr on the Gulf of Aden coast. Since coming on stream in late September 1993 the company has announced recoverable reserves of 546m barrels and has reached an average production rate of 135,000 barrels a day, about a third of Yemen's total output. Although Mr Isautier doubts that the company's production will increase substantially from existing fields in the coming year he is optimistic about other possible finds in the area. 'There is still upside potential particularly in the fractured basement,' he said, referring to the hard rock foundations underlying porous limestone formations where oil is usually found. 'We now have one well producing 8,000 barrels a day of natural flow, a higher quality oil, and flowing under very steady, stable pressure. That is indicative of a large well connected area and it's very encouraging,' he says. CanadianOxy is meanwhile trading information with other companies adjacent to its concession area, particularly Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimir, all of which are working to the north and north-east of the al-Masila fields. In the current climate of cost effectiveness, traded data saves on exploration costs and could be especially important for CanadianOxy. 'If those companies make significant discoveries, that would suggest more potential in the eastern portions of our concession,' says a company executive. Based on CanadianOxy's discoveries, oilmen have long suspected a trend running through the region. But confirmation has so far eluded them. Last April, Total announced a find capable of yielding 12,000 b/d to the east of al-Masila and to the north Clyde is currently evaluating results after a recent strike along its concession line with CanadianOxy. But Lasmo is now said to have drilled three dry holes, while Nimir has just begun its drilling programme. As prospects of large discoveries diminish, oil companies will gradually have to adjust their exploration programmes, gearing their efforts to smaller finds near existing facilities to ensure commerciality. But oilmen insist that even such modest exploration efforts may be uneconomical under present production-sharing agreements with the Yemeni government. 'The government has tended to think in terms of quick large-scale finds and has negotiated contracts accordingly,' one says. 'That means small finds become commercially unattractive and that, in turn, puts a damper on further exploration.' But there are signs already that the government is adjusting to the new conditions, announcing last month extensions in the exploration agreements of Shell and Clyde. With concession areas ranging from 7,000 to 40,000 sq km, the added time should enable companies to explore larger portions of their territory and to evaluate more carefully the data they gather. CanadianOxy has now been in the country seven years and, as Mr Isautier points out: 'We still have a lot of ideas to work on to determine the ultimate potential of our fields'.

0,FT931-3231 ,"FT931-3231 _AN-DCQCCAB6FT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BHP steps up Chinese exploration efforts      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   BROKEN HILL Proprietary, the Australian steel and resources giant, is stepping up its involvement in China with new explorations ventures in oil and minerals. But its chairman, Mr Brian Loton, says the company is proceeding cautiously in a complex market. Speaking in Beijing at the weekend, Mr Loton said BHP's approach to China would be 'practical and hard-nosed', but at the same it recognised the growth of new opportunities now that the country was 'opening up'. The BHP chairman, who has tended to be regarded by company insiders as a 'China-sceptic', was visiting Beijing to assess an expanding range of options for BHP in both the resources and oil and gas sectors. He was received by Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, one of the Chinese leaders responsible for economic management, and officials of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industries. Mr Loton said that representatives of BHP Petroleum would be visiting China later this month to examine possible involvement in exploration of the vast Tarim basin in the north-west, which has recently been opened to foreign companies and may have reserves to match those of Saudi Arabia. He stressed, however, that BHP on its own did not have the resources necessary to explore China's desert wastes. This indicated that BHP might join forces with an oil major in a Tarim basin venture. BHP's experiences looking for oil in China had not been encouraging, Mr Loton noted. It had, for example, drilled 23 dry wells in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River delta in a consortium with British Petroleum. He added, nevertheless, that these setbacks had 'not dimmed our enthusiasm,' and that BHP was either actively engaged in exploration or was evaluating opportunities in several offshore areas. These included the Bohai Gulf in northern Chinese waters, the South China Sea and areas off Hainan island in the south. BHP was also expected to bid for blocks in the East China Sea off Shanghai in June. The company was also spending about ADollars 4m to evaluate a lead/zinc prospect in Sichuan province in China's centre-west. This venture marks something of a first for a foreign company in the strategic minerals and metals area. China has tended to guard jealously its minerals and onshore oil and gas resources from foreign involvement, but with demands from the leadership for speedier economic development, officials are now beginning actively to seek assistance abroad. Mr Loton said that his company had no immediate plans for further minerals exploration ventures, but he also noted that China recognised the expertise of companies like BHP in both looking for and exploiting mineral deposits. China has barely scratched the surface of its minerals assets across a vast country. An obsession with gold - in the past two decades about 70 per cent of China's exploration resources were devoted to looking for the metal - has been a serious drag on overall minerals development. BHP's chairman and his fellow executives were bullish about the company's iron ore sales to China, which they expected would rise by about 10 per cent to some 5m tonnes in 1993. The sales are being driven by the extraordinary growth in the Chinese economy in the past year of 12.8 per cent, well up on revised growth targets of 9 per cent. China produced 78m tonnes of steel last year, making it the world's number three producer. It is aiming for 100m tonnes a year by 2000, which represents continuing good news for BHP and other Australian iron ore suppliers.   Companies:-  Broken Hill Pty.     BHP Petroleum.

A strong performance from the remaining business travel division outweighed lacklustre performances in financial services and transport. Turnover for the six months to September 30 fell to Pounds 78.8m (Pounds 89.3m). Operating profit from continuing operations rose to Pounds 5.55m (Pounds 5.47m). The interim dividend goes up to 2.75p (2.6p), payable from earnings of 17.28p (9.35p) per share. The pre-tax profit figure includes a Pounds 6.7m net book gain from the sale of the travel chain. The result includes only a three-month contribution of Pounds 1.2m from the chain, compared with a six month figure of Pounds 3.45m last year. Mr Brian Perry, chairman, said the business travel division now had 34 of the leading 100 UK quoted companies as customers. Business travel operating profits increased to Pounds 1.62m (Pounds 900,000). Operating profits at the financial services division were only marginally ahead at Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 2.34m). The group said the division had suffered as companies had deferred decisions on pensions while they awaited the outcome of expected legislative changes. The prospect of change is, however, expected to boost demand for short-term consultancy work. Operating profits at the transport division fell to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.17m). European trailer and port operations performed well, but air freight suffered from low volumes and reduced margins. The group added that it had experienced a marked lull in cargo movements to the Falkland Islands, which had adversely affected yields on its regular shipping services to the South Atlantic.

State Councillor Song Jian and other leaders from the  central  and local governments took part in the meeting, which was  sponsored by the Environmental Protection Committee of the State  Council.    Speaking at the meeting, Xie Zhenhua, director of the State  Bureau of Environmental Protection, said that total proven coal  reserves in the adjacent area of Shanxi-Shaanxi-Inner Mongolia  now reach over 280 billion tons.    He said that reasonable exploration of coal resources in the  area is of great significance to promoting the development of  the national economy.    But, he added, natural conditions in the area are poor due  to  an overemphasis on exploration, to the detriment of  environmental protection.    As a result, the environment was seriously polluted in this  area, with much coal wasted and a large portion of topsoil  washed away, he said.    He added that the central government has paid very close  attention to environmental protection in developing natural  resources in the area.    He urged taking forceful measures to reorder coal  exploration  and strengthen supervision over environmental protection work in  this area.    In the near future, he continued, the urgent task is to  clear  out rivers to ensure that flood peaks pass safely in the coming  year.    The participants also investigated the serious soil damage  in  the area due to natural resource exploration.     "

0,FT943-11958 ,"FT943-11958 _AN-EG1ANAF5FT 940727   FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (10): Fields no longer marginal - Oil and gas exploration      By JAMES HARDING   Hydrocarbon exploration in Tunisia will reach a new high in 1994, with 38 exploration agreements in force and 20 exploration wells expected to be drilled. Uncharitable observers say the surge in exploration is a desperate bid to resurrect the industry after a 10.5 per cent fall in 1993 followed a decade of gradual decline in oil production. Increased domestic energy consumption, combined with falling output from Tunisia's largest oilfields, pushed exports down by 22 per cent to Dollars 23m below oil imports in 1993, forcing Tunisia into a deficit on its oil account for the first time in 20 years. A predicted rise in oil consumption from 3.516m metric tonnes in 1993 to 3.684m tonnes this year indicates that Tunisia will maintain a deficit in 1994. The decline in production is expected to slow, with an official estimate showing a 2.2 per cent drop to 4.545m tonnes in 1994. Gloom, however, is largely unwarranted. A shrewd government policy of enabling the production of marginal or previously unmarketable reserves and fiscal encouragement to explore for further fields will compensate for the decline of Tunisia's original large oil producers. High levels of exploration activity demonstrate international confidence that there are discoveries waiting to be made in Tunisia. And, starting from 1995, a hydrocarbons surplus seems assured with the coming on stream of gas from Miskar in the Gulf of Gabes. The Miskar field was discovered over 20 years ago but despite proven reserves of 33bn cu metres has remained untapped. It was only with the development of a guaranteed domestic market for gas, under- pinned by the transfer to gas-based electricity production and confirmed by a purchase agreement with the Tunisian government covering the lifetime of the field, that it became viable for development. British Gas is now investing Dollars 650m to set up four production platforms offshore, a 120km pipeline and the Hannibal processing plant, outside Sfax, which will remove nitrogen, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide and then pass the clean gas to power stations at Tunis, Sousse and Gabes. It is thought British Gas could start production as early as April 1995, with four wells open by the end of May, compared with a contractual date of September 1995. Peak production of 160m-180m cu ft a day (or 1.5m tonnes of oil equivalent a year) should be reached in a year and maintained for five to six years, while compression apparatus may be used at the offshore platforms from 1998 to keep output at capacity. The field's estimated life is 18 to 20 years. Tunisia has a lot to gain from Miskar. Gas production, primarily for the domestic energy market, will release a greater volume of oil for export. It will allow Tunisia to transfer more Algerian gas which it has used for domestic electricity generation, increasing its tariff income on the gas pumped through the Transmed pipeline from Algeria to Italy. A scheduled doubling in gas volume through Transmed in 1995 will further increase tariff revenues. The fixed tariff on the Algerian gas and the agreed price for gas from Miskar enable Tunisia to profit from spot trades in the fluctuating international gas market. And, of course, it is hoped that the British Gas project will increase employment in Sfax and develop the domestic skills base in gas production. British Gas, too, is expected to profit from a deal with a lifetime purchase guarantee, albeit at a price linked to oil. However, considering the size of investment for a comparatively small production volume, margins appear precariously narrow. However, the building of a processing plant designed to outlive the Miskar field by as much as 15 years indicates confidence at British Gas that its future in Tunisia will run to more than Miskar. That confidence is shared by a number of British Gas competitors. Despite a squeeze on funds in the last few years following the drop in oil prices, investment in exploration in Tunisia has almost doubled from Dollars 61m in 1988 to a predicted Dollars 120m in 1994. The reason for the high level of exploratory interest, according to Mr Kesraoui, chief executive of Etap, the state manager of the oil and gas sector, is the favourable environment for developing marginal fields. As well as the advantages of moderate labour costs and low transport requirements in a small country like Tunisia, Mr Kesraoui points to the fiscal and legislative regime which enables companies to produce profitably from small finds. The profits-related tax regime, the lowering of royalty and corporation tax rates and the establishment of capital uplifts on certain exploration expenditures have significantly improved the tax burden for international explorers. Not that the oil and gas industries in Tunisia are without any complaints. Government pressure to provide jobs and the demands of the employment codes require foreign companies to show tact and diplomacy in navigating the labour market. Industry observers calculate that Tunisian expectations for labour requirements on the British Gas Hannibal processing plant, for example, may be as much as five times the actual need. The tax regime, as well, is subject to criticism. Companies are taxed by field for their activities in Tunisia, as opposed to on a global basis. Thus, exploration and seismic analysis costs cannot be offset against production profits on fields discovered before 1990. Despite these gripes, the industry shows a healthier complexion than a decade ago. For the 12-year period following the discovery at Ashtart in 1974, there were no significant finds of new oil reserves. However, a discovery at the Ezzaouia field near Zarzis in 1986 was followed by Maamoura in 1988, and Sidi el Kilani in 1989, encouraging an adventurous mood among explorers. Dr Cameron Davies, of Oil Management Services, a hydrocarbon consultant, points out that finds in Tunisia's limestone reservoir 'helped to redirect the thinking of exploration geologists towards unusual reservoirs in chalks, karstified carbonates and hightly fractured limestones.' That new thinking and the fiscal regime have led to the opening and development of a number of small fields. The Belli field discovered in 1991 produces 16,000 barrels of oil a day, Sidi el Kilani averages 10,000 b/d and the Cercena field discovered in 1992 started production in June with 4,000 b/d. These sites are small in comparison with the volume of gas coming on line from Miskar. But encouraging marginal fields in the oil sector is the pragmatic way of regenerating the industry as the old mammoths wither.   Countries:-  TNZ  Tunisia, Africa.

The latest well, three kilometres south of BP's discovery, confirms that the Schiehallion reservoir extends into neighbouring exploration blocks. BP has estimated Schiehallion's recoverable oil reserves at 250m to 500m barrels. Amerada Hess, whose partners include Aran Energy, OMV and Murphy Petroleum, said it will hold talks with BP and its partner Shell on ways to 'appraise the technical and commercial potential of the field as quickly as possible'. Amerada Hess also announced that it had bought Esso's 15 per cent share in the nearby Clair field - a vast 3bn barrel reservoir which, with its complex geology and remote location, has so far defied development. The latest find at Schiehallion is expected to encourage other oil companies with acreage in the area to accelerate exploration programmes. Last week 10 companies said they were looking at the possibility of an integrated development scheme which might improve the economic viability of a number of projects west of Shetland. The deep water and bad weather in the area - and the absence of established infrastructure such as pipelines - makes development of the oil and gas resources relatively risky. Chevron yesterday announced that Ninian has become only the third North Sea oilfield to produce more than 1bn barrels. The others are Forties and Brent.   Companies:-  Amerada Hess.     Esso UK.

The aim is to double the recovery rate in the Rhourde el Baguel oilfield in eastern Algeria from 20 to 40 per cent of recoverable reserves. Of the total investment, Dollars 1bn will be spent in exploration over the next five years; the balance is the so-called 'entrance right'. This is the first agreement of this type concluded since Algeria's oil and gas exploration laws were liberalised in a new hydrocarbons law of December 1989. A string of oil exploration contracts have been signed over the past two years which have led to pacts signed between Sonatrach and more than two dozen international oil companies. The Arco deal came in the face of increased nervousness among foreign governments about the safety of their nationals in Algeria. On Monday, gunmen disguised as Algerian police killed four Russians and a Romanian working with Sonatrach. Suspected Moslem fundamentalists last week killed seven Italian seamen, and four Algerians died yesterday in a shootout outside Italy's Algiers embassy. Mr Livio Caputo, Italian deputy foreign minister, said in Rome that Italy had said it would reduce the number of Italians in Algeria and would boost security for expatriate workers and its diplomatic missions.

Summary of Comments         Several automobile manufacturers recommended that definite   fuel specifications for methanol and natural gas fuels used for   emissions and fuel economy testing be adopted. The commenters   stated that the proposed procedure allows for too much potential   inconsistency between the manufacturers and EPA in fuels used for   testing. Without fuel specifications, fuel economy and emission   results could vary in response to differences in fuel properties.   The manufacturers suggested that specifications for methanol   blends be based on chemical grade methanol (ASTM D 1152) and   certification grade gasoline (40 CFR 86.11382a).         EPA Response to Comments         The Agency agrees that setting fuel specifications for   alternative fuels for emission and fuel economy testing would   reduce the uncertainty associated with certification using   unspecified commercially representative fuels. However, EPA   believes that, to the extent variability in fuel specifications   can affect emissions, fuel specifications for methanol, natural   gas, and other alternative fuels used for emissions testing (and,   therefore, fuel economy testing since they are calculated from   the same test) should be representative of fuels encountered in-use. Certified automobiles are expected to comply with emission   standards under normal in-use conditions, which includes the use   of fuels that are representative of those commercially available.   The Administrator reserves the right to test vehicles using fuels   representative of those that in-use vehicles will encounter.     Ideally, fuel specifications should be developed that are   representative of in-use fuels. However, since the markets for   these fuels for use in motor vehicles are not yet established,   and the fuels that become commercially available could vary   significantly in composition, a single set of specifications may   not be representative of the fuels that could be used. Also, it   is difficult to identify which compositions are representative in   the absence of established markets.     On April 11, 1989, EPA published a final rulemaking in the       Federal Register     (54 FR 14426) which established emission   standards and test procedures for methanol-fueled automobiles.   In that rulemaking, methanol test fuels were required to be   representative of in-use fuels. However, the methanol fuel   market is not yet at a level of development to allow for the   determination of a representative fuel. EPA has developed a   package of proposed technical amendments (58 FR 11816, March 1,   1993) to the above-mentioned final rule to improve the quality of   emissions data and increase the flexibility for manufacturers to   meet the requirements. One of the proposals in this package is   to allow a combination of chemical grade methanol and   certification gasoline for test fuels in proportions that reflect   the composition of the intended in-use fuel (currently this would   be 85% methanol and 15% gasoline) until specifications for a fuel   representative of in-use fuel can be determined. EPA plans to   apply these provisions for both emissions and fuel economy   testing purposes.     For natural gas, the issue of setting fuel specifications   is being addressed in a separate rulemaking (``Standards for   Emissions From Natural Gas-Fueled, and Liquified Petroleum Gas-Fueled Motor Vehicles and Motor Vehicle Engines ***'' NPRM   published on November 5, 1992, 57 FR 52912). In the interim, EPA   will allow a manufacturer to petition the Administrator to use a   specific composition of natural gas, provided that the   manufacturer can demonstrate that this fuel is similar in   composition to currently available in-use fuel. If standard   grade fuels emerge when methanol, natural gas, ethanol, and other   alternative fuels become commercially available, EPA will   consider such fuels for setting test fuel specifications.

The ceremony promulgating it will mark the informal opening of campaigning for next May's presidential elections. The 1853 constitution was amended mainly to allow Mr Menem to stand for re-election when his term ends next year. The previous constitution banned successive presidential terms. Lifting this ban became Mr Menem's overriding political aim of the past two years. As well as allowing the president's re-election to a second, four-year term, the new constitution introduces a semi-parliamentary form of government, broadens the powers of Congress and gives the judiciary greater independence. The constitution is Mr Menem's greatest personal achievement since his election in July 1989. Last December, he overcame the opposition of the Radical Party, led by former president Raul Alfonsn, by promising a number of concessions in return for allowing his re-election. The constitution incorporates referenda and entrenches a broad range of individual rights and declarations of principles. These include recognition of Indian lands and a restatement of Argentina's claim to the Falkland Islands. Argentina has protested to Britain over the UK decision to extend a fishing exclusion zone around the Falklands, a government spokesman said yesterday, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Britain confirmed it was extending the zone to an area north of the islands known as the Gap. Mr Guido di Tella, Argentine foreign minister, handed the protest to Britain's ambassador, Mr Peter Hall, on Monday. Mr di Tella later criticised remarks by British Home Secretary Michael Howard claiming there was 'nothing to negotiate' over the islands. London denies its decision to expand the fishing exclusion zone is related to Argentina's renewed claims over the Falklands. But Mr di Tella called the extension a tit-for-tat move.

Statistics show that the city's individual households  involved in the private economy numbered 42,000 by the end of  1992, with a total registered capital of 440 million yuan, up 71  and 66 percent from the previous year's figures.    The city government has implemented more than 20  preferential  policies for the expansion of the private economy to cope with  establishing the socialist market economy in the country, said  Qian Dihua, mayor of Daqing.    The policies include the widening of private business  coverage and the reduction of taxes for self-employed workers.    The city government has worked hard to promote its private  economy by learning from the experience of Chinese coastal  cities in line with its own conditions, the mayor said.    Private manufacturers are engaged in the deep processing of  petroleum and chemical products, making use of Daqing's abundant  resources.    They produce necessary accessories for petroleum production  equipment. Using leftover bits and pieces of materials of a  chemical factory, more than 100 households in the city's datong  district make plastic fiber bags. The bags, costing half the  price demanded by similar products, sell well both in and  outside of the city.    Shi Fuxiang, a self-employed worker, set up a glass fiber  factory with an investment of more than one million yuan. The  factory uses leftover bits and pieces of glass to produce glass  cloth, which is used to wrap oil pipelines.    The factory turns out more than 1,000 meters of glass cloth  a  day.    The city government is now improving its market system to  further promote its private economic sector.     "

0,FT934-2584 ,"FT934-2584 _AN-DLMDEAEDFT 931213   FT  13 DEC 93 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (1): Gas becomes the jewel in the crown - Oil prices, which fell 20 per cent this year, may suffer even steeper falls once Iraq comes back on stream. But gas, once the oil industry's poor relation, is now the star performer      By ROBERT CORZINE   Mood swings are nothing new to the world's oil and gas industry. Its history is writ large with extreme movements in prices and a supply situation that can fluctuate rapidly between shortfalls and surplus. To some observers the 20 per cent slump in oil prices this year may be seen as merely a temporary blip. Advocates of this argument say demand and supply is nearly in balance, and that oil prices are likely to edge back up to average Dollars 17-Dollars 18 next year. The most recent price falls, they believe, reflect over-nervous financial markets, which have reacted badly to persistently low demand in the main consuming countries at a time of particularly plentiful oil supplies. But others warn that today's depressed prices may be just the first phase of a deeper collapse. They note that crude oil prices have fallen by an average of 9 per cent a year since 1991, with few positive factors on the horizon. Traders are beset with reasons why oil prices could fall further. There is the prospect of even greater amounts of oil becoming available next year from a resurgent North Sea and other producers outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. There is also considerable scope for market volatility in the run-up to the re-emergence of Iraqi oil exports, possibly as early as the second half of 1994 if Baghdad meets United Nations demands over the long-term monitoring of industry with military potential. Pessimistic observers say such conditions could even prompt the benchmark Brent Blend to fall below Dollars 10 a barrel - a level last seen in the price collapse of 1986 - although in real terms prices are already at those levels. The major oil companies had been scurrying off in search of new supplies of relatively cheap oil. That search has been fuelled by the opening up in recent years of large parts of the world previously out-of-bounds to the industry, including the former Soviet Union and China. But much of the industry's current capital spending is still concentrated in well-known areas. This is due in part to the application of new seismic and drilling technology. This is occurring both in new areas, just being opened to exploration, as well as in mature regions such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, whose original development can be traced to earlier periods of high oil prices. Such techniques are being used by both the major companies and a growing band of independents to add substantially to the life of many existing fields and producing regions. Such strategies have the added benefit of maximising the investment made over the years in costly infrastructure such as platforms, pipelines and terminals. For the big integrated oil companies, however, the recent decline in oil prices and the knock-on effect on their share prices has taken much of the gloss off such achievements. Suddenly the themes put forward by both the US and European majors and which so impressed the markets earlier this year - successful reductions in overheads and a renewed focus on core businesses - no longer seem so convincing. Sceptical investors wonder what will happen to the majors' cash flow if average prices next year are closer to the current level of Dollars 14 a barrel, rather than the Dollars 18-Dollars 20 a barrel to which a number of companies have successfully adjusted. Weak oil and share prices would also affect the search for ever-cheaper and bigger reserves in the world's frontier areas. Exploration efforts in remote areas of China and the countries of the former Soviet Union are in their early stages. The majors have committed large amounts of skilled manpower, but their capital costs are so far relatively small. That could soon change, however, as projects in those areas become serious competitors for scarce development funds, say analysts. The scale of such undertakings is illustrated by a recent estimate by Chase Manhattan Bank that western companies could be spending more than Dollars 5bn a year on exploration and development projects in the former Soviet Union within a 'couple of years, and much more in five to 10 years'. The integrated majors have downstream profits to fall back on when prices weaken, a factor much in evidence in third quarter results. But chronic refining over-capacity in Europe threatens to undercut margins, while the recession in Europe and Japan continues to dampen final demand. The independent exploration companies have no downstream buffer to fall back on. A prolonged period of price weakness could not only cut into new exploration and development spending. It could also trigger off an acquisition hunt by bigger cash-rich companies keen to secure sound assets at bargain prices. The financial pressures imposed on the corporate sector by low oil prices are nothing, however, to those being felt by the 12 members of Opec. The extent of the potential damage is highlighted by the fact that for every annualised dollar fall in the oil price, member states lose a combined Dollars 5bn in annual revenues. Opec's overall oil revenues have fallen steadily in the first three quarters of this year. The most recent price falls mean they could reach a level not seen since before the Kuwaiti crisis of 1990, according to a recent study by the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies. Even Saudi Arabia, the dominant producer, is experiencing a budgetary crisis. The failure or inability of many Opec members to diversify their economies and reduce their dependence on oil revenues has compounded the pain induced by the price falls. It also raises the spectre of possible social unrest in the most vulnerable Opec countries, such as Iran and Nigeria, whose non-oil domestic economies are performing poorly. The oil industry is looking to Opec to stabilise the market with production cuts. But the organisation faces a dilemma, according Gulf Arab officials. A modest cut from its current output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day might send a positive signal that Opec can fine-tune production to suit very short-term demand. But it would also cause some members to cheat on their individual production quotas, say the Gulf officials, thereby triggering further price falls. Opec's decision in November to maintain the present production ceiling into the new year was also based on a belief that the demand will increase, either through bad weather in the industrialised world or as a result of cheap prices encouraging the greater use of oil in those economies which are growing. But the decision also reflected Opec anger that independent producers are nibbling away at the organisation's market share. Opec no longer wants to play the role of swing producer, say officials, and a production cut would simply hasten the gains being made by non-Opec producers. The decision not to budge was also a reflection of the reluctance on the part of Saudi Arabia and other large Opec states to cut quotas in advance of Iraqi exports being readmitted into the production ceiling, probably by the second half of next year. An emergency meeting will be called as soon as the UN gives the go-ahead for renewed Iraqi exports. It could prove to be one of the most contentious in Opec history given the antagonism between Iraq and its Gulf neighbours. Iraq, which has the world's second largest reserves, is adamant that it should be allowed to return to the export markets with a large quota. But that would require deep cuts in the quotas of other members, most notably Saudi Arabia, at a time when their need for oil revenues is rising. The pessimistic mood which has gripped the oil industry has shown no signs of infecting the gas sector. Gas is increasingly being viewed as the most environmentally benign fuel, a label which is ensuring a high degree of interest in developed markets such as Europe. In October the first gas was delivered to continental Europe from fields off Norway under the Troll agreement, the largest commercial contract in the history of the petroleum industry. A number of pipeline proposals are under consideration to link continental Europe with new reserves. These include the possible construction of an inter-connector between the UK and Belgium, as well as additional lines from Russia and Norway. In the US, newly-deregulated markets have resulted in higher prices, which in turn have persuaded a number of companies to explore for new reserves. Elsewhere, and especially in Asia, gas-fired power generation schemes are seen as one of the fastest and cheapest ways to make up from shortages of electricity.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.

That compared with a previous deficit of Pounds 1.2m, a figure restated to conform with accounting changes which forced the company to write off Pounds 80m of previously unsuccessful exploration expenditure. Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give the company the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Clyde is also involved in the offshore development of the Wytch Farm oilfield in Dorset, the Stirling oilfield and several gas fields in the Netherlands. Some 90 per cent of the company's commercial reserves will come on stream by 1994. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p. Clyde is continuing its exploration efforts in the Yemen and Syria as well as some small developments in the Netherlands. Turnover for 1992 dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m). COMMENT Investors taking up the rights issue are demonstrating their faith in the management to continue growing the company beyond its production peak in 1994. But at 44p a share, the rights issue is priced at a discount to the company's net asset value, which is estimated to be between 50p and 56p a share. The company will reach a peak in production and see a big increase in earnings and cashflow in the next few years. But investors must ask how sustainable this is. Clyde is clearly hoping for good exploration success in the Yemen, the results of which will become apparent towards the end of the year.

0,FT944-9108 ,"FT944-9108 _AN-EKQEIABBFT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Venezuela opens its oil sector to private capital: Exploration tenders sought for first time since nationalisation in 1976      By JOSEPH MANN   Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976. Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit-sharing contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10 geographical areas onshore and offshore. Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves. If commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered, the private investor will then set up a joint venture with one of PDVSA's operating subsidiaries  -Corpoven, Lagoven or Maraven - to develop the new fields and market the oil internationally. If no oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the private party bears the loss. The PDVSA plan must still be approved by the cabinet of President Rafael Caldera and by a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress. PDVSA officials expect no big problems. PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, has extensive proven reserves of heavy crude oil and bitumen, but wants to boost its reserves of higher-value light and medium crudes to stay competitive internationally. At end-1993, PDVSA's proven reserves of crude oil stood at 64.5bn barrels, the largest in the western hemisphere. Executives at PDVSA say geological and seismic studies indicate that the country still has large, undiscovered deposits of light and medium crude oils. Exploration of the most promising areas by PDVSA on its own would require capital investments of Dollars 6bn-8bn, taking more than 25 years. However, PDVSA expects that if private investors join the effort to find oil, exploration of these same areas could be completed in 10 years, with all exploration investment paid for by private companies. The areas to be put up for tender could hold between 7bn and 23bn barrels of light/medium crudes, plus 10,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates made by PDVSA after a British Petroleum survey. Winning bidders will be chosen on the basis of how much of their future after-tax profits they are willing to hand over to the state if they find oil and gas. PDVSA says that according to risk contacts offered in other countries, the state keeps between 71 and 88 per cent of after-tax earnings, with the remainder going to private investors. In developing its proposals, PDVSA has been mindful of the failure of this year's round of oil and gas tenders in neighbouring Colombia. But while international oil companies such as Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco and others have shown considerable interest in the Venezuelan plan, they have some reservations. For example, some would prefer a transparent mechanism that would reduce their payments to the state to encourage them to develop profitably any smaller, more remote fields. The government is working on a plan which would offer possible post facto reductions in royalty payments in such cases. Companies have also expressed concern about government policy, including strict controls on foreign exchange transactions and the suspension of constitutional rights to private property. PDVSA and the government are working on possible solutions. PDVSA managers point out, for example, that when investors are ready to repatriate profits, probably in several years, exchange controls should have been lifted or softened. 'Venezuela is without doubt one of the most attractive countries for risk investment in exploration,' said the local representative of a US oil company. 'If PDVSA can work out the kinks, they should receive a strong response from bidders, and could obtain several billion dollars in exploration and development capital over the next decade.' Venezuela has been slowly opening up its nationalised oil industry for the last few years. Under the previous government, private oil companies were allowed to produce crude and natural gas under operating contracts in so-called marginal (relatively small) oil fields. But in these cases, the operator is paid on a per-barrel basis by PDVSA; the oil does not belong to the private investor and must be turned over to PDVSA. Several important joint ventures between PDVSA units and foreign companies have been established in producing natural gas and upgrading heavy oil, but none has begun to operate. Until now, exploration for and production of crude oil (for eventual sale) had been off limits to private investors.   Companies:-  Petroleos de Venezuela.

Tomorrow it is 10 years since the Argentines invaded the Falklands. In Chester, standing on his now-indispensable soapbox, Mr Major said: 'What do we hear from the Labour leader as we come up to the anniversary of the Falklands war? He wants to enter into discussions about what the future of the Falklands should be. 'I wonder what message that gives to the soldiers, airmen and navymen who actually fought in that war and to the people still living there.' Mr Kinnock had indicated Labour might be ready to negotiate with a stable Argentine democracy about the Falklands, provided that there were enforceable guarantees about the islands' security. He said: 'There cannot be anything done without the active consent of the people of the Falkland Islands. Too much has been expended, the loyalty is too great and the status is too important for there to be any abandonment of the needs and desires of the people of the Falklands.' Mr Major also highlighted the contrast between his campaigning and the more 'closely minded' style of Mr Kinnock. He told a lone heckler in the crowd of a few hundred: 'It's nice to see one member of the Labour party who doesn't live in a field train, secreted from the rest of the world. 'Wherever I go between now and April 9 this soapbox is coming with me. There is no way they are going to stop the Conservative message getting right out on the streets.'

The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US - Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at a cumulative rate of 8,100 barrels of oil and condensate and 82.5m cu ft of gas a day. It is the third discovery from four exploration wells which Anadarko has drilled in the area. Two additional prospects in the area will be drilled soon, according to Mr John Hogan, chief operating officer. The desert areas being explored have so far been free from any of the political violence affecting Algeria. But drilling crews and technical staff are flown directly to the area, thus avoiding the capital, Algiers. Further drilling to appraise the full potential of the discoveries is likely to take place later this year, the company said. It is also assessing the overall potential of Algeria in light of the string of discoveries. Premier Consolidated Oilfields, an independent exploration and production company, has found gas in a new field to the west of the large Qadripur gas field in Pakistan. The discovery in the Ghauspur block was in geology similar to that of Qadripur. But the different composition of the gas confirmed it was a separate field, the company said. Gas from the latest find has a relatively low calorific value and a high nitrogen content, but the company believes it could be marketable if the reserve proves large enough.

0,FT921-6640 ,"FT921-6640 _AN-CB0CIAADFT 920227   FT  27 FEB 92 / Survey of Dominican Republic (5): Balaguer set to award Dollars 200m contract - Mining      By CANUTE JAMES   IN A few weeks the Dominican government will name the foreign company it has approved to develop what will be one of the largest gold-mining ventures in the Americas, writes Canute James. The companies have put in bids for building facilities to exploit gold and silver deposits, which are owned by Rosario Dominicana, the state company, in Pueblo Viejo in the island's north. The development of the facility follows the exhaustion of reserves in the oxide zone of the mine, and a decline in the country's gold and silver output in recent years. Bids are being considered from four companies - Davy McKee of the UK, Minproc Engineering and BHP Utah International of Australia, and Paulo Abib/Andrea Gutierrez of Brazil. The favoured company will be granted a Dollars 200m contract. Rosario Dominicana expects that the Pueblo Viejo sulphide zone will yield an average of 1,100 ounces of gold (with 40 per cent silver content) a day. The country expects to earn about USDollars 7bn before the deposits are exhausted. All the companies have presented projects that would take between two and 2 1/2 years to complete. The board of Rosario Dominicana is evaluating the bids, and such is the importance which the government has attached to the venture that the final decision on the award of the contract will be taken by President Balaguer. The development and exploitation of the sulphide zone will reverse the trend in the decline in production of precious metals. Gold production in 1981 was 412,991 ounces, but fell gradually to 138,640 ounces in 1990 and is estimated to have been slightly less last year. 'Gold production has been falling as the oxide deposits have been exhausted and attention has been turned to a transition zone,' says Mr Gerald Ellis, director-general for minerals. That zone will be worked for three years and then the sulphite zone will be exploited for about 25 years. The transition zone will be mined until 1993 and is expected to yield gold and silver worth about Dollars 125m. Earnings from the expanded gold-mining venture will lift the country's already significant minerals sector, now dominated by nickel production. The Dominican Republic is the world's seventh largest nickel producer and the second largest after Canada in the western hemisphere. The country's proven reserves are about 37.8m tonnes with a grading of 1.72 per cent nickel. The only producer, Falconbridge Dominicana, a subsidiary of a Canadian company, has a facility with a capacity of 63m lb a year. The industry, which has overtaken sugar as the main foreign currency earner for the Dominican Republic, has been troubled by domestic and market problems in recent years. The plant was shut in 1988 as the company and the government argued over an export levy. The issue was resolved when the government guaranteed the company's mining operations and exports, while the company allowed the state an increased share in profits. More recently, the industry was affected by low prices and weak demand for nickel. Exports last year are estimated to have been slightly lower that the 67.4m lb exported in 1990, and which were valued at Dollars 262.1m. The reduced production was caused by a cutback in production by Falconbridge in the last quarter of last year because of low prices. 'Several companies are involved in exploration for precious and base metals in other parts of the country,' says Mr Ellis. 'There is some hope of finding another major gold deposit, and several major Japanese, US and Canadian companies are in the hunt.' The companies include the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan and Canyon Resources and Battle Mountain of the US. At the same time, a number of companies is involved in oil exploration as the government attempts to reduce its dependence on foreign oil, and to ensure that its electricity generating capacity is below demand. The company needs about 23m barrels of oil a year, and the government clearly hopes that two ventures will yield oil. Mobil of the US and Once Once, a joint US/Dominican venture are exploring areas offshore and onshore for which they have been granted licences. 'The Dominican Republic has a policy which is favourable to investments in petroleum and mining,' says Mr Ellis. 'The country is willing to welcome any company which comes. The paperwork and the bureaucracy are slow, but we are trying to speed up things.' The bauxite mining industry is in an uncertain state. Mines which were worked by the Aluminum Company of America were closed in 1982 after declining production. The Dominican Republic, a founding member of the International Bauxite Association, a producers' organisation, lost its membership when the industry died. There have since been bauxite shipments from the country when agreed quantities are mined by a local company, Ideal Dominicana, for the Aluminum Company of America. Most of this has been to fill shortfalls in Alcoa's operations, notably in Surinam when that industry was affected two years ago by anti-government rebels. Mr Ellis reported that the Dominican Republic has 15m tonnes of bauxite reserves, and that Alcoa ordered 150,000 tonnes of ore last year. The order was not filled as President Balaguer suspended mining because of increasing local concern over deforestation and other adverse environmental effects. The government has also been trying to expand production of other minerals. Corde, the holding company for state enterprises, is attempting to increase output of gypsum, lifting production which was 75,000 tonnes in 1990, to about 250,000 tonnes a year. There are also plans to lift marble extraction well beyond current levels which average 20,000 cubic metres a year. Limestone production has also fluctuated in recent years, moving from 350,000 tonnes in 1989 to 503,000 tonnes last year.  The Financial Times   London Page 34  "

The agreement gives Amoco Romania Petroleum, a subsidiary of Amoco Production Company, rights to a 750 sq km (290 sq miles) area in the Carpathian Mountains about 60 km (37 miles) north-east of Bucharest, which Amoco won after an international tender in September 1990. A Canadian Occidental/Enterprise Oil combine, which won two offshore sites in the Black Sea and, Shell, which successfully bid for an area in Transylvania, are due to sign similar contracts within the next 10 days. The western companies are expected to invest about Dollars 90m in the next three years as part of an initial five-year exploration period. However, Rompetrol said developing the sites in the event of commercial finds could could cost more than Dollars 2.4bn. Rompetrol retains the right to acquire up to 20 per cent in any development, with the western companies, which have received substantial tax concessions from the Romanian government, free to export their share of production. Mr David Work, vice-president of Amoco Production, said the agreement was consistent with the company's strategy of investing in areas with known hydrocarbon potential. The deal, which was held up for several months until the Romanian parliament passed enabling legislation, is Amoco's first exploration agreement in central Europe. Existing wells in Romania, historically one of central Europe's major oil-producing areas, were heavily exploited under the Ceausescu regime. However, the dictator's obsession with paying off the national debt kept the Romanian oil industry short of funds for further exploration, contributing to a drop in domestic crude oil production from more than 12m tonnes in 1979 to 6.8m tonnes last year. SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil producer, said yesterday its Snorre oil and gas field had come on stream six weeks earlier than planned and NKr1.5bn (Pounds 135m) below budget at a cost of NKr16.6bn, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo. Recoverable oil reserves are put at 770m barrels. Production will be gradually built up beyond 100,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, by which time production from a seabed installation will have come on stream, allowing production capacity of 190,000 b/d to be reached early next year. Snorre is providing Saga's first production from a field that it operates. It has been developed with the Norwegian North Sea's first tension leg platform, the biggest of its kind in the world. Oil and gas is processed at the nearby Statfjord field, with oil tanker loaded and gas exported further via the Statpipe line to the European continent.  The Financial Times   London Page 22  "

Tuskar must drill two further wells to hold its licence beyond June 30 this year. In an interim statement last month Mr Neil O'Donoghue, Tuskar's chairman, said that commercial development of the field would require investment sufficient to produce oil at 25,000 barrels per day to offset high transport costs and the current low prices for the heavy crude which the field produces. He said: 'The required amount of funds cannot be raised at this time, and any attempt to do so would not even raise sufficient funds to complete the current work programme.'

Basic customs duty on general capital  goods and project imports is reduced from 35 percent to 25  percent. Duty slabs for machine tools reduced from three to  two. New duty rates are 35 percent and 45 percent. Customs  duty on steel reduced to 50 percent. Major nonferrous metals  like copper, zinc, and lead will have a unified rate of 50  percent to promote investment.    Import duty on all types of ores and concentrates has been  reduced and will now attract a uniform rate of 10 percent.  Import duty on melting scraps also reduced from 12.5 percent to  10 percent; iron ore pellets from 15 percent to 10 percent. The  import duty structure for chemicals and pharmaceuticals has also  been rationalized and reduced. The peak rate of duty on  chemicals has been brought down to 65 percent.    In the pharmaceutical sector, import duty on a large number  of raw materials varying between 85 percent to 50 percent at  present are lowered to 50 percent and 25 percent. Import duty  on various machinery and raw materials to be used in the leather  industry has been drastically reduced. The new rate will be 20  percent. This has been done to boost export efforts of the  leather industry. Electronics and telecommunication sectors have  also attracted concessions. Import duty on computer parts has  been reduced to 50 percent from the present 80 percent.  Similarly, the import duty on application software reduced from  85 percent to 20 percent. For nonelectronic parts for the  manufacture of the telecommunication equipment, import duty has  been reduced by 10 percent. The new rate will be 40 percent  while on optical fiber it has been slashed by almost half to 40  percent.    Domestic watch industry will also enjoy concession to make  it  internationally competitive. Import duty on some items of  machinery is reduced by half to 25 percent. The import duty  structure on coal and petroleum has been simplified. The new  import duty on these items will be 35 percent. Duty on coke  from 85 percent to 25 percent. LPG [liquefied petroleum gas] to  have 15 percent import duty, while naphtha and coal continued to  be exempted. However, the changes are not to affect the  administered prices of petroleum products.    On the excise front duty [as heard], the finance minister  has  also announced major reforms as part of modernizing the tax  structure. The benefits of the MODVAT [modified value added  tax] scheme have been extended to capital goods and petroleum  products. The excise duty for petroleum products are to be  rationalized. The existing specific rates will be replaced by a  uniform ad valorem rate of 10 percent.    Concessions now available for the fertilizer industry to  continue. Duty on manmade fibers rationalized. All fibers and  blended or spun yarns will be charged uniform excise duty of 20  percent. There will be an ad valorem duty of 60 percent on  polyester or filament yarn, 30 percent on nylon and  polypropylene yarn, and 15 percent for viscose filament yarn.  On cotton yarn, the duty will be now a uniform 5 percent  instead of the present varying rates. Cosmetics and other  personal care products are to cost less. The duty rate on these  products is being reduced from 70 to 50 percent. But cigarettes  are to cost more. They will attract an additional 12 percent  duty. However, in the nonfilter segment, the excise duty for up  to 60 mm category is being reduced from 120 rupees per thousand  to 60 rupees.    To widen the base for indirect taxes, the finance minister  has proposed to bring the services sector under the tax net. A  5 percent charge will be made on the amount of telephone bill,  the net premium charged by nonlife insurance companies and the  brokerage or commission charged by stock brokers for their  services.

Their  development, on the basis of the concepts of the capitalist  market economy, will be priorities for the economic development  of the country, without denying the positive role played by  trade and construction. Now, at the conclusion of the second  year of democratic government, it is very significant that these  three fields of economic development have registered increases.  Statistics are more eloquent that any propaganda of orators,  since they do not allow you to depart from reality and they  clearly show the development of Albania on the basis of the  program of the Albanian Democratic Party.    The Voice of Progress From the Subsoil    The figures are higher at the end of this year, compared to  1992, for all the mines and the processing industry. For  example, compared to the same period in 1992, the Chrome  Corporation had, for the 10-month period, some 1,939,455,000  leks' worth of goods sold, or 617,758,000 more than in 1992 -- a  147 percent increase. Before the end of the year, the Copper  Corporation had 1,295,822,000 leks' worth of goods sold, or  167,643,000 leks more than last year -- a 115 percent increase.  The work continues without interruption. The Petroleum  Corporation had 6,386,541,000 leks' worth of petroleum sold for  the period from January to the end of October 1993,  2,082,745,000 more than in 1992 -- a 148 percent increase.  Elektro-Energjetika is coming into the new year with 735,521,000  more leks' worth of product sold than in the first year of the  democratic government. The demarcation line between the  communist hell and the free and rich life is 22 March 1992.  [passage omitted]    In 1993, 24,889 more metric tons of petroleum, 7,882 more  tons of gas, 13 tons, or 117 percent more lubricating oil, and  13,162 more tons, or 126 percent more distilled fuel oil were  processed than in 1992. Other petroleum subproducts such as  petroleum pitch and petroleum coke also registered increases of  6,544 tons and 7,895 tons, respectively. This has been a good  year for the chrome mines, which are the treasures of the  Albanian subsoil, along with the petroleum and copper resources.  Some 5,156 more tons of 41.6 percent enriched chrome and 11,356  more tons of carbonic ferrochrome were produced in 1993 than in  1992. And what about the copper mines? Some 6,141 more tons of  concentrate, 426 more tons of blister copper, and 204.2 more  tons of copper wire and cables than in 1992. There was also an  increase in the production of electric power, caustic soda,  glass products, fabrics, knitted goods, clothing, plastic  products, and so forth.    New Investments of the Democratic Government    In the area of investments, the team of the Ministry of  Mines  and Mineral Resources, headed by Abdyl Xhaja, worked in  accordance with the program and the economic platform of the  democratic government. Thus, in the sectors covered by this  ministry, some 432.3 million of the planned 562.7 million leks  were invested in only nine months. Some 116.8 million leks were  invested in oil drilling and prospecting and we have 101.8  million leks for geological prospecting. [passage omitted]    During the year, considerable investment funds were devoted  to the construction of roads connecting the mines to residential  centers, cities, and villages. Some 32.7 leks were invested for  more than 12 segments of roads, 103 percent more than in 1992.  About 28.2 million leks, more than the planned amount, have been  invested for the modernization of some wells and other annexes  in the main mines of the country, for the purpose of increasing  production and creating new work places.    New Work Places Are Being Created    For the mineral processing and mining industry, the year  1993  saw an increase in the creation of new work places, although not  to the extent which is possible for this priority field of our  economy. Nevertheless, it should be stressed that more people  got jobs in the industry in 1993 than in 1992. As of 1993, about  103,507 people are employed in enterprises of the mining  industry, including the budgetary and nonbudgetary sector. In  addition to the wage fund of 2,802,038,000 leks, the democratic  state has given these workers an additional 570,897,000 leks in  compensation, for the purpose of relieving and alleviating the  social problems which are a natural result of the implementation  of economic reform.

0,FT922-8324 ,"FT922-8324 _AN-CENCNAADFT 920514   FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of Argentina (4): Coming in from the cold - Foreign Policy      By STEPHEN FIDLER   PRESIDENT Carlos Menem's love of the grand gesture makes him, on occasions, a diplomat's nightmare. The examples are legion. Rather than downgrade subtly the quality of the Argentine delegation to the Non-Aligned Movement, as a diplomat might have advised, he pulls Argentina out with a grand fanfare. Rather than wait for an invitation to visit Britain, which would certainly have been forthcoming in time, he announces, through the medium of the FT, a plan to pay a visit to the UK in 1992, an election year and the 10th anniversary of the Falklands war. (The visit seems likely to take place in 1993.) In contrast to the awkward reaction of most Latin American governments to the crisis in the Gulf, Mr Menem sends two warships to support the US-led coalition. He also followed the hard US line on Cuba, breaking ranks with the rest of Latin America. Mr Menem is telling the world that Argentina is a changed country; that the 60 years of isolationism which marked Argentina's foreign policy is over. He is seeking to bury Argentina's reputation as an unreliable player on the world's diplomatic stage. Mr Fernando Petrella, deputy foreign minister, argues that 'Argentina's internal and its international policies are a unity'. In other words, a democratic, open economy requires a different foreign policy from a closed economy run by a dictator. The wide-ranging manifestations of this policy include: Alignments: Argentina has aligned itself more closely to the west. This was initially seen as a pro-Washington tilt to policy, an interpretation disliked in both Washington and Buenos Aires. More recently, there has been emphasis on relations with Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of external trade compared with 15 per cent in the US. Family ties with Europe are strong - more than 1m Argentines are also citizens of EC countries. International agreements: Argentina has professed an intention to comply with a wide range of these that it had previously refused to sign. In April President Menem signed a decree placing strict controls on the export of sensitive materials. The government has signed agreements with Brazil on nuclear inspection, and with Brazil and Chile on banning nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. The nuclear safeguards laid down by the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna have been adopted. The government has made a commitment to the US to abandon the Condor missile project, expressed a desire to join the Missile Technology Control Regime and committed itself to nuclear non-proliferation and the Tlatelolco treaty which banks nuclear weapons in Latin America. It has also signed treaties on international investment protection. Despite all this, many of these commitments have yet to be ratified by the Argentine Congress. Furthermore, there will remain some doubts about the ability of the government to force compliance on the military of some of these agreements. Nonetheless, the reaction from Washington has been positive. The US has said that some 20 Skyhawk jets are available to the Argentine air force, the first indication of US willingness to combat aircraft to Argentina since the Falklands War. Relations with neighbouring countries: Argentina has eased historically tense relations with Brazil and Chile. This has a strong economic motive. The government is intent on economic integration with Brazil, the key to which is Mercosur, a customs union of the two economies with Uruguay and Paraguay. That is scheduled to begin in 1995, though its implementation may be delayed. The hope is that Chile will join the group once Brazil's economic problems abate. But there is little doubt that the excitement in Argentina over integration with Brazil is not matched in Brazil. There are also some worries that Mercosur may restrict Argentina's ability to act unilaterally over trade matters, for example, in discussing a free trade agreement with the US. However, given the openness of the Argentine and the Chilean economies, and the growing outward orientation of Brazil, further economic integration appears inevitable with or without agreements among governments. Companies from the three countries are already discussing mergers and joint venture agreements, and Chilean companies have already been buyers (of two power stations) in the Argentine privatisation programme. Relations with the UK: Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Britain in July 1990. These had been broken with the invasion of the Falkland Islands 10 years ago. That was also the key to improving relations with the European Community. With the issue of sovereignty under a so-called umbrella - meaning both sides retain their claim to sovereignty - fairly cordial discussions between London and Buenos Aires have moved ahead on the practical issues of fishing rights and aviation. There has been less progress on the more difficult issue of oil exploration rights. Mr Guido di Tella, the Argentine foreign minister, has also said that the desires of the islanders will be taken into account in a settlement, a statement viewed as constructive in London. While Britain retains a garrison of 2,000 men on the islands that the Argentines know as the Malvinas, Argentina must be considered now neither to have the intent nor the military capability to invade. Thus the only risk to the 2,100 islanders is the small one of an attack by some maverick force. The Argentines have not given up on their claim to the islands, however, and the war remains a traumatic experience over which they still agonise. Since there is little chance of the British parliament cutting a deal over sovereignty over the heads of the islanders, the Argentine government appears to have embarked on a longer-term strategy of reducing the islanders' fear of things Argentine. If this is so, policy towards the Falklands fits neatly with the rest of Argentine foreign policy: to convince the world that Argentina is now a democratic, stable and reliable member of the community of nations.

R. 645200100, scope of rules for coal exploration; Utah Admin. R. 645201200, notices of intention to conduct minor coal exploration; and Utah Admin. R. 645202200, performance standards.  Based upon the additional revisions to the proposed program amendment submitted by Utah, OSM reopened the public comment period in the July 29, 1994,     Federal Register     (59 FR 38578, administrative record No. UT956). The public comment period ended on August 15, 1994.      III. Director's Findings      As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds that the proposed program amendment submitted by Utah on January 27, 1994, and as revised by it on May 10 and July 11, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations.

According to a 1993 Mexican Petroleum (Pemex) report, Mexico  is willing to sell its entire stock of crude exports to the  United States as long as U.S. market prices for Mexican oil are  best for the country. In 1993, Mexico sent almost two-thirds of  all the oil it sold abroad to the U.S. market. The nation's  overall income from oil and petroleum products in 1993 was  $5.992 billion. (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 21 Mar 94 p  15)    Mexico's oil reserves decreased between 3.5 and 4 percent in  1993. Nevertheless, the decline was not as sharp as in previous  years. Pemex Director Francisco Rojas announced at ceremonies  marking the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's  nationalization that Mexico currently has oil reserves of 64.769  billion barrels. Energy industry sources say the decrease in  the reserves resulted from meager investments in the exploration  and production of oil, despite the discovery of new deposits.  (Mexico City UNOMASUNO in Spanish 18 Mar 94 p 19)    Pemex Director Francisco Rojas says oil production in Mexico  declined last year by 14 percent. Rojas attributed the decline  to the ""worst cyclical depression ever experienced by the  petrochemical industry worldwide and Mexico's economic  recession."" President Carlos Salinas de Gortari spoke at the  same event -- the 56th anniversary of the Mexican oil industry's  nationalization. He reiterated that ""oil is a strategic  resource for our great nation and will continue to be the  exclusive property of the Mexican people."" Salinas added that  oil has remained a nonnegotiable point in NAFTA. (Hamburg DPA  in Spanish 0037 GMT 19 Mar 94)    President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has announced in  Tlaxcala  that the National Foreign Trade Bank and the Secretariat of  Commerce and Industrial Development, Secofi, will redouble its  efforts to allow more medium-sized and small businesses to enter  the North American, Central American, and European export  markets. (Mexico City XEW Television Network in Spanish 0430  GMT 12 Mar 94)    Fernando Heftye, Secofi's director of foreign investments,  says that through February foreign investments in Mexico  amounted to just over $4 billion, which could increase to $15  billion by year's end. Heftye said at least 20 countries are  interested in signing bilateral agreements to protect and  promote investment but that a formal negotiations process has  not been initiated. Among the countries interested, he said,  are Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Spain.  (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO in Spanish 17 Mar 94 pp 1, 6)    Jacques Lecomte, European Union, EU, ambassador to Mexico,  says Mexico's exports to Europe decreased by 17 percent in 1993  because of the economic recession in the region. This decline  in sales also slowed the Mexican economy and fostered  uncertainty among Mexican businessmen prior to the signing of  NAFTA. Lecomte said the EU has not conducted studies on the  impact NAFTA will have on the EU-Mexican trade balance, but, he  added, telecommunications will be among the most adversely  affected areas. Lecomte concluded that the European countries  would like to increase their exports to Mexico. (Mexico City  NOTIMEX in Spanish 0242 GMT 16 Mar 94)    French Ambassador to Mexico Paul Dijou says French investors  and bankers would like to establish themselves in Mexico because  NAFTA has made it a strategic point for investments. They are  considering opening branches or establishing partnerships with  Mexican banks. Dijou toured Puebla State to sign technological  cooperation agreements with the Autonomous University of Puebla.  (Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 0148 GMT 16 Mar 94)    Mexico's industrialization process has remained at a  standstill over the past 13 years. Today, high technology  exports total 60 percent of the country's total exports.  Mexico's participation in the international market with  sophisticated technical equipment is limited by the industrial  underdevelopment in Latin America. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 3A)    The nation's airlines are not ready to deal with the  increased shipping of merchandise under NAFTA. Domestic cargo  service by domestic airlines decreased 3.8 percent over the past  two years, while foreign airlines increased their cargo services  by 30 percent over the same period. (Mexico City EL FINANCIERO  in Spanish 16 Mar 94 p 21)    EL FINANCIERO conducted an economic analysis based on Bank  of  Mexico information that shows prices of nearly one-third of the  basic food basket staples increased at an annual rate of 11.2  percent in January -- a rate 3.7 percent above the national  inflation index for consumer prices. Increases in the prices of  corn meal, cookies, rice, oats, powdered milk, margarine, and  other items all contributed to lowering the people's purchasing  power.

The subsidiary, Esso China Ltd., will begin to gather  seismic  data in a contract sea block on June 26.    Esso and 14 big foreign oil companies, including Texaco,  Chevron, Shell and Phillips-Arco, are now searching for oil and  gas over a 64,246 square kilometer continental basin area in the  sea.    In May 1992, the Chinese Government decided to open part of  the offshore area in the East China Sea to foreign oil companies.    On June 30, 1992, the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation  opened bids for Sino-foreign joint development of oil in that  area.    Esso and 14 foreign oil companies beat fierce competition to  win bids to search for and produce oil and gas in 18 blocks in  the sea, in cooperation with the Chinese corporation.    Li May Phipps and Kevin Biddle, both vice-presidents of Esso  China Ltd., said that they were delighted at Esso's success in  winning a contract block.    The 2,120 sq km block is about 200 km north-east of Wenzhou,  a port in Zhejiang Province.    Biddle said: ""We are fully confident of our success in  exploring oil in the East China Sea.""    Since oil exploration in the East China Sea began in the  early 1970s, an oilfield and nine oil-bearing structures have  been discovered and 27 oil exploratory wells drilled there.    After seismic exploration is completed and relevant data  processed, Esso China Ltd. will choose the best well location to  drill an exploratory well, he said.    Drilling is expected to begin next year, he added.    Founded in 1882, Esso is currently searching for oil and gas  in more than 80 countries. It spent 8.2 billion U.S. dollars in  investment and exploration in 1993.    Esso opened a representative office in Beijing 13 years ago  as part of its effort to participate in developing energy  resources in China.    Biddle said that over the past ten years and more, his  parent  company had spent 200 million U.S. dollars in the search for  offshore oil and gas resources in China.    To date, Esso has drilled 17 wells in two blocks in the  South  China Sea, striking both oil and gas there, he said.    Moreover, together with Chinese partners, Esso is also  searching for oil in the Tarim basin in northwest China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, he added.    He said he thought that oil and gas resources in northwest  China are probably even more promising than those in the Daqing  oilfield in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province and in the  Shengli oilfield in east China's Shandong Province.    Esso's cooperation with China is based on long-term  interests, he said, adding that Esso will try to expand its  cooperation with Chinese partners in accordance with the  principles of equality and mutual benefit.    Esso is also willing to invest in energy projects in China,  such as oil projects, coal projects and power projects, he added.     "

The communique said the vessel, which was sighted fishing  160  miles off the coast of San Julian Friday morning, was initially  identified as the Hin Van Sing, but on closer inspection the  Navy noticed that the ship's name was different from the one  painted on its lifeboats. Suspecting that the boat was poaching,  the corvette ordered it to stop so it could be inspected.    The fishing boat ignored the command and took off in a  northeasterly direction toward the Falkland Islands, with the  corvette in hot pursuit, prompting the gunfire. The fishing boat  was reportedly hit in the hull, and was losing fuel as the  Argentine Navy continued to trail it.    The vessel was expected to be forcibly intercepted and  boarded Saturday.    An agency for several fishing vessels from Taiwan in  Argentina, however, said Saturday that, based on information it  received from an Argentina naval base in the southern part of  Argentina, it had determined the fishing boat was Korean.    The Taiwan Tuna Fishery Association also said that no  fishing  boat registered with the association is operating off the  Argentine coast, nor is any boat named the Hin Van Sing  registered with it.    Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry in Taipei said ROC [Republic  of China] officials stationed near San Julian would investigate  the incident.    The government will offer necessary legal assistance and  medical care for boat crew members, ministry officials said.  They also called on Taiwan fishing boats to adhere to  international laws when fishing away from Taiwan.     "

And Arco's Yacheng 13-1 operation, the largest offshore  gasfield in China, is scheduled to go onstream in January 1996,  the company announced.    Arco experts have spent the last few months surveying  Chinese  onshore oil and gas fields in Daqing, Liaohe, Dagang, Sichuan  and Shengli.    ""We are looking at many opportunities for onshore oil  operations,"" said John Knepler, vice-president of the  Shekon-based Arco China Incorporate.    ""But we have to decide which ones we believe are economic to  pursue,"" he said.    The Yacheng field will supply natural gas through pipelines  to Hong Kong and Hainan Island. The gas will feed electric power  plants and a fertilizer factory.    ""By the year 2002 the Yacheng Gasfield will be producing 9.3  million cubic metres each day, and we will have recovered our  investment,"" the 48-year-old vice-president said.    The gasfield, with reserves of 100 billion cubic metres, was  discovered by Arco, with the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation and the Santa Fe Energy Corporation in 1983.    At present, Arco is focusing its efforts on getting partners  for oil and gas exploration and development in China.    The average worldwide exploration success rate for 1987 to  1992 was only 6 percent.    ""We know that exploration work is very risky and that is why  the successes must pay for the failures or we would go out of  business,"" said Knepler.    Arco is bullish on the prospects of finding large quantities  of oil and gas both onshore and offshore, he said.    Arco, which came to China in 1979, is regarded as one of the  lucky foreign oil firms which have so far operated successfully  in China.    Arco is the eighth largest non-governmental oil operator in  the world.     "

This is why, he said, the best way to maintain the  parastate company as a public company is to avoid  ineffectiveness, inefficiency, and the lack of productivity;  otherwise, the state will be forced to place the tapping of  crude oil ""in hands more capable than its own.""    In a brief interview, the official pointed out that insofar  as we appreciated the country's social harmony for many years, a  harmony that remains broken for the time being, we must also  appreciate the government's efforts to not negotiate the tapping  of crude oil within the framework of NAFTA.    As Rojas highlighted the need ""to be more efficient,  productive, and capable"" to keep Pemex away from the world trend  of privatizing national petroleum industries, as currently faced  by such countries as Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Russia,  among others, he said the pressure tactics of 1938, when the  industry was expropriated, are the tactics currently used to  have Mexico transfer the tapping of its petroleum reserves under  the old argument that ""we Mexicans lack the capacity to manage  our crude oil.""    As he unveiled a plaque to mark the opening of the second  Catalytic Disintegration Plant at the ""Miguel Hidalgo"" Oil  Refinery, owned by Pemex, Rojas noted that the political stature  shown by the Mexican oil industry while negotiating NAFTA, a  time when the Mexican Government did not negotiate the tapping  of its national petroleum reserves, has yet to emerge.    After opening this new facility, which will provide 24,000  gallons of Magna Sin gasoline for daily domestic consumption, he  admitted there is international pressure to induce the  privatization of the world's national enterprises, as is the  case in Venezuela, where there is unlimited access to its oil  industry because of the government's inability to make it more  efficient. To that effect, during his speech to oil union  members, the Pemex director general said in view of the domestic  and foreign pressure, the uncompromising defense of the oil  industry kept the country's sovereignty over its energy  resources unharmed. In his 9-page speech, Rojas estimated that  the best way to defend Pemex is to avoid inefficiency and lack  of productivity; otherwise, Pemex will be forced to cede its oil  to more capable hands.    Further on, he stressed the endeavors that the law  stipulates  as exclusive rights of the state, through Pemex, were not ceded.  He added that thanks to the oil policies of the current  administration, there is full confidence hydrocarbons will  remain Mexican property.    During the event also attended by Hidalgo Governor Jesus  Murillo Karam, Rojas said five years into the Carlos Salinas  administration, changes have broadened, the country has evolved,  inflation has been successfully controlled, and public finances  have been cleaned up. Now, the challenge is to create more and  better paying jobs because only productive and well-paid workers  can guarantee all Mexican families welfare and good quality of  life, he added    During his visit to the Catalytic Disintegration Plant, the  construction costs of which amounted to $135 million, the Pemex  director general stressed the Mexican Government's commitment to  fight pollution.

These figures, released by Wang Tao, president of the China  National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC), at a national oil work  conference here today, are both higher than the government-set  output targets.    This is an effort to match the development of the oil  industry to the demand of the country's rapid economic growth,  Wang told the conference.    He described the situation of the oil industry as ""good"",  although it falls short of demand and has become one of the  bottlenecks of the national economy.    China produced 139 million tons of crude and 15.9 billion  cubic meters of natural gas, thanks to strengthened exploration  and development of oil fields. However, the ever-expanding  demand has pushed China onto the verge of becoming a ""net oil  importer.""    Wang called for intensive exploration for additional  resources to prepare China for the next century. China expects  to extract 200 million tons of oil and gas in oil equivalent by  the year 2000, according to an ambitious plan.    To this end, China has embarked on a strategy of stabilizing  the production in the eastern part of China and developing  reserves in the western part.    The eastern part of China, which includes such important oil  fields as Daqing, Shengli and Liaohe, is China's main oil  producer.    CNPC will invest billions of yuan in a bid to maintain the  production level in the eastern part of the country. New  technology and management will be adopted in the Daqing oilfield  in order to keep its annual oil output well above 55 million  tons up to the turn of the century.    The western part of China, especially the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region, is regarded as a key alternative. Its crude  output for the first time topped 10 million tons for the first  time [as received] in 1993.    This year the figure is expected to rise to 11.9 million  tons, Wang said. Exploration will be carried out both  intensively and extensively, he added.    CNPC is striving to strike a balance between oil output and  new recoverable reserves and between capital input and output,  according to Wang. As the government eases off restrictions on  oil prices, the industry has wiped out red inks. However, Wang  warned against high cost and low efficiency in oil production.    Wang welcomed the participation in oil exploration and  development by other sectors, enterprises, localities, people  from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, overseas Chinese and foreign  investors.    CNPC has announced the second round of international bidding  for risk exploration in 26 blocks and 11 projects to enhance oil  recovery in the existing oilfields.    Preparatory work for the third round bidding is to start  soon  and more blocks in southwestern and western China are expected  to open to foreign bidders.    Wang admitted that China's oil will not be able to meet the  demand by the year 2000. He said crude import will depend on  economic growth but China still needs to sell some oil abroad  for foreign currency, technology and equipment.     "

The USM-quoted oil and gas producer saw pre-tax profits decline by 43 per cent to Pounds 91,000 (Pounds 160,000 restated) in the half year to March 31, after exceptional costs of Pounds 65,000 connected to its reorganisation under which exploration activity has been curtailed and staffing levels reduced. Sales in the six months declined to Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 3.1m). Provisions for exploration costs fell to Pounds 414,000 (Pounds 486,000) and interest payments and exchange losses took Pounds 142,000 (Pounds 73,000). Earnings fell to 0.3p (0.5p) per share. The company said that the 'successful efforts' accounting policy reflected the fact that the speculative exploration stage had been completed. A charge of Pounds 18.8m had been made against reserves as a result of the change.  The Financial Times   London Page 26  "

0,FT941-14614 ,"FT941-14614 _AN-EASC7AFVFT 940119   FT  19 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Taking the heat out of diamond fever - The Australian Stock Exchange's new code for reporting discoveries      By NIKKI TAIT   Diamonds, always a girl's best friend, have in recent months also become a stock market speculator's dream. So much so that the Australian Stock Exchange has quietly adopted a new reporting code for diamond exploration results, mineral resources and ore reserves. This has been devised by the Joint Ore Reserves Committee - a standard-setting body formed in the nickel boom days of the early-1970s and backed by the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, the Australian Mining Industry Council, and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists. The code, says the committee, represents the first time anyone has attempted to standardise the way in which diamond discoveries should be reported and ensure that investors are given a reasonable idea of the commercial significance of exploration results. The problem is simple: diamonds, by their nature, are easy to find, but discovering a large-scale, economically-viable diamond resource is another matter entirely. 'To the best of my knowledge, it's also the first time such a standard has been adopted by a stock exchange,' adds Mr Ray Schoer, director of operations at the ASX. The Australian exchange, however, may not be out on a limb for long: the JORC reports inquiries and requests for copies of the code from both the US and Canada, where a diamond rush has been under way for a couple of years. Laudable though the initiative may be, it comes not a moment too soon. Two recent incidents in Australia have demonstrated all-too-clearly the volatility which can surround diamond-related stocks. The first was Great Central Mines, a Melbourne-based exploration business whose shares jumped from around the ADollars 7 to as much as Dollars 19 last spring, capitalising the loss-making company at a staggering ADollars 1bn-plus. That performance was influenced by a discovery of 'microdiamonds' in the Greater Nabberu region of Western Australia, which GCM's chairman and managing director, Mr Joseph Gutnick, described as 'significant' but was judged uneconomic by the company's joint venture partner, Stockdale Prospecting, a subsidiary of De Beers, the South African mining house. Today the twinkle has faded. GCM's shares are back in the ADollars 9.50-Dollars 10 range, despite some institutional support in the wake of a rather more substantial gold discovery. The second instance of runaway diamond shares occured only last month, and concerned Cambridge Gulf Exploration, a stockmarket newcomer. Cambridge shares, which had been issued at 25 cents in July, surged above ADollars 4 in mid-December on news that the company had found diamonds in the Bonaparte Gulf, off Western Australia. When Cambridge released the details of this discovery - stemming from a small sample of sea-bed gravel - the ASX demanded more information about the sampling methods, the location of the discovery, and so on. Today, the shares are trading at about ADollars 2.20. But, while GCM and Cambridge have grabbed the headlines, one JORC member says that the lack of guidelines on diamond-related reporting was a much more fundamental problem. 'GCM and Cambridge were just a manifestations of the fact that diamonds were becoming hot news. But a dozen other companies, perfectly straightforward, were also unsure how to present their results'. In essence, the new code aims to ensure that anyone reporting diamond exploration results gives investors some clues as to the commercial significance of the find. It carries a cautionary note, for example, stating that diamond valuations 'have only been considered reliable on parcels of at least 2,000 carats of diamonds from a single deposit'. 'Valuations placed on a small number of diamonds from exploration samples become meaningless and are likely to be misleading,' it continues. The code goes on to require details of the professional valuation experience of anyone reporting on a parcel of diamonds; to set out sampling information required; to insist that reports of indicator minerals be prepared 'by a suitably qualified person; and formally to define 'microdiamonds' as those being less than 0.4mm in size and weighing less than 0.001 carats. 'By definition, pre-resource mineralisation must be considered to be mineralisation of significance,' states the code. 'The occurence of individual diamonds or microdiamonds in surficial desposits or from inadequately-sized samples from a primary or secondary rock source would not usually qualify as pre-resource mineralisation'. In short, while the outback may glitter, that, in itself, does not mean anything of substance. For all practical purposes, says Mr Schoer, the new strictures come into effect immediately. Existing listing rules demand that the market be kept informed. So, citing this broad requirement, the ASX will require exploration companies to meet the best practice levels set down in the code. Analysts are generally grateful. 'I think it will be a great help to investors,' says Mr David Kauler at Pru-Bache, for example. 'I think it is fair to say that there is a problem in industry reporting, especially with the junior explorers. This will go a long way to improving the quality of the results.'

Mr Ken Dredge, executive general manager of MIM Holdings (Lead and Zinc), yesterday said 26 per cent of Australia's land mass is closed to mineral exploration through either environmental or aboriginal claims. A further 22 per cent is under claims for further restriction. Access to large land tracts at minimal costs is essential for successful exploration. For every 1,000 initial explorations, roughly 100 warrant further detailed work and just 10 are drilled. 'Limiting access to land only increases these odds,' Mr Dredge said. Speaking at an annual conference of the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, Mr Dredge noted the uncertainties in the country's investment rules. He cited the ADollars 2bn (Pounds 830m) coal development project of Utah Development Company in Bowen Basin in the late 1960s. Shortly after the project started turning in handsome returns following energy price rises in the early 1970s, the Australian government introduced a special duty on open cut coal production and a regime of rail freights for subsequent export coal projects that incorporated additional royalties. Last year's federal government decision to refuse approval for gold and platinum mining at Coronation Hill also illustrated the present mineral investment environment. 'The uncertainty and confusion created by such decisions resulted in Australian miners spending increasing proportions of their exploration budget overseas,' Mr Dredge said.

Argentina remains one of 17 countries still banning British cattle for breeding because of the outbreak of 'mad cow disease' in the 1980s. Mrs Shephard who has left officials behind in Argentina to continue negotiations on lifting of the ban, said some very real progress had been made. 'Not that Argentinian beef needs improving - they have some of the most magnificent animals in the world - but there is enormous enthusiasm for freshening the stock and there will be opportunities for co-operation.' The ban applies chiefly to frozen embryos and semen used for introducing new strains to beef cattle. Mrs Shephard said Argentina was also interested in improving techniques in the pig industry and was keen to co-operate with UK experts. Mr Eric Thain, executive director of the Scottish Agricultural College, who accompanied Mrs Shephard on her trip, said he had agreed a deal to co-operate with Argentina's technology institute on a wide range of farming issues, including pig breeding. Mr Thain will also be helping the Argentines with sustainable farming methods and vaccinations for foot and mouth disease. Mrs Shephard touched on the sensitive issue of fish stocks in the South Atlantic during her trip, but she said the issue of sovereignity of the Falkland Islands was not mentioned. A two-week spell of dry weather in Argentina's farming belt could hurt production of the 1993-94 wheat crop, traders have warned, Reuter reports from Buenos Aires. Stunted seedling growth in vast crop areas - caused by the recent lack of rain and a previous 70-day drought - could inflict losses of up to 1m tonnes, they added. Seasonal wheat sowing was concluded in the past week, with farmers planting a total 5.2m hectares.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.   Industries:-  P0212 Beef Cattle, Ex Feedlots.

0,FT942-7698 ,"FT942-7698 _AN-EEYBKAF6FT 940524   FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Billion-dollar changes for YPF - The oil group is undergoing a transformation      By JOHN BARHAM   YPF, Argentina's privatised oil company, is to transform its domestic operations and back a cautious expansion into neighbouring markets with a Dollars 100m a month investment programme. The expansion of exploration and production and the revamping of its retail business is the company's largest investment programme, and the most evident sign of YPF's transformation from a corrupt, money-losing state corporation to a profit-oriented, private company. Mr Jose Estenssoro, YPF's president, says he now has 'one firm commitment: profits. Our investors have become the most important part of our corporate life'. He claims YPF's investment plans are proof that this is no cheap corporate hype. More than Dollars 1bn is budgeted for next year and a further Dollars 1bn in 1996. Argentina's biggest company is now 20 per cent owned by the federal government, with the rest held by the employees and provincial governments. The government, which once owned the company outright, sold 45 per cent last June in a Dollars 3.04bn local and international initial public offering. Last year, YPF raised profits 176 per cent to Dollars 706m, despite lower oil prices and an increase of just 2 per cent in sales to Dollars 3.96bn. However, profits and revenues both declined in the first quarter as oil prices continued falling. YPF is to sink 720 new production wells this year, at a cost of Dollars 700m. Mr Estenssoro wants to raise output by one-fifth to 450,000 barrels per day by the end of 1995, and then maintain production at this level. 'Argentina's wells are small producers, so (we need to do) a lot of drilling,' he says. Mr Estenssoro wants to maintain YPF's oil reserves at the equivalent of 10 years' production through a big exploration effort. This year YPF is spending Dollars 300m to drill 180 exploration wells as part of a Dollars 3bn, 10-year exploration programme. Argentina is self-sufficient in oil, although it does not come close the volumes of Mexico or Venezuela, Latin America's big oil producers. But it does have considerable potential: Mr Estenssoro says only five of its 19 identified oil-bearing basins have been explored and are in production. The country does have much more natural gas than oil. YPF and joint-venture partners Ampolex of Australia and Petrobras of Brazil are investing Dollars 250m over four years to explore a potentially giant gas field in north western Argentina. Mr Estenssoro is spending a further Dollars 250m this year to upgrade YPF's downstream business, where profitability is low. In August 1990, when he took over at YPF, the downstream business lost Dollars 400m. It is now returning 5 per cent on assets, and Mr Estenssoro wants to double profitability by next year. In comparison, the upstream production business returns about 20 per cent a year. YPF has also started a Dollars 500m, five-year project to bring its operations - particularly its refineries - into line with world environmental standards. Finally, YPF is spending Dollars 300m between 1993-96 to renovate its retail network. The company has 2,800 petrol stations, many more than its competitors, but its stations are a byword for bad service. YPF is financing the investment programme with a mix of bank borrowing, retained earnings and overseas bond sales. Mr Estenssoro announced earlier this year a Dollars 350m Yankee bond issue and a Dollars 500m medium-term note issue. Analysts praise the company for reducing production and administrative costs to compensate for falling oil prices. Some, however, criticise Mr Estenssoro for not hedging oil prices and thus exposing YPF's growing exports to dwindling prices. Mr Estenssoro has continued cutting the work force - which stood at 51,000 when he took over and now numbers only 6,500 - leading to growing criticism from the unions. However, many former employees still work for the company as subcontractors, often on excessively generous terms, say some analysts. Competitors and economists also complain that YPF abuses its dominant market position. It produces over half Argentina's oil, has over half its refinery capacity and controls half the retail market. Mr Estenssoro rejects accusations that YPF plays dirty. 'The market works, it is very competitive and if YPF did not exist, or was not as big as it is, its market would be split among the multinationals,' he says. YPF, which has always focused on its domestic market, is gradually expanding into neighbouring countries. It has just opened a 270-mile pipeline over the Andes to Chile, allowing it to raise exports by Dollars 300m a year. Mr Estenssoro says: 'We are looking to our neighbours as a natural place to expand.' He has started small exploration projects in Bolivia, Uruguay and Paraguay and is negotiating exploration contracts in Chile and Peru. YPF may bid for the Peruvian and Bolivian state oil companies when they are offered for privatisation. It seems appropriate that YPF, the world's first state oil company and Latin America's first privatised oil company, should make a stab at becoming the region's first private oil multinational.

0,FT921-13397 ,"FT921-13397 _AN-CAVBGAAVFT 920122   FT  22 JAN 92 / UK rebuffs Argentine military overtures      By JIMMY BURNS   DISCREET attempts by Argentina to resume normal military ties with the UK appear to have been rebuffed in the run-up to the 10th anniversary of the Falklands war. It emerged yesterday that the Ministry of Defence has turned down a request from Argentina to allow a limited supply of UK-manufactured spare parts to the Argentine navy, begun during the Gulf war, to continue. Whitehall has also vetoed a plan for an Argentine military transport aircraft to fly to Britain next month to collect some cargo assembled by the naval attache's office at the Argentine embassy in London. Argentine officials insist the cargo would have involved nothing more than a few boxes filled with books and military research periodicals, as well as brochures of British defence companies, normally sent via the diplomatic bag. But the planned trip by an aircraft which is normally used by the Argentine navy to transport military equipment would have almost certainly fuelled stiff opposition from the Falkland islanders and from MPs opposed to any suggestion of a 'sell-out' over the islands. Military ties between the two countries have been governed officially by an arms embargo imposed by Britain on Argentina following the outbreak of the Falklands war in 1982. During the Gulf war, however, London agreed to the supply of Rolls-Royce spare parts to the Argentine navy which operated with the allied forces. The parts were for Argentina's German-built destroyer Almirante Brown, which is powered by Rolls-Royce Olympus and Tyne gas turbines. They were drawn from Royal Navy stocks. Argentine officials had hoped the waiving of the arms embargo would pave the way for a more open policy on military relations. The Argentine navy is believed to be cutting the operational hours of vessels to minimise the use of equipment for which replacement parts are needed.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT942-5497 ,"FT942-5497 _AN-EFEASAAYFT 940604   FT  04 JUN 94 / MoD defends the Chinook      By BERNARD GRAY   The Ministry of Defence yesterday replied to criticism that the crashed Chinook helicopter had no 'black box' flight recorder or all-weather radar to assist navigation in poor conditions. The MoD said all-weather radar, useful for large commercial jets flying at height to avoid large storms, would be 'more or less useless' for military low-level helicopter operations. Any weather signals would be confused by reflected ground noise. It said Chinooks had pressure altimeters and downward radar sensors to estimate their height above ground, which should allow them to fly in poor visibility. The MoD said that few military aircraft carried flight recorders - other accident investigation techniques were considered sufficient to determine the cause of any crash. But Mr William O'Brien, a lawyer who specialises in air accident claims for solicitors Russell, Jones and Walker, said the lack of a flight recorder would slow the investigation. He said: 'It can be important, particularly in crashes such as this where the wreckage is widely spread and the airframe badly broken up.' Mr O'Brien, who acted for the captain of the worst Chinook accident in the UK - when 45 oil-rig workers were killed off Shetland in 1986 - said a longer investigation would also slow the victims' families claims for compensation. Apart from yesterday's crash there have been three bad accidents in UK-owned Chinooks. The Shetland accident was caused by a mechanical problem which has been rectified. Poor weather was a factor when three servicemen were killed in a Chinook crash in the Falkland Islands in 1986. In that accident, 'white-out' conditions made it impossible for the pilots to get their bearings. Another Chinook was lost in the Falklands a year later, with seven killed, thanks to a different mechanical failure from the one that caused the Shetland crash. The MoD is happy with the helicopter and is considering ordering more for Royal Air Force transport needs. A mixed order, probably for Chinooks and EH-101 helicopters, manufactured by Westland, is expected to be placed next year.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The exhaust gas sampling system described in this paragraph is designed to measure the true mass of both gaseous and particulate emissions in the exhaust of petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled heavy-duty diesel engines. This system utilizes the CVS concept (described in 86.1309) of measuring mass emissions of HC, CH    3    OH and HCHO (methanol-fueled engines), CO, CO    2    , and particulate from all fuel types. A continuously integrated system is required for HC (petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled and liquefied petroleum gas-fueled engines) and NO    X     (petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled engines) measurement, and is allowed for all CO and CO    2     measurements plus CH    3    OH, HCHO and HC from methanol-fueled engines. The mass of gaseous emissions is determined from the sample concentration and total flow over the test period. The mass of particulate emissions is determined from a proportional mass sample collected on a filter and from the sample flow and total flow over the test period. As an option, the measurement of total fuel mass consumed over a cycle may be substituted for the exhaust measurement of CO    2    . General requirements are as follows:         * * * * * *        (2) The HC analytical system for petroleum-fueled diesel engines requires a heated flame ionization detector (HFID) and heated sample system (375     #    20  F (191     #    11  C)).

Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the 15th round of offshore licensing would include all available unlicensed acreage in the southern basin and the central North Sea, where gas is predominant. The round would be 'fast track' to encourage rapid exploration. Applications should be in by July 26, and awards will be made in the autumn. Mr Eggar is also seeking nominations for blocks companies would like to see offered in the 16th round, which will cover coastal areas of Britain and the north of Scotland, including west of Shetland where BP has made a promising discovery. When blocks are in sensitive areas, the government will ask applicants to say how they would address environmental concerns. Later this year Mr Eggar will also give details of the 17th round which will include frontier areas such as Rockall. Mr Eggar said he did not expect any territorial controversies over these regions. The new rounds came with the release of figures showing that UK oil and gas reserves are at record levels with production heading for new highs. The government's Brown Book says recoverable reserves continue to rise at a faster rate than consumption. Oil production last year rose 6 per cent to 2.13m barrels a day. Gas output was up 17 per cent to 2.31 trillion cu ft. The book also shows that the number of exploration wells fell by 30 per cent last year. Mr Eggar said this was more likely to have been caused by the softness of the oil price than the government's decision to increase North Sea oil taxation. The Energy Report Vol 2.

MERC.      By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Energy prices soared again Friday, with November crude oil futures leaping more  than $2 a barrel to a record high above $35 on tough talk by Iraqi leader  Saddam Hussein and signs of tight petroleum supplies overseas.    A barrel of West Texas Intermediate -- the U.S benchmark crude that heavily  influences other petroleum prices -- to be delivered in November rose $2.01 a  barrel to $35.43 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The surge in oil prices  carried over into gasoline and home heating oil futures, which posted sharp  gains as well.    The closing price was another record high for the Merc, which began trading in  oil futures in March, 1983. The previous Merc crude oil high was reached only  on Thursday, when the price of October crude closed at $34.71. That was the  last day of trading for October oil futures.    The market on Friday was rattled by Hussein's speech on Iraqi television in  which he called on his people to prepare for war, which would be bound to  disrupt production and distribution of much of the world's oil. In a report  issued Friday, the World Bank predicted that a Mideast war could send oil  prices soaring to $65 a barrel this year and then remain at $30 to $40 a barrel  during the next five years.    ""The thinking in the market is that a war is almost inevitable,"" said Andrew  Lebow, an oil industry analyst at E. D. & F. Man International Futures  Inc., a New York brokerage firm.    The growing expectation of war and uncertainty over supplies has also reduced  the pool of sellers, who want to hold onto their oil in case shortages develop,  traders said.    ""A shortage mentality is beginning to creep into the market,"" Lebow said.    According to traders, oil prices were also riding the momentum that pushed  October oil up nearly $2 a barrel on Thursday. ""We went out real strong (on  October oil futures) and that cleared the path for November,"" said Tom Bentz,  director of trading at United Energy, a New York trading firm.    Predictions of a colder-than-normal winter in the Northeast and the closure of  several Gulf of Mexico coast refineries for maintenance contributed to sizable  price increases in gasoline and home heating oil futures.

MERC.      By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Energy prices soared again Friday, with November crude oil futures leaping more  than $2 a barrel to a record high above $35 on tough talk by Iraqi leader  Saddam Hussein and signs of tight petroleum supplies overseas.    A barrel of West Texas Intermediate -- the U.S benchmark crude that heavily  influences other petroleum prices -- to be delivered in November rose $2.01 a  barrel to $35.43 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The surge in oil prices  carried over into gasoline and home heating oil futures, which posted sharp  gains as well.    The closing price was another record high for the Merc, which began trading in  oil futures in March, 1983. The previous Merc crude oil high was reached only  on Thursday, when the price of October crude closed at $34.71. That was the  last day of trading for October oil futures.    The market on Friday was rattled by Hussein's speech on Iraqi television in  which he called on his people to prepare for war, which would be bound to  disrupt production and distribution of much of the world's oil. In a report  issued Friday, the World Bank predicted that a Mideast war could send oil  prices soaring to $65 a barrel this year and then remain at $30 to $40 a barrel  during the next five years.    ""The thinking in the market is that a war is almost inevitable,"" said Andrew  Lebow, an oil industry analyst at E. D. & F. Man International Futures  Inc., a New York brokerage firm.    The growing expectation of war and uncertainty over supplies has also reduced  the pool of sellers, who want to hold onto their oil in case shortages develop,  traders said.    ""A shortage mentality is beginning to creep into the market,"" Lebow said.    According to traders, oil prices were also riding the momentum that pushed  October oil up nearly $2 a barrel on Thursday. ""We went out real strong (on  October oil futures) and that cleared the path for November,"" said Tom Bentz,  director of trading at United Energy, a New York trading firm.    Predictions of a colder-than-normal winter in the Northeast and the closure of  several Gulf of Mexico coast refineries for maintenance contributed to sizable  price increases in gasoline and home heating oil futures. Unleaded gasoline for  October delivery soared 5.91 cents to 97.45 cents a gallon and October heating  oil jumped 5.35 cents to 97.21 cents a gallon. Trading in October gasoline and  heating oil ends next week.

The Phoenix Steel Application was denied because LK, Inc. failed to show it was authorized to represent Phoenix Steel and the DOE was unable to contact Phoenix Steel or an employee of the company.              Atlantic Richfield Company/Small's Garage, et al., 4/1/94, RF3044881              DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning six Applications for Refund filed in the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) special refund proceeding. The DOE determined that the refund claims be denied, because the individual who filed the Applications, Nic Schnettler, admitted that they were fraudulent. After pleading guilty to mail fraud, Mr. Schnettler was sentenced to two years probation and ordered to pay $7,000 in restitution by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Although the ARCO proceeding was closed on December 3, 1993, five of the six Applicants were given thirty days from the date of the Decision to file Applications on their own in the ARCO proceeding. The other Applicant has an Application pending.              Gulf Oil Corp./New York Telephone Co., 3/30/94, RR300256              The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Motion for Reconsideration filed by Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI) in the Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding on behalf of New York Telephone Company (NYT). RRI, in filing the Motion, requested that the DOE reverse its earlier decisions dismissing NYT's Application for Refund because it was filed after the final filing deadline in the Gulf Oil Corp. special refund proceeding. RRI further alleged that certain staff members of the DOE were prejudiced against RRI and that the prejudice influenced the DOE's decision to dismiss NYT's Application for Refund and deny NYT's first Motion for Reconsideration. The DOE, as a discretionary matter, reviewed the Motion and determined that it should be denied. The DOE found that RRI had presented no new information or compelling reason that warranted reversing the previous decisions. The DOE also found RRI's allegations of bias to be unfounded.              Murphy Construction Co., et al., 3/28/94, RF27291456           The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting seven Applications for Refund filed in the crude oil refund proceeding. This Decision and Order incorporated simplified language as part of an ongoing attempt to improve service to the DOE's stakeholders and customers. With respect to one application, the DOE noted that the applicant had included purchases of asphalt concrete. The DOE held that asphalt concrete did not qualify as a covered product and therefore reduced the applicant's gallonage to reflect the exclusion of asphalt concrete.           Standard Oil Co. (Amoco)/Indiana, 3/29/94, RM21265           The State of Indiana filed a Motion for Modification of a previously-approved second-stage refund plan. The Motion, if granted, would allow the State to use $123,750 of Amoco monies to fund its Fuel Saver Van Program. Under Indiana's proposal, up to three vans containing automobile diagnostic equipment will travel to thirty cities in the State of Indiana. The equipment in the vans will be used to inspect motorists' vehicles free of charge. Once an analysis is completed, each motorist will be given a detailed description of all items inspected and their condition. The analyses will focus on problems affecting excess gasoline consumption and vehicle emissions. The State predicts that the Program will help injured consumers improve the energy efficiency of their automobiles and save them money by reducing the amount of fuel they consume. The $123,750 that Indiana proposes to use for this program has not previously been allocated to another program. However, since Indiana had not been reflecting in its oil overcharge account all of the interest earned on Amoco monies previously transferred to it, the State itself has supplied $123,750 which would have been the total amount of interest earned on Amoco monies received by the State, but was not previously posted to its account. The DOE has previously approved funds for state support of the Fuel Saver Van Program. Accordingly, the Motion for Modification was granted.           Texaco Inc./J.H. Rose Truck Line, Inc., 4/1/94, RF32119063           LK, Inc. filed an Application for Refund on behalf of First Interstate Bank of Texas (First Interstate), requesting a refund based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products made by J.H. Rose Truck Line (Rose). The Application stated that First Interstate was a secured creditor in Rose's bankruptcy proceeding. In considering this request, the DOE found that First Interstate had not demonstrated that it had a clear and undisputed right to Rose's Texaco refund. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order denying the Application for Refund filed on behalf of First Interstate.            Texaco Inc./M  M Transportation Co., 4/1/94, RR321150           LK, Inc. filed a Motion for Reconsideration of a Decision and Order that had denied its Application for Refund in the Texaco refund proceeding with respect to purchases made by M  M Transportation Company (MM), a bankrupt firm. The DOE determined that the Motion did not present any compelling reason to reconsider the earlier decision. Specifically, the DOE found that the purported assignment of MM's right to a Texaco refund to LK in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding did not meet the strict standard adopted for approving such assignments in the precedential case of Gulf Oil Corp./Spector Red Ball, Inc.,     23 DOE 85,011 (1993). The DOE further found that there was no reason for applying a more lenient standard in this case since the assignment did not expressly convey the right to apply for a product refund in the Texaco proceeding and LK's payment to MM was unconscionably low. Accordingly, LK's motion was denied.               Texaco Inc./Mike's Texaco on Henry Kevin's Texaco, 4/1/94, RF3218931, RF3219514           The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund filed on behalf of two indirect purchasers, Mike's Texaco on Henry and Kevin's Texaco, in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. Each applicant stated that it had no records from which to determine the number of gallons of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order period and submitted estimated figures obtained from a chart labelled ``Information compiled from the National Petroleum News Fact Book'' (Chart). The DOE rejected the use of the Chart in estimating the applicant's gallonage figures because it failed to differentiate between different types of retailers and because the Chart defied established historical trends in petroleum sales during the consent order period. Because neither applicant could establish the volumes of Texaco products it purchased during the consent order period, the DOE determined that granting the applicants a refund would not constitute restitution for Texaco's alleged overcharges. Consequently, the DOE denied the Applications for Refund.             Tiger Oil Company, 3/29/94, RD27268538, RF27268538         The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a refund to Tiger Oil Company (Tiger), an oil drilling contractor, in the Subpart V crude oil overcharge refund proceeding. The application was submitted by Edward Mike Davis, owner of Tiger, through Federal Refunds, Inc. (FRI), a private filing service. In the application, FRI estimated that Tiger purchased 204,529,860 gallons of refined petroleum products during the crude oil price control period. Neither Davis nor FRI submitted any documentation to support this estimate.       The DOE later learned that Tiger is the subject of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding. The DOE contacted the trustee in bankruptcy, who had Tiger's records examined by two petroleum engineers. The petroleum engineers calculated from the records that Tiger purchased 18,729,672 gallons of refined petroleum products during the price control period. The DOE adjusted Tiger's gallonage claim in accordance with the petroleum engineers' estimate, and directed the refund check to the trustee to provide appropriate restitution to Tiger. In addition, the DOE denied a motion by a group of States and Territories, which argued that Tiger had passed the crude oil overcharges onto its customers. The total volume approved in the Decision and Order is 18,729,672 gallons, and the total refund amount granted is $14,984.

0,FT931-4558 ,"FT931-4558 _AN-DCJCTAGHFT 930310   FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India opens door to private mining investors      By KUNAL BOSE      CALCUTTA   IN A dramatic policy U-turn, the Indian federal government has decided to allow private sector participation in the exploration for and mining of 13 minerals hitherto reserved to public sector operations. The minerals are iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc, molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group. Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis. But the government will be ready to sanction higher foreign capital participation depending on the merits of each case. However, mineral and metal processing units with any level of foreign equity will now be allowed to develop captive mines (mines tied to metal processors). While the new national mineral policy is part of India's economic reform programme, it is also a response to the need to introduce foreign technology and funds to develop 'world grade mines to produce minerals at internationally competitive rates'. India has had success in recent years in discovering new mineral deposits through modern exploration techniques, but the public sector, in many cases, could not mobilise resources to develop mines. For example, Hindustan Copper, India's only copper producer, was forced to postpone the development of Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine with estimated reserve of 275m tonnes because of lack of finance. Things may now look up for Hindustan Copper and other public sector undertakings. According to Mr Balram Singh Yadav, minister of state for mines, the government has received a good number of enquiries for mineral exploration from leading mining companies in the US, Australia, South Africa and Canada. The government is hoping that joint ventures with foreign companies as partners will focus on the exploitation of those minerals in which the country is deficient or does not have exportable surpluses. An objective of the new policy is to promote the export of Indian minerals with as much value added as possible.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P10   Metal Mining.

The goal is to find more reserves and maintain oil  production  in this part of the country at 124 million tons, according to a  senior official of the China National Petroleum Corporation  (CNPC).    The eastern region covers the vast area east of the Taihang  Mountains and the Three Gorges and north of the Chang Jiang  River. Oil reserves in this area are estimated at 33.5 billion  tons, 54 percent of China's total onshore oil reserves. It  produces 90 percent of the country's oil, which is expected to  reach 140 million tons this year, slightly higher than last.    After more than four decades of exploitation and  development,  most of the production wells have entered the period of decline.  The high content of water makes production difficult. The  amount of reserves verified is less than the amount of oil  tapped.    Oil production in this region is essential to maintain the  current level of production, as oil exploration and development  in the western part of the country has just begun and  transportation problems have hampered development.    According to the CNPC official, a plan has been in place to  increase the recovery rate of the old wells by five percentage  points by drilling more wells and adopting such technologies as  water control and tertiary extraction.    At the same time, efforts will be made to implement rolling  exploration and development in and around the old oil fields in  a bid to find more geological reserves. This will help find 100  million tons of new geological reserves a year and boost the  production capacity by two million tons.    In addition, the region will accelerate the development of  low-filtration, thick oil and shallow sea oil fields.    China's crude oil consumption increases at an annual rate of  six million to seven million tons.     "

Now the UK economy is struggling out of recession as the North Sea suffers another employment downturn, but there is cautious optimism in the area (Aberdonians are unfamiliar with reckless optimism) that the north-east is not about to head off in the other direction again. Professor Alec Kemp, of Aberdeen University's economics department, says North Sea employment probably peaked in 1991 and is falling slowly. The combination of the current very low oil price and a high production cost per barrel because of lower production levels from oilfields developed in the 1970s has, he said, pushed companies to look for ways to economise. Many new fields are smaller and require fewer people. Exploration drilling has slowed since last year's petroleum revenue tax changes. Mr Tom Snowling, economic research officer with Grampian regional council, agrees that the oil companies, learning from the mistakes of the 1970s and 1980s, are much more cost conscious - a far cry from the industry's free-spending days, when oil companies paid top rates for the skilled people on whom traditional fishing and farming, paper and textiles industries had relied. Technology has helped. New drilling techniques mean fewer platforms are needed to get the oil out, and smaller crews are needed for the platforms. For example, Total's Dunbar jacket and topside is designed for a crew of 16, a fraction of what would have been needed 10 years ago. Hook-ups of platforms are now done with a few hundred people (a legend of the 1980s is of 3,000 people on one platform, where there was standing room only). But it is thought that only about a third of the 27,500 offshore workforce live in the area: most live in central Scotland, north-east England and further afield. Prof Kemp says the effect on the local economy of the offshore slowdown will be offset by continuing relocation of high-skill, high-wage personnel. Intense local lobbying helped push the Department of Trade and Industry last year to relocate to Aberdeen part of its petroleum exploration directorate. That, says Professor Kemp, will have a knock-on effect in relocation of oil company personnel who have to deal with the DTI on new field development and field abandonment. There is also, he says, a continuing movement of oil-related companies to the north-east simply because it is still cheaper than south-east England and more cost-effective to be nearer the activity. One change in the industry which could have long-term implications is the trend, among oil producers, away from engaging a large number of specialist contractors, towards partnership agreements with a small number of prime contractors. The bigger service companies are now signing long-term arrangements with operators where, says Sir Ian Wood, chairman of John Wood Group, Scotland's largest private company, 'they are helping an operator drive his business. We sit down with the operator and try to understand what he wants to achieve and work with him in ways in which we share in his risk.' Five years ago his company would have sought a straightforward maintenance contract on one platform. Now it will negotiate, with an operator and five or six specialist subcontractors, a design, construction and maintenance programme on a number of platforms. This, he says, has cut costs. In the longer term, such companies could diversify into other areas, such as power generation, and should have the size and expertise needed to operate in the international oil marketplace. Sir Ian talks of consolidating a 'mini-Houston' in north-east Scotland. Sir Ian, who is also chairman of the government-backed economic development body Grampian Enterprise, acknowledges that an economy based on a wasting resource has to look to its other industries. The Aberdeen area, he says, 'has become an uncomfortably unbalanced environment'. A generation has grown up in Aberdeen that has not known a time without oil. Traditional industries have had to cope with a higher cost base than anywhere else in Scotland. Both he and Mr Derek Marnoch, chief executive of Aberdeen Chamber of Commerce, believe oil has helped the area's other industries by making the business climate more competitive, risk-aware and generally sharper. Mr Marnoch talks of an economy working on two levels, with those outside the oil industry struggling in an area where oil drives housing and other costs  -but he believes there are probably more second earners than there are elsewhere in Scotland. As a high-wage area, the way to survive has been to work at the quality end of the market - always the case for an area whose distance from the main marketplaces means high transport costs. For example, the area's four paper mills produce about 600,000 tonnes of paper and board a year, about 10 per cent of UK output. But 400,000 tonnes is high-value printing and writing stationery, about 20 per cent of the UK total. Although they are in the same industry, the four mills are not direct competitors, which allows them to co-operate in areas such as training. Mr Ed Gillespie, general manager at Arjo Wiggins's paper mill on the outskirts of Aberdeen, acknowledges conflict with oil in the labour market, especially in the early 1980s. But now the oil industry is training more of its own people, while both industries have cut labour demand through technological change. He has noticed that men in their 30s and 40s, tired of the rigours of the North Sea and anxious to spend more time with friends and family, are coming back to onshore industry. His recent move from five-and-a-half to seven-day working created 70 jobs, for which 1,500 applied - although he did not advertise the vacancies. Mike Stephen, group managing director of Grampian Country Food Group, a large-scale pork and chicken producer, says oil took away 'a lot of young lads who would have worked on the farm or driven trucks,' but agrees that 'it's not every married man with a family who wants two weeks on and two weeks off'. But difficulties in getting process labour are pushing his company harder to find technological improvements. although much of his process labour is female, for which there is less competition. His company is an example of how food production, that most traditional of all industries, is becoming concentrated in a small number of large companies - driven, he says, by hygiene regulations. Turnover is up from Pounds 1m in 1980 to about Pounds 180m last year and, like other dominant food processing companies in the area, it is under local ownership. The area is strong in locally-owned premium food brands, such as Baxters of Speyside and Walkers of Aberlour. But behind the big, successful food companies there are also small traditional farms whose finances have recently been fragile. And it is those family farms which underpin the economies of small towns and villages throughout the area, where the eventual loss of oil industry commuters can be expected to hit very hard.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------            Unemployment by travel-to-work area (December 1993)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                 Males     Females     Total     % rate    Change since                                                    4.6        November  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Grampian       10,438       3,466    13,904        4.6           +478 Scotland      184,070      52,444   236,514        9.3         +2,364 UK          2,146,045     636,651 2,782,696        9.9        +13,258  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economic Development  Planning Department, Grampian Regional Council  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

However, the independent oil and gas exploration and production company still intends to pursue an expansive exploration policy. Profits were Pounds 3.04m for 1991, down from Pounds 9.98m last time, equivalent to earnings of 2p (2.9p) per share. The fall came despite a sharp increase in daily production, from the equivalent of 19,000 barrels of oil a day to 24,000 b/d. But the realised UK price amounted to Pounds 11.37 per barrel, compared to Pounds 13.42. The company's proven and probable reserves amounted to 195,774m barrels of oil equivalent, down from 197,289m. Dr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the company continued to seek new oil sources, mainly in regions outside its traditional North Sea area of operation. There had been particularly encouraging results from a well off the east coast of the Malaysian peninsula. It was still being tested but appeared to contain several reservoirs of high quality oil The group is maintaining its final dividend at 0.75p leaving the total for the year unchanged at 1.25p. It said, however, that there was inevitably a conflict between the need to fund exploration and the requirement to pay dividends. Because of expanded international activity and the weak oil price, directors said they would review future dividend policy.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

Petroleum: Opening to the Outside World and Involvement in  Multinational Operations    By the end of November, the China National Petroleum  Corporation had produced 127 million tonnes of crude oil, up  1.38 percent from the same period last year, and 141 million  cubic meters of natural gas, up 3.6 percent from the same period  last year. In recent years, to speed up petroleum industrial  development, China has opened the southeastern part of the Tarim  Basin, Xinjiang, and part of the East China Sea to prospecting  by foreign petroleum firms. More than a dozen big firms from a  number of countries signed up to bid for these two regions. Ten  contracts have been signed on the East China Sea and one on the  Tarim Basin, signalling another breakthrough in the China's  petroleum industry's opening up to the outside world.    Another breakthrough this year: The China National Petroleum  and Natural Gas Corporation stepped out of the country to engage  in multinational oil and natural gas operations. Since  October, the corporation has signed four overseas oil contracts  and accords with Peru, Canada, Papua New Guinea, and Thailand.  So China is not only attracting foreign firms to prospect its  land and seas; its petroleum industry has also gone out of the  country in oil and natural gas prospecting.    Electric Power: Strive for Sustained and Accelerated Growth    China's electric power industrial growth rates have been  astounding to the world. Since 1988, China increased its  installed generating capacity by 12 million kw, though power  supply remains short compared with its recent 20 percent  industrial growth rate. To ease power shortages as soon as  possible, the Ministry of Power Industry has decided to increase  financing and use of foreign funds for the power industry. From  now on, investment in the expansion and reproduction of the  power industry will take up another 25 percent over and above  its present proportion in the GDP. By the end of this century,  China's installed generating capacity will have increased from  the current 240 million kw to 310 million kw, which is expected  to basically ease the power shortage across the country.    This year, the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang  progressed to the design and production stage, and the first  generator unit of the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant in Guangdong  started generating power for electric grids this year,  signalling a new dimension for China's nuclear-powered  electricity.    Coal: Diversified Operating Modes, Move Toward the Market    Coal accounts for over 70 percent of China's primary energy  structure and is vital. The state has decided to deregulate raw  coal prices and stop subsidizing its production in the near  future. State-owned coal mines are facing grim challenges. On  the basis of its diversified modes of operations, the coal  industry is quickening its move toward the market. The average  output value of coal production under diversified operations  between 1986 and 1991 annually rose 25 percent and by the end of  last year, the diversified part of the industry was employing  1.45 million people, generating 15 billion yuan in output value,  which is expected to hit 18 billion, and absorbing 150,000  people made redundant by staff cutting. The diversified  operating part of the coal industry has generated more than 20  different trades, set up close to 20,000 operating units and  factories and a number of Sino-foreign joint ventures or jointly  invested ventures. The development of diversified operations  has contributed to stabilizing raw coal production and reversing  losses in state-owned coal mines.     "
0,FT931-1667 ,"FT931-1667 _AN-DCXCKADOFT 930324   FT  24 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China plans drive to woo foreign mining investors      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   CHINA WILL soon embark on a drive to attract much-needed foreign involvement in its flagging minerals development sector, following a comprehensive review of its resources policy. Mr Zeng Shaojin, director of exploration for the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, said in an interview that China was accelerating attempts to involve foreign companies in both the exploration and development of its minerals under what he described as its Prospecting Treasure Plan. This aimed at providing China with the additional mineral resources needed to support its booming economy, which is expected to grow at between 8 and 9 per cent annually for the rest of this decade. It registered growth last year of 12.8 per cent. Mr Zeng said China planned to invite foreign miners to Beijing in May to discuss about 30 projects that might be available. United Nations bodies would help to organise the conference. The Chinese official admitted that the response of foreign mining companies to earlier overtures by China had been disappointing. He hoped that new regulations to be released later this year would be more appealing. In Beijing, the representative of a foreign mining conglomerate described existing mining regulations - these date from 1986 - as 'strongly nationalistic' and a disincentive to investment. What was needed, he said, was both a change in the regulations to link development with exploration under favourable terms and, perhaps more importantly, a shift in philosophy. Mr Zeng seemed to indicate the latter was possible when he declared that China was now anxious to secure foreign assistance because it had neither the funds nor the advanced minerals treatment technology required. China's mineral resources were rich and diversified, he declared, but were under-developed. Per capita yield of minerals is only half the world's average. The Chinese official indicated that priority minerals included copper (China imports about half its requirements of copper concentrate, an intermediate material), lead, zinc, iron ore, coal, diamonds, rare earths, uranium and possibly gold. While Chinese regulations effectively prevent foreign exploitation of gold reserves at present, Mr Zeng indicated that this might change if 'certain gold deposits need high technology and funds for development.' He conceded that China had in the past two decades devoted too big a proportion of its minerals exploration and development budget to the search for gold. This had absorbed about 60 per cent of all funds devoted to solid minerals exploration. He estimated China's 'in-ground' gold reserves at 3,000 tonnes, and these were being added to at the rate of about 10 per cent annually. China mined about 100 tonnes of gold a year. In anticipation, possibly, of a more encouraging environment for foreign mining companies in China there appears to have been a revival of interest. Broken Hill Proprietary of Australia recently signed an agreement to investigate a lead-zinc deposit in Sichuan province. But foreign mining representatives indicated that they would proceed cautiously until they could be sure China had indeed experienced a change of heart and was genuinely open for business in the sensitive minerals area.

0,FT922-637 ,"FT922-637 _AN-CFZBBAEFFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (2): It all depends on oil - The Economy      By KAREN FOSSLI   NORWAY'S vast petroleum resources are both a blessing and a curse for the economy. To say that the discovery of oil two decades ago has had a profound impact on its structure would be a gross understatement. One has only to look at this year's massive budget deficit to appreciate Norway's extreme addiction to petroleum revenue or reflect on an earlier economic downfall caused by plunging petrol prices. Including petroleum revenue, this year's budget deficit stretches to NKr39.9bn, allowing the minority Labour government to pursue an ever-expansive economic policy aimed at shoring up the sags in the social welfare system. Excluding petroleum, the deficit swells to a new record NKr71.1bn. Luckily, petrol production will grow by over 20 per cent to 1996 from a current level of slightly more than 2m barrels per day. Thereafter, the main reliance on oil revenue will begin to shift to one on revenue from natural gas sales as oil production begins a steady decline to the year 2000. It is only recently - since the green wave of environmental concern swept Europe - that natural gas's future has brightened with the prospect of conversion to gas-fired power generation from coal-fired power generation. Even so, Norway has done nothing to protect itself against the possibility of plunging oil prices. Official estimates indicate that a fall in the oil price of just Dollars 1 a barrel weakens Norway's petroleum wealth by more than Dollars 20bn, or by about 25 per cent of mainland gross domestic product. This means that the value of petroleum resources would become negligible if the oil price plunges below Dollars 10 a barrel, as it did in 1986. With the oil price at Dollars 18 a barrel, new oil and gas field developments from about the first quarter of the next century would have to be postponed to avoid large losses on investment. It is only when petroleum prices exceed extraction costs that the economy derives a windfall gain - and Norway's petroleum extraction costs are among the highest in the world. So far this year, oil prices have struggled to maintain a level of about Dollars 19 a barrel, and many international oil companies do not foresee a change in this level over the next few years. Norway's petroleum wealth has an estimated net present value of NKr710bn, with the state's share put at NKr580bn, yielding an estimated return on investment of NKr41bn in 1992. When world crude oil prices fell to Dollars 8 a barrel in 1985-86, a severe blow was delivered to the economy - which was already in a state of acute over-heating - from which it has not yet recovered. Norway was forced to devalue by 10 per cent to counteract a deterioration in international competitiveness. The government then set out a three-pronged strategy to reduce the economy's dependence on petroleum income by seeking to reduce growth in private and public consumption while stimulating productivity through supply-side reform. Reduction in petroleum revenue slashed Norway's spendable real income by 9 per cent as tax and royalties from the sector fell to just over NKr18bn in 1986 from NKr52bn in 1985, or measured in proportion to total income, to 7 per cent from 19 per cent. Export revenue from the petroleum sector was reduced by NKr30bn, corresponding to about half the deterioration in the current account from 1985 to 1986. This reduced the sector's share of gross national product to 11 per cent in 1986 from 19 per cent in 1985, although total petroleum production increased to 69m tonnes of oil equivalent (t o e) from 64m t o e in the period. The current account swung from a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP to a 6.5 per cent deficit. Fresh warnings on the oil price for 1992 are emerging - indeed, in this year's revised budget forecast the government cut budget-based oil prices to NKr120 from December's NKr131 a barrel. Last year, oil prices averaged about NKr134, due to windfall effects from the Gulf war. Nevertheless, the government revised upwards 1992 GDP growth to 2.9 per cent from 1.9 per cent predicted in December and sees GDP growth of about 2.5 per cent until 1996, lifted by rising North Sea oil output. Overall GDP grew by 1.9 per cent in 1991, down from the 2.6 per cent forecast earlier by the government. Petroleum production will expand to 129m t o e this year, up 4m t o e on December's forecast, and will swell further to 149m t o e by 1996. But the government revised downwards last year's output to 118m t o e from the 123m t o e estimated in December, largely because of a maintenance overhaul causing a longer than expected shutdown of Statfjord, the biggest oil producing field. The current account surplus was also revised downwards to NKr26bn from December's forecast NKr37.3bn, due to the adjustment in forecast oil prices, but the government believes that net foreign debt may be reduced to zero in 1994. The budget also revealed weaknesses in the mainland economy, which excludes petroleum and shipping. Investments in mainland industry are expected to fall 2 per cent this year and growth has been pared back to 1.5 per cent from December's 2 per cent forecast. Demand for goods and services, however, may rise by 2 per cent from 1991-92. Cost competitiveness has improved by about 10.5 per cent in the past three years. Also on the bright side, inflation, at 2.5 per cent, is lower than that of Norway's main trading partners and interest rates have fallen to the level of most of western Europe. Households have improved their financial position and debt is being reduced on a large scale. But, nothing is being done to reduce the economy's dependency on petroleum income. On the contrary, petroleum earnings have allowed NKr40bn to be spent since 1988 to stimulate domestic demand. This year the government has allocated expenditure of NKr2.5bn just to curb unemployment, which, at 8 per cent, has risen to its highest ever post war level.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

0,FT932-15911 ,"FT932-15911 _AN-DDHB2ADVFT 930408   FT  08 APR 93 / Oil explorers warn of tax threat      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   NORTH SEA oil operators are preparing to warn the government that they will scale down oil exploration severely if changes to Petroleum Revenue Tax proposed in the Budget become law. The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes. A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that 85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000. The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent on drilling activity, compared with 17p now. Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of wells. If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from existing fields. Last year 116 wells were drilled and some estimates expect this to drop to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT changes.

At the same time, the Pemex spokesman denied that the  explosion had resulted in several casualties.    Martinez denied reports disclosed on Saturday by Radio Red,  a  Mexico City radio station, on at least 10 persons having died  and 20 others having been wounded as result of the explosion and  fire at a pipeline located in the municipality of Cunduacan,  near Villahermosa, 600 km southeast of Mexico City. ""There were  no fatalities,"" the Pemex spokesman emphasized, and indicated  that only nine persons were injured as a result of burns,  including Pemex workers and residents of the communities of  Gregorio Mendez and Ranch Nuevo, both which are near the area.    Martinez pointed out that the explosion took place at a gas  pipeline connected to the petroleum installation known as Iride.  He added that the cause of the explosion is ""still being  investigated,"" starting first by cleaning up the area and then  examining materials through laboratory analysis. Pemex  technicians and specialists from the Attorney General's Office  [PGR] are investigating the explosion and fire which resulted in  damages to an area measuring approximately 300 meters, mainly to  trees and pastures, he specified.    A Red Cross spokesperson told AFP on Saturday that the  disaster prompted the evacuation of at least 800 persons living  in the nearby communities whom, according to Mario Martinez,  ""have already returned to their homes."" He stipulated that  Pemex is also investigating damages to nearby properties. Pemex  will compensate the owners for any damaged property.    The Pemex spokesman acknowledged that the Iride installation  lacked ""adequate attention to normal maintenance procedures,""  but attributed this to the fact that peasants in the area ""have  blocked entry"" to the site by staging constant ""protests for  alleged damages"" caused by the petroleum plant. ""These  installations have been blocked from the first months of 1993 to  date by persons unjustly demanding compensation for alleged  damages,"" Pemex indicated.    Residents of the region of Cunduacan where Pemex  concentrates  a vast petroleum drilling and production infrastructure have  complained about damage caused by the state-owned company which  they accuse of polluting the area in which they live.

Mr Mukherjee assured the foreign participants, representing  the world's largest mining companies from about 10 nations, that  present national policies were based on consensus and did not  depend on changes in the political leadership. ""India's  democracy is transparent, agile and vibrant supported by a  vigilant press and independent judiciary"", he added.    He reminded the prospective foreign investors that way back  when Indian banks were nationalised, foreign banks were not  touched at that time. India has never failed in its debt  repayment upto now and situation has become much better with  regard to foreign exchange reserves, he added.    The Minister said the Indian economy is the world's seventh  largest with the third largest pool of technical manpower and  professional managers. India has a large network of railways  and seaports and other infrastructure facilities - like the  powerful stock exchange system with 25 stock markets and 6,250  registered companies, which are available for collaboration.    He said already seven power projects are being set up in the  country by foreign investors. Nearly 34 industrial sectors are  open for foreign investment and collaboration.    Welcoming the delegates, Minister of State for Mines Balram  Singh Yadav said the objective of the three-day conference is to  familiarise investors with the mining potential offered by India  and to present a forum for interaction between investors and the  Central Government, the State Governments, the public and  private sector units, Geological Survey of India, Indian Bureau  of Mines and other agencies concerned with the minerals sector.    The Minister said potential areas for mining ventures are  where exploration activities during the last four decades have  resulted in identification of large resources, specially of iron  ore, bauxite, chromite and manganese, as also several medium and  small deposits of other mineral commodities. These resources  have not yet been mined to their fullest extent largely for want  of capital and appropriate technology and provide a ready  opportunity for profitable investment in the mining sector, he  added.    He maintained that over 94 per cent of India's area has  already been mapped by the Geological Survey of India so that  preliminary data is available for further development.  Technical consultancy and geological services are also provided  in the area of mining and preparation of geological plans by the  Indian Bureau of Mines on a commercial basis.    Speaking on the occasion, Mr I. G. Thingran, Secretary,  Ministry of Mines, said in the new deregulated environment which  is investment friendly foreign investors would find great scope  for investment in exploration and mining in India.    Many countries like China, France and Australia are already  cooperating with India in the mining sector, he said.     "

The outcome compared with profits of Pounds 28m in the corresponding period of 1990 although this figure reflected the benefit of higher oil prices resulting from the Gulf war and exceptional profits from the sale of the group's North Sea assets and an exchange gain on the subsequent reduction in bank debt. Net production over the interim period amounted to 949,700 barrels - an average of 5,200 barrels per day - which represented a decline of 6 per cent. Some 88 per cent of the output stemmed from the Villeperdue field in France where another four horizontal wells are scheduled later this year. Directors said they were undertaking a re-evaluation of the group's current licence interests and exploration commitments. Several licences would be farmed out or relinquished and some applications for new exploration acreage would be withdrawn. Earnings per share emerged at 3.17p (33.96p). No interim dividend is declared (1p).  The Financial Times   London Page 17  "

Both groups confirmed yesterday that they had restarted talks, shelved since the imposition of the United Nations embargo at the start of the Gulf war, on the exploitation of two large oil and gas reserves north of Bassorah near the Iranian frontier. Iraq, in desparate need of foreign exchange to tackle shortages of basic supplies and to rebuild the economy, approached them to study crude oil buying contracts in preparation for the possible ending of the trade embargo. It then extended the talks to cover exploration and production sharing. Other western oil groups have also been approached, said Elf and Total. Both French oil groups emphasised the talks were at an early stage, that they had not signed commitments and would not sign anything until Iraq had obeyed its obligations to the UN and the embargo had been lifted. However, the Iraqi vice president, Mr Taha Yassine Ramadan, yesterday said oil production would restart soon, and would not necessarily await a UN security council decision. 'Certain countries realise that it is in their interests to re-establish relations with Iraq,' he told a Jordanian newspaper. Elf said: 'We are simply preparing for the moment when Iraq will become integrated into the international community. We have signed nothing and will sign nothing until Iraq is part of the international community.' Total warned against expecting an early agreement. The move is the first indication of French willingness to renew trade links with what used to be its closest ally and main trading parter in the middle east.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

0,FT942-13040 ,"FT942-13040 _AN-ED0DLAB7FT 940427   FT  27 APR 94 / Settling for fourth place      By BRUCE CLARK   For much of the post-war period, British politicians have been embarrassed to boast about their country's military prowess; but now Mr Malcolm Rifkind has suggested to Britons, and above all to his own rightwing supporters, a new source of pride - it might be dubbed the importance of being fourth. 'Only the United States, Russia and France can deploy as broad a range of capabilities . . .' as Britain, Mr Rifkind said yesterday, in one of few real sound-bites he had to offer reporters. His definition of strength is a carefully chosen one: there are many countries with far bigger land armies - Turkey, for example - and, by next year, the Royal Navy's total of 35 main surface ships will leave Britain as little better than a middle-ranking sea power. However, the basis for his statement is clear enough. By retaining its submarine-based nuclear deterrent, a land army in Europe and a host of minor ex-colonial commitments, Britain can certainly claim to be carrying out an extraordinarily wide range of duties for a country of its size. Yesterday's document lists 31 separate areas of engagement for the British armed force: from the Falkland Islands to Belize to Gibraltar to Hong Kong. But several of the ex-colonial commitments are due to disappear imminently, and if by 'breadth' Mr Rifkind is referring simply to the geographical extension of Britain's commitment, then the country will not hold its fourth place for long. Britain will soon withdraw land forces from Belize and Berlin and and its naval presence in Bermuda is also due for the axe. By 1997 it must quit Hong Kong. Mr Michael Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Studies, points out that the document confuses two things: the fact that Britain retains some minor colonial commitments, which are an accident of history, and the fact that Britain is still highly respected for the quality of its armed forces. The reputation of the British military should ensure the country a role  - in training, peace-keeping and as an arms exporter - far beyond its shores.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," FR940728-0-00055   FR940728-0-00019        EPA is not excluding recovered oil from operations downstream of refining, such as marketing or retail sales, because such oil is already excluded from regulation (so long as it is not disposed of). Under existing section 261.33, unused commercial chemical products that are recycled in most manners are not solid wastes when they are recycled. This principle applies to unused fuels that are recycled by being returned to fuel-production processes. (See also RCRA section 3004 (q)(l), establishing a similar principle.) Thus, for example, if a bulk oil storage terminal has a spill of product and is able to capture the spill and return it to a refinery or other legitimate fuel production operation, the spilled product is not a solid waste. (As noted at 55 FR 22671 (June 1, 1990) however, mere assertion of an intent to recycle a commercial product spill does not convert the spill into a non-waste. There must be objective indicia that recycling is reasonable, and that it will occur in a timely manner.)       For different reasons, EPA is not extending the exclusion to recovered oil from non-petroleum industries. First, such an exclusion is beyond the scope of the proposed rule. It is also beyond the scope of the judicial decisions construing the definition of solid waste. These decisions indicate that when one industry sends its residual materials to another industry for recycling, the initial industry can be considered to have discarded them.     API     v.     EPA,     906 F. 2d at 74142;     Ilco     v.     EPA,     996 F. 2d 1126 (11th Cir. 1993). EPA is also concerned that when recovered oil originates with non-petroleum industries, the likelihood increases that the oil can be contaminated with toxic constituents that would not normally be found in petroleum industry recovered oil. See generally, 56 FR at 48009 (Sept. 23, 1991); and see, e.g., EPA's Development Document for effluent guidelines for the iron and steel industry (skimmed oil from iron and steel industry contains contaminants not found in petroleum recovered oil).    6     Such oily material consequently is more likely to differ from the feedstocks customarily processed by refineries and thus need not be viewed as part of that process, and may also pose risks that can be viewed as part of the waste disposal problem. Finally, the Agency is studying this issue under the aegis of the Solid Waste Definition Task Force and is not at a point where it is in a position to make a final determination.    7                 6     Volumes IV of     Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards for the Iron and Steel Manufacturing Point Source Category,     U.S. EPA, May 1982, National Technical Information Service     #    PB82240425, 433, 458, 466, and 474. See specifically Volume III, pp. 395398; Volume IV, pp. 107129; Volume V, p. 227.                7     EPA also notes that when Congress created certain exemptions (not exclusions) from hazardous waste fuel labelling requirements to accommodate certain petroleum industry practices involving recovered oil, it limited the scope of those exemptions to fuels produced from oily materials ``resulting from normal petroleum refining, production and transportation practices'', RCRA section 3004 (r)(3). This is similar to the scope of today's rule.          B. Rationale for Excluding Recovered Oil and Not Wastewater from Being a Solid Waste           EPA is also determining today that the oil that is skimmed from plant wastewaters during wastewater treatment (normally during the initial oil/water/solids separation step occurring during primary wastewater treatment), as well as oil recovered from other sources, is not a solid waste if it is going to be inserted into the refining process prior to the point in the process where crude distillation or catalytic cracking occurs. Thus, the recovered oil systems themselves would not be waste management units. (These units may, however, contain hazardous wastes, such as K049, which become subject to regulation when removed from such units. See 40 CFR 261.4 (c), which says that hazardous waste regulation does not begin for (among other things) hazardous waste which is generated in an associated non-waste-treatment-manufacturing unit until the waste is removed from the unit.)         The petroleum industry argued in its public comments to the January 8, 1988 proposal that plant wastewaters containing oil are not solid wastes either. Rather, they characterize the primary wastewater treatment operations in which oil is skimmed from plant waters as still being part of the refining process. Thus, the argument goes, any step at a refinery that involves some recovery of oil for further use is still part of the ongoing refining process and cannot involve solid waste under the holding of     AMC I    .       EPA disagrees with respect to primary wastewater treatment operations. These operations do not involve secondary materials that are ``recycled and reused in an     ongoing     manufacturing or industrial process'',     AMC I    , 824 F. 2d at 1186 (emphasis original);     see also AMC II    , 907 F. 2d at 1186 (    AMC I     concerns only ``materials that are `destined for     immediate reuse     in another phase of     the industry's     ongoing production process''') (emphasis original). Primary wastewater treatment operations exist to treat plant wastewater. The percentage of oil in plant wastewaters that form the influent to primary wastewater treatment is minuscule, on the order of .0001 % to .000001 % (    i.e.     from 1 to 100 parts per million oil). See Tables in Section V,     Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum   Refining Point Source Category.     While some oil may be recovered from this wastewater (an activity the Agency certainly encourages, and indeed requires to prevent the oil's discharge to surface waters and POTWs), the amounts are not significant in the context of a refinery's overall production activities. Clearly, wastewater treatment is the main purpose of the systems in question, and any oil recovery is of secondary import.       Refinery wastewater is not a ``secondary material immediately reused within an industrial process''.     Chemical Waste Management     v.     EPA    , 976 F. 2d at 14. Primary wastewater treatment is the first step in the wastewater treatment process that purifies the discarded wastewaters from the refining process so that those discarded waters can ultimately be discharged to navigable waters pursuant to Clean Water Act requirements. That a small amount of oil is removed from these wastewaters in the course of treatment does not make wastewater treatment a petroleum refining operation. Put another way, the fact that a small amount of oil may be recovered from large volumes of the discarded plant wastewaters does not require EPA to consider those operations to involve non-discarded materials, and hence to exclude all of the materials going to primary wastewater treatment operations from the definition of solid waste.     AMC II    , 907 F.2d at 11867 (``discarded'' is an ambiguous term that EPA may interpret in a reasonable manner, and EPA's interpretation that recoverable materials managed in wastewater treatment operations containing surface impoundments were discarded solid wastes was reasonable).

Refinery wastewater is not a ``secondary material immediately reused within an industrial process''.     Chemical Waste Management     v.     EPA    , 976 F. 2d at 14. Primary wastewater treatment is the first step in the wastewater treatment process that purifies the discarded wastewaters from the refining process so that those discarded waters can ultimately be discharged to navigable waters pursuant to Clean Water Act requirements. That a small amount of oil is removed from these wastewaters in the course of treatment does not make wastewater treatment a petroleum refining operation. Put another way, the fact that a small amount of oil may be recovered from large volumes of the discarded plant wastewaters does not require EPA to consider those operations to involve non-discarded materials, and hence to exclude all of the materials going to primary wastewater treatment operations from the definition of solid waste.     AMC II    , 907 F.2d at 11867 (``discarded'' is an ambiguous term that EPA may interpret in a reasonable manner, and EPA's interpretation that recoverable materials managed in wastewater treatment operations containing surface impoundments were discarded solid wastes was reasonable).

[Hurd] It is my first opportunity to meet Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias and other Greek Government officials since  Greece took over the European Union [EU] Presidency. We will  discuss several issues, such as Cyprus, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  the strengthening of relations with the countries of East and  Central Europe. Expanding the EU to the East is a important aim  of the Greek Presidency.    [Karidhis] What does Britain expect from the Greek  Presidency?    [Hurd] Generally, we expect the Greek Government to  implement  the program it announced. The EU enlargement negotiations,  which are at a critical stage, must be concluded. And the  economy must continue to be discussed. Everyone in Europe is  concerned with unemployment. We are also very concerned with  the Yugoslav issue. EU countries have an important role to play  in the former Yugoslavia. We are offering assistance, providing  troops, and contributing to the peace process. The Greek  Presidency has set out some goals for each of these sectors. We  would like to contribute so that these goals are implemented.  [passage omitted]    [Karidhis] Following the implementation of the Greek  embargo,  the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] is facing  serious economic problems. In Athens, all the political parties  represented in the Chamber of Deputies except the Greek  Communist Party approve of the economic measures adopted by  Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou against Skopje [FYROM]. The  Greek decision surprised Brussels and greatly annoyed Greece's  Community partners. What is the British Government's position  on this issue?    [Hurd] We share the views of our EU partners. The problem  must be settled by negotiations under UN auspices. The  negotiations that have been suspended must resume. The Greek  measures, which cause serious problems to a small, weak country,  contribute to instability in the Balkans. Stability in Skopje  is in Greece and the EU partners' interest.    Serious Problems    [Karidhis] Minister, do you believe the Greek action  violates  international law (the UN Charter, Treaty of Rome, and  Maastricht Treaty)?    [Hurd] I am not a judge expressing a legal opinion but I am  not so much interested in the legality of the decision as in  whether the measures can be considered wise.    We understand the Greek reservations. The Greek side has  clearly expressed its fears. We believe though that the problem  must be solved through direct talks. I do not believe it is  reasonable to cause problems, what are probably serious  problems, for a small country that is already in a difficult  position because of the situation in the former Yugoslavia.  This is our position, a position that I believe is shared by  all of Greece's Community partners. And it must be considered  seriously, especially now that Greece holds the EU Presidency.  This position must be understood and not considered as hostile  toward Greece.    [Karidhis] Other than the name issue, Skopje does not appear  willing to make concessions on basic issues (the flag and the  Constitution). I recall that Britain--an EU member--decided to  impose an embargo on Argentina during the war in the Falkland  islands.    [Hurd] We took measures against Argentina not because it  pursued the Falkland islands, but because Argentine forces  attacked and occupied the islands. It is a different case.  Dialogue with Skopje must continue. Greece may understand our  views following the EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels  early this week.    Greece is a warm supporter of the European Union, it holds  the Presidency, and I hope that the doors that have closed  regarding Skopje will reopen. We understand the Greek concerns  but the problem will only be solved through negotiations.    [Karidhis] Let us move to another issue. You said you will  discuss the Cyprus issue in Athens. Last October, you urged  Cypriot President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas to make new efforts to resolve the differences  between the two communities. In your opinion, what are the  prospects for a settlement?    [Hurd] Some activity has been noted since then, especially  in  the talks on confidence-building measures [CBMs] under Joe  Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus. Athens and London agree that Cyprus must remain united.  We also agree that the status quo cannot continue. Both  countries believe there are two communities in Cyprus with equal  rights. I hope there is no disagreement between us on CBMs,  which I considered a good start. I believe the three guarantor  powers--Turkey, Britain, and Greece--are obliged to make every  possible effort so that there is an agreement first on CBMs and  then a general settlement of the problem.    [Karidhis] It seems there are basic differences between the  two sides on CBMs.    [Hurd] I do not believe the differences are basic. There are  differences but they are not differences of principle. I  believe Kliridhis can reach an agreement with Denktas on the  measures and then continue with the dialogue. I believe the  problem will worsen if the two sides do not exploit this  opportunity now. When I was in Cyprus in October, I realized  there was a tendency toward intransigence on the part of the  leadership and within the parties and among the public. If the  CBM's are not accepted, the problem will continue, thus  perpetuating an unfair situation, one that carries the threat of  instability. [passage omitted]    [Karidhis] Minister, how do you see the future of  Greek-British relations?    [Hurd] We are linked with traditional ties of friendship. We  do not always agree 100 percent but we are very close friends.  We speak to each other honestly. In the next few months I will  visit Greece three times. My first visit will begin next week.  Afterward, I will participate in the EU foreign ministers  meeting in northern Greece, then in the EU summit in Corfu. I  am looking forward to these visits, not because it is pleasant  to visit Greece in the spring and summer, but because I will  have the opportunity for close talks. I believe this has always  been one of the characteristics of the friendship between the  two countries.     "
0,FT931-12596 ,"FT931-12596 _AN-DA1B9ACQFT 930128   FT  28 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: The oilman's land of opportunity - Existing exploration contracts cover only 17 per cent of Peru's 70m hectares of potential oil-bearing territory      By SALLY BOWEN   PERU REMAINS 'the great unexplored in the oil business,' says Mr Roger Alderson, general manager in Peru for Simon Petroleum Technology. 'No-one questions the technical possibilities of major finds here.' The country has more that 70m hectares of potentially oil-bearing territory but only 17 per cent of that is covered by existing exploration contracts. Since 1983, investment in oil exploration in Peru has been in almost continuous decline. Last year companies under contract with state-owned Petroperu invested a mere Dollars 43m in exploration, a tenth of the amount invested ten years earlier. Proven oil reserves have slumped to about 350m barrels, half of their 1982 level, and Petroperu estimates exploration investment should be at least Dollars 115m a year. But the situation, it is hoped, is about to change. The controversial return to democracy in Peru via congressional elections on 22 November could now pave the way for a long-awaited spurt of foreign investment. 'The April 5 coup didn't scare investors away,' says Mr Alderson, 'but it did slow things down. If Peru's democracy is now accepted as valid, we're away and flying. Peru has ten times the opportunities of Argentina, for example, and, historically it's no less stable or any worse a risk than either Argentina, Colombia or Bolivia.' For the past two years, SPT (formerly Robertson Research) has been working with Petroperu to boost foreign interest in Peruvian oil. Twice-yearly promotional tours have targeted oil operators, largely in the US, who are seeking fresh fields for expansion. A big factor in Peru's favour is recent legislation governing foreign investment in general and oil exploration in particular. 'The current law works,' says Mr Jaime Quijandria, president of Petroperu. 'We can prove we offer better conditions than Colombia, Argentina or Ecuador - and investors are coming.' One hiccup has been the delay in gaining final approval for contracts. But under new, streamlined procedures Petroperu has been able to reach speedy agreement with three US oil companies over exploration and development, but Peru's council of ministers has inexplicably been dragging its feet. One of these contracts is with Great Western Resources for exploration in the Peruvian jungle; another with Olympic of Denver, Colorado, in association with a Peruvian firm Petrolera San Juan for drilling in the northern coastal area of Piura; and the third, an exploration and production contract, with Texas-based Clayton Williams. The proposed joint venture with Clayton Williams, the ebullient Texan operator who once ran for governor of his home state, is Petroperu 's first  -and the first for an area already producing. Clayton Williams has an 80 per cent share and will bear the full Dollars 10m initial cost of drilling five wells. Petroperu's contribution will come in down the line when a further 40 wells are planned. Mr Quijandria is convinced that Peru must, as Colombia did, get its oil industry off the ground with a series of similar smallish contracts. 'The larger companies aren't risk-takers,' he says. 'They prefer the smaller fry to come in and do the donkey work - then they'll move in later.' There are only two big names operating locally at present, Mobil and Occidental Petroleum - and both have been in Peru for years. Occidental has increased its output by 20 per cent in the past few months since settlement of a long-running dispute with the previous Peruvian government. Mobil's hopes of striking it big in Peru's unexplored central jungle, meanwhile, have been dashed. The company boldly entered the central Huallaga, centre of the Peruvian illegal cocaine trade, two years ago. The camp was attacked by Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas in December 1990 and had to be almost completely rebuilt. Terrorism is not the reason for the pull-out, however. After investing about Dollars 32m in necessary infrastructure, the first well drilled was dry. 'At least we've learned there's no oil there at 9,000 ft down,' says a philosophical Mr Quijandria. 'But remember the Huallaga basin has never been drilled before - it would have been utopian to find oil first go.' Petroperu's promotional efforts focus on two Peruvian basins, the Ucayali and the Maranon. Both have basic transport infrastructure in place and are close to Peru's northern pipeline. Initial surveys show the jungle zone of Madre de Dios is also promising, but transport is more of a problem. The hurdle is getting the first investors interested. Petroperu is having to go it alone with development of the rich Chambira deposits, where oil was struck three years ago. Now that Dollars 30m in financing has been agreed with the Andean Development Corporation (CAF), Chambira should be producing 7,500 barrels a day within 12 months. 'This is a totally no-risk enterprise,' says Mr Quijandria. 'Yet we offered it for a year to the private sector and no-one was interested.' While the complex process of privatising Petroperu is taking time, senior company managers, perhaps surprisingly in a massive state-owned enterprise, are full of initiatives. In recent weeks, Petroperu has reached a 'maquila' (lease on idle capacity) agreement with trader Marc Rich to utilise 20,000 b/d of idle capacity at its La Pampilla refinery. Marc Rich will bring in Dollars 18m of crude every 45 days for refining. The refined products will be left for Petroperu to market locally, and the residual crude will be re-exported. Later, when domestic Peruvian prices are more internationally competitive, it is expected that Marc Rich will market in Peru under its own brand-name. Camisea, the vast gas and condensates field discovered by Royal Dutch Shell in the Peruvian jungle in the mid-1980s, remains the most exciting prospect. Shell is dragging its feet - but Peru's current, dramatic electricity shortage is injecting fresh urgency into the search for a solution. State-owned Electroperu is now contemplating construction of several gas-fired thermal plants near Camisea. Electricity could be shipped over the Andes by cable instead of building a gas pipe-line. 'It's a financing problem now,' says Mr Quijandria. 'I'm suggesting the government appoint an agent to get a consortium together for the Dollars 1.4bn needed to develop Camisea. Then we have to put pressure on Shell to say whether they'll agree to head it.'   Countries:-  PEZ  Peru, South America.   Industries:-  P1311  Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

Following completion of repairs in 1990 and due to an expected decline in ANS transportation requirements, the Vessel was temporarily placed in foreign service and renamed accordingly. Subsequently, under a provision of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, the vessel was, and remains, prohibited from operating in Prince William Sound, thereby denying the Vessel from operating in the only Jones Act trade for which it is operationally and economically suited.   SeaRiver advises that since September 1990, therefore, the Vessel has operated in foreign service. In the four years of foreign operations, the Vessel has completed more than 60 voyages primarily transporting mid-East crude oil to European discharge ports. SeaRiver states that the Vessel's performance in this service has been exemplary, and the Vessel and its crew are highly regarded in the many foreign ports which it has entered. Moreover, as the only modern U.S. tanker consistently operating abroad, the Vessel and her crew have demonstrated and fostered the best traditions of the American flag merchant marine.

The disposal of Discol forms part of the divestment programme at Pinault, which has been selling assets in an attempt to reduce the FFr19bn (Dollars 3.5bn) net debt it incurred in its controversial bid for the Au Printemps department store chain. Discol is a substantial wholesaling business with 13 depots across France and annual sales of FFr2.7bn. However, it is a loss-making company with heavy debt of about FFr100m. The acquisition of Discol would turn Promodes into the largest wholesaler in France ahead of Metro, the German group. Promodes has substantial wholesaling interests through its Prodirest subsidiary which has 21 depots and annual sales of FFr1.5bn. Pinault hopes to raise FFr100m from the sale, according to an unconfirmed report in yesterday's edition of L'Agefi, the French financial newspaper, and wipe out Discol's FFr100m borrowings. The group yesterday disclosed a marginal fall in sales to FFr70.69bn last year from FFr70.83bn in 1991. Casino, another leading French hypermarket group, yesterday disclosed a 46.3 per cent increase in sales to FFr61.6bn in 1992 fuelled by last summer's acquisition of the Rallye hypermarket chain. Au Bon Marche, the department store group, produced sales of FFr25.16bn last year, although this can not be compared to 1991's FFr4.65bn sales because the company has been expanded by adding part of Mr Bernard Arnault's luxury goods interests.

0,FT934-16464 ,"FT934-16464 _AN-DJFC5ADZFT 931006   FT  06 OCT 93 / Shell and BP link for oil and gas venture      By RICHARD WATERS and ROBERT CORZINE      NEW YORK, LONDON   SHELL OIL and BP said yesterday they would spend Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 790m) to develop the largest oil and gas discovery in the Gulf of Mexico for the past 20 years. The field, known as Mars, was discovered by the two partners in 1989. It will mark the site of the deepest platform in the Gulf at 2,933ft when production starts towards the end of 1996. Shell Oil, the US subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell group, will have a 71.5 per cent interest in the development and bear a similar proportion of the costs, with BP Exploration of the US representing the remaining 28.5 per cent. For Shell Oil the development, 130 miles off the Louisiana coast from New Orleans, will mark a significant addition to production. The first phase of development is expected to yield 500m barrels of oil equivalent, with a further 200m barrels potentially available in later stages of development. The company's total proven reserves at the end of 1992 amounted to just under 2bn barrels. At its peak around the year 2000, Mars is expected to produce 100,000 b/d, not far short of the total 136,000 b/d that Shell currently produces in the Gulf of Mexico. The development is also expected to produce 110m cu ft of natural gas a day. Deep-water sites in the Gulf of Mexico have become a focus for US exploration and development as companies apply new seismic and production technology to the area. Mr John Browne, BP's London-based exploration chief, said the tension-leg platform technology used in the Mars project will, for example, 'have valuable applications both elsewhere in the Gulf of Mexico and in other parts of the world'. Although many US-based companies are investing heavily in long-term exploration elsewhere, the application of new technology has made the Gulf of Mexico a more immediate and accessible source of new production from proven reserves. BP has sold its interests in the El Qari'a gas field in the Nile Delta concession about 100 miles north of Cairo to Amoco, the US company announced in Chicago yesterday. The price was understood to be about Dollars 50m. The project is run by the Egyptian subsidiary of Agip.   Companies:-  Shell Oil.     BP Exploration Inc.     Amoco Corp.

Refund Claims             We now propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April 10 Notice to the crude oil subpart V proceeding that is the subject of the present determination. As noted above, $870,000 of an alleged crude oil violation is covered by this proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $174,000, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties.         The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined products.     E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,     14 DOE  85,475 (1986) (    Mountain Fuel    ). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, a covered product is any product that was either covered by the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. 751760, or if the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery. See     Great Salt Lake Minerals  Chem. Corp.,     23 DOE  88,118, at 88,305 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price controls.     E.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,     15 DOE  85,495, at 88,89396 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges.     E.g., Berry Holding Co.,     16 DOE  85,405, at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.     E.g., New York Petroleum,     18 DOE at 88,70103.         Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury and may not rely on the presumptions of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the     Report by the Office of Hearings and Appeals to the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, reprinted in     6 Fed. Energy Guidelines  90,507 (1986). Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for crude oil refunds under subpart V.     Mid-America Dairyman, Inc.     v.     Herrington,     878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989); accord     Boise Cascade Corp.,     18 DOE  85,970 (1989).         Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined products will be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived by dividing the alleged crude oil violation amounts involved in this determination ($870,000) by the total consumption of petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls (2,020,997,335,000 gallons).     Mountain Fuel,     14 DOE at 88,868 n.4.         As we stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will be required to submit only one application for crude oil overcharge funds.     E.g., Allerkamp,     17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another application. That previously filed application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994, as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds. See 58 F.R. 26,318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed within this deadline at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants that filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.     E.g., Seneca Oil Co.,     21 DOE  85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the     Federal Register    .           B. Payments to the States and Federal Government             Under the terms of the SMRP, we propose that the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision, or $696,000, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government for indirect restitution. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.             It Is Therefore Ordered That:       The refund amount remitted to the Department of Energy by Dane Energy Company pursuant to the Consent Order executed on April 8, 1993 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Higher crude oil prices benefited all three firms as did a steep rise in  gasoline and other oil product sales prices. But the gains were partially  offset by dwindling production.    Texaco's profit fell to $366 million, from $464 million compared to 1988  results. The second-quarter 1988 results included a restructuring gain of $225  million from the sale of its West German unit. Revenue declined 10% to $8.4  billion.    Higher crude prices benefited Texaco's exploration and production business,  while a steep rise in gas prices in the quarter helped refining and marketing  businesses.    But those gains were offset partly by declines in foreign exploration and  production earnings stemming from last year's platform explosion in the North  Sea and the sale of Texaco subsidiaries in Canada and West Germany.    Texaco also said its refining margins were reduced by a softening of gasoline  prices toward the close of the quarter and scheduled maintenance at three  refineries.    White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco is the nation's third-largest oil concern  behind Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.    Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum's earnings rose about 4% from last year  to $80 million.    It said quarterly earnings reflected extraordinary losses of $4 million in 1989  and $10 million in 1988 from the early payment of debt. Revenue rose 7% to $5.1  billion from the 1988 quarter.    Occidental's Piper Alpha oil platform off Aberdeen, Scotland, exploded and  burned July 6, 1988, in the North Sea's worst oil disaster. Texaco and  Occidental were two of four companies operating the field, where production has  been delayed since the accident.    Occidental said the North Sea accident reduced its exploration and production  earnings, but that was partially offset by higher crude oil prices.    Occidental said coal division earnings tumbled to $1 million from $3 million  due to strikes by miners in Kentucky and Tennessee , who joined a wildcat  strike in sympathy with a walkout against Pittston Coal Group's operations in  Virginia and West Virginia.    Houston-based Shell, the nation's sixth-largest oil company, said  second-quarter earnings soared 61% from a year ago to $440 million. Revenue  totaled $5.9 billion, a 9% gain.

Under the terms of the agreement with the China National Petroleum Corporation BP Exploration and four Japanese partners will spend three years on a seismic programme, after which they will have an option to begin exploration drilling. The consortium's commitment is on a relatively small scale, thought to be around Dollars 3m for the seismic operation. Other foreign companies which have recently reached exploration agreements in the area include Exxon and Texaco of the US, Agip of Italy and a number of Japanese companies. The Tarim Basin has long been viewed with interest by foreign companies, but its remote location and lack of infrastructure means development of any oil finds are likely to be long-term prospects.

It is the latest of several legal setbacks for WMC. WMC, via a subsidiary, bought Seabright in 1987 for around CDollars 92m (USDollars 70m), as part of push into North America. However, within weeks of completing the acquisition, WMC described Seabright's Beaver Dam deposit, thought to be one of its most promising assets, as hopeless. By 1989, the Australian company had halted Seabright's operations and written off its investment. WMC proceeded to sue Seabright's president, Mr Terence Coughlan, and other directors, for alleged fraud and negligence. They counter-sued WMC, levelling a variety of charges, including abuse of process. Last year, Mr Justice Merlin Nunn, in the Nova Scotia Trial Division, delivered a judgment which was scathing of WMC's behaviour. He duly ordered the it to pay damages and costs, expected to exceed CDollars 10m, to the president and six former directors of Seabright. Yesterday, in the wake of the appeal court's decision, WMC said it still believed that its case had merit, and was 'considering an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada'. The Seabright affair has been only one of several costly legal debacles for WMC, one of Australia's largest mining companies, in recent months. It was forced to hand over the valuable Ernest Henry copper/gold deposit to Savage Resources in an out-of-court settlement after WMC's exploration team trespassed on a lease area, and then failed to advise Savage of its work. And, last November, WMC and Ord Minnett paid ADollars 20m to settle a case in which it was alleged that a report by the Australian stockbroker - stating that WMC's sale of a 50 per cent interest in the Lady Bountiful gold mine was 'fair and reasonable' - was negligent. The payment, to a small exploration company called Consolidated Exploration, which had sold the stake to WMC, was split between the two firms.   Companies:-  Western Mining Corp Holdings.

Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said President Ramos  was informed yesterday of the latest find in West Linapacan, the  country's biggest oil field.    The find was made as the West Linapacan consortium was  drilling a sidetrack well dubbed as A-5 to stop water seepage in  the original well.    Water encroachment in the Linapacan wells cut their  production level from a high of 18,000 barrels a day (BOPD)  early last year to 5,000 BOPD in December 1993.    Consortium representatives told DOE officials last Friday  that the A-5 well encountered continuous very good oil shows in  the limestone up to a depth of 8,020 feet.    The operators said the oil-water contact in the A-5 well is  lower than that in the A-3 well, giving an additional 400 feet  of oil column.    An energy department source said the discovery of a new oil  section may boost the production of crude from West Linapacan.    The consortium also reported that the A-5 well may have  combination gas and water drive which would enhance oil recovery.    Three drill stem tests (DST) are to be conducted in A-5 this  week after which the well will be completed for production and  hooked up the storage tanker. [sentence as published]    Alcorn (Production) Phils., Inc., the operator of the field,  has a 23.4 percent stake in Linapacan. Its partners are  Oriental Petroleum  Minerals Corp. (36.6 percent); Basic  Petroleum (11 percent); Alcorn Petroleum and Minerals (7.4  percent); Alcorn Phils. Inc. (5.6 percent); Petrofields (5  percent); Philodrill (4 percent); Seafront (4 percent); Unioil  (2 percent); and Balabac Oil (1 percent).    Still on the oil sector, Shell Philippines Exploration Corp.  (SPEX) and Occidental Petroleum are eyeing two of the world's  biggest oil exploration firms as partners in the $2 billion  worth development of the Camago-Malampaya field in Northwest  Palawan, the largest gas find in the country.    An industry source said that Atlantic Richfield Co. (Arco),  one of the top ten oil exploration firms in the United States,  and Total Corp., a French oil company, are negotiating  separately with Shell and Oxy.    Arco recently won the geophysical and seismic exploration  contract (GSEC) covering the Sulu Sea.    The source said that SPEX and Oxy, operators of the  Camago-Malampaya field, are willing to offer up to 15 percent  each to a foreign partner. Shell and Oxy each have a 50 percent  stake in Camago-Malampaya.    Shell and Oxy have started inviting foreign oil companies to  join the Camago-Malampaya development last February.    Shell and Oxy has shortlisted some five companies as  possible  partners which include Arco and Total.    Shell and Oxy are willing to accept investors who would be  able to carry their share of a $2-billion project.    A 1 percent participating interest in Camago-Malampaya may  be  worth some $20 million.    Earlier, sources said that the two oil exploration companies  were not inclined to dilute the ownership of the field.    Last February, Shell and Oxy started the drilling of two  wells.    Two more wells are expected to be drilled to confirm  reserves  of three to five trillion cubic feet (TCF) of natural gas and a  minimum of 100 million barrels.    Bomasang earlier said the Camago-Malampaya field could  supply  Luzon at least 600 million cubic feet of gas per day through an  undersea pipeline.    The amount will be enough to sustain the fuel requirements  of  a 3,000-megawatt (Mw) power plant by the year 2000.    According to Bomasang, an early production system will  produce oil at 20,000 to 50,000 barrels per day by 1996 and if  the reserves are adequate, a final production system of 10,000  to 20,000 BOPD would be set up by 1999.

Officials of the Australia-Indonesia Joint Authority for the Timor Gap Zone of Co-operation say over 26,000 km (16,000 miles) of seismic work has been completed since 11 contract areas were designated between December 1991 and last February. The contracts commited companies to six-year exploration programmes worth Dollars 362m, under which they must complete 52,100 km of seismic work and drill 45 exploration wells. The Timor Gap is an offshore area of about 60,000 sq km between Indonesia and Australia. A dispute between the two countries over rights to the area was resolved by a treaty of co-operation, which came into effect in February 1991. The first well is to be drilled by the Australian subsidiary of Marathon Oil, a US-based company. A Marathon official said on Tuesday that a tender for a drilling vessel would be placed soon and a further four wells were scheduled for next year. Marathon is leading a consortium of Santos and Korea Petroleum in two contract areas and is commited to a Dollars 76m programme to drill 12 wells and conduct 10,000 km of seismic work. Other companies holding a stake in the contract areas include Shell, BP, Phillips and Enterprise Oil. The acreage agreements provide for production to be shared equally between the Joint Authority and the contractor, after recovery costs, up to the first 50,000 barrels. The governments of Indonesia and Australia are equal partners in the joint authority. Industry officials say the Timor Gap is a largely unknown territory for oil exploration. Only one well has previously been drilled in the area, 14 years ago, which found some gas and indicated the presence of hydrocarbons but not in commercial quantities.

Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said planned maintenance shutdowns at the Wytch Farm field and the Forties pipeline system in the UK led to a lower average daily output during the first half of 21,072 barrels of oil equivalent. Production had returned to normal levels and he predicted average output for the full year would be close to the 23,900 b/d achieved last year. The drop in first half production caused turnover to decline to Pounds 39.2m (Pounds 43.7m). But the company benefitted from selling forward 73 per cent of its estimated 1993 output at Dollars 18.67 per barrel, against recent prices of under Dollars 16 a barrel. Cash inflow of Pounds 25m was supplemented by the Pounds 34.2m received from the company's rights' issue last March. Gearing, currently at 100 per cent, is likely to be slightly higher by year-end, according to Mr Gourlay. But he expects it to fall to 60 per cent by next year because of the cashflow expected when the North Sea Gryphon field begins producing next month. Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in the field. Mr David Basham, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the size of the interim loss took the market 'a little bit by surprise,' and added that Clyde was 'trying to tidy up its balance sheet before the Gryphon production began.' Mr Gourlay said the company's exploration efforts would focus in future on the Netherlands, UK and Yemen. He said Clyde would be 'opportunistic' about possible disposals.

Having installed an  offshore platform and using its own prospecting personnel, the  Brazilian company is working on the island as subcontractor to a  consortium put together by Total, of France, and the Canadian  firm CMW.    Exploration of the Cuban coastline in search of petroleum  began last year when risk contracts were signed with  multinational oil companies. Since it has no funds to meet any  high-cost commitments, Cuba will use the oil taken from the  bottom of the sea to pay the companies that operate there.    ""Indications of Oil""    Andrade Gutierrez's efforts, explained Roberto Rivas,  director for the Americas of the Cuban Cooperation Committee,  focused first on reserves that had already been analyzed by  Cuban Government geologists and geophysicists. ""We have  indications that there is petroleum under the sea,"" said Rivas,  who is an important adviser to Carlos Lage Davila, considered to  be the strongman of that country's economy.    According to Andrade Gutierrez press advisers, the builder  has already fulfilled half the contract. The work began on 18  December 1993. So far, 1,760 meters of drilling has been done in  three 3,500-meter deep wells in Cardenas Bay, on the north of  Cuba across from Valadere beach (the country's biggest tourist  center), according to reporter Elizabeth Rosa.    Andrade Gutierrez sets the total value of the project at $9  million. It took the firm, which began drilling oil wells in  Brazil early in the 1980's, 13 days just to transport the  platform from Brazil to the Cuban coastline. According to  Gutierrez, the platform was inspected by international firms and  considered to be ""in legal and acceptable condition in terms of  the United States trade embargo against Cuba.""    Decline in Production    Even during the years of close ties to the Soviet Union, the  Caribbean island had been producing as much as one million tons  a year of petroleum, Rivas noted. But since Soviet assistance  ended, local production has leveled off at about 500,000 tons a  year, not enough to satisfy domestic needs.    The state corporation in charge of business transactions in  the petroleum field--everything from prospecting to refining and  distribution--is Cupet Cubana de Petroleos. The current  off-shore risk contracts, the director of the cooperation  committee stated, will also have the effect of using the idle  capacity of the island's three refineries--one in Havana,  another in Santiago de Cuba, and a third in Cienfuegos.  Considered the most modern of Cuba's refineries, the plant at  Cienfuegos has the capacity to refine three million tons of oil  a year.     "

In the past there has been a concern with finding  methods of reducing the harm to the environment while saving  energy if a separation film process were to be used to purify  petroleum. Both the technological and financial aspects of the  problem have been discussed. As the result of about one year of  research, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) reports that such applications are in fact possible, and  is therefore establishing the Advanced Materials Laboratory at  the High Polymer Center. MITI is also embarking on this research  and development in cooperation with the film manufacturers Tore  and Nitto Electric, as well as with petroleum purification  companies, the engineering industry, and universities.    The separation of liquids and gases with polymer films has  made great technological strides in recent years and is used for  a wide range of applications. However, distillation is still the  basic step in the petroleum purification process. The use of  separation films has merit, but MITI says that new technological  advances are required because ""these liquids have high  viscosity."" In fact, there are as yet no examples of successful  application anywhere in the world.    MITI's Center for Promoting the Petroleum Industry has been  investigating the suitability of separation films for pertroleum  purification. Their conclusion is that the technology is  difficult but application is possible if the necessary advances  can be made in polymer technology. MITI also said that it will  support increased technical cooperation with oil-producing  nations such as Saudi Arabia.    The focus of this research and development will be the High  Polymer Center. Technical investigations will be carried out by  the Joint International Separation Film Specialists Research  Committee, studying the state of experimental research.  Participants include scholars such as Professor Naoshi Kimura of  Tokyo University and Professor Teruhiko Oya of Yokohama National  University, the Materials Engineering Technology Laboratory,  Arabia Oil, Shukko Kosan, Chiyoda Kako Kensetsu, Tore, and Nitto  Electric. Research will be conducted at the Advanced Materials  Laboratory that is expected to be completed by February of next  year, with Tore and Nitto Electric in charge.    The 1993 budget calls for expenditures of about 200  million (about $2 million), and MITI expects the project to last  10 years. Film materials are currently made from polyimides or  PPS, but materials of higher functionality will be sought. MITI  also says that research will attempt to find applications  through modularization and bench plants.     "

The figures showed that the underlying business was stable despite the Pounds 1.65bn exceptional charge taken by the company to fund its radical restructuring. The company was also able to make a fractional increase in its full year dividend to 14.5 pence a share, compared with 14.2 pence last time. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, noted that the increased dividend was 'broadly in line with inflation.' The company still retained a policy of making achieving real rises in dividends, he said. Mr Rogerson noted that dividend cover was 1.4 times, compared with the normal level of 1.5. The loss per share after exceptional items was 6.6p, compared with a profit per share of 15.8p in 1992. But the adjusted figure, excluding exceptional charges, was 20.8p (21.8p). Despite diversification in recent years the UK gas supply business still provides the overwhelming bulk of British Gas operating profits. These were Pounds 1.16bn before exceptional charges of Pounds 1.56bn, resulting in an operating loss of Pounds 405m, compared with a Pounds 927m profit in 1992. Overseas gas supply made an operating profit of Pounds 162m (Pounds 137m), while exploration and production profits rose to Pounds 264m from Pounds 226m before. The rise in the overseas division was attributable mainly to good results from the company's distribution operations in Argentina, where it is part of a consortium supplying gas to Buenos Aires. British Gas's US trading arm, the Natural Gas Clearinghouse, also reported improved operating profits. The exploration and production side benefitted from new fields coming on stream and higher production rates from the South Morecombe field off the west coast of the UK. Analysts expect a steady increase in exploration and production profits over the next few years because of a planned rise in production volumes. Total sales volume last year was 98.9m barrels of oil equivalent, but analysts say it could rise to 150m barrels by 1995-1996. British Gas also benefits from the fact that the pricing structure of many of its gas supply contracts is linked only partially to oil prices, which could stay weak for much of this year.

""We are concerned over developments that tend to disrupt the  equilibrium in the region. But we hope that China and Vietnam  can resolve this amicably, and later all claimants can proceed  multilaterally on the issue,"" Foreign Affairs Undersecretary  Rodolfo Severino said.    ""Although this is a bilateral problem, but since its impact  has reverberations in the region, then all claimants have an  interest in what happens,"" Severino added.    The latest row between China and Vietnam, two of the six  claimants to the Spratly Islands, stemmed from China's grant of  oil exploration rights to the Colorado-based Crestone Energy  Corp. over a 25,000 square kilometer area of the South China  Sea, which Vietnam claimed was within its continental shelf.    Vietnam warned that Crestone's decision to proceed with its  exploration of the disputed area was a ""serious violation of  Vietnam's sovereignty"" and would escalate tensions in the region.    Vietnam, apparently in retaliation, also signed up with  Mobil  Oil Corp. to explore an area overlapping the Crestone concession.    The Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] said that while the  Crestone concession does not fall within the territorial claim  of the Philippines in the South China Sea, it is closely  monitoring developments in the area to review its implications  on regional stability.    ""As defined by Presidential Decree 1596, the Crestone  exploration block is not covered by the Philippines' claim to  the Spratlys. The Crestone block lies some 135 kilometers from  the Western boundary of the Philippine claim,"" a DFA official  said.    But the Philippines reminded China and Vietnam of the 1992  ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea which urged  claimant-states ""to set aside issues of sovereignty and explore  the possibility of cooperation"" in the Spratlys.    The official said the Philippine strategy was to initiate  bilateral talks with other claimants to the Spratlys to promote  the idea of demilitarizing the area and developing the oil-rich  islands through cooperation. The Philippines first proposed the  plan of demilitarizing the area during President Ramos' state  visit to Vietnam.    The Philippines will also continue diplomatic initiatives to  adopt confidence-building measures which will ""veer away from  military confrontation,"" the official said.    The oil-rich Spratlys is being claimed in whole or in part  by  the Philippines, China, Vietnam, Brunei, Taiwan, and Malaysia.     "

'We share the concern of the industry about the growing potential power of citizen suits and the increasing legal fuzziness of issues like land 'suitability' and 'acceptable' environmental compliance', say analysts Amy Gassman and Alexandra Zawadiwsky. They suggest a 'compromise' version of the mining law reform is likely to be passed during 1994 and this could affect the earnings of several gold mining companies from 1995 onwards. The analysts say it is likely that gross royalties between 3 per cent and 5 per cent could be levied on federal unpatented lands and add 'we believe the industry can live with a moderate new royalty structure.' They point out that only a very small number of exploration prospects eventually become mines. 'Thus, to introduce greater uncertainty into the exploration process (will the project receive permits, will it be located on suitable lands?) further reduces the already-slim probabilities associated with the search for new mines. In order to increase the probabilities, miners are looking (outside the US) where there has not been as much activity.' However, this move to offshore exploration also 'reflects the intersection of several positive trends - the move toward a market economy and democratic government in several Latin American countries, the availability of large areas of unexplored prospective acreage offshore, the passage of new mining legislation to protect ownership rights and the ability to remit profits - at the very time that the process for exploring and developing properties in the US is becoming more uncertain and time-consuming.' The existing Mining Act of 1872 has been under attack by some US politicians for years because it enables mining companies to apply for a patent on federal land on which they are mining or plan to mine for a one-time fee of Dollars 5 an acre. Also, once patented, the land and the minerals contained in it are transferred from the public to the private sector and are exempt from any further rental or royalty payments to the Federal Treasury. Critics say the present system does not provide a financial return to the American people for the use of public domain lands.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The surprise action, introduced by Sen. James A. McClure (R-Idaho), appeared to  be intended to put an end to the moratorium process that has put California off  limits to offshore oil drilling for a decade and stirred the rancor of senators  who favor exploration for oil.    The economic impact of a port shutdown on cities such as Long Beach would be so  catastrophic that opponents of offshore drilling would have little choice but  to stop barring new oil exploration by congressional mandate, supporters and  critics said.    Approval of the port-closing measure, which was attached to an Interior  Department funding bill on a 12-10 vote, appeared likely to at least force  Congress to limit the scope of a sweeping one-year offshore drilling moratorium  recently approved by the House.    The moratorium, which was accepted reluctantly by the Senate panel as part of  the appropriations bill, bars new oil exploration within 84 million acres of  American coastline, including the entire length of California, through October,  1990.      Acknowledge Dilemma    Even staunch drilling advocates acknowledged that public concern about oil  spills, particularly the Exxon Valdez disaster off the Alaskan coast, had made  it impossible to vote against a moratorium.    Rather than oppose a moratorium outright, they sought to turn that public  concern to their advantage, arguing that any coastal waters too sensitive to be  exposed to drilling ought also to be protected from more hazardous oil tanker  traffic.    ""If an area is really sensitive,"" said Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), ""let's  close it.""    The amendment would bar oil-carrying tankers from entering any U.S. waters in  which oil exploration was prohibited beginning in October, 1991.    Passage of the amended measure prompted cries of outrage from drilling critics,  who denounced the port closing provision as ""mischievous"" and ""irresponsible.""    ""This is a distortion,"" said California Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey),  sponsor of earlier bills that have put most of California off limits to  drilling since 1981. ""They're saying: 'If you don't like drilling, we'll take  your tankers away.' ""     ""It's sort of like planting a time bomb,"" said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the  Natural Resources Defense Council. ""It's a ploy to pressure the states that  have moratoriums to drop them.""    But other environmentalists acknowledged that the port-closing measure puts  them in a difficult position because it appears to echo their own concerns  about the risks that oil exploration poses to environmentally sensitive  regions.    And many expressed concern that, if enacted by the Senate, the threat could be  used as a negotiating chip to force the House to abandon a provision that would  prevent the Interior Department from conducting even preliminary drilling  studies off California.    The Interior Department, which opposes the drilling moratorium but had not  expected to block it altogether, had made elimination of the ban on preleasing  activity a top priority. The provision affords special protection to a vast  area off Central California, where progress toward a scheduled 1991 lease sale  otherwise would go unhindered.    In a victory for the Administration, the Senate panel agreed to delete the  preleasing activity ban from the legislation on grounds that it would block  crucial studies designed to assess whether drilling might pose an environmental  threat.    While the committee approved the rest of the drilling moratorium, it voiced  strong reservations, criticizing what it described as ""ineffective"" efforts by  the House to address public concerns.    ""I understand emotions,"" warned Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), an outspoken  supporter of the oil industry, ""but we're not supposed to be tossed along on  the frothy sea of emotion. We're supposed to deal with facts.""    Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.), an advocate of the moratorium, urged his  colleagues to be patient in large part because ""the nation is recoiling from  oil spills.""    Despite the misgivings on the part of the committee, champions of the drilling  ban expressed confidence that they could win approval of a comprehensive  moratorium when the measure reaches the Senate floor. A vote could come as  early as today.      Unexpected Twist    ""The committee approval of the leasing moratorium is an important victory in  our battle to protect the California coast from oil and gas development,"" said  Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.). As for the moratorium on preleasing activity,  Cranston said: ""I expect we will prevail.""    The introduction by McClure of the port-closing provision added an unexpected  twist to what had been a straightforward battle between pro-exploration and  anti-drilling forces.    Many observers interpreted the provision as a deliberate effort by the Senate  committee to ""tweak"" California, which has wielded its legislative power in the  House to protect itself from new offshore drilling while profiting enormously  from the oil industry.    ""I think what you're witnessing is a regional dispute,"" said Steve Goldstein,  an Interior Department official. ""California's predominance in the House has  tended to bring about a rather parochial point of view.""    Administration officials praised the McClure measure for focusing attention on  the fact that tankers have proven more likely to cause oil spills than have  offshore drilling platforms. But they refused to address the merits of the  proposal, indicating only that the measure ""served its purpose.""    A stronger reaction came from the oil industry, which contended that the  measure might block its product from American markets if ports were indeed  closed.

0,FT944-12447 ,"FT944-12447 _AN-EKAEZAHIFT 941101   FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (3): The lining is golden - Mines survive new land rules      By BRUCE JACQUES   For the Australian mining industry the much feared 'era of Mabo' has begun without interrupting the long-standing trend of steadily increased production and export revenue. Mabo is the popular tag given to a watershed High Court decision given legislative effect late in 1993 through the Native Title Bill. The Bill, which broadly gives Australia's Aboriginal people title to large tracts of the country, had drawn dire predictions from the mining lobby, mainly reflecting concerns about exploration and development access. However, in 1993-4, the industry has again overcome weak world demand, historically low prices for many key commodities and unfavourable exchange rate movements marginally to lift export revenue to almost ADollars 30bn, accounting for better than 35 per cent of the country's total export receipts. Figures from ABARE, the Federal Government's commodities research arm, show that Australia's mineral exports have risen in all but one year of the past decade. The latest total represents more than double the country's then record ADollars 14.9bn mineral exports in 1986. While this performance justifies the industry's world leader status, demonstrating its inherent strength and diversity, closer inspection reveals some weak spots which threaten to reduce momentum later this decade. The industry acknowledges that the effects on production and revenues may not be felt for some years, given the lead times involved in major projects. But mining executives see Mabo as part of a long term pattern of adversity which includes the rise of environmental issues, compensation claims from landowners, unfavourable tax treatment and vexatious litigation. Mr Geoffrey Ewing, of the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC), says the mining industry has long been a leader in negotiating with Aboriginal communities. 'Our argument is not with the concept of native title, but with the way the Bill produces an unwieldy system for exploration and development access,' Mr Ewing said. 'Any real influence on production and exports is obviously some years off. In fact, our annual financial survey, due out later this year, will probably show a lift in exploration spending in the latest year. But our information is that the spending is mainly on what could be described as 'brownfields', sites which are free of any native title claims.' The Australian mineral industry's overall performance in the latest year was also distorted by near boom conditions in one commodity - gold - where export value rose by more than 26 per cent to ADollars 5.42bn, masking some serious declines in other commodities. Gold's resurgence echoes its historical position as one of the main populators of fledgling antipodean colonies more than a century ago. The metal's more recent Australian history is scarcely less important to national fortunes. From a position of decline in the 1970s, when many of the country's biggest mines faced closure and annual output ran at less than three tonnes, Australian gold production has rallied close to 250 tonnes in the current year, ranking it third in the world after South Africa and the US. And new projects already under way mean that production will keep rising strongly, barring a collapse in the all-too-volatile gold price. Mr Robin Widdup, gold analyst with J. B. Were  Son, the Australian stockbrokers, told the Financial Times World Gold Conference in June that Australia's annual gold production was likely to top 300 tonnes by the turn of the century. Vigorous exploration and new mine development has transformed the gold industry from the 1980s picture of short life, shallow oxide open pits, to large long life mines in the 1990s,' Mr Widdup said. 'The 1990s Australian gold rush has seen geologists, armed with new geochemical and geophysical techniques, unearth a series of large new gold discoveries beneath sand cover. 'This breakthrough in technology has lifted exploration expenditure  .. and the rate of success shows no sign of slowing. A group of 10 to 15 new mines should lift Australian production by 40 to 50 tonnes over the next five years.' If gold fulfils these expectations, it could replace coal as Australia's number one export earner around the turn of the century. Gold's export jump in the latest year compared with a corresponding 5 per cent fall to just under ADollars 7.2bn for coal. Several other major Australian minerals recorded solid export revenue gains in 1993-94, including aluminium, up 5 per cent to ADollars 1.82bn and iron, steel and ferroalloys, up 22 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. But zinc exports fell 22 per cent to ADollars 795m. Sticking to a familiar pattern, Australia's higher overall export receipts were achieved despite markedly lower average commodity prices received. ABARE's mineral export price index slumped from 99.7 to 91.9 over the year while the index of mine production rose from 105.2 to 107. Australia is, quite simply, continuing to sell more minerals for less money. The financial performance of its leading commodities companies remains volatile. It's a habit that will prove hard to kick while the industry remains a price taker, hostage to a small local market and heavily exposed to the vagaries of international trade.

On this issue, our radio editor has this to say:    In recent days, many activities have been taken by a number  of countries which have complicated the situation in the Truong  Sa [Spratly] Archipelago and on Vietnam's continental shelf.    Despite the Vietnamese Government's statements on its  continental shelf and special economic zone, the Creston Company  of the United States on 8 May 1992 signed an agreement on oil  and gas exploration with a Chinese company in an area they  called Wananbei-21, which is in fact the Tu Chinh area of  Vietnam. The Vietnamese Government immediately voiced its  protest, considering the move a violation of Vietnam's  sovereignty, but it ignored Vietnam's statement. On 18 April  1994, Creston again announced a seismic survey in the area.  Foreign reports on 10 May quoted a spokesman for the Chinese  Foreign Ministry saying that the Thanh Long Sea area belongs to  the adjacent waters of Nansha Island, which is in fact Vietnam's  Truong Sa Archipelago. He even said that the exploration  contract signed between Vietnam and the Mobil Oil Company was  illegal.    On the question of Truong Sa and Tu Chinh, the Vietnamese  Government has many times affirmed that they are under Vietnam's  sovereignty. At a press conference in Hanoi on 5 May, a  spokesperson of the Vietnam Foreign Ministry said: Vietnam has  enough historical and legal documents proving its sovereignty  over Truong Sa Archipelago. Therefore, foreign activities of  exploration and exploitation of natural resources of Truong Sa  area without the permit of Vietnam are acts of violation of its  sovereignty.    On the settlement of disputes, Vietnam has on many occasions  stated that disputes should be settled in the spirit of  equality, mutual understanding, and mutual respect in accordance  with international law and the Convention on the Maritime Law of  1982, and in respect of the sovereignty of all countries over  exclusive economic zones and continental shelves. All parties  concerned should restrain themselves not to further complicate  the situation, use violence, or threat to use violence. Vietnam  is persistent on this line. As for Tu Chinh, Vietnam affirms  that it lies within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone and  continental shelf, entirely under Vietnam's sovereignty.  Vietnam has the sovereign right to explore for and exploit  natural resources in this area by itself or in cooperation with  other foreign countries, the right which no other country may  interfere. Tu Chinh and Thanh Long are in no way related to the  Truong Sa Archipelago or the adjacent waters. Any statement or  any contrary act to these principles is illegal and runs counter  to the international law.     "
0,FT934-16484 ,"FT934-16484 _AN-DJFC5ADFFT 931006   FT  06 OCT 93 / Fresh feather in their caps: Brazil's constitution has slowed economic growth. Reform is in sight      By ANGUS FOSTER   Five years after adopting a new constitution, Brazil's congress today sits down to discuss important changes to a document now blamed for some of the country's most serious problems. If adopted, the changes could help stabilise the country's economy. If not, the government's attempts to tackle inflation of almost 2,000 per cent a year are unlikely to succeed. Many of the ideals behind the 1988 document were admirable, but have proved unrealistic for a developing country such as Brazil. The constitution was designed to reverse a process of centralisation imposed during 20 years of military rule, and restore individual rights. Instead, it reflected the utopian dreams of its drafters and now looks awkwardly socialist and nationalist in character. To entrench workers' rights, the constitution imposed a country-wide minimum wage, ruled that public employees could only be sacked through the courts, and forced through a retirement system based on length of service, which let female teachers retire after only 25 years' work. Five years later, the minimum wage is driving employers in the poorer, northern half of the country to hire and fire through the informal economy, outside the government's tax net. The public sector salary bill has doubled to 11 per cent of the government's creaking budget, and the social security system is nearly bankrupt because more people will soon be receiving benefits and pensions than are contributing. Mr Mailson de Nobrega, finance minister when the constitution was approved, says the government was powerless to avert these problems because it lacked support in congress. 'We could only cry, and pray,' he says. Brazil finally has the chance to address its constitutional weaknesses over the next few months. Except for clauses that guarantee the basic federal structure and individual rights, every aspect of the constitution is open for discussion. Amendments will be passed by simple majority among the combined members of Brazil's congress, the senate and house of deputies. The most important area for change is the relationship between the federal government, the states and municipalities. The constitution, in a bid to decentralise power and spread wealth to the poorer regions, forced the federal government to transfer more resources to states and municipalities. For example, the federal government's share of total tax revenues fell 10 percentage points to 33 per cent in 1988 as a result of the changes. But there was no corresponding decrease in the federal government's responsibilities, and it remained burdened with spending commitments in areas such as schools, health and public services. Transfers to states and municipalities and wage bills accounted for 70 per cent of the federal government's revenues last year, while a further 17 per cent went in interest costs on its debt. As a result, the government could only fund its commitments by borrowing at high, short-term interest rates and printing money, both of which are highly inflationary. The constitution also made compulsory the earmarking of certain expenditures. For example, 18 per cent of total tax revenues has to be spent on education. These rules make government efforts to cut its budget deficit difficult and will have to be relaxed for the revision to be successful. Equally, observers note, resources should be better related to responsibilities. This means the federal government should be allowed to claw back some transfers, or the states and municipalities should assume more responsibilities. 'We have to get a fair sharing of revenues and expenditures to restore feasibility to the federal government and tackle inflation,' according to Mr Nobrega. Persuading congress of the need for fiscal reform will be tricky, especially since the largest political party, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, is suspicious of the intentions of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister. It fears that he is planning a 'shock' economic plan, the fifth since 1986, which could bolster his chances of running for president next year. The biggest obstacle to constitutional reform will be the states, which would suffer through either smaller transfers or more spending commitments. For this reason, the government is likely to call for a political consensus to make the sacrifices necessary to solve the federal budget deficit. 'Without a political pact on how to distribute resources, you won't get the ball rolling. You won't do much by simply changing the rules of the constitution,' according to one minister. The chances of reaching such a pact are mixed. There is widespread support for the revision process in congress but it is opposed, sometimes violently, by a coalition of leftwing and church groups which fears workers' rights are at stake. Although this group only involves about 25 per cent of congress, it can delay progress and has threat-ened to challenge the revision through the courts. Perhaps more important, the coalition government of President Itamar Franco is weak and seems unlikely to be able to generate enough support within congress for the more unpopular measures that are needed, including thorough fiscal reform. With only a year before presidential and congressional elections, there is a danger some members of congress will place their re-election interests ahead of those of the government's budget. Mr Roberto Campos, federal deputy for Rio de Janeiro and a leading critic of the constitution's weaknesses, is cautious about what the revision can accomplish. 'It can't worsen the constitution, and that's the only cause for optimism,' he says. Areas that could see important change, according to Mr Campos and others, include foreign access to the economy. The constitution discriminated against foreign investment in fields such as mining and transport, and guaranteed state monopolies in petroleum and telecommunications. These are today hindering new investment because of the government's lack of resources. Following vocal lobbying from organisations such as Fiesp, the Federation of Sao Paulo Industries, it seems likely the discrimination clause will be dropped and foreign-controlled companies will be allowed once more to exploit Brazil's mineral reserves. It is also possible that Telebras, the monopoly telecommunications company, will slowly be forced to face private sector competition. Less likely to be questioned is the monopoly over petroleum exploration and refinery enjoyed by Petrobras. A newspaper poll of congress members at the weekend showed them divided over the Petrobras issue, mainly for nationalist reasons, and the government appears equally split. There could also be much-needed reform of the retirement system. Because of generous provisions in the constitution, and special treatment for groups like teachers, there are now some 14.5m Brazilians receiving state retirement benefits and pensions, at a cost of about USDollars 6bn a year. But contributions to the system are too low, and the shortfall has been met with money meant to pay other types of benefit. The government wants to delay the retirement age, which would be the same for men and women, and privatise some services. However, opposition will be formidable, both inside and outside congress, from groups who see Brazil's retirement system as one of the few successes for workers in recent years. Progress in these areas will be difficult because of the government's political problems and the unfortunate timing of the revision, one year ahead of elections. Brazil should emerge with an improved constitution, but this is likely to remain far from ideal. As an indication of the difficulties, congress seems split on the constitution's most notorious ruling, that real interest rates should not exceed 12 per cent a year. The clause is widely ignored, but its removal would have important symbolic effect. However, the poll of congress members showed a small majority, 46 per cent to 42 per cent, in favour of keeping the rule in place - probably reflecting popular mistrust of the banks.

The UK Offshore Operators' Association, the oil industry group, has drafted a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry, saying that many companies will be unable to meet previous commitments made to the government over future drilling activity because of the planned PRT changes. A survey published yesterday by Ernst and Young, the accountants, found that 85 per cent of oil companies expect job losses to result from the PRT changes. Some 40 per cent of the respondents expected job losses to be much higher than the Treasury's estimate of 10,000. The changes to the PRT regime would reduce the tax rate for existing oilfields from 75 per cent to 50 per cent and abolish it for new fields. The chancellor also proposed to abolish tax relief for exploration and appraisal work. This means that companies will have to pay 64p for every pound spent on drilling activity, compared with 17p now. Companies say they applied for previous licences to explore for oil in the North Sea on the basis that the rules would stay the same. As part of those applications, they committed themselves to drilling a certain number of wells. If no tax relief is available for exploration, many companies will be unable to fulfil their obligations, the industry argues. But its response to the new rules is complicated by a row between winners and losers from the changes. Amerada Hess has said it will halve its exploration activity, but British Petroleum said the changes would improve recovery of oil from existing fields. Many companies want some transitional relief - the chancellor has said that if companies had already entered into contracts for drilling wells, they can still apply for tax relief. Companies want that to be extended to firm commitments for drilling wells. Analysts reckon that as part of previous licensing arrangements, the industry is commited to drilling 170 wells over the next couple of years. Last year 116 wells were drilled in the North Sea, and some estimates expect this to drop off to just 80 this year as a result of the depressed oil price and the PRT changes. An average of one in seven wells strikes oil. Oil sector at odds, Page 9   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

The issue is intended to finance exploration and strengthen the company's balance sheet by retiring debt. Mr Lindsay MacAlister, managing director, said Pancontinental wanted to strengthen its overall position before deciding whether to increase capacity at its Kunwarara magnesite operation in Queensland. The proposed expansion would increase capacity for deadburn magnesia to 150,000 tonnes a year from 100,000, and boost production of electrofused magnesia to 25,000 tonnes from 15,000. Mr MacAlister said Pancontinental would require ADollars 20m over three years for increased exploration and evaluation of mineral prospects and a further ADollars 20m to optimise capacity at the mines and associated facilities. Pancontinental said it would concentrate expenditure on the Paddington/Kundana gold mines in Western Australia, the Thalanga base metals operation in Queensland, and the tantalum mine at Wodgina in Western Australia. The company said about 55.52m shares would be issued with acceptances closing on July 3.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "
0,FT921-14807 ,"FT921-14807 _AN-CANA3ADUFT 920114   FT  14 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Washington keen for Mexican oil reform      By DAMIAN FRASER      MEXICO CITY   THE US is likely to push for a substantial liberalisation of Mexico's oil sector as part of the free-trade negotiations between the two countries, but will fall short of demanding changes to the Mexican constitution, according to a document from the US industry sector advisory committee on energy trade policy matters. Under the Mexican constitution, hydrocarbon ownership is limited to the Mexican nation. However, current practice allows Pemex, Mexico's oil monopoly, to hire private sector oil companies in exploration and drilling on condition that the contract signed is a service one - that is, that payment received does not depend on oil found. Nevertheless, in a letter to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, the advisory committee says: 'Mexico has an unofficial, yet effective, ban on American land drilling rigs.' Offshore drilling contracts, says the report, are hampered by the need to use middlemen, and it is 'extremely difficult to obtain work even with an agent'. The advisory committee calls for a substantial liberalisation of existing laws and regulations in Mexico, saying this would 'increase the value of its (Mexico's) hydrocarbon resources'. This reform could be carried out within the current constitution. 'The US industry has demonstrated great flexibility in developing contractual arrangements for oil and gas exploration and production to accommodate a variety of legal, political and economic situations,' the letter goes on. 'If Mexican authorities are interested in obtaining outside participation in upstream activities, contractual arrangements could be developed which would meet their constitutional requirements, assure Mexico favourable investment returns, and provide US companies with incentives necessary for participation.' While Mexico's constitution limits ownership of oil to the nation, it is only the regulation which governs the constitutional article that rules out risk-sharing exploration contracts. The report highlights other areas that block foreign investment. Service stations and refineries in Mexico, it says, are solely owned by Pemex. The report concludes: 'The downstream sector should be open to foreign investment, as it is in the US and Canada. Such investments will bring necessary technology to address environmental problems.'

The Labour government won a deal with the opposition to allow exploration in the Skagerrak strait, but agreed to make further environmental studies before starting drilling. The opposition Conservative party backed the plan in return for a government promise to review controversial rules allowing the state to raise its stake in profitable oil and gas fields. The new exploration areas will open up 16 per cent more of Norway's continental shelf for prospecting, making it possible to drill under 56 per cent of the waters off the coast. Norway, western Europe's biggest oil producer, currently pumps some 2.5m barrels a day, mostly from the North Sea. Output, however, is expected to fall in few years unless new discoveries are made. Sweden, fearing pollution from oil prospecting in the waters between itself, Norway and Denmark, has requested inter-government talks before a decision is made. Norway's state pollution board has sharply criticised previous studies of the consequences of opening Skagerrak and areas off mid-Norway for exploration, calling them inadequate.

God willing, may it be a year full  of success. Could you tell our listening friends what important  projects were implemented by the Petroleum Ministry in 1372  [year beginning 21 March 1993]?    [Aqazadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful.    I reciprocate new year's greetings to all our dear people  and  I hope that it will be a wonderful and constructive year for our  country and people, God willing. Regarding the last (?two)  years, we attained considerable success in 1372, which can be  presented in the form of a list:    --The exploration of the Darkhovin reserves, which has  approximately 9 billion barrels of very superior quality light  oil.    --The discovery of a new gas reserve with 20 trillion cubic  feet [as heard] of gas with very rich deposits.    --Regarding drilling, fortunately we have attained a  wonderful drilling record since the Revolution: 300,000 meters  on the nationally.    --In the field of crude oil production, we have raised  Iran's  production capacity to over 4 million barrels. The war caused  extensive damage to the crude oil production industry.  Fortunately, we were able to carry out repairs and  reconstruction and raise our production from 2.5 million barrels  at that time to 4 million.    --Regarding infrastructural projects, one of our most  remarkable achievements was the inauguration -- in the presence  of the esteemed president -- of the Arak Refinery with a  capacity of 150,000 barrels and of one of the greatest  petrochemical units of the country, namely the Arak  petrochemical complex with a capacity of approximately 250,000  petrochemicals, including light and heavy polyethylene, and  propylene.    --In the field of gas piping, in 1372 we were able to  install  250,000 gauges in the houses of the people, and by activating a  new phase of the Kangan Refinery we were able to raise its  output to more than 55 million cubic meters.    --Fortunately, we were successful in expanding our gas  piping  activities in various cities, and in 1372 200 cities had been  covered by piped gas or activities for expanding the gas piping  network had been initiated, which was a massive and valuable  project performed by the National Gas company.    --With all the deficiencies and shortcomings, it was an  appropriate performance compared to other years for the National  Distribution Company [NDC]. Fortunately, we did not experience  any fuel shortages in the colder areas of the country, such as  in East and West Azerbaijan, Ardabil, Kermanshah, and Kordestan  Provinces. The situation was most satisfactory throughout the  country, compared to all the years since the Revolution. This  made it possible to have a very rare situation countrywide, and  except for some temporary shortages in some cities, the  situation was most satisfactory.    Fortunately, with the signatures of most of the deputies and  their appreciation of its services, the NDC was able to plan its  activities for 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] in such a  manner that we can resolve the problem of transporting fuel  permanently, God willing.    These activities are a brief account of our projects in  1372.  Regarding the sale of crude oil and our presence in  international markets, the situation in the first six months of  this year regarding prices and sales were favorable and in  accordance with what had been envisaged in the budget. However,  in the second half of the year, with a slump in oil prices, our  income decreased. In general, we had an oil income of $13.5  billion, which was $3 billion less than the forecasts. In view  of the situation in the international market, this level of  income was quite appropriate and we were able to adhere to the  production ceilings stipulated by OPEC, as well as to organize  our exports within that framework in an excellent manner without  any retail problems.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, could you tell us what  programs you envision for 1373? If, God willing, you have any  glad tidings for our compatriots, do let us know.    [Aqazadeh] I may state that since the development and  distribution of oil and gas, the expansion of the petrochemical  complexes is the priority of the Islamic Republic of Iran. We  are optimistic that new oil derricks that have been set up for  exploration in the Caspian Sea will become operational next  year. In addition, we will begin drilling wells in the eastern  Mazandaran Sea region, which is one of the most suitable sites  in the country, even though it has not been explored in the past  years.    Our prospecting activities will continue in the Persian Gulf  and [words indistinct] fortunately, we have decided that the  planning and construction of this refinery will be done  completely by Iranians. This work will begin in 1373 and it is  hoped it will be operational in 1375 [year beginning 21 March  1996].    A very important piece of news for our people is the  value-added [arzesh-afzudeh] importance of this unit, as well as  the magnitude of the production of the vast Bandar-e Imam  complex. The glad tidings I have for the people are that this  massive complex, which is the largest petrochemical production  unit in our country and covers all branches, such as light and  heavy polyethylene, propylene, EDC, PVC [preceding acronyms in  English], as well as all other petrochemical products, is  expected to begin full operation in Khordad [22 May-21 June]  this year.    With these complexes going into operation, we will not only  be able to attain self-sufficiency in most petrochemical  departments but will also be able to export $300 million worth  of these products this year. This is also good news for the  factories that provide the raw materials for the petrochemical  complexes, and they should not have any doubts regarding the  sale of their products because we will ensure high-quality  production at an international standard and will thus  permanently eliminate the problems that they have experienced  for so many years regarding petrochemical imports and  fluctuations in foreign exchange income.    On the gas piping situation, as in the past years, we will  expand these activities in various cities of the country, which  is our priority. We hope that this year more cities in the  colder areas of our country will join the gas piping network.    With the functioning of the Sarkhun Refinery in Bandar-e  'Abbas, which has a capacity of approximately 15 million cubic  meters of gas per day, we will be able to cater to the needs of  the Hormozgan, especially of the Kerman Province, its power  station, the peripheral copper industries, the Sarcheshmeh  copper complex, and the cities on this route right up to Kerman.  This will open a new chapter in the piping of gas. With the  development of the refinery and its operation, especially of the  (Karkehraker) unit in Abadan that distills furnace oil and its  products such as gasoline, gas oil, and kerosene, we are  extremely optimistic that 1373 will be a wonderful year for our  people regarding the provision of their fuel product  requirements.    I predict that in the oil industry 1373 will be a grand year  for production, foreign exchange earnings, and the increase in  the efficiency of this great industry of the country. Once  again, I wish to convey my greetings for this new year to the  people, especially to my colleagues in the petroleum industry  who have behind them a successful year, and I hope that this  year they will make the same sublime efforts so that the country  is steered toward economic and political self-sufficiency.    [Correspondent] Mr. Aqazadeh, I am extremely grateful that  you have given some of your time for us, despite your  engagements. We hope you will be successful and that in the  course of the year 1373 we will be able to be at your service  again.    [Aqazadeh] Likewise, I am grateful for your efforts and  those of your colleagues at the radio [station] for preparing  and presenting such joyful, wonderful, and useful programs.    [Correspondent] May you be successful, God willing.     "
0," FR940628-2-00110   FR940628-2-00084        T.D. 56487 emphasized the statutory requirement that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the T.D. provided that the exportation of a given quantity of a manufactured product affords a proper basis for the allowance of drawback only to the extent that the product could have been produced in that quantity (together with the quantities of related products produced concurrently) from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. The T.D. provided that this requirement meant that such concurrent production must be practicably possible by ordinary manufacturing techniques.     T.D. 56487 contained explicit accounting procedures for manufactured articles. When the inventory of a particular product contained product with different drawback factors (e.g., if the inventory of motor gasoline was from more than one month's production, each month's quantity could have a different drawback factor), withdrawals from the inventory for exports were required to be ``[f]rom lowest [factor] on hand'', withdrawals for drawback deliveries (i.e., for further manufacture resulting in a product on which drawback could be claimed) were required to be ``[from] lowest on hand after exports are deducted'', and withdrawals for domestic (non-drawback) shipments were required to be ``[f]rom earliest on hand after [withdrawals for export and drawback deliveries] are deducted.''     The basis for the above accounting procedures is explained in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, in which it is stated, ``[t]he total amount of drawback allowable *** shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of product exported by the drawback factor for that product,     with due consideration for the `lower-to-higher' principle established in [19 CFR 22.4(f)]    .'' (Emphasis added.)     Customs has been requested to amend T.D. 8449 (as stated above, when the Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback were revised in 1983, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives was not included in the revised regulations but was subsequently published, without substantive change from its initial publication as T.D. 56487, as T.D. 8449) to permit the accounting for withdrawals for export and for drawback deliveries from the inventory of a particular product containing product with different drawback factors on the basis of FIFO or higher-to-lower. The basis for this request is stated to be that when T.D. 56487 was published, Customs permitted such accounting only on a lower-to-higher basis but now other bases of accounting, including FIFO and higher-to-lower are permitted.     It is Customs position that the above-described rationale for amending T.D. 8449 to permit the accounting on a FIFO basis in the described situation has merit (although, in the interest of administrative simplicity, Customs believes that the order of such withdrawals should continue to be the same; i.e., first exports, then drawback deliveries, then domestic shipments). The reasons given for the introduction of FIFO to accounting procedures for drawback still apply; i.e., that FIFO is less difficult to administer and is consistent with commercial accounting procedures (see, e.g.,     Miller's Comprehensive GAAP Guide     (1985), page 2401     et seq    ., Inventory Pricing and Methods). The basis for requiring use of the lower-to-higher accounting procedure in this situation was that that was the only accounting procedure permitted to be used for drawback at the time. Customs position has now changed. Furthermore, we note that under T.D. 8449, there are procedures guaranteeing that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise, as required by the drawback law.     However, it is Customs position that T.D. 8449 should not be amended to permit the accounting on a higher-to-lower basis and, furthermore, that C.S.D. 8482, the only published Customs ruling permitting higher-to-lower accounting for drawback purposes, as well as any unpublished Customs rulings to the same effect, should be revoked. As described above, when the Customs Regulations on drawback were revised in 1983 and the use of FIFO, or any other accounting procedure approved by Customs, was authorized, the applicable provision (19 CFR 191.22(c)) was modified from that proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for the revision. In the Notice of Proposed Rule Making, only FIFO would have been permitted. In the Final Revision it was explained that this change was in response to a comment which was found to have merit, and therefore other accounting procedures could be used. Illustrations of these other accounting procedures were given. The illustrative accounting procedures (``low-to-high'', ``identification'', and ``blanket identification'') are either as conservative as the lower-to-higher procedure then permitted or consist of direct identification without recourse to an accounting system.              "," FR940628-2-00110   FR940628-2-00084        T.D. 56487 emphasized the statutory requirement that the total amount of drawback allowed may never exceed 99 percent of the duty paid on the designated imported merchandise. To ensure compliance with this requirement, the T.D. provided that the exportation of a given quantity of a manufactured product affords a proper basis for the allowance of drawback only to the extent that the product could have been produced in that quantity (together with the quantities of related products produced concurrently) from the designated imported crude petroleum or petroleum derivatives. The T.D. provided that this requirement meant that such concurrent production must be practicably possible by ordinary manufacturing techniques.     T.D. 56487 contained explicit accounting procedures for manufactured articles. When the inventory of a particular product contained product with different drawback factors (e.g., if the inventory of motor gasoline was from more than one month's production, each month's quantity could have a different drawback factor), withdrawals from the inventory for exports were required to be ``[f]rom lowest [factor] on hand'', withdrawals for drawback deliveries (i.e., for further manufacture resulting in a product on which drawback could be claimed) were required to be ``[from] lowest on hand after exports are deducted'', and withdrawals for domestic (non-drawback) shipments were required to be ``[f]rom earliest on hand after [withdrawals for export and drawback deliveries] are deducted.''     The basis for the above accounting procedures is explained in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making for T.D. 56487, in which it is stated, ``[t]he total amount of drawback allowable *** shall be computed by multiplying the quantity of product exported by the drawback factor for that product,     with due consideration for the `lower-to-higher' principle established in [19 CFR 22.4(f)]    .'' (Emphasis added.)     Customs has been requested to amend T.D. 8449 (as stated above, when the Customs Regulations pertaining to drawback were revised in 1983, the general drawback rate for crude petroleum and petroleum derivatives was not included in the revised regulations but was subsequently published, without substantive change from its initial publication as T.D. 56487, as T.D. 8449) to permit the accounting for withdrawals for export and for drawback deliveries from the inventory of a particular product containing product with different drawback factors on the basis of FIFO or higher-to-lower. The basis for this request is stated to be that when T.D. 56487 was published, Customs permitted such accounting only on a lower-to-higher basis but now other bases of accounting, including FIFO and higher-to-lower are permitted.

Mr Ashdown wrote to Mr John Major, the prime minister, saying he had seen the British proposal which was circulated to other Antarctic treaty parties before their meeting in Madrid next week, but which was not given to MPs. He said the document showed that Britain intended actively to promote a mining regime at the conference. Greenpeace is pressing for the continent to become an international nature reserve. Lord Melchett, director of Greenpeace, protested that UK policy would mean a moratorium on mining for a fixed term, probably 20 years, to be followed by a minerals agreement.

Mr David Boyd, managing director, said the company would be better off in the short term from the overhaul to the Petroleum Revenue Tax announced in last week's Budget. He said the move would contribute Pounds 5m in additional cash flow from Goal's share in the onshore Wytch Farm development and the Magnus field in the North Sea. However, he said the changes would accelerate plans the company had in place to move its exploration efforts overseas. It is looking at making a further shift from the British to the Netherlands sector of the North Sea. Oil production was steady at 115,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent (which includes gas). It is set to dip slightly this year and almost double in 1995 when offshore production from Wytch Farm comes on stream. Turnover was steady at Pounds 44.2m.

Members are to be selected from the spectrum of commercial carriers and shippers using the inland and intracoastal waterways, to represent geographical regions and to be representative of waterway commerce as determined by commodity ton-mile statistics.     Service.     The Board is required to meet at least semi-annually to develop and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army on waterways construction and rehabilitation priorities and spending levels for commercial navigation improvements, and report its recommendations annually to the Secretary and the Congress.     Appointment.     The operation of the Board and appointment of its members are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (Public Law 92463 as amended) and Departmental implementing regulations. Members serve without compensation, but their expenses due to Board activities are reimbursable.      The considerations specified in Section 302 for the selection of the Board members, and certain terms used therein, have been interpreted, supplemented, or otherwise clarified as follows:     Carriers and Shippers.     The law uses the terms ``primary users and shippers.'' Primary users has been interpreted to mean the providers of transportation services on inland waterways such as barge or towboat operators. Shippers has been interpreted to mean the purchasers of such services for the movement of commodities they own or control. Individuals are appointed to the Board, but the must be either a carrier or a shipper, or represent a firm that is a carrier or shipper. For that purposes a trade or regional association is neither a shipper or primary user.     Geographical Representation.     The law specifies ``various'' regions. For the purpose of selecting Board members, the waterways subjected to fuel taxes and described in Public Law 95502, as amended, have been aggregated into six regions. These are: (1) the Upper Mississippi River and its tributaries above the mouth of the Ohio; (2) the Lower Mississippi River and its tributaries below the mouth of the Ohio and above Baton Rouge; (3) the Ohio River and its tributaries; (4) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway in Louisiana and Texas; (5) the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways east of New Orleans and associated fuel-taxed waterways including the Tennessee-Tombigbee, plus the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway below Norfolk; and (6) the Columbia-Snake River System and Upper Willamette. The intent is that each region shall be represented by at least one board member, with that representation determined by the regional concentration of the individual's traffic on the waterways.

Previously, much of this  land could be explored only by ECOPETROL and was not open to  third parties.    An interesting process begins today. It will continue in  Houston, United States; Calgary, Canada; and, in approximately  two weeks, London. Three packages with information from three  regions will be presented. The regions are El Pie de Monte, in  Los Llanos; Magdalena's Valle Superior region, in Tolima and  Huila; and the Putumayo region. Each information package is  worth $20,000.    Colombia, as the newspaper EL ESPECTADOR reports in today's  Salmon Section, is going to go all the way to attract new  investors by means of more attractive contracts to build a sound  future as far as exploration and exploitation of oil goes.    We have ECOPETROL President Juan Maria Rendon on the line.  Good morning, Dr. Rendon.    [Rendon] Hello, Dario, how are you?    [Arizmendi] What do you and ECOPETROL expect from this probe  being initiated today?    [Rendon] The main objective is to attract new investors to  the country so that they can help Colombia get into this oil  business, which is characterized by high risks and heavy  investments. Colombia suitably decided 20 years ago to work on  this in conjunction with the private sector. Unfortunately, low  oil prices and the fact that China, Russia, and many others have  opened up to foreign investments like Colombia did appropriately  a long time ago makes it more difficult to find companies that  want to come here for exploration. The main objective is to  engage in a very aggressive campaign in the cities you mentioned  to visit the headquarters of the companies with our information  to secure oil production levels Cusiana will make possible.    [Arizmendi] How many foreign companies are expected to join  the exploration process?    [Rendon] We do not have any fixed estimate, but we hope that  10 or 15 new companies come to the country.    [Arizmendi] Dr. Rendon, After this initial process that  covers the three big regions we just mentioned -- the Pie de  Monte of Los Llanos, Magdalena's Valle Superior, and Tupumayo --  will information be prepared on other regions of the country for  similar exploration activities?    [Rendon] This year we will work on this process only,  basically. We are going to wait for results. Possibly next  year we will work on a new bid.    [Arizmendi] Current contract conditions are attractive  enough  to compete with nations like China and Russia?    [Rendon] These countries we have mentioned, plus Argentina,  Peru, and others, are working on this under very special  conditions because previously they had not considered foreign  investment to develop the oil industry. The state was doing  that. Now they have come to the foreign investment arena in a  very hearty way. Their conditions are special, and it will be  difficult for Colombia to match them. We have produced  conditions we think are attractive. They are based on the  country's economic stability and on the respect we always show  to companies, plus the fact that this country is attractive  because of the Cusiana oil breakthrough which we think will be  successful.    [Arizmendi] Much has been said about Cusiana and (Cucuagua).  The country has to start thinking about what will happen after  the year 2000. Exploration activities have dropped, probably  because of high exploration and exploitation costs and because  we are not being sufficiently competitive with other countries  such as China and Russia, as you have noted. What other factors  could exist with regard to Colombia's loss of competitive clout  with foreign investors?    [Rendon] Companies go to countries that offer revenue  possibilities and respect for the rules of the game. These are  two factors on which we want to make emphasis. We have also  changed our attitude, from one that consisted of passively  waiting for the companies to come here, to a more businesslike  attitude of preparing reports on Colombia's potential to present  them at formal bidding sessions, like the ones we have prepared.  We will elect the winner after a public bidding that will  consider investment factors [words indistinct] in the country.    [Arizmendi] Will this international bidding include the  potential oil zones of Medina and Cundinamarca?    [Rendon] No. Those are reserve areas that have a high  potential and that ECOPETROL maintains for itself to develop in  the future. This is an area near Cusiana. We are looking for  ways of working on those fields by somehow forming an  association with a company willing to share risks and manage  investments. Oil wells there will cost $30 million each. That  is a very complex area. The budget for that operation could be  a bit difficult.    [Arizmendi] If foreign investment is necessary, why have we  renounced the support of Shell in Huila Department, as it has  just happened?    [Rendon] This is a legal matter more than anything else.  What happens with this company is that there is this contract,  signed over 30 years ago. It is based on outdated  circumstances, when the state [words indistinct] intervention.  Later Colombia went modern, and now foreigners and ECOPETROL  are partners and manage things jointly. After 30 years the  contract is over, and there has been a legal ruling. Shell  believes it can extend the contract. The State Council has said  no. In view of this, the government has decided that it cannot  extend the contract. It is not that we want them to leave.  Shell is one of the most important companies in the world. We  would like them to be in Colombia, with an even larger presence.  I hope we can understand each other. This is not a matter of  attitudes or of lack of compliance, but a legal matter.     "

Background        The adoption of the State Underground Petroleum Environmental   Response (SUPER) Act of 1986 set standard procedures for the State   of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and   their Division of Waste Management's Bureau of Waste Cleanup to   regulate during cleanup processes undertaken at all petroleum   contamination sites. The SUPER Act was amended on   February 20, 1990, and is currently referred to as Chapter 17770,   Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria.     Chapter 17770 gives the FDEP authority over cleanup operations   for areas which have been contaminated by fuels from petroleum   storage systems. Chapter 17770 also provides guidance for   permittees in preparing initial remedial actions (IRA's),   contamination assessment reports (CAR's), and remedial action   plans (RAP's) while assessing and delineating areas where   suspected petroleum contamination has occurred. In order to   facilitate the authorization process for the potentially large   number of permittees who would be required to discharge treated   groundwater to surface waters of Florida, the FDEP requested that   an NPDES general permit be issued to cover these facilities in   Florida. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after   proposing a draft permit on August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), issued   a final NPDES general permit on July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), to   cover the facilities and similar types of discharges associated   with them. This NPDES General Permit was modified on   August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), to address general dewatering for   uncontaminated discharges of produced groundwater and short term   discharges from facilities with treated groundwater. This   modification also changed the number of the permit from FLG040001 to FLG830000.     As of June, 1994, EPA has authorized over 350 facilities to   discharge under the general permit, and the FDEP estimates that   there are over 20,000 facilities that have reported suspected   petroleum leaks throughout the State of Florida. The current   permit FLG83000 expired on July 16, 1994, and numerous   facilities are either discharging under this permit or   submitting Notices of Intent for coverage under this general   permit. Therefore, EPA Region IV is proposing to reissue the   NPDES General Permit No. FLG830000 to facilities in the State of   Florida to assist in permitting these types of activities. The   requirements for those facilities that were covered by the   current NPDES General Permit before July 16, 1994, will be   continued in force until reissuance of this general permit   occurs. However, once reissuance occurs, all facilities   covered by this permit will be required to submit a NOI   requesting continued coverage under the reissued general permit   within sixty (60) days after reissuance of the general permit.   Permittees submitting NOI's after July 17, 1994, will not be   provided with a notification of coverage under the general   permit. These facilities will not be allowed to discharge until   the date which the reissued NPDES General Permit, FLG830000,   becomes effective, or until an individual permit is issued to   the facility.

Background        The adoption of the State Underground Petroleum Environmental   Response (SUPER) Act of 1986 set standard procedures for the State   of Florida's Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and   their Division of Waste Management's Bureau of Waste Cleanup to   regulate during cleanup processes undertaken at all petroleum   contamination sites. The SUPER Act was amended on   February 20, 1990, and is currently referred to as Chapter 17770,   Petroleum Contamination Cleanup Criteria.     Chapter 17770 gives the FDEP authority over cleanup operations   for areas which have been contaminated by fuels from petroleum   storage systems. Chapter 17770 also provides guidance for   permittees in preparing initial remedial actions (IRA's),   contamination assessment reports (CAR's), and remedial action   plans (RAP's) while assessing and delineating areas where   suspected petroleum contamination has occurred. In order to   facilitate the authorization process for the potentially large   number of permittees who would be required to discharge treated   groundwater to surface waters of Florida, the FDEP requested that   an NPDES general permit be issued to cover these facilities in   Florida. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), after   proposing a draft permit on August 25, 1988 (53 FR 32442), issued   a final NPDES general permit on July 17, 1989 (54 FR 29986), to   cover the facilities and similar types of discharges associated   with them. This NPDES General Permit was modified on   August 29, 1991 (56 FR 42736), to address general dewatering for   uncontaminated discharges of produced groundwater and short term   discharges from facilities with treated groundwater. This   modification also changed the number of the permit from FLG040001 to FLG830000.

The well, which is operated by Anadarko of the US, Lasmo's partner in the venture along with Maersk of Denmark, was tested at 4,900 barrels of oil a day and 6.3m cu ft of natural gas. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, said the partners were considering an early appraisal of the find. 'The prospects for a commercial discovery are quite good,' he said. Last year Lasmo and its partners announced an oil and gas find south of the latest discovery. Two more exploration wells are to be drilled in the area, which is in a relatively remote area south-east of the town of Hassi Messaoud. The discovery is about 50km from the nearest pipeline. Oil operations in the region have so far been untouched by the political violence directed against foreigners in Algiers, although American drilling crews are flown to the site directly from Texas.

0,FT911-3891 ,"FT911-3891 _AN-BDWB7ABLFT 910423   FT  23 APR 91 / Farm deal upsets Falklanders: Is the unloved FIC being paid too much? John Barham reports      By JOHN BARHAM   WHEN the Falkland Islands government announced on April 6 that it planned to buy out the last big absentee landowner left on the islands, it probably expected the deal to be received as a triumph of local power over the unloved Falkland Islands Company (FIC). However, opposition to the sale quickly began to grow as purchase terms for the four FIC farms emerged. Less than a week after the announcement, a straw poll by the local radio station found that 36 of the 50 people questioned rejected the deal. The government has agreed to pay Pounds 4.85m for the farms, which cover 974,000 acres of prime land in the southern half of East Falkland. Other payments raise the net price to Pounds 5m, or 13 per cent of government revenues. Most critics focus on the price FIC won for the farms. Mr Bill Luxton, a councillor who bitterly opposes the acquisition, said: 'It's not the concept that is wrong. I'm all for getting the land out of the hands of FIC.' But he argues that the farms and their 200,000 sheep have been grossly overvalued, claiming that the Falklands have handed Anglo United, FIC's troubled parent company, a Pounds 3m 'donation'. Mr Gerard Robson, one of the councillors who negotiated with Anglo, conceded that 'with the present state of wool prices you can't argue that this is a brilliant deal.' The farms' only significant product is wool. Wool prices have crashed to a 50-year low and no farmer is making money. So the Falklands should have received a discount from FIC instead of paying a premium. However, FIC says it had another potential buyer who had offered as much as Pounds 6m for the farms. Officials admit that covering losses at the farms, which produced 29 per cent of last year's wool output of 2,591 tonnes, will raise the acquisition price to Pounds 8m over the next three years. Mr Derek Howatt, chief financial officer, says the purchase may push the government into an operating deficit this year. Still, the legislative council is unlikely to reject the sale. Mr Robson, like most councillors, says it is worth paying a premium to wrest control of the islands' economy from FIC, which, established by royal charter in 1852, wielded almost feudal powers in the Falklands until the 1970s. Naturally, many people are questioning the wisdom of making the government a big landowner at a time when state economic intervention is being rolled back all over the world. However, Mr Ronald Sampson, the government chief executive, says: 'We will take a very hard commercial line in running the business. But we will not announce redundancies in the medium term. If (the farms) have no long term future they will be allowed to go to the wall.' The government can also be criticised for failing to loosen FIC's grip over the islands' economy. Its shipping, retail and service operations remain intact. These sectors are probably the most lucrative part of FIC's operation. Although Anglo United refused a government offer to buy FIC outright, it decided to give the government 'for no consideration' a half-share in its subsidiary Darwin Shipping. Darwin is a charter company that handles nearly all the islands' foreign trade. By making the government a partner, FIC probably expects it will be less anxious to break its oligopoly. Strangely, the sale has highlighted the islanders' lack of self-confidence. The Falklands remain very much a colony with appointed officials such as Mr Sampson running local government. All big decisions must first be approved in London, sometimes at cabinet level. British officials say in private that the islanders often fail to grasp complex issues, such as the land deal, fully. For their part, islanders fear that the British government subordinates their interests to its own political aims. Conspiracy theorists suspect that obscure geopolitical or vested interests were the 'real' reason behind the land sale. They say the government was suspiciously quick to accept a sale that may not be in the islands' best interests. The Falklands have grown rich quickly through the sale of fishing licences. This year licences will raise Pounds 23.7m for the treasury. The government had earlier convinced the islanders to save as much of the windfall as possible. But now it has agreed to a deal that will cost this year's budget surplus. Mr Ray Evans, a farmer, says: 'If they could only give a solid reason for paying such a high price, it would calm a lot of people.' But Mr Rodney Lee, once a farm hand and now the owner of a successful sheep farm, summarises the islanders' dilemma: 'I've done a lot of bowing and scraping in my time. We have been dictated to all our lives. All that ended after the (1982 Argentine) invasion. But we don't have many local people who are qualified to take complex decisions.'

This week one of the largest companies in the sector, Lasmo, announced a deeply discounted Pounds 219m rights issue to shore up a balance sheet ravaged by a Pounds 794m debt. Management said strong operating cash flows have been undermined by the steep fall in oil prices over the past year, to current average levels Dollars 13-Dollars 14 a barrel for the benchmark Brent Blend. Price weakness called into question the company's ability to carry out its ambitious plans to cut its high-cost production base by developing low-cost oil and gas reserves. Analysts have long considered Lasmo the company in the exploration / production sector most vulnerable to weak oil prices. Its agony as oil prices plumeted over the past year has been marked by a trail of casualties: in early 1993 it dropped Chris Greentree as chief executive in favour of Joe Darby. Changes have also been made to its finance director and non-executive chairman. In addition its shares were among the worst performers in 1993 and it passed its final dividend last month. Investors may therefore be wondering whether Lasmo's plight is unique, or a sign that similar troubles might spread to other companies in the sector. After all, as the chart shows, the performance of the exploration and production sector has been relatively resilient in recent months in spite of oil prices falling to five-year lows. Furthermore, asset values in the sector do not fully reflect oil prices at recent lows. Analysts have mixed views on the sector, but most agree that Lasmo's case is unique in at least one crucial sense; its investment cycle and therefore its debt load is seriously out of synch with the oil price. The company is entering a two-year period of large-scale development commitments for schemes such as Liverpool Bay, a big natural gas project which will generate significant cash after 1996. It already had financing for Liverpool Bay and other projects, but at current prices Lasmo's high-cost production profile makes the company unprofitable. Analysts say a successful rights issue will give Lasmo the breathing space it needs over the next two years. Other exploration companies have also seen their cash flow suffer because of weak oil prices. But most, including Enterprise, the biggest independent explorer, find themselves at more comfortable points in the capital investment cycle. Does the sector deserve its relatively high valuation given the continuing uncertainty over oil price? Brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull think not. In a recount report they argue that investors are perpetually over-optimistic about oil price trends: 'Equity investors . . . have been only too keen to pay over the odds in order to acquire oil and gas reserves via the stock market at prices which the oil and gas industry itself has not been prepared to pay.' The brokers add that the 'anomaly between stockmarket versus industry reserve valuation obviously creates good opportunities for energy companies to raise finance in the equity markets.' Other analysts disagree. They point to recent asset sales in the North Sea which valued reserves at Dollars 15-Dollars 17 a barrel, proof they say, that the industry believes current prices are not a realistic long-term prospect. But for private investors the attractiveness of a flutter on the sector still rests on whether they think the oil price will increase, and whether they feel lucky.   Companies:-  Lasmo.

The state company's own operator, Nigerian Petroleum Development Company has found nine hydrocarbons levels at the Oziengbe south field, five km from Koko in Delta state, in one of the few onshore concessions that is 100 per cent owned by NPDC. The find takes NPDC's proven reserves to 169m barrels. The company has one small oil field in production at Apura, a joint venture with British Gas, but the rest of Nigeria's 1.8m barrels daily quota is produced by NNPC's minority joint venture partners who are all international oil companies, except Dubri Oil, the only indigenous private sector producer in Africa.

The agreement covers exports of 250,000 tonnes of hake, cod and Illex squid. The new agreement is considered an advance on similar accords signed between Brussels and third countries because it increases the involvement of local companies. Owners of EC vessels must form joint ventures with Argentine companies. This is intended to modernise the Argentine fishing fleet, by allowing local companies to replace their ageing ships with more modern European ones. Catches are not intended to increase, because EC ships must be either equal in capacity or smaller than the Argentine ships they are replacing. However, the local industry fears that the newer European ships will increase fishing pressure on hake - already close to maximum levels. Overfishing would not only threaten stocks but erode prices and thus offset the benefit of lower tariffs. Last year Argentina's fish catch rose 10 per cent to a record 692,000 tonnes. The industry suspects that the agreement will benefit the Spain - which has a large number of idle fishing ships - more than Argentina. Mr Mario Olaciregui, president of Harengus, Argentina's largest fishing company, said: 'There is more optimism about the accord in Vigo than there is here'. However, he recognised that the agreement will modernise Argentina's fishing fleet and provide funds for scientific research. The government also says that the agreement advances its claims to the Falkland Islands. Mr Guido di Tella, foreign minister, the agreement will 'make (the islanders) realise that we have very important friends'. However, the EC excluded the Falklands' 150-mile fishing zone from the agreement and established a 30,000-tonne limit for catches of the Illex squid - the Falklands' most lucrative species. Last December, Argentina began selling low-priced fish licences aimed in part at undercutting those sold by the Falklands, thus reducing a key source of revenue for the islands. Britain and Argentina are to hold new fishery talks in Buenos Aires in December.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.   Industries:-  P0912 Finfish.   Types:-  RES  Natural resources.

The market quickly made up its mind that the biggest winner from the Budget moves was British Petroleum, whose shares followed Tuesday's 9 gain with a further rise of 9 1/2 to 304 1/2 p, the stock's highest closing level since November 1991. Turnover was a hefty 22m shares. Shell Transport, however, settled 2 off at 578p. Enterprise Oil jumped 13 to 505p and Lasmo edged forward 3 to 189p. One sector specialist said: 'The simple conclusion has to be that the moves favour the big companies at the expense of the so-called tiddlers; the companies paying high levels of petroleum revenue tax, for example BP and Enterprise Oil, as well as Lasmo, are the major beneficiaries. The small companies who have organised their assets in a tax efficient manner are having the rug pulled from beneath them.' The smaller stocks edged higher at the outset but quickly came under severe pressure. Clyde Petroleum settled 7 1/2 down at 52 1/2 p, Goal dropped 4 1/2 to 61p and Aran dipped 2 1/4 to 25 1/4 p.

The postponement of drilling in the Gulf of Alaska and Cook Inlet, which were  tainted by oil from the catastrophic spill, marks the Bush Administration's  first significant decision on offshore drilling since the Exxon Valdez hit a  reef nearly two months ago.    The plan, approved late Tuesday by Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan Jr.,  imposes a one-year delay on the scheduled lease of a vast 138-million-acre  package, postponing final action until August, 1991, to provide time for  scientists to gather more information about the effects of the oil spill on the  pristine marine environment.    A senior aide to Lujan emphasized that the decision on the Cook Inlet site ""in  no way diminishes"" the Administration's commitment to a separate plan for oil  exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That proposal has been the  target of criticism from environmentalists since the Alaska spill.      'Much to Learn'    But the aide, Steve Goldstein, said Lujan had decided that it ""would not be  prudent to go forward with the new lease sale immediately after a major  accident. It is quite clear that we have much to learn from what happened.    ""This should not be read as a cancellation,"" Goldstein said. ""This is a  postponement to gather information while new facts are coming to light.""    The surprise deferral of the Cook Inlet sale, from which the government had  expected to earn $10 million next year, sends a further signal of the  Administration's willingness to reconsider some long-term drilling plans  established by the Interior Department under former President Ronald Reagan.    Among the proposed sales now being re-evaluated are vast areas off the coast of  Southern California and Northern California, which are being reviewed by a  presidential task force headed by Lujan.    ""This is a very cautious Administration when it comes to offshore drilling,""  one Republican official said, ""and this is just a further indication of that.""    However, Administration officials have given no indication that drilling in  those regions would be canceled altogether. And they have expressed a  determination to proceed with other oil exploration in the Alaskan wildlife  refuge and in offshore tracts where drilling rights already have been leased to  oil companies.    Plans for oil exploration in one such already-leased area, Alaska's Bristol  Bay, have been the principal target of drilling opponents since the Valdez  spill. Administration officials said Tuesday that those plans would not be  affected by the decision on Cook Inlet, because Bristol Bay was not affected by  the spill.    Critics of offshore drilling praised the Administration action as a welcome  step. But many argued that the disastrous consequences of the spill already  have made cancellation of the new drilling plans imperative.    ""This is the least they can do,"" said Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), warning  that the Administration and the oil industry might seek to resume ""business as  usual once the political heat dies down.""    Another drilling critic, Natural Resources Defense Council attorney Lisa Speer,  said that she could not understand why the Interior Department did not act to  postpone other Alaska leases as well until the environmental damage of the  spill can be determined.    ""We've already seen the terrible damage that can be wrought by oil in Alaskan  environments,"" Speer said.    While the Cook Inlet lease sale now has been postponed until at least a year  from its scheduled date of August, 1990, the current Interior Department  schedule calls for at least five other new lease sales to take place next year.    They include two sales off Alaska, two in the Gulf of Mexico and one off North  Carolina and other Mid-Atlantic states. In addition, the lease sales off  Northern and Southern California could proceed if authorized by the  presidential task force.

Ms Albina Africano, the country's energy minister, said western oil companies were preparing to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) in oil exploration. The country was plunged back into civil war after election results which returned President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and his MPLA government to power were rejected by the rebel movement Unita. In May Unita captured the oil town of Soyo where they destroyed oil storage facilities and halted onshore oil production. 'They've completely destroyed Soyo, everything has been blown up,' Ms Africano said. Onshore oil output of 30,000 barrels a day (b/d) has been stopped since January and some offshore production has been suspended because of the destruction of Soyo's storage terminal. Ms Africano in London for meetings with the British government in an effort to persuade ministers to put pressure on Unita to return to the negotiating table, said 60,000 b/d of offshore output had been halted, but she was confident that this could be resumed within months, if storage facilities offshore could be expanded. Angola is producing 453,000 b/d compared with capacity production of 550,000 b/d. The rebels have shot at the oil platforms 70km offshore, but Ms Africano said the western oil companies have been given military guarantees they will be protected as effectively as possible. 'The situation is more stable than it appears, the future investment plans of the oil companies show they still have confidence in the country,' she said. Chevron, Angola's largest operator is investing Dollars 500m in development of oilfields in Cabinda, and Elf, the French energy company, plans to put Dollars 1bn into expanding its own production. Ms Africano said the government hoped to sign a contract by September, giving Exxon, the US oil major, and British Petroleum deep-water exploration acreage. Exxon will be the operator on the 4,500-square km block with BP holding 40 per cent of the interest and Agip, Italy's resources company, having a minority interest. Royal Dutch/Shell has recently been awarded another deep water block and Ms Africano said a group of companies led by Chevron and including Total and Agip would be awarded another deep-water block in August. The Angolan government is looking for the country's oil production to increase to 690,000 b/d by 1997, excluding the new deep-water blocks.   Countries:-  AOZ  Angola, Africa.

The fishing business here for South Korean companies, which  goes back to the late 1970s when Hansong Enterprise Co. first  took to the water, witnessed its worst group seizure ever.    All four vessels are operated by locally incorporated South  Korean companies -- two by Tae Ung Deep Sea Fisheries Co., one  by Tongwon Industries Co. And the last by Chewon Co. These  locally incorporated firms own a total of 34 vessels, all flying  Argentinian flags and obligated to follow local regulations,  prompting South Korean officials to question why they were  seized by Argentine authorities.    The captured boats were operating about 300 miles north of  the Falkland Islands. The fishermen say they were taken  illegally, insisting they were outside Argentina's territorial  waters. Local authorities, however, say the boats were inside  the 200-mile territorial limit, fishing 195 to 197 miles off the  coast.    Bickering over whether a vessel is operating inside or  outside the boundary is common: Most boats fishing illegally  inside Argentine territorial waters speed beyond the boundary  when chased by maritime authorities and claim they were fishing  at the point of capture. But officials here say this time, the  maritime police started from outside the boundary and gradually  worked to the inside, discrediting the South Koreans' claims.    Argentina's federal courts will have to decide who is right,  and most observers say South Korea is aboard a sinking ship.  History shows that virtually no vessels accused of illegal  fishing were set free without paying at least a minimal fine.  The federal courts usually take at least three months to  investigate before setting a fine. Depending on whether the  courts see the violation as premeditated or unplanned, the fine  could range from 490,000 U.S. dollars to as high as 1 million  dollars. Because four boats were caught at once, the courts are  most likely to view it as a planned violation, the officials say.    Over 500 boats operate in the teeming waters off Argentina  in  March and April including 50 Russian and 150 South Korean  vessels, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese boats and those  locally incorporated.    The officials say Argentina's fierce reaction to boundary  violations is understandable given that so many foreign vessels  cross the line to net squid and shrimp whenever the authorities'  watchful eye is averted.

As of 31 December, the Bank of Mexico's international  reserves were $24.537 billion, a $6-billion increase at the  close of 1992. These figures appear in the Bank of Mexico's 1993  annual report, 172 pages of Mexico's primary economic indicators.    The Bank of Mexico cites economic trends following  noteworthy  achievements in Mexican economic development, like significant  progress in structural changes and the control of inflation,  which was reduced one digit to 8 percent, and increased work  productivity and in midlevel salaries. Nevertheless, an economic  slowdown may result from uncertainty regarding NAFTA  ratification. Other factors that discouraged private spending in  investment as well as consumption negatively impacted on  employment.    The gross domestic product grew 4 percent in 1993 and the  surplus in the balance of payments was higher than in 1992,  accompanied by a high level of enthusiasm in nonpetroleum  exports and lower deficits in the trade balance and the current  account. The trade balance deficit was $13.81 billion, a  $2.5-billion reduction compared to last year's deficit. Crude  exports were reduced while petroleum byproducts increased. The  average price of Mexican petroleum on the international market  went down from $14.83 to $13.20 per barrel. In its 1993 report,  the Bank of Mexico forecasts an upturn in the Mexican economy  for 1994, with benefits for all the nation's sectors.     "
0,FT932-11842 ,"FT932-11842 _AN-DD3B1AG2FT 930430   FT  30 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Albania offers onshore exploration blocks      By KERIN HOPE      TIRANA   ALBANIA IS extending its oil and natural gas exploration programme to onshore areas, offering concessions in six blocks covering 700 square km along the country's Adriatic coastline. In a separate project, international oil companies are being invited to submit bids for a Dollars 70m recovery enhancement programme at existing oilfields in southern Albania. The offers mark a reversal of previous Albanian policy on oil exploration, which restricted foreign companies to offshore drilling. The government is now trying to attract large-scale investment from abroad to help modernise the country's crumbling industrial base. Following completion of seismic testing last year, five international oil companies are due to start offshore drilling in the Adriatic this summer. However, there have been considerable administrative delays caused by uncertainty over Albania's legal framework for investment. Mr Albert Isai of Albpetrol, the state oil company, said that the tender offer for onshore concessions was prepared in partnership with Western Geophysical, the US-based surveying company, which re-processed data provided by Albanian geologists. He said seven international companies had so far shown interest in onshore exploration. Bids are due by June 15. The onshore contracts, expected to have a 25-year duration, foresee a five-year research and exploration period, with on-site training to be provided for Albanian technical staff. Under a production-sharing agreement, capital expenditures would be recovered over five years. Up to 40 per cent of yearly crude oil production would be payable for cost recovery, while profit sharing would be negotiable, Mr Isai said. Natural gas discoveries would remain the property of the Albanian state. The government hopes that Albania will be linked with a planned gas pipeline from Skopje in Macedonia and another under construction in northern Greece. Both would supply Russian natural gas. The recovery enhancement project covers oilfields at Divjaka, Povelca and Ballaj where total production of crude has declined to around 800,000 tonnes a year from more than 2m tonnes a year in the late 1970s. Albpetrol invited bids in the form of joint ventures, production sharing or service contracts, specifying that local staff and services should be used wherever possible. The three-year project would probably involve new drilling 'for exploitation not exploration' and use of new technology, such as steam injection techniques, to increase oil yields, Mr Isai said. 'Production has been steadily declining. We are using antiquated Russian, Chinese and Romanian equipment, and there are no spare parts,' he said. The project also calls for spending Dollars 5m for environmental improvement, mainly on a clean-up of contaminated land and streams around the oilfields. Negotiations are under way with several international companies, including Mol of Hungary, and two US-based companies, Transmark and Anglo-Suisse, with contracts due to be signed this summer, Mr Isai said.

OFFICE      By DONALD WOUTAT, Times Staff Writer      Texaco announced a plan Tuesday to streamline its legendary bureaucracy in the  U.S. Oil Patch and said it would eliminate 12 of 26 layers of operations,  including the Los Angeles office of 135 employes who oversee West Coast oil and  gas exploration and production.    The shuffle is expected to cut significantly into the overall employment of  Texaco U.S.A., the Houston-based domestic operating arm of the company. A  spokesman said much of the job reduction is expected to consist of early  retirement or ""voluntary"" decisions not to accept transfers.    ""We do not expect wholesale layoffs,"" the spokesman said.    Long derided in the oil industry as a company where nobody could make a  decision, Texaco said a major reason for the cutback was to push authority down  ""as close to the wellhead as possible"" and to introduce risk and participative  management to the ranks.    The plan divides its U.S. ""upstream,"" or oil exploration and production,  operations into East and West regions with 12 divisions. They supplant 26  headquarter, division, region and district offices, the company said.    The Los Angeles division office in Universal City oversees exploration and  production from California to Alaska. Its function moves to Denver, and the 135  employes could be retired, laid off or transferred to Denver, Ventura or  Bakersfield, the company said.    Unaffected by Tuesday's restructuring is the ""downstream,"" or refining and  retail end of Texaco's business. In California, that includes about 330  employees in Universal City who will continue to oversee the company's Los  Angeles refinery, West Coast service station network and other facilities.    Named to head the Denver-headquartered Western region was Vice President L.  Paul Teague. His counterpart in New Orleans is Vice President William F.  Wallace III. Both have similar responsibilities already.    Texaco has been trimming its California operations since 1984, when the  company's ill-fated takeover of Getty Oil Co. left it with more than 4,000  employes in the state. It currently has about 3,000.    The domestic reshuffling is the latest implementation of Texaco's companywide  restructuring that stemmed from its bankruptcy in the aftermath of the Getty  deal. The bankruptcy resulted from a $10.3-billion jury verdict that Texaco had  improperly interfered with a Getty takeover by rival Pennzoil.    Texaco is openly trying to reverse a highly centralized management style that  was said to stifle employees and make it an unpopular and distrusted company  within the industry. Oilmen accustomed to making deals on a handshake say  Texaco management would routinely overrule such informal transactions.    ""The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead as possible,  so that each division operates as would a successful independent company,  making its own operating decisions with minimum review at other management  levels while being accountable for its own performance,"" said Texaco U.S.A.  President James L. Dunlap.    In a statement, Dunlap said the restructuring is to be completed by the end of  the year. He said ""some relocation and reduction of personnel is expected, but  the final effect on employment cannot yet be determined.""

The shuffle is expected to cut significantly into the overall employment of  Texaco U.S.A., the Houston-based domestic operating arm of the company. A  spokesman said much of the job reduction is expected to consist of early  retirement or ""voluntary"" decisions not to accept transfers.    ""We do not expect wholesale layoffs,"" the spokesman said.    Long derided in the oil industry as a company where nobody could make a  decision, Texaco said a major reason for the cutback was to push authority down  ""as close to the wellhead as possible"" and to introduce risk and participative  management to the ranks.    The plan divides its U.S. ""upstream,"" or oil exploration and production,  operations into East and West regions with 12 divisions. They supplant 26  headquarter, division, region and district offices, the company said.    The Los Angeles division office in Universal City oversees exploration and  production from California to Alaska. Its function moves to Denver, and the 135  employes could be retired, laid off or transferred to Denver, Ventura or  Bakersfield, the company said.    Unaffected by Tuesday's restructuring is the ""downstream,"" or refining and  retail end of Texaco's business. In California, that includes about 330  employees in Universal City who will continue to oversee the company's Los  Angeles refinery, West Coast service station network and other facilities.    Named to head the Denver-headquartered Western region was Vice President L.  Paul Teague. His counterpart in New Orleans is Vice President William F.  Wallace III. Both have similar responsibilities already.    Texaco has been trimming its California operations since 1984, when the  company's ill-fated takeover of Getty Oil Co. left it with more than 4,000  employes in the state. It currently has about 3,000.    The domestic reshuffling is the latest implementation of Texaco's companywide  restructuring that stemmed from its bankruptcy in the aftermath of the Getty  deal. The bankruptcy resulted from a $10.3-billion jury verdict that Texaco had  improperly interfered with a Getty takeover by rival Pennzoil.    Texaco is openly trying to reverse a highly centralized management style that  was said to stifle employees and make it an unpopular and distrusted company  within the industry. Oilmen accustomed to making deals on a handshake say  Texaco management would routinely overrule such informal transactions.    ""The idea is to move the decision point as close to the wellhead as possible,  so that each division operates as would a successful independent company,  making its own operating decisions with minimum review at other management  levels while being accountable for its own performance,"" said Texaco U.S.A.  President James L. Dunlap.    In a statement, Dunlap said the restructuring is to be completed by the end of  the year. He said ""some relocation and reduction of personnel is expected, but  the final effect on employment cannot yet be determined.""      TEXACO INC; CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING; BUREAUCRACY    "

The turnround, which compared with a loss of Pounds 4.8m last time, was struck on sales 86 per cent higher at Pounds 5.4m. The improvement was largely due to the acquisition of producing assets from Monument Oil  Gas in the second half. Brabant said it had increased average net oil production during the year by 52 per cent to 1,786 barrels per day. The Monument acquisition had left it well placed to fund future exploration, the company said. Brabant could 'rely on internally generated funds to support its exploration and development programme for the foreseeable future'. Mr Malcolm Butler, managing director, said the group could now begin exploring its own prospects, as opposed to ones dictated by obligations such as those arising through acquisitions. A substantial drilling programme, to be funded through cash flow, was planned for 1994. It was unlikely that the company would seek investment from shareholders for this programme. Any payment of a dividend would depend on exploration success - as in previous years there is again no pay-out.   Companies:-  Brabant Resources.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

It is reported that the source is  emitting 3,300 æR/h.    It is not clear how it appeared there since after the  transfer the territory was carefully examined by experts. Much  has been written about the harm inflicted to Lithuania by the  former Soviet Army, and each case of environmental damage is  carefully documented. Lithuanian experts have long suspected  that radioactive substances may remain in the territory of  former military units, but even in the camps which house missile  divisions, nothing has been found thus far. The problem mostly  amounted to soil contamination with petroleum products. Here,  the military units indeed ``worked hard.'' In some places, the  soil was penetrated so deep that cleanup calls for enormous hard  currency outlays. A lot of petroleum products penetrated the  soil even in the territory of the Severnyy camp. This was  established by environmental experts. Yet this contamination did  not pose a serious problem for the future of this territory. The  municipal administration has decided to set up the largest  business center in the region on this spot with offices, hotels,  and banks.    I do not think that the unpleasant finding will destroy  these  cheerful prospects.      "

Mr Hurd was expected to be briefed by the Chilean Foreign Ministry on the slow progress of the murder inquiry. So far, the inquiry has failed to shed any light on the assassination, which was made to look like suicide. Mr Moyle, the 28-year-old editor of Defence Helicopter World, was murdered in the Carrera Hotel in Santiago in March 1990 while covering an airshow. British interest in Mr Moyle's fate was revived following the collapse of the Matrix Churchill trial, where it was shown that UK government ministers sanctioned the sale of military technology to Iraq via a Chilean middle-man, Mr Carlos Cardoen. Attempts to link Mr Cardoen to Moyle's assassination collapsed last week during an identification parade in which a Carrera Hotel chambermaid failed to recognise a Cardoen employee she thought she had seen talking to Mr Moyle on the eve of his death. Mr Cardoen has always denied any link to the murder. Mr Hurd's two-day visit to Chile is also expected to be taken up with trade and investment talks, and the impact of the European Community single market on Chilean exports. The UK is Chile's biggest export market in Europe, with sales of some Pounds 200m last year, against imports of some Pounds 110m. British multinationals also have a strong presence in the Chilean mining, cement, tobacco and food industries, with Pounds 2bn of investments, but British diplomats in Santiago believe UK exporters are not taking full advantage of Chile's booming economy, which grew 9.7 per cent last year. Mr Hurd's five-day visit to Argentina was described by both sides as a success, even though they made no progress over the Falklands, the only issue that divides them. Mr Hurd said his trip proved 'that it is possible to come to Argentina and not be bombarded all the time by the sovereignty dispute'. British officials were pleasantly surprised that demonstrators did not meet them on their arrival in Buenos Aires on Wednesday. One of Argentina's top Falkland negotiators said Mr Hurd's visit, the first by a cabinet minister since the 1982 Falklands conflict, meant 'we are on our way to a broader, richer relationship in which the islands are only a part of the relationship, not the only issue'.

Schroders, Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities were paid about two-thirds of the total Pounds 24m in bid costs, said Mr Joe Darby, chief executive. The rest went in charges such as legal fees. The failed bid has cost shareholders in the two companies almost Pounds 50m. Enterprise disclosed last week that its costs, including an Pounds 18.3m writedown on the value of its 10 per cent stake in Lasmo, would come to Pounds 24m. Lasmo's comments came as it announced first-half net losses of Pounds 22m, against a Pounds 22m profit last time. While the bid costs appeared to push the company into the red, these were more than offset by a Pounds 36m gain on asset disposals. Turnover fell from Pounds 309m to Pounds 306m, partly due to the lower oil price. The results were largely in line with analysts' expectations. Yet the market was impressed with the cost-cutting achieved in the period. Operating costs per barrel fell by 15 per cent to Pounds 3.70. Mr Darby said he expected average costs for the year to fall to between Pounds 3.50 and Pounds 3.55 per barrel. By 1997, unit operating costs would be 25 per cent below 1993 levels. Lasmo now had the financial strength to pursue exploration opportunities and to develop its existing reserves, he said. The company aimed to produce about 210,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day by 1996, against the current 167,000. Gearing fell from 69 per cent to 37 per cent in the first half, largely due to a Pounds 219m rights issue in the spring. Mr Darby estimated that annual spending on exploration would average some Pounds 50m over the next three years. Of the 14 wells drilled in the first half, eight were successful and included two substantial finds in Algeria. Development expenditure was static at about Pounds 117m (Pounds 119m). There was no interim dividend (1.3p). The loss per share was 2.6p (2.8p profit). COMMENT Lasmo yesterday painted a picture of a company which was confident in its strategy and future. The City was inclined to agree. However, even after all the surgery, the company's finding costs will still only be on a par with its rivals. This highlights a fundamental problem for exploration companies, such as Lasmo and Enterprise, which have much higher finding costs than the majors. After losses this year, Lasmo should be just back in profit in 1995, assuming oil prices of Dollars 18. In 1996, a rising production and earnings profile should lead to substantially improved profits. The most tempting aspect for some investors, however, might be the very real prospect of a foreign income dividend this year.   Companies:-  Lasmo.     Schroders.

But an event that took place off the US west coast 25 years ago has a particular relevance to residents of environmentally sensitive seaside areas in the UK such as Christchurch. In 1969, a blow-out at an offshore production platform left 30 miles of beach near Santa Barbara, one of southern California's main tourist destinations, covered in oil pollution. The impact of the spill on public opinion was such that development of the state's rich offshore oilfields was curtailed for decades, while the political fallout from it is felt even now. Hazel O'Leary, US energy secretary, recently confirmed that residents of coastal states still have a virtual veto over new offshore oil developments. The Santa Barbara spill has also had a lasting effect on how the international oil industry operates in sensitive coastal areas, including those in the UK. Over the next few years, oil companies plan to increase inshore exploration drilling, encouraged by coastal discoveries such as the Wytch Farm oilfield near Poole in Dorset and the Liverpool Bay natural gas field. In last year's 14th licensing round, the government included a large number of inshore blocks, many of which are located near well-known coastal beauty spots, important fishing or breeding grounds, or in areas which support endangered species. But the special requirements of operating inshore often conflict with established ways of working in the North Sea, according to Geoff Nicholson, manager of near-shore exploration projects for Elf Enterprise, a joint venture between Elf Aquitaine of France and Enterprise Oil, the biggest UK independent. It has been active in Poole Bay on the south coast and is about to begin exploration in the Irish Sea, 15 miles off Anglesey. 'The industry likes to move fast and with few constraints,' he says. In the North Sea, the sudden availability of a drilling rig at an attractive rate can cause companies to alter plans overnight. In the exploration phase, oil companies also tend to operate at an arm's length through specialist contractors. 'But you can't operate like that inshore,' says Nicholson. 'Long periods of consultation with local governments and community groups are necessary before actual operations, such as seismic surveys or drilling, can begin.' Senior Elf executives say it is as important to understand the 'geo-political aspects' of England's south coast as it is of south Yemen or the other remote locations in which the oil industry operates. Elf's emphasis on the careful identification and cultivation of community groups is no accident. In 1992, its initial exploration efforts in Poole Bay ended in angry confrontations at sea between seismic survey ships and local fishermen. The company had reached an early agreement on compensating those who fished for crab and lobster. But it struggled to reach an understanding with the trawlermen. 'We first had to define who was a fisherman,' says Nicholson. 'In the winter someone might be a painter and decorator, but in summer they might do a little fishing.' In addition, some political pressure groups saw the chance to use Elf's dispute with the fishermen to their own advantage. Elf eventually had to pay out more than Pounds 1m in compensation to the fishermen. 'We had to solve the dispute on the run and in a very unsatisfactory way,' concedes Nicholson. The problems of dealing with 10 different fishing associations persuaded the company to set up and fund a forum in which to channel problems. It also provides a mechanism for arbitration. The fragmented nature of the fishing industry made it the most difficult for Elf to deal with. But many other groups also saw the company as a threat. Some were concerned that even the hint of an oil spill offshore in summer could do long-lasting damage to the area's important tourist industry. Others simply did not want oil companies operating in their back yard. 'I don't care if you drink your bloody oil,' was the attitude of one resident at a public meeting. Late last year, Elf drilled an exploratory well, the results of which it has yet to divulge. The licence for Poole Bay was issued in an earlier round, but Elf observed many of the environmental conditions set by the government for 14th round licences. Seabed studies were carried out both before and after drilling to determine if there was any damage to marine life. A narrower than usual well was specified to cut down on the amount of rock cuttings brought to the surface. Water-based drilling muds were used when possible in preference to oil-based ones to lubricate the drill bit. Rock cuttings brought to the surface were cleaned before being dispersed over a wide area - rather than piled on the sea bottom - to avoid smothering fish feeding grounds. And the normal stand-by safety vessel was augmented by one carrying a chemical dispersant and booms to contain any spills. Local officials say such precautions have made inshore exploration drilling acceptable to the public. But they say the prospect of permanent platforms within sight of land is no more acceptable now than in 1988 when a British Petroleum proposal to build an artificial island off Wytch Farm to tap the offshore extension of the field triggered a storm of protest along the south coast. New technology, in the form of horizontal drilling from a land base to a point more than 5km offshore, solved BP's problem. But technology is unlikely to offer a solution in all cases. At some time in the next few years an inshore discovery could be made that will test whether coastal residents in the UK have a similar power of veto as their counterparts in California.

0,FT942-10037 ,"FT942-10037 _AN-EELCZAE5FT 940512   FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Bigger is not necessarily better - Enterprise's bid for Lasmo      By ROBERT CORZINE and PEGGY HOLLINGER   When Mr Graham Hearne, chief executive of Enterprise Oil, justified his hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo by describing oil exploration as a big boys game which required critical mass, he triggered off a chorus of criticism. Analysts accused him of seeking size for its own sake, and pointed to the many big discoveries made by small oil companies. Many industry executives said what mattered most was the way in which companies handled their existing assets. However Mr Hearne's comments have brought to the surface an issue which bedevils an industry in which corporate minnows co-exist alongside the big integrated majors. 'There is a very great debate on whether size is an important issue,' said Mr David Simon, chief executive of British Petroleum. Mr Hearne said he never intended to convey the impression that Enterprise was interested in size for its own sake. But he stands by the argument that critical mass makes good industrial sense and that Enterprise, the largest UK independent, needs to be of a 'size we feel necessary to deliver shareholder value'. Lasmo's defence document rebutting this argument has to be published by Monday but it is widely expected to be out before the weekend. The size argument has not found many supporters among Mr Hearne's industry colleagues. 'I think that aspect of Enterprise's argument is total rubbish,' said one executive. 'There have always been niches for different sizes of players and different skills.' Many in the industry believe the proposed deal is driven more by financial issues than industrial logic. They point out that neither company operates many of their main projects, so there is little scope for greater production efficiency. The commercial argument, that cash-rich Enterprise is short of medium-term development prospects while cash-strapped Lasmo may not be able to fund all its potential projects, is somewhat stronger, according to analysts. They note that revenues from Lasmo developments such as the Liverpool Bay gas project would smooth out an expected dip in Enterprise's production and cash flow later this decade as output falls from the Nelson and Scott fields. Many industry observers believe, however, that Enterprise's need to keep growing its dividend is one of the most compelling reasons for the deal. Smaller independents are relieved of that pressure. They have always been seen as North Sea-based capital growth stocks, the price of which could soar on the back of just one strike. Enterprise, however, is 'too large to be regarded as an asset play,' said one independent executive. He added that it was judged more on its dividend paying capacity in much the same way as an integrated oil major. In fact, a combined Lasmo and Enterprise would rival in size the exploration and production arms of some of the integrated oil majors but without the benefits of being a diversified group with downstream activities. 'There is a lot of pressure to pay dividends, and investors want it to go up each year,' the head of a rival independent company said. But to carry on paying, companies need to find oil fields, either through exploration or acquisition, or have the support of diversified downstream operations. Some in the industry feel that Mr Hearne has compounded his problems by choosing to focus on upstream exploration and production. 'Most other large companies have some sort of vertical integration so they can ride out the storms of the oil price by making money at the petrol pump,' said the managing director of a UK independent. Some analysts also argue that Enterprise could have realised its upstream ambitions by simply buying packages of assets, thus avoiding a costly takeover battle. Completed asset disposals in the UK North Sea alone have totalled Dollars 1bn since the beginning of 1993, according to analysts at Kleinwort Benson, and brokers say there is no shortage of assets for sale. Buying packages of assets might have been more warmly greeted in the City, but it would also have taken Enterprise much longer to achieve a similar spread of business. In addition Enterprise says the Lasmo portfolio fits particularly well with its own. Many in the industry understand the pressures which have forced the hostile bid. Yet they still question the wisdom of a move which would force a whole new range of problems, such as the fact that big oil companies need to make big discoveries. The chances of making discoveries adequate to replenish reserves fall dramatically as the companies get bigger, as the graph shows. 'Lasmo might make Enterprise a stronger company . . . but it does not answer the fundamental question of what to do afterwards. The challenge to replace such large reserves with reserves of equal quality is an even greater one,' said one sceptical executive. The only way off the dividend treadmill is to shrink the company by selling assets. 'Every oil exploration company has to shrink at times,' says one executive. Companies such as Exxon and BP have succeeded in downsizing, but the task of persuading shareholders that such a move can be in their interests is not easy, he added. 'Investors don't understand downsizing, even though the only time you make money is when you sell.'   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.     Lasmo.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The company, due to address analysts next week, cited delays in the publication of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the future structure of British Gas, a major customer, and lower than expected demand from the water industry. Williams Holdings added 7 at 309p after Strauss Turnbull advised investors to switch out of TI Group, 7 lower at 338p. The leading pharmaceutical issues made a bold attempt to move ahead during the early part of the day, helped by the strong performance of Wall Street overnight, but quickly ran into pockets of resistance as the London market got under way. The two Zeneca stocks, strong performers in London late on Wednesday when the Fleming buy note impacted on the market, initially edged higher before slipping to close marginally easier on the day. The 'old' lost 2 at 621p and the 'new' nil-paid 1 1/2 at 21p. Turnover in the 'old' was 5.2m shares and in the 'new' 8m. The constant takeover speculation in Fisons, which has picked up since the official launch of the company's anti-ashtma drug Tilade earlier this week, drove the stock up to 177p before closing at 175p, up 3 on balance. SmithKline Beecham put on 5 at 451p and Glaxo managed to stay in positive territory, rising marginally to 595p. Another series of excellent results from the utilities ensured renewed strong interest in the sub-sectors. Water stocks were again heavily traded, with the second liners initially taking up the running after being left behind by the FT-SE 100 contituents. Of the smaller stocks, Northumbrian was the best performer, closing 4 harder at 581p. Southern eased 4 to 505p in spite of the 9.2 per cent increase in the dividend total, at the top end of expectations. Towards the close the sector retreated. Severn Trent Water, at 483p, gave up 13 of its recent advance: the preliminary figures, including the 9.3 per cent rise in the dividend, were close to best expectations. North West Water lost 7 to 467p, Anglian 8 to 476p and Thames 10 to 466p. The electricity sector's 'dividend race' hotted up as South Wales Electricity topped East Midland's 14 per cent payout with a 14.9 per cent increase. But profit-taking in the electricity sector kept the lid on the shares, which settled 2 easier at 546p. An early rally ahead of a September dividend was said to be behind the changing fortune of Dalgety, which strengthened 6 to 462p. Bensons Crisps advanced 8 to 76p in anticipation of favourable comment and Booker registered a rise of 13 at 381p on the appointment of a new chief executive. Investor faith continued for Guinness after a presentation in London by LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer with whom Guinness has a 24 per cent cross-shareholding. It moved up 6 to close at 495p in a volume of 3.2m. Bass firmed 2 to 484p but Allied- Lyons slipped 5 to 532p. A heavy two-way business was seen in Burton Group, which edged up  3/4 to 86 3/4 p as 17m shares were traded. In a continued show of confidence following the better than expected interim results, Granada Group added 5 at 420p. Feeling in the market strengthened that Forte may be close to making an acquisitive move for Savoy Hotel, whose 'A' stock climbed 30 to 835p while Forte's share price slipped a penny to 219p. The government's moves to amend the new Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) regime was seen as good news for the smaller exploration companies by the leading broking houses. Mr Simon Flowers, exploration and production analyst at NatWest Securities, said the news was 'particularly bullish for companies planning to spend up to Pounds 10m on exploration over the next two years and which stand to pay PRT in the near term'. NatWest said virtually all smaller explorers will see their net asset values boosted, and mentioned the clearest winners as Aran, Hardy and Goal. The broker added that Lasmo and Enterprise would gain from the changes but that their exploration budgets would be too large for the changes to be material. Other brokers took the view that the changes were moderately positive. Hardy Oil rose 6 to 168p, additionally helped by the results. Aran held at 33p and Goal edged up a penny to 64p.

This is the first acreage promotion held by the CNOOC,  following four rounds of international bidding for offshore oil  and gas exploration and development. The 13 blocks, with a  combined area of 40,000 square kilometers, are situated in the  basins of the Pearl river mouth, Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan in  the South China Sea.    Gong Zaisheng, CNOOC's chief geologist, told XINHUA that the  principal objective of this acreage promotion was to expand  offshore oil and gas exploration, and his corporation would  present the geology of the blocks and the key targets for  exploration.    A total of 33 targets have been initially selected inside  the  blocks, he revealed, adding that CNOOC will answer questions on  the promotion and discuss technological issues with companies  interested in specific blocks.    He said the blocks in the Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan basins  have good natural gas prospects. These blocks, originally  reserved for self-financed exploration, are now being promoted  only because of some inadequacies in funding and technology.    He said that especially the deep stratum in the region, so  far barely drilled because of high temperature and pressure, is  considered an exploration domain with great potential.    On the other hand, he said, the blocks in the pearl river  mouth basin were redefined, after careful analysis and  evaluation by Chinese experts, to include a batch of hopeful  targets for exploration.    CNOOC has told 80 foreign companies about the promotion, and  it was well received, said Gong, who is expected to head a  delegation to the United States for the promotion from June 20  to 24.    A seminar will be held in Adam's Mark Hotel, Houston, on  June  20, followed by detailed technical exchanges and discussions,  Gong added.    The oil companies will not need to worry about marketing  their products from natural gas exploration and development in  Yinggehai and Qiong Dongnan, he said, adding that the market in  the coastal area is vast.    CNOOC is considering the construction of a gas pipeline, as  soon as enough deposits are discovered, to link all the big  cities along the coast in the provinces of Guangdong, Fujian and  Hainan. ""This long-distance pipeline will give the gas to be  produced access to the market,"" Gong said.    The CNOOC signed 94 agreements and contracts with 55 oil  companies from 15 countries over the past ten years. Altogether  78 oil and gas-bearing structures have been discovered on  China's continental shelf, through cooperative and self-financed  exploration.    So far 1.2 billion tons of oil in place, and 180 billion  cubic meters of natural gas have been proven and controlled,  according to experts. The daily crude output of the corporation  has risen to 130,000 barrels, bringing the projected total for  this year to 5.5 million tons.    By 1997, the CNOOC is expected to produce 265,000 barrels of  crude and 10 million cubic meters of gas each day, experts said.     "

The banks have bought 350,000 Dia-Met shares, equal to 3.5 per cent of the total outstanding, in a private placement priced at CDollars 39 a share. The deal was put together by First Marathon Securities of Toronto. Dia-Met's share price has soared in the past year from less than CDollars 5 to a peak of CDollars 60 in the wake of its discovery of diamonds in the Lac de Gras area, 350km north-east of Yellowknife. The company said last May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore had yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appeared to be of gem quality. BHP, the Australian mining group, has rights to a majority interest in the Dia-Met property. De Beers and Kennecott, the North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, are among numerous other companies which have joined the diamond stampede, in which a total of about 23m acres has been staked.

During the reception, P.M. Vo Van Kiet welcomed Japanese and  US oil and gas industrialists to visit Vietnam and sign a  product- sharing contract wth Vietnam on exploring and  exploiting oil and gas at lot 05-1B in the Thanh Long (Blue  Dragon) oilfield. He reaffirmed that the group was not only  significant in economy, but also indicative of a new step of  development in the cooperative relations among Vietnam, Russia,  Japan and the US. In addition to the cooperation in oil and gas  exploration and exploitation, he said the group would serve as  basis for the companies' experience exchanges and technology  transfer in conformity with the benefits of all partners.    For his part, Mr. T. Wada, president of Japex Company  reaffirmed that with experience of each company, the group  expected to broaden their work to other lots in the Thanh Long  oilfield, and cooperate with Vietnam in other areas including in  exchanges of experience and technology transfer in the interests  of each partner and for stability and development of Vietnam.    Earlier, the delegation was received by Communist Party of  Vietnam General Secretary Do Muoi.     "
0,FT931-3219 ,"FT931-3219 _AN-DCQCCACIFT 930317   FT  17 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tax shift boosts oil shares      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON   OIL ISSUES, little changed ahead of the Budget, rose sharply after news that Petroleum Revenue Tax on existing oil fields is being reduced from 75 per cent to 50 per cent from July 1 and that tax on new fields will be abolished. The market's knee-jerk reaction was that the oil majors, British Petroleum and Shell Transport, would be the main beneficiaries of the Budget changes, closely followed by the exploration and production stocks. BP had jumped 9 to 295p by the close, with turnover totalling 5m shares. Shell, sold down to 571p early in the session, finished a net 2 higher at 580p. The exploration and production stocks saw initial sluggish performance transformed into good gains across the board. Enterprise Oil settled 4 ahead at 492p and Lasmo, plagued by worries that the dividend may be cut when the preliminary figures are published later this month, gained 5 on balance at 186p. An analyst commented: 'Any reduction in the tax-take from the North Sea, on existing and new fields, has got to be seen as good news for the oil companies.' Premier Consolidated, with its raft of small marginal fields in the North Sea, was seen as a big winner from the Budget moves. The shares ended 2 3/4 up at 29 1/2 p.

Blackland is issuing 761.9m new shares of 1p to Kingsleigh's shareholders and separately placing 286m shares at 3 1/2 p in a bid to raise Pounds 9.2m net. The new company created by the deal will be called Fortune Oil. Kingsleigh is involved in trading oil in China as well as the construction of an offshore loading point and 15km pipeline. The transaction will involve 9 Chinese businessmen joining the Blackland board including Mr Sun Zhaoqing, chairman of China National Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, as non-executive chairman. 'What we're buying here is connections in China as well as an earnings stream from a major engineering project,' said Mr John Mottram, who will be finance director of the joint company. Blackland currently has a series of small onshore exploration and production interests in the UK. It incurred an operating loss of Pounds 321,000 for 1992, compared with Pounds 472,000. Losses per share were 3.59p (5.28p). Mr Mottram said the acquisition would create the first company with a sizeable Chinese shareholding to be listed in the UK. The Pounds 9m from the share placement will be used to pay part of Kingsleigh's investment in the Chinese shipping facility as well as pay down group debt.   Companies:-  Blackland Oil.

The message was handed  over by Hisham Nazir, the Saudi minister of petroleum and  mineral resources, who was received by the prime minister at the  parliament headquarters here on Tuesday.    Following the meeting, Nazir told the SPA that he also  conveyed to Mr Hata the interest of King Fahd for promotion of  the bilateral relations between the two countries in various  fields.    Nazir also expressed satisfaction over the four-decade  friendship ties between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Japan as  the Kingdom is regarded as the biggest oil exporter to Japan  which imports about 25 percent of its oil needs from the kingdom  which is, on turn, regarded among the biggest importers of the  Japanese products.    Minister Nazir said the kingdom is looking forwards for  setting up more economic joint ventures with Japanese partners  including a joint petroleum project for refining and  distribution of the Saudi Aramco's oil products in Japan's  markets.    He said the Japanese prime minister and other concerned  ministers with which he met, have expressed support for the  establishment of the joint venture which will be run by the  Saudi Aramco and Japanese oil companies inside Japan.

But they recognize that today's full order books are the  result of the backlog that developed in the Challenger aftermath, when nothing  was launched, and that when things settle down, the orders will be only a  trickle. Hughes Aircraft, the leading satellite maker with more than half the  40 commercial satellites now in space, estimates about five launches a year.    Yet today's renewed enthusiasm is important, helping U.S. industry to begin the  real work of the next decade, which will be laying the groundwork of space  platforms and communications systems for the wide-ranging exploration of space  that is sure to come in the 21st Century.    And the revival is timely because competitors have been active. The European  space consortium, Arianespace -- funded by 13 individual nations -- leads the  world; it has put up 23 satellites in the past four years and has orders to  launch almost four dozen more. China and the Soviet Union are offering launch  services at cut-rate prices.    Not surprisingly, Japan has ambitious plans for space. In 1992, Mitsubishi  Heavy Industries will launch its H-2 rocket, and in the mid-1990s will put up  the Japan Environmental Module, which is scheduled to accompany the U.S. space  station. Beyond that, Japanese companies are being encouraged to think big by  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, which is holding a  competition for ideas on space exploration in the next century.    Meanwhile, despite today's enthusiasm, U.S. industry may not have smooth  sailing when Congress gets the $30-billion bill for the space station,  scheduled for launch in 1995 and envisioned as both a center for experiments  and a platform for planetary exploration. There will be cries that it's a  boondoggle and that space isn't a real profit-making business anyway.    But that's not true. First, as the Europeans and Japanese understand, projects  like the space station are needed to support the early stages of a new  industry. And profit margins on space business are already good, says Donald  Robinson, vice president of planning for American Rocket. American charges  $800,000 a launch on small rockets and earns $200,000.    Furthermore, space is a business with a considerable record of success. Today's  commercial rocket launches are not the dawn of the space business but the  second stage of a developing industry, says General Dynamics' Lovelace, a  one-time NASA official. Communications satellites -- the first stage -- have  been a business for decades.    Now we have launches, space-age trucking really. And the next stages, Lovelace  says, will be in Earth remote sensing -- bringing to commercial business the  work being done by spy satellites -- and weather control.    Truth is, today's enthusiasm is not misplaced. Space exploration has already  brought us wonders that we take for granted -- the techniques of image  enhancement for pictures from space have brought our hospitals computerized and  magnetic resonance brain and body scanning. And while U.S. industry must now  make up for some lost time, the advances of U.S. computer technology give  America an edge in space for the decade ahead.

The input to the recovered oil systems is primarily oil skimmed from wastewater treatment operations as well as oil recovered from other sources, not discarded refining process wastewaters. Recovered oil systems do not exist to remove contaminants from wastewater. Rather, their purpose is to restore recovered oil to sufficient purity so that it can be reused as a feedstock material in the refining process. This is a natural point to characterize activities as being part of the refining process.   It is thus EPA's view that until oil is recovered from refinery process wastewaters, the wastewaters are discarded materials and hence solid wastes potentially subject to regulation under RCRA.    8     (Wastewaters remaining after oil has been recovered are still solid wastes, and are typically returned to an upstream point in the refinery's wastewater treatment system.) The oil recovered from such wastewaters is not a solid waste, however (assuming it is reinserted into the refining process). This reading is not only in accord with common sense, as explained above, but also is in accord with RCRA's goals and purposes.     AMC II    , 907 F. 2d at 118687;     API    , 906 F. 2d at 74041. As these cases make clear, EPA may ordinarily consider secondary materials that have ``become part of the waste disposal problem'' to be discarded.     API    , 906 F. 2d at 741;     AMC II    , 907 F. 2d at 1186. That is the case here. Discarded plant wastewaters up to and including the primary wastewater treatment step, can contain high loadings of hazardous constituents that may pose environmental harm if released. It is estimated that an average of 34% of the benzene (a human carcinogen) entering a petroleum refinery's wastewater treatment system is emitted to air from the wastewater collection portion of the system; when primary wastewater treatment (i.e., a non-enclosed oil-water separator) is included in this calculation, the amount of benzene emitted relative to the influent concentration rises to 47%.    9     Primary wastewater treatment also is sometimes conducted in land-based or in-ground units, which can (and have) resulted in environmental contamination.    10     This further indicates that these operations can be part of the waste management problem.             8     On a similar note, the Agency is aware of activities at petroleum management facilities where free-phase hydrocarbon (from spills, etc.) is removed from the water table as part of groundwater remediation (see 56 FR at 13406 (Apr. 2, 1991)). These hydrocarbon recovery operations can recover materials ranging from mostly water to mostly oil; only recovered materials that are primarily oil, and that can be inserted into a refinery's recovered oil system without pretreatment (or can be inserted directly into the refining process itself), would be considered ``recovered oil'' eligible for today's exclusion. The management of petroleum-contaminated groundwater in separation and treatment units is clearly solid waste (and potentially hazardous waste) management, essentially wastewater treatment.                9     The Agency addressed benzene emissions from waste operations in a final rule published January 7, 1993 (58 FR 3072) using risk-based standards for benzene. See also EPA,     Final NESHAP Standards for Waste Operations: Basis for Impact Calculations    , February 16, 1990. This document is available in the Benzene Waste Operations NESHAP docket.                10     ``Background Document to Support Listing of Primary Oil/Water Separation Sludges from the Petroleum Refining Industry,'' U.S. EPA, December 22, 1989, pp. 6, 1012.        In addition, petroleum refineries frequently generate individual wastewater streams that exhibit characteristics of hazardous waste, which streams are mixed together so that the characteristic is removed. (The characteristic can be removed either before or during primary treatment.) These aggregated wastewater streams may still contain high volumes of hazardous constituents, however, because aggregation (i.e. dilution) and primary treatment do not significantly remove or destroy all hazardous constituents. See Tables in Section V,     Development Document for Effluent Limitations Guidelines, New Source Performance Standards and Pretreatment Standards for the Petroleum Refining Point Source Category    . The aggregated wastewaters are then managed in surface impoundments, where biological treatment occurs. The D.C. Circuit has made clear, in     Chemical Waste Management     v.     EPA    , that in such circumstances the decharacterized wastewaters cannot be managed in surface impoundments unless they have first been treated to meet the treatment requirements of RCRA Section 3004(m) (requiring treatment that substantially removes or destroys hazardous constituents so that threats to human health and the environment are minimized), or unless treatment equivalent to Section 3004(m) treatment occurs before the wastewaters are discharged.     Id    . at 7, 2024. 11  The court indeed repeatedly referred to these treatment standards as the core of RCRA's hazardous waste management scheme.     Id    . at 23, 24.             11     EPA is still working to interpret the scope of the ``equivalence'' requirement in the     Chemical Waste Management     opinion, and the language in the text should not be taken as representing the Agency's resolution of the issue. It is clear, however, that the opinion imposes obligations on facilities that use impoundments to manage wastewaters that are decharacterized by means other than full-scale section 3004 (m) treatment.        EPA's interpretation that the influent into primary wastewater treatment consists of discarded wastes, not in-process petroleum, is fully in accord with these core principles of RCRA. Decharacterized wastewaters that are going to be managed in surface impoundments would nevertheless receive Section 3004 (m) treatment before their ultimate discharge, as required by the     Chemical Waste Management     opinion. Under industry's preferred reading, however, the decharacterized wastewaters would not be solid wastes at all until all oil recovery has been completed, even if held in impoundments. At that point, the wastewaters would no longer exhibit a characteristic (because they have been diluted through aggregation), and thus would not be prohibited wastes subject to Section 3004 (m) treatment. The ``core principles of RCRA'' would thus be avoided. EPA considers its interpretation of ``discarded,'' that assures proper treatment of characteristically hazardous petroleum refinery wastewaters that are going to be managed in surface impoundments, to be more reasonable.    12                 12     EPA views the facts here as similar to those in the     AMC II     case. In particular, both situations involve wastewater treatment operations, where plant wastewaters could ultimately be managed in surface impoundments.        EPA acknowledges that it initially proposed to exclude all such wastewaters from the definition of solid waste. 53 FR 525526. However, the Agency's reasoning was based in part on the same mistaken view of the scope of     AMC I     that was later rejected by the     API     court. 906 F. 2d at 74041. (EPA even relied in part on the overbroad ``indigenous'' concept, 53 FR 525, 526, that was remanded in     API    . 906 F. 2d at 739, 742.) The Agency is obviously not bound by its proposal, and subsequent case law makes clear that the Agency has more interpretive discretion than it imagined in 1988. The interpretation adopted in today's rule is reasonable and in accord with statutory goals and purposes.

Id    . at 23, 24.             11     EPA is still working to interpret the scope of the ``equivalence'' requirement in the     Chemical Waste Management     opinion, and the language in the text should not be taken as representing the Agency's resolution of the issue. It is clear, however, that the opinion imposes obligations on facilities that use impoundments to manage wastewaters that are decharacterized by means other than full-scale section 3004 (m) treatment.        EPA's interpretation that the influent into primary wastewater treatment consists of discarded wastes, not in-process petroleum, is fully in accord with these core principles of RCRA. Decharacterized wastewaters that are going to be managed in surface impoundments would nevertheless receive Section 3004 (m) treatment before their ultimate discharge, as required by the     Chemical Waste Management     opinion. Under industry's preferred reading, however, the decharacterized wastewaters would not be solid wastes at all until all oil recovery has been completed, even if held in impoundments. At that point, the wastewaters would no longer exhibit a characteristic (because they have been diluted through aggregation), and thus would not be prohibited wastes subject to Section 3004 (m) treatment. The ``core principles of RCRA'' would thus be avoided. EPA considers its interpretation of ``discarded,'' that assures proper treatment of characteristically hazardous petroleum refinery wastewaters that are going to be managed in surface impoundments, to be more reasonable.    12                 12     EPA views the facts here as similar to those in the     AMC II     case. In particular, both situations involve wastewater treatment operations, where plant wastewaters could ultimately be managed in surface impoundments.        EPA acknowledges that it initially proposed to exclude all such wastewaters from the definition of solid waste. 53 FR 525526. However, the Agency's reasoning was based in part on the same mistaken view of the scope of     AMC I     that was later rejected by the     API     court. 906 F. 2d at 74041. (EPA even relied in part on the overbroad ``indigenous'' concept, 53 FR 525, 526, that was remanded in     API    . 906 F. 2d at 739, 742.) The Agency is obviously not bound by its proposal, and subsequent case law makes clear that the Agency has more interpretive discretion than it imagined in 1988. The interpretation adopted in today's rule is reasonable and in accord with statutory goals and purposes.              "

The result included an abnormal profit of ADollars 37m on the sale of its holding in Ampol Exploration, an Australian petroleum company. However, the abnormal profit was offset by a provision of ADollars 40m against the book value of US assets, which was also treated as an abnormal item. Pioneer said it had restated profits for both periods to exclude contributions from Ampol Exploration, the sale of which was completed for accounting purposes in July. The group said sales revenue fell 13 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn. Revenue from building materials was down 2 per cent to ADollars 1.2bn, primarily because of weakness in Australian markets. Petroleum refining and marketing operations revenue fell 17 per cent to ADollars 1.3bn, principally reflecting a fall in crude oil prices at the end of the Gulf war. Directors declared an interim dividend of 7.5 cents a share, unfranked because of available tax losses incurred in previous years.  The Financial Times   London Page 23  "

The properties are being sold to Apache, an independent energy company based in Houston, Texas. With net proven reserves of 81m barrels of oil and 220bn cubic feet of gas, the fields are roughly half as big as Apache's total reserves at the end of last year. The sale should be completed in the first quarter of next year, the two companies said. Texaco said the sale price amounted to Dollars 5.08 per barrel of oil equivalent. Texaco's move echoes steps taken by big US oil groups in recent years. Most have moved to shed smaller US fields, which they are often not able to develop and run as profitably as can smaller independent companies with lower overheads. Texaco said in July that it intended to dispose of a collection of smaller US fields which contributed 'zero to earnings and less than 10 per cent' of the company's cashflow from exploration and production activities in the US. The 300 properties being sold to Apache are spread throughout Texas, as well as Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico, the Rocky mountains and 'the mid-continent' area of the US. Still for sale are properties in California and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.     Apache Corp.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT924-9877 ,"FT924-9877 _AN-CKCCTAGHFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Oil and Gas Industry (2): To strange horizons - How exploration has changed      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   THE world's biggest oil and gas companies are turning to ever more exotic parts of the globe to look for new supplies. This so-called frontier strategy is taking companies such as British Petroleum into the Colombian jungles and British Gas into the former republics of the Soviet Union. Frontier exploration is devoted to extending the limits of known energy reserves but carries a risk much higher than companies face in their more traditional areas of influence such as the North Sea and North America. Some of this exploration is conducted in extremely hostile environments where the oil majors face many environmental drawbacks as well as possible disruption to drilling programmes by guerrilla action. In addition host governments are often unstable and could turn hostile at very short notice. The fact that many companies are prepared to run these huge risks is evidence of their often desperate search for new oil reserves. Most big discoveries are thought to have been found in the North Sea and, while there still remains a lot of oil and gas to drill, production profiles are expected to tail off towards the end of the decade. At the same time, the environmental lobby has closed much of North America for oil exploration and raised the cost for companies still operating there. Mr Robin West who advises companies on their frontier strategy at Petroleum Finance Company, the Washington-based consulting group, points out that most traditional oil majors have done a poor job of replacing their reserves of energy. British Petroleum, for example, saw the level of its proven oil reserves drop by four per cent last year, since the company has much of its production concentrated in the mature oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska. 'Companies are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out, low-risk investment in the North Sea and North America to riskier prospects,' Mr West explains. The drive for oil companies to replace their reserves with new discoveries has occurred at a time of rapid political change across the globe which has seen the opening up of many countries where governments were previously hostile to western oil companies. These countries  - from Vietnam and Russia to Laos and Yemen  - are looking to exploit mineral resources to expand hard currency earnings. They look to the oil and gas majors for valuable investment in infrastructure and development in return for drilling rights on tracts of potential oil-bearing land. Nowhere is the rush to explore more evident than in the former Soviet Union. In spite of the difficulties of negotiating with changing political regimes and large scale bureaucracy, most western companies are hoping to secure at least some acreage or production-sharing deals. British Gas recently landed exclusive rights to negotiate for the development of a huge field in Kazakhstan which is the first stage before agreeing a contract. But negotiations can drag on for months or even years and many companies have become embroiled in discussing technicalities. Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, the US oil major, was negotiating with Kazakhstan for over four years, but he explained the company's persistence in terms of the significance of the field in which he was interested. 'It is unique in size and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our size for a very long time.' The republics of the former Soviet Union provide a safer bet for companies looking to frontier exploration since, in spite of production difficulties, they collectively remain the world's largest producer of oil with vast proven grossly under-exploited reserves. Companies searching for oil in Vietnam, Laos and Colombia are running a greater risk of ending up with dry holes. Clyde Petroleum, a small UK exploration company, was forced to write off its Dollars 8m investment in offshore Vietnam when it discovered a large reservoir of carbon dioxide last year instead of the natural gas reserves it was hoping for. Companies must collect extremely expensive high-tech data on the country's geology before deciding where to drill which is, in the end, a subjective decision. Oil exploration is a notoriously hit-and-miss affair even in the best researched locations. Much of the impetus for frontier exploration came after the Gulf war early last year when many oil producing nations began to talk of a dialogue, if not partnership, with consumers. Most nations in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) are in need of capital to complete capacity expansion plans, but many are short of hard currency. Dr Subroto, secretary general of the organisation, estimates that its 13 members need roughly Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to finish expansion programmes. These capital requirements have seen Opec nations actively courting western oil companies to form partnerships that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Industry analysts call this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies. Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil consulting group and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the oil industry, said: 'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a wave of nationalism across the world led to many of these companies being thrown out of countries they were operating in.' Iran, which expelled western oil companies after the revolution in 1979, is now eager to entice them back. Tehran has even hosted conferences on producer-consumer dialogue in an effort to court wary western companies. Countries are competing for scarce cash amid global credit shortages which means they are often prepared to offer western companies extremely favourable deals in order to attract their investment and sophisticated technology. For the few companies that strike lucky in frontier exploration, the high stakes can offer rich rewards. Companies are hoping for an 'elephant'  - a discovery of 1bn barrels or more  - which will ensure earnings growth for at least a decade. British Petroleum's oil find in the foothills of the Colombian mountains is rumoured to contain more than 1bn barrels. Although the company has played down the significance of its discovery, it badly needs a boost to its reserves and, among the majors, has pioneered the risky frontier strategy. The company is painfully aware of the fact that the successful energy companies in the 1990s will be the ones that strike lucky in the jungles of Laos and Vietnam or strike favourable deals in the former Soviet Union. The stakes have been raised once more in the risky oil exploration business.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

A group of States and Territories (States) objected to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to its customers. In support of their objection, the States cited increases in Acme's sales and earnings from 1973 to 1974. In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the steel industry was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. The DOE determined that the evidence offered by the States was insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user injury and the applicant should receive a refund. The DOE also denied the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the States had not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. In addition, the DOE found that the petroleum coke purchased by Acme originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller who did not substantially change its form. Therefore these purchases were found to be eligible for a crude oil refund. The refund granted to the applicant in this Decision was $75,035.

That compared with the previous profit of Pounds 4.8m. Cost of lawyers, accountants, merchant banks and other parties working on the restructuring amounted to Pounds 8.9m. Mr John Gainham, group managing director, deplored the cost and said: 'When you have advisers from eight banks you need a room the size of Wembley. We have no control over them.' Provisions for operational reorganisation came to Pounds 7m and there was Pounds 2.4m mainly in connection with aborted disposals. The interest charge was Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 32.7m). Anglo's core debt has been reduced from Pounds 251m to Pounds 130m. Interest on most of the borrowings is currently fixed at 14.5 per cent. Operating profits before exceptional items fell from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 20.3m. Mr Gainham said the result had been affected by another mild winter, the continuing recession, uncertainty over the future of British Coal and the distraction of the restructuring. Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said: 'We have all the working capital we need.' Smokeless fuels reported reduced operating profits of Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 21m) as many of the company's solid fuel customers continued to destock because of recession. Liquid fuels and chemicals saw operating profits drop from Pounds 8.6m to Pounds 4.6m, mainly because of lower heating oil margins. Operating profits from other activities fell from Pounds 4.7m to Pounds 3.4m as revenues declined from the Falkland Islands Company because of the reduction in fishing. Losses per share of 8.9p compared to earnings of 0.8p. There is no dividend, compared with a total of 0.85p last time. COMMENT Anglo is in a vicious circle. The interest on the bank debt is bleeding the company dry when it should be expanding its core businesses to help pay off some of its principal debt. Ideally it should be buying some small distributorships, but with what? Disposals is the obvious answer, but that is all but ruled out while its markets are still affected by the recession. One solution could be to sell its main business, namely smokeless fuels. In the short-term Anglo is restricted to its current business plan but in the long-term Mr Gainham says nothing is sacred and all options are open. With the company's options so restricted, its shares, languishing at 3 1/2 p, offer little hope for recovery in the medium-term.   Companies:-  Anglo United.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Currency gains fell sharply from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 85,000. Mr Peter Everett, chairman, said the currency effect and net profits decline masked a strong underlying performance, with the operating return for the six months to December 31 77 per cent higher at Pounds 1.65m. The return was achieved in spite of a marked weakening of oil prices from an average of Dollars 18.76 per barrel to Dollars 15.13. Turnover rose by 57 per cent to Pounds 7.52m. The increase was largely due to an early contribution from the Scott field in the North Sea, which came on stream in September. The company reached record production levels of 737,400 barrels of oil equivalent, of which some 220,847 had been produced by the Scott field. Pict was determined to continue its exploration programme, and had budgeted about Pounds 8m for projects this year. The company also said it intended to pursue further acquisitions abroad. Pict ended the first half with cash of Pounds 15.5m against Pounds 14.8m last year. Net debt was Pounds 13.5m, equal to 29 per cent of shareholders' funds. As in previous years, there is no dividend.

0,FT943-6936 ,"FT943-6936 _AN-EHZDVAAZFT 940826   FT  26 AUG 94 / Dual assault exposes Fujimori flaws: There is a bleaker side to the 'economic miracle' in Peru      By SALLY BOWEN   The bitter feud within Peru's first family continues to dominate the country's political centre-stage - with President Alberto Fujimori this week stripping his wife, Ms Susana Higuchi, of first lady status after she persisted in allegations of corruption against cabinet ministers. Behind the scenes, however, the agenda for next April's general elections is starting to take shape. Since his arrival in the Peruvian capital a week ago, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, former UN secretary-general, has been closeted in meetings with a series of prestigious economic analysts. Mr Perez de Cuellar has not yet formally announced he will run against Mr Fujimori - who has also still to declare an official candidacy - but his public addresses hint more strongly each day at the substance of his eventual campaign. The suggestion that an elderly former diplomat might pose a serious threat to the buoyant Mr Fujimori provokes incredulity among many businessmen, both Peruvian and among the increasing numbers of foreigners who are flocking back to Peru to seize investment opportunities. 'Fujimori is the best president this country's ever had,' said one leading Peruvian manufacturer. 'We couldn't be so incredibly stupid as to reject him.' Indeed, most macroeconomic indicators suggest things are coming right for long-beleaguered Peru. Inflation this year should be below 20 per cent, down from a staggering 7,000 per cent when Mr Fujimori took office in 1990. After expanding 7 per cent last year, GDP growth could top 10 per cent in 1994. International reserves, at more than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn), are the highest in Peru's history. Equally important, after more than a decade of terror and killing, guerrilla activity has virtually ceased. Mining and petroleum exploration and development has been resumed in many remoter areas of the country while dozens of foreign concerns are either returning or setting up Peruvian offices for the first time. But there is a bleaker side to the Peruvian 'economic miracle', which both Ms Higuchi and Mr Perez de Cuellar have pinpointed. Only one in 10 Peruvians of working age is judged 'adequately' employed; another eight survive through subsistence agriculture or a host of 'informal' activities outside the legal economy. Reform of the bloated state apparatus has pushed tens of thousands of former civil servants and state company employees on to the street, literally. They have swollen the army of informal vendors eking out a living in the centre of Lima. For the 300,000 or so young people who join the national workforce each year, the task of finding secure employment is all but hopeless. Attending to the nation's poor has not, so far, been a priority for the government. In the early days of the Fujimori administration, as food subsidies and price controls were eliminated, the need to re-establish a working relationship with the multilateral organisations was more urgent. Repayments to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank cost the Treasury in a month what the social emergency programme doled out in a year. More recent efforts to create a 'compensation' programme similar to that designed for post-stabilisation Bolivia have been only partially successful. The Foncodes fund has for the past two years been channelling cash to community projects, focusing on small building projects, drinking water and sewerage systems. Now, in this pre-election year, the government finds itself swimming in cash from privatisations. The IMF has authorised spending of up to Dollars 876m on 'social' programmes. But Foncodes does not have the organisational capacity to spend more than about Dollars 120m. Other hastily hatched plans to funnel more money into health posts and schools may succeed in spending about the same amount again. Multilateral organisations such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank which have resumed lending to Peru are pouring money into upgrading infrastructure. Several hundred million dollars will, by 1995, have been pumped into road and bridge repairs; poverty alleviation is limited to, at best, inadequate food handouts and short-term palliatives. Ms Higuchi has emerged in recent weeks as one of Mr Fujimori's harshest critics amid the couple's highly public falling out, fuelling rumours that she harbours political ambitions herself. She has made a series of attacks on her husband's regime, accusing him of personal authoritarianism and neglect of the 'human factor' in the economic programme. 'There is too much emphasis on infrastructure,' Ms Higuchi said. 'The head of a household can't promise a fine mansion but keep his family starving whilst it is being built.' Those close to Mr Perez de Cuellar say his eventual campaign platform will echo this theme and propose reorienting Peru's economic programme to farther-reaching solutions to unemployment and poverty. This would imply tougher negotiations with the IMF, World Bank and IADB and, possibly, a halt to the breakneck privatisation of state assets. 'So far no one's taken a long hard look at where Peru is going,' says Mr Francisco Sagasti, a former senior World Bank official now heading a Lima research institute. 'Pulling the neo-liberal economic model back to the centre from the extremes where it's been for the past four years and renegotiating with the multilaterals would make a lot of sense.'

(a) This subpart contains procedures for exhaust emissions tests on petroleum-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks, and for evaporative emission tests on gasoline-fueled, natural gas-fueled, liquefied petroleum gas-fueled and methanol-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks. Certain items of equipment are not necessary for a particular test,     e.g.,     evaporative enclosure when testing petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles. Alternate sampling systems may be used if shown to yield equivalent results and if approved in advance by the Administrator. Equipment required and specifications are as follows:     (1)     Evaporative emission tests.     The evaporative emission test is closely related to and connected with the exhaust emission test. All vehicles tested for evaporative emissions must undergo testing according to the test sequences described in 86.13096; however, the Administrator may omit measurement of exhaust emissions to test for evaporative emissions. The Administrator may truncate a test after any valid emission measurement without affecting the validity of the test. Further, unless the evaporative emission test is waived by the Administrator under 86.09026, all vehicles must undergo both tests. (Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from the evaporative emission standard.) Section 86.107 specifies the necessary equipment.     (2)     Exhaust emission tests.     All vehicles subject to this subpart are subject to testing for both gaseous and particulate exhaust emissions using the CVS concept (see 86.109), except where exemptions or waivers are expressly provided in subpart A of this part. Vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' (i.e., phase-out) standards described under subpart A of this part are exempted from testing for methane emissions. Otto-cycle vehicles subject to the ``Tier 0'' standards are waived from testing for particulates. For vehicles waived from the requirement for measuring particulate emissions, use of a dilution tunnel is not required (see 86.109). The CVS must be connected to the dilution tunnel if particulate emission sampling is required (see 86.110). Petroleum- and methanol-fueled diesel-cycle vehicle testing requires that a PDP-CVS or CFV-CVS with heat exchanger be used. (This equipment may be used with methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles; however, particulates need not be measured for vehicles that are waived from the requirement). All vehicles equipped with evaporative canisters are preconditioned by loading the canisters with hydrocarbon vapors. Petroleum-fueled diesel vehicles are excluded from this requirement.     (3)     Fuel, analytical gas, and driving schedule specifications.     Fuel specifications for exhaust and evaporative emissions testing and for mileage accumulation are specified in 86.113.

The production of oil  dropped by 15 per cent in the first quarter of this year as  compared to the corresponding period of 1993, the output of coal  -- by 9 per cent, gas -- by almost 1 per cent, light petroleum  products -- by 12-18 per cent, and electricity -- by 4 per cent.    In general, the slump in this sector of the economy remained  at last year's level and equalled to 6.5 per cent, ITAR-TASS was  told at the Russian Ministry for Fuel and Energy.    In expert opinion, the output of energy resources was  negatively influenced not only by the general recession, but  also by such factors as default of payments, which reached 19  trillion roubles in the fuel and energy complex alone, regularly  delayed budget allocations, and further reduction of  investments. Along with general economic factors, experts link  the dropping oil output of the recent years with the growing  share of deposits on the developed oilfields that yield to  extraction with great difficulty.    The marketing of refined products is another factor  responsible for slumping oil production, because the consumers  have turned insolvent. This explains the stoppage and closure  of about 15,000 oil wells, which brought down oil extraction by  approximately 4-4.5 million tonnes.    The fuel sector's financial ""hunger"" has had a negative  effect on the processing of crude oil and the production of  light petroleum products. Their volumes dropped by 15 per cent  in the first quarter of this year as compared to 1993, which  equals to more than eight million tonnes.     "

A  Kelper told LA PRENSA that ""we do not understand the rationale  behind Argentina's decision to buy the Skyhawk planes -- unless  it is seeking to attack the islands.""    Another islander, who is very close to the islands'  government, added that ""we do not trust Argentina, and even  though it is terrible for us, we are not afraid because here we  have the Royal Air Force to defend us.""    The Malvinas Islands' representative in London, Suky  Cameron,  reported that the islands' government -- through the United  Kingdom -- had lodged a strong protest before the Clinton  administration about the sale of the U.S. Skyhawk aircraft.    Argentine Deputy Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella told LA  PRENSA that ""Cameron's remarks have caused a great  disappointment in the Argentine Foreign Ministry, because it  seems that she has not taken note of the fact that Argentina  will continue to press its claim to sovereignty over the  Malvinas by diplomatic and peaceful means, as it has every right  to do.""    ""It Reached Clinton's Ears""    For his part, Defense Minister Oscar Camilion has disclosed  that the dispute arising from Great Britain's opposition to that  business transaction ""even came to President Bill Clinton's""  knowledge.    As the defense minister pointed out: ""It is my considered  opinion that the stance taken by the British is totally  groundless and anachronistic. If this were not so, we would not  have this favorable outcome now.""    Camilion further stated that it was not possible that while  Argentina was aligned with the UN Security Council, two of its  leading members -- the United Kingdom and the United States --  ""should be enforcing an arms embargo against Argentina.""    He also said that ""this is why this means that the arms  embargo on Argentina has been raised by all the countries in the  world except for Britain, until it decides to the contrary.""    He likewise denied that Argentina was interested in buying  F-16 fighter planes, noting that ""our budget possibilities would  never allow it; it would be impossible to find someone willing  to sell them, and it would logically cause a regional imbalance.""    In its 1 February edition, the FINANCIAL TIMES reports that  the sale of the U.S. planes to Argentina represents ""a severe  blow"" for the UK Government led by Prime Minister [John] Major  and its relations with the United States.

The weakest argument is that there would be savings from joint use of infrastructure. Enterprise argues that the profitability of future developments would be enhanced by cheap access to Lasmo's pipelines in Liverpool Bay and elsewhere. The snag is not simply that access on non-commercial terms would be impossible given that other companies also own stakes in the infrastructure. Even if it were possible, enhanced profitability of Enterprise's developments would merely be matched by reduced profitability of Lasmo's infrastructure. Another Enterprise argument - that its expertise in three-dimensional surveys could be applied to Lasmo - is hardly better. Lasmo has been using 3-D technology for over a decade. That leaves Enterprise's criticism of Lasmo's slow development of its Indonesian interests as the company's most persuasive argument. But even here, the case is not clear-cut. Lasmo's Sanga Sanga concession is fairly mature and so unlikely to yield vast new treasures. Enterprise should reconsider its strategy of trying to join the big boys' game. An alternative would be to return to its roots as an exploration company by splitting itself into two. One half could contain most of its current production assets as well as group debt. This company would pay investors handsome dividends and gradually liquidate itself. The other half would focus on exploration and would offer investors the hope of capital gains. Enterprise once toyed with this idea. When reminded of it today, the company said it was only joking.   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.     LASMO.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mitsubishi of Japan, the Astra Group of Indonesia and British Gas are the latest companies to reach provisional accords in a region which is attracting increasing interest from foreign oil producers, as they seek to replace their reserves. Bidding for the final block was still going on, PetroVietnam said. Lasmo, the independent UK oil producer, announced last week that it had won a joint tender with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading company, in the same area. That was followed this week by an announcement from British Petroleum and Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil company, that they had formally confirmed a production-sharing contract with PetroVietnam for a concession offered in the first licensing round. Vietnam has now allocated nine of the 10 blocks south-east of the southern coastal town of Vung Tau to foreign bidders. The blocks were originally to be explored by Vietsovpetro, a joint venture with the Soviet Union, but were handed back to Vietnamese control a year ago, after Hanoi complained that Moscow lacked the technology to develop them.

The result of the investigation will be vital to the company's future, but on any likely outcome life will continue to be pretty tough. With the RPI-5 price formula and increased competition, earnings this year are likely to be around 22p a share. That means dividend cover will only be 1.5 times against the company's declared target of a twice covered payout. Interest cover is close to the company's own comfort level of four times. Meanwhile capital expenditure - particularly on exploration and production - will mean a further cash outflow this year. Those financial ratios might seem comfortable for a pure utility, but the profile of the business is shifting markedly. Even if some of the more radical suggestions are ignored by the MMC, competition in the UK gas business will increase, lessening the security of the utility franchise. At the same time, the heavy investment in exploration and production is taking the company into higher risk areas which will not start to produce substantial returns until 1995. If the MMC produces a particularly tough report, that might even force a hard look at the dividend. On a milder outcome, the prospects for dividend growth will still be severely limited. The 6 per cent yield on British Gas shares is supposed to reflect uncertainty over the MMC investigation. But unless that review increases the rate of return on the UK gas business, a re-rating looks unlikely.   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Nonetheless, these substitutes can serve as viable   alternatives in certain applications.   b.     Substitutes for solvent/diluents.       (1) Petroleum hydrocarbons (C6C20).   Petroleum hydrocarbons are generally defined as C6C20 hydrocarbons fractionated   from the distillation of petroleum. These compounds are loosely grouped into paraffins (six   carbon chains to ten carbon chains_n-hexane, n-heptane, etc.) and light aromatics (toluene   and xylene) and come in various grades of purity. Components with up to twenty carbons are   now also being used in an effort to reduce flammability. These compounds have good   solvent properties, are relatively inexpensive (about half the price of MCF), and are readily   available from chemical distributors. When a controlled substance is used only as a diluent,   such as in automotive undercoatings, substitution using petroleum hydrocarbons can be   achieved with minor reformulation. Many of these products containing petroleum   hydrocarbons even outperform their chlorinated counterpart.   Petroleum hydrocarbons are, however, flammable, and thus cannot be used as   replacement solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable such as   electronic cleaning applications. In addition, pesticide aerosols formulated with certain   petroleum hydrocarbons must adhere to requirements imposed under the Federal Insecticide,   Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).   (2) Oxygenated organic solvents. Oxygenated organic solvents are compounds based on hydrocarbons containing   appendant oxygen (alcohols and ketones), integral oxygens (ethers), or both (esters). These   compounds are relatively inexpensive compared to MCF_about half the cost_and are readily   available from chemical distributors. These compounds are also flammable, however, and   cannot be used as substitute solvents in applications where the solvent must be nonflammable.   These compounds are currently being blended with class I substances to reduce the   amount of class I substances used in a product's formulation. Since the quantity of these   compounds is small, the product still remains nonflammable. Some manufacturers, however,   are completely reformulating products such as spot removers with ketones, esters, ethers, or   alcohols. To continue the safe use of these convenient products, consumers may have to be   educated about the product's increased flammability.   (3) Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).   HCFC141b is a potential substitute to replace CFC11 and CFC113 used in   solvent/diluent applications in aerosols and pressurized dispensers. HCFC141b's ODP is   similar to that of MCF, making it unlikely that aerosol manufacturers would reformulate their   products away from MCF towards HCFC141b.   HCFC141b has a number of characteristics that make it a suitable alternative solvent,   namely: It is nonconductive, nonflammable according to U.S. Department of Transportation   specifications, and evaporates quickly. However, HCFC141b is expensive compared to the   pretax price of CFC113_almost three times the cost. Further, HCFC141b is slightly   corrosive to plastic parts, and could not serve as a drop-in replacement for all the uses of   CFC11 and CFC113 as a solvent.   (4) Terpenes.   Terpenes are unsaturated hydrocarbons based on isoprene subunits. They have good   solvent properties and could replace ozone-depleting compounds in some solvent cleaning   applications. They are flammable, which limits their use in applications that require   nonflammable solvents. Some terpenes have a slight citrus scent while others have stronger,   unpleasant odors, making them difficult to use over an extended period of time.            "

Additionally, the   permit was publicly noticed in five (5) major cities in the   State of Florida on September 16, 1994, (Public Notice   Number 94FL0167), to allow comments from interested parties   which would be considered in the formulation of a final   decision regarding reissuance of the proposed draft NPDES   General Permit No. FLG830000.   The following parties responded with written comments on   reissuance of the proposed NPDES general permit: Florida   Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), Chevron   Research  Technology Company, Morgan Lewis  Bockius, Mobil   Oil Corporation, Exxon Company, Walt Disney World Company,   Florida Chemical Industry Council and the United States Fish   and Wildlife Service.   Comment 1: The Florida Department of Environmental   Protection (FDEP), Bureau of Waste Cleanup, submitted   comments by letter dated October 3, 1994, which commented on   Part I.A.3 of the general permit. The FDEP wanted   clarification concerning the intent of Part I.A.3. FDEP   stated that the statement on Page two (2) of the   introduction states that `` Except for facilities meeting the   conditions of Part I.3, written notice of intent to be   covered by the reissued NPDES general permit shall be   provided to the Permit Issuing Authority prior to initiation   of discharge to waters of the United States,'' implies that   this includes subparts of Part I.3., including I.3.(a), (b),   and (c). FDEP stated that this implies that for discharges   that are either uncontaminated or are contaminated with   petroleum only and are treated, notification to EPA is not   required. It was stated that this is not consistent with   the phrase under I.3(a) which states ``upon receipt of   written EPA notification of coverage that the Notice of   Intent (NOI) request is complete, these short-term   discharges may commence.'' The State mentioned that this   implies that not only must prior notification be given by   EPA for the short-term discharges from sites contaminated by   petroleum only, but that the person responsible for the   discharge must wait for a reply from EPA, and this   inconsistency should be reconciled.   Response: EPA agrees that the referenced statement on page   2 of the introduction is incorrect. It has been corrected   to read, ``except for facilities meeting the conditions of   Part I.A.3(c), written NOI to be covered by the reissued   permit shall be provided to the Permit Issuing Authority.''   Comment 2: FDEP stated that it is not reasonable to wait   for a response from EPA in order to initiate a short-term   discharge for the following reasons: (1) Chapter 62770,   requires that a Remedial Action Plan (RAP) be submitted to   the FDEP within 2 months of approval of a Contamination   Assessment Report (CAR), and that it is routine to require   pump tests to design information for the RAP, plus identify   aquifer characteristics. FDEP stated that it is not   reasonable to delay the RAP by requiring prior approval from   EPA of these simple 8 hour pump tests. (2) Due to varying   hydrogeological conditions in Florida, local departments   commonly perform dewatering activities in their right-of-way   of previous retail service stations, plus have no   information before commencing these activities on the   existence of petroleum contamination. FDEP stated that   these construction projects should not be delayed for an   extended period to wait on response from EPA, since mobile   treatment units can be deployed and designed to meet EPA's   discharge limitations in the NPDES general permit. (3)   During dewatering for construction and replacement of   underground storage tanks, FDEP mentioned that it was not   reasonable for the tank installation to be delayed for an   extended period of time; especially since discharges from   these operations only last for a few hours at a time and   mobile equipment used is very reliable in achieving EPA's   discharge standards.

SUMMARY:     OSM is approving, with an additional requirement, a proposed amendment to the Utah permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the ``Utah program'') under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). Utah proposes revisions to its rules pertaining to the scope of rulemaking and promulgation of rules, petitions to initiate rulemaking, hearing requirements for designating areas unsuitable for coal mining, confidentiality of coal exploration information, permit application requirements pertaining to blasting and hydrology, and mining in special areas, specifically prime farmland and alluvial valley floors. The amendment incorporates the additional flexibility afforded by the revised Federal regulations, clarifies ambiguities, and improves operational efficiency.                EFFECTIVE DATE:     July 11, 1994.                FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Thomas E. Ehmett, Telephone: (505) 7661486.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     I. Background on the Utah Program         On January 21, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Utah program for the regulation of coal exploration and coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands.

Monument is one of the UK's band of independent exploration and production companies. These put so much money into searching for oil that there is seldom any left to pay dividends. At the same time, the rise and fall of their share prices is tied closely to the fluctuations in world oil prices. This year oil prices are low: for UK companies forced to cope with the dollar-sterling exchange rate, they have sunk to their lowest level in real terms for 20 years. Low oil prices have pushed UK oil company stock prices into the doldrums. What is more, the stock market has started to lose faith in a long-term increase in oil prices which undermines the argument for buying into the sector in the first place. Craven-Walker would like to find a novel way of offering a pay-out to shareholders. In any case, Monument can offer more long-term value than some of its counterparts because of its stake in the Morecambe Bay field in the North Sea. This field produces gas for which there is strong UK demand at prices which are often uncoupled from the oil market. The last week has seen a small pick-up in the price of oil, giving a boost to oil sector shares. But the price rise was probably more for technical reasons than because of any strong upturn in demand and is unlikely to be sustained. Chris Fay, exploration director at Shell, has commented that the industry is working on the margin of economic viability. Most UK oil companies can make money with oil prices at around Dollars 18 a barrel but those with high costs such as Lasmo and Clyde Petroleum will struggle. At the same time, almost all exploration companies are trimming their drilling budgets this year which lowers their chances of an oil find. With the oil sector underperforming the FT-All Share index by at least 10 per cent this year, some pundits argue that oil stocks are a cheap buy. Not everyone agrees: 'The sector is bombed out, but there has been a significant change in perceptions about future oil prices. I don't think this has been fully reflected in share prices yet and they could still fall relative to the market,' said Simon Flowers, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh. County NatWest has joined many other industry observers in revising its forecast for oil prices downwards to Dollars 23 a barrel in 1997 compared with its previous estimate of Dollars 26 a barrel. It bases this on commitments by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to boost production capacity along with expectations of a slow increase in world oil demand. Money invested in oil stocks is a hedge on the future direction of oil prices in general. More specifically, investors could be expressing confidence in a small company's ability to find oil. But this is a big bet. Oil stocks, particularly the small independent exploration companies, should carry a health warning. Investors who piled into Kelt Energy when its share price hit Pounds 3 three years ago as the company looked as if it was having a successful run on exploration, have seen their holding plunge to virtually nothing today. A group of banks is running the company in a bid to recoup some of the money lent. Tullow Oil is currently generating a lot of excitement: it is focused purely on oil exploration and has enjoyed some success. Investors could easily see the value of their holdings double if the company makes a big discovery, but they could equally lose their entire stake. Shell and British Petroleum are much a safer bets on the oil price. Of these two, Shell is financially stronger and its shares are likely to continue their steady rise while dividends keep pace with inflation over the long haul. BP is more risky since if oil prices continue in their current vein, it is unlikely to be able to sustain dividend payments at current rates. In spite of the gloom over future oil prices, the sector could still prove lucrative for the strong-hearted investor. Oil prices have a tendency to confound expectations. Any political upset in the Middle East could send prices soaring while exploration stocks take off.  The Financial Times   London Page II  "

The Abu Dhabi authorities made the offer to Mr Yoshiro Nakayama, honorary chairman of Cosmo Oil, when he visited the United Arab Emirates in April, Cosmo said. Japan accounts for about half of Abu Dhabi's total crude oil exports. Negotiations are still underway, but if a deal is finalised it would help Cosmo to take its long-term goal of expanding its Middle Eastern production a step further. It has been producing oil at the Mubarraz concession in Abu Dhabi since 1973 through a joint venture company with Japan Energy. However, output at Mubarraz has been on the decline from a peak of 30,000 barrels per day in 1979 to about 15,000 b/d. An award of new exploration and development rights in Abu Dhabi could bolster Cosmo's financial performance. Exploration and production is where profits are to be made, although Japanese oil companies have concentrated on downstream operations, said Mr Nicholas Smith at Jardine Fleming. Oil companies and the Japanese government have been keen to win development rights in the Gulf to ensure a steady source of oil for the country, which has few energy resources of its own. Japan depends on the Middle East for 70 per cent of its oil imports. But Japanese equity in international oil reserves accounts for only only 13 per cent of the country's total imports. The Japanese government wants to raise this to about 30 per cent in the medium term.   Companies:-  Cosmo Oil.   Countries:-  XXZ  Abu Dhabi, Middle East.

Although electric vehicles are included under the definition of the term ``automobile'' in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, they do not consume ``fuel'' as defined in the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act.

The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial disputes involving three Asean members - Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan over the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. All six countries have claims over the islands. The disputes could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area. The meeting is the first since the January accord among the six Asean governments, which include Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand - to transform the region into a free-trade area by 2007. They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Raul Manglapus, Asean standing committee chairman and Philippines foreign affairs secretary, confirmed yesterday that the Spratly disputes will be discussed. China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to drill for oil in the disputed territories. Vietnam recently increased its campaign by wooing Malaysia with participation in an exploration venture. Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker on a reef and had authorised its army to use force if necessary to control the islands.

Australia had been helping the Philippines in the oil  exploration field.    Only recently, the Australian Government financed the survey  work on several prospective oil-bearing structures in the  Philippines .    The first report on the results of the survey was released  last month and pointed to the areas where oil reserves could  have accumulated over the years.    The drilling season is set to start next month and several  local and foreign oil exploration companies will be searching  for oil in offshore Palawan, Mindoro, and the Sulu Sea.    The Philippines depends on imported crude. Recent oil  discoveries have helped cut these imports. One of the country's  biggest oil strikes, the Linapacan oil field off Palawan,  initially produced at least 15,000 barrels a day until water  started to seep into the pipe.    Two foreign firms -- Shell Exploration and Occidental  Petroleum -- are working on the development of a much bigger oil  structure called the Malampaya field. This structure contains a  sizable amount of natural gas and crude oil.     "

Food and crude oil prices have been particularly weak over the past year, according to figures published by the Central Statistical Office. The output price index, which measures the prices of manufactured products at the factory gate, rose by 0.3 per cent between December and January. The annual rate fell back from 4 per cent in December (which included an exceptionally big jump in January 1993). If food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum are excluded, the annual increase in the 12 months to January was just 2.6 per cent. This compared with 4 per cent in the year to December. Input prices, which reflect manufacturers' costs, fell by 0.3 per cent between December and January, or 0.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis. In the 12 months to January, input prices have fallen by 2.5 per cent. The statistics may give some support to the Bank of England's decision to cut base rates last week, which the chancellor justified by saying that 'looking ahead, inflationary pressures appear subdued'. Analysts at brokers Greenwell Montagu pointed out that a downward trend in underlying prices - excluding food, beverages, tobacco and petroleum - was now firmly in place, so there should be 'good news for RPI'. January's retail prices index is published on Wednesday. Mr Peter Oppenheimer of James Capel said: 'Overall, the latest producer price data are very supportive of our view that core retail price inflation will drop below 2 per cent this year and will remain there through 1995.'

Essotier also insists that there are large reserves in  Yemen,  but conceded that the area's secrets cannot be known until  additional information is available. He says: ""We are continuing  to work on an active program of exploration in the concession  area granted to us, where we can produce some oil. We still  expect to test small setups. We are working hard and actively to  complete this, because these wells are close to our existing  facilities.""    In view of the fact that the drop in oil prices is  negatively  affecting the budget earmarked for exploration, the Canadian  company is not at present pushing to find large discoveries in  the remote parts of their concession area, which totals 37,500  square km [sq km]. Rather, it is concentrating on the smaller  discoveries, which can be incorporated economically into the  existing facilities.    It is worth mentioning that the oil fields and facilities  belonging to the Canadian company are located in the al-Masilah  region in Southern Yemen.    These facilities are connected by a 138 km pipeline south to  the port of al-Shuhayr on the coast of the Gulf of Aden.    The Canadian partner announced that, since the start of  production in September 1993, its concession area has produced  546 million barrels of oil. Production has reached an average of  135,000 barrels per day [bpd], i.e., one-third of Yemen's oil  production.    Despite Essotier's doubts that his company's production from  its producing fields will increase very much in the coming year,  he expressed optimism regarding increased oil discoveries in his  company's concession area. He said: ""There are still good  quantities, particularly in the lower strata,"" referring to the  fact that solid rock bases are located under the higher  limestone formations, where oil is usually found. He added: ""We  have one well that produces 8,000 bpd of excellent quality oil  in a natural smooth, stable flow. This indicates a broad area,  some of which is connected with others, which encourages us to  continue our activities.""    In a related development, the Canadian company is exchanging  data with other companies that control nearby concession areas,  especially with the Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimeyer companies, active  to the north and northeast of the al-Masilah fields.    With regard to the Canadian company's discoveries, those  active in the oil business think that there is a not  inconsiderable amount of oil there, but they have so far been  unable to find conclusive evidence. In April 1993, the Total  Company announced the discovery of a field that could yield  12,000 bpd, located east of al-Masilah. North of al-Masilah, the  Clyde Company is currently evaluating results, after the recent  discovery of a field located close to the Canadian company's  concession.    It is said that Lasmo has so far dug three wells in which  nothing was found, while the Nimeyer Company has just begun to  implement its digging program.    With the diminishing possibily of finding major quantities  of  oil, the oil companyies, in order to assure economic  feasibility, will be obliged to gradually intensify their  exploration programs and concentrate their efforts on small  discoveries close to their present facilities.    Nevertheless, workers in the oil business insist that even  these modest exploration efforts might be economically  unfeasible, in view of the existing agreements with the Yemeni  Government, which stipulate participation in production.

By Tad Szulc, Tad Szulc, a former foreign correspondent, has been on assignment  in Eastern Europe.      WASHINGTON      The fragile democracies of Eastern Europe are being dealt twin blows by the  petroleum crises in the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf. The sudden reality  is that these countries cannot afford to import vitally needed oil at today's  soaring prices.    Until last year, Eastern Europe -- Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania,  Bulgaria and East Germany -- depended to an overwhelming degree on Soviet  petroleum and natural-gas deliveries, financed by subsidies and barter through  Comecon, the East-Bloc common market. Eastern Europe was thus sheltered from  the great oil shocks of the '70s that hit Western economies so painfully .    When the fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe began preparing early this  year for fundamental shifts from central planning to free-market economies --  shifts calling for unprecedented austerity and social and personal sacrifices  -- they continued to enjoy cheap oil and easy eastward exports. They assumed  that the transition from the old trade patterns with the Soviets to new ones  would be long enough to cushion their economies. There seemed to be no reason  for Moscow to upset existing practices.    The crucial assumption was that oil would remain available in needed volume and  at an affordable rate. But the effects of vast economic changes in the Soviet  Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika caught East Europeans  unprepared.    Last spring the Soviets announced that starting Jan. 1, 1991, all exports to  Eastern Europe, including oil, would have to be paid at world prices and in  hard currency, such as U.S. dollars or German marks. While the Soviets promised  to pay in hard currency for East Europe imports, their purchases dropped  precipitously. Overnight, Polish potato farmers lost their Soviet markets, as  did the Hungarian manufacturers of Ikarus buses.    The hard fact was that Moscow could no longer afford to subsidize the former  satellites, desperately needing hard currency to finance its own vital imports  from the West, such as grain and high technology.    Just as East Europe countries adjusted to the hard-currency realities of their  new relations with the Soviet Union, things got worse. Domestic upheavals in  the Soviet Union cut 1989-90 petroleum production, and Moscow decided last May  to reduce its oil deliveries to Eastern Europe by about a third.    Even before the cut in shipments, the East Europeans were already calculating  that their annual hard-currency expenditures would double this year to meet the  Soviet fuel bill. Before the Persian Gulf conflict, these governments  calculated that for 1990-91 they would need at least $6 billion in additional  dollar earnings to pay for imported energy. East Germany, of course, will be  removed from immediate peril by its absorption by West Germany, now set for  Oct. 3. But elsewhere economic and social tensions have risen as retail  gasoline prices shoot up; lengthy queues at stations brought back memories of  the communist days.    There is concern that fuel shortages may diminish Western tourism, a basic  source of hard-currency for Eastern Europe. Even at July oil prices, economists  were projecting a surge in inflation and a reduction in industrial output.    In the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, world oil prices jumped from $16  to more than $30 per barrel of benchmark crude oil, rendering it virtually  impossible for East Europeans to buy the petroleum they need. Governments began  to realize that even if prices did not keep climbing, they had to rethink all  their fundamental economic planning. The only beneficiary of the new situation  was the Soviet Union, whose hard-currency income from oil exports virtually  doubled.    The worst hit were Bulgaria and Poland. Iraq was indebted to Bulgaria for $1  billion and to Poland for $500-million, in payment for large-scale engineering  works and arms, in Poland's case. Iraq was paying off the debt in crude oil;  the U.N.-imposed embargo -- fully supported by the two governments -- has  effectively shut off this source of fuel.    Under the circumstances, it should be a top priority for the United States and  its Western partners to develop measures and policies to protect Eastern Europe  from the new oil shocks. It would be morally and politically intolerable if the  Eastern European nations, newly freed from nearly 50 years of communist  dictatorship, were allowed to founder in economic chaos and social unrest as a  result of oil shortages.    The Bush Administration, aware of Poland's latest economic troubles and of the  need to prevent social unrest certain to play in the hands of rightist  political radicals, has taken preliminary measures to alleviate the oil  problem. Among them, it has sought to establish a relationship between Warsaw  and Saudi Arabia, in the hope that might help the Poles work out a favorable  import arrangement.    The Administration has also looked into the possibility that oil belonging to  Kuwait, now on ships at sea, might some way be diverted to Poland. But the  government turned down Poland's request to forgive part of its debt, fearing it  would have set an unfavorable precedent for other debtor nations. Latin  America, for example, has also been hit by rising oil prices, and carries  enormous debts.    In a worst-case scenario, the emergence of right-wing, dictatorial regimes  throughout Eastern Europe is possible if tension and frustration sweep the  region. Profound splits within democratic forces are already occuring in  several of these countries; economic catastrophes could push them over the  edge.    A concerted plan by the United States, Western Europe and Japan is urgently  needed to prop up the imperiled Eastern European democracies. Innovative  policies must be launched, or else the West risks losing Eastern Europe for a  second time in this century.

The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement, 6 Fed. Energy Guidelines 90,509 at 90,687. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Settlement Agreement.        It Is Therefore Ordered That:        The funds remitted by Murphy Oil Corp., Murphy Oil USA, Inc., and Murphy Exploration  Production Co. pursuant to the Consent Order entered into with the DOE on July 15, 1994 will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

0,FT931-2332 ,"FT931-2332 _AN-DCUAGACEFT 930320   FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: British-Borneo Petroleum surges by 73% to Pounds 7.8m      By HUGH CARNEGY   BRITISH-BORNEO Petroleum Syndicate yesterday joined the chorus of concern from oil and gas explorers about the tax changes for the sector announced in Tuesday's Budget. Reporting a 73 per cent surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.81m in the year to December 31, compared with Pounds 4.52m, the company said it would have to carry out a strategic rethink of its plans to expand significantly its activities in the North Sea. The proposals would stop companies offsetting exploration and appraisal costs against income from fields which incur Petroleum Revenue Tax, leaving them paying a net 64p for every Pounds 1 spent instead of 17p under present rules. Mr Alan Gaynor, managing director, said British-Borneo would almost certainly slow down exploration in the North Sea. He called for clarification of the government's intention to allow a two-year extension of PRT relief on existing contracts. It was not clear whether four wells British-Borneo had obligations to drill but on which work had not yet begun would qualify, he said. Revenues from oil and gas were up almost four times at Pounds 17.9m (Pounds 3.7m), outstripping for the first time revenue from the investment portfolio. Mr Gaynor said there was strong growth potential in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly in gas. He announced British-Borneo's first move into direct operating, through an operating consortium in the Gulf of Mexico with American Cometra, a subsidiary of Electrofina, and Ranger Oil of Canada. Earnings per share were down at 16.93p (19.95p), while the proposed final dividend is 4.433p, making an unchanged total for the year of 7.1p.   Companies:-  British Borneo Petroleum Syndicate.

ACTION:     Notice of proposed consent order and opportunity for public comment.              SUMMARY:     The Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) announces   a proposed Consent Order between the Department of Energy (DOE) and Murphy Oil Corporation, Murphy Oil USA, Inc. and Murphy Exploration  Production Company (Murphy). The agreement proposes to resolve matters relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations for the period January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. If this Consent Order is approved, Murphy will pay $10,700,000.00 to DOE. To distribute these monies, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals will be petitioned to implement Special Refund Procedures pursuant to 10 CFR Part 205, Subpart V, in which proceedings any persons who claim to have suffered injury from the alleged overcharges would have the opportunity to submit claims for payment.         Pursuant to 10 CFR 205.199J, ERA will receive written comments on the proposed Consent Order and will consider all comments received from the public in determining whether to accept the settlement and issue a final Order, renegotiate the agreement and issue a modified agreement as a final Order, or reject the settlement. DOE's final decision will be published in the     Federal Register    , along with an analysis of significant written comments in response to this notice, as well as any other considerations that were relevant to the final decision.          DATES:     Comments must be received by August 26, 1994.          ADDRESSES:     Interested parties are invited to submit written   comments concerning this proposed Consent Order to: Murphy Consent Order Comments, U.S. Department of Energy, Economic Regulatory Administration, GC44, 820 First Street, N.E., Suite 810, Washington, D.C. 20585. Any information or data considered confidential by the person submitting it must be identified as such in accordance with the provisions of 10 CFR 205.9(f).          FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Dorothy Hamid, Economic Regulatory Administration, Department of Energy, 820 First Street, N.E., Suite 810, Washington, D.C. 20585, (202) 5233045.          SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     Murphy is a petroleum refiner and a producer subject to the audit jurisdiction of ERA to determine compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations. During the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, Murphy engaged in, among other things, the production, sale and refining of crude oil. On February 9, 1987, Murphy and DOE entered into a Consent Order (hereinafter the 1987 Consent Order) that settled, with certain specific exceptions, all claims and disputes against Murphy by DOE for the period January 1, 1973 through January 28, 1981. The 1987 Consent Order specifically excepted, among other things, issues or claims then pending or arising out of first sales of crude oil produced and sold from properties operated by Murphy.         As a result of DOE's investigation of Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period covered by the proposed Consent Order, ERA issued a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) to Murphy on December 15, 1986. On June 17, 1992, DOE's Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) modified the PRO and issued it as a Remedial Order (RO) to Murphy.     Murphy Oil Corp    ., 22 DOE  83,005 (1992). The RO finds Murphy liable to make restitution of $13,366,664.60, plus interest to the date of restitution, for violations of the regulations applicable to first sales of domestic crude oil (10 CFR 212.72212.74), the regulations exempting from the price rules the sale of crude oil produced from ``stripper well'' properties (10 CFR 210.32 and 212.54), and the normal business practices rule (10 CFR 210.62(c)) in connection with Murphy's first sales of crude oil during the period September 1973 through December 1979. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the RO would total $67.6 million through June 1994. Murphy appealed that RO to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).     The RO also remands for further proceedings claims against Murphy pertaining to Murphy's operation of properties for which the PRO found violations during the year 1979, as well as certain crude oil properties not included within ERA's investigation of Murphy or within the PRO.     On January 24, 1994, a FERC Administrative Law Judge issued a decision and proposed order (DPO) that modified the RO and directed recalculation of the amount of restitution.     Ocean Drilling  Exploration Co., et al.    , 66 FERC 63,002 (1994). The DPO is now pending before the Commission in Docket No. RO925000. With interest, Murphy's current liability under the DPO (including ERA's estimate of Murphy's liability for previously unaudited properties and unaudited time periods (yet to be adjudicated by OHA or FERC)) totals approximately $5.2 million.     ERA has preliminarily agreed to the proposed $10,700,000 settlement as resolution of Murphy's liability for DOE regulatory violations for the period covered by the proposed Consent Order. ERA has made this tentative determination after an assessment of the risks of the current matters in litigation. Among other things, ERA has considered the risk pertaining to the following issues that Murphy has raised in its defense: whether Murphy properly applied the definition of ``property'' to certain of its offshore and onshore producing premises in the period September 1973 through August 1976; whether the largest of Murphy's offshore producing premises qualified as multiple DOE ``properties'' under DOE Rulings 19771 and 19772; whether Murphy charged prices in excess of the appropriate ceiling prices for crude oil produced from offshore and onshore properties that it operated; whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with sales of crude oil that had been taken ``in kind'' from Murphy-operated properties and sold by working interest owners; and whether Murphy should be liable for 100% of the overcharges associated with certain sales of crude oil from Murphy-operated properties as to which the federal government received a royalty interest. ERA has also considered the time and expense that would be required for the government to litigate every issue fully. Based on these factors, ERA has tentatively concluded that the resolution of its claims against Murphy for $10,700,000 is an appropriate settlement and in the public interest. Except as specifically excluded, all pending and potential civil and administrative disputes, claims and causes of action, whether or not heretofore asserted, between the DOE and Murphy relating to Murphy's compliance with the federal petroleum price and allocation regulations are resolved and extinguished by this Consent Order. Murphy and DOE mutually release each other from the claims arising under the subject matter covered by the proposed Consent Order.     Under the terms of the proposed Consent Order, Murphy is required to pay the sum of $10,700,000 within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the Consent Order and shall maintain records as are necessary to demonstrate compliance with the terms of this Consent Order.     If the settlement is not made final by the one hundred fiftieth (150th) day following execution, Murphy may withdraw from the proposed agreement.       Submission of Written Comments:        The proposed Consent Order cannot be made effective until the conclusion of the public review process, of which this Notice is a part.     All comments received by the thirtieth (30th) day following publication of this Notice in the     Federal Register     will be considered before determining whether to adopt the proposed Consent Order as a final Order. Any modifications of the proposed Consent Order which significantly alter its terms or impact will be published for additional comments. If, after considering the comments it has received, ERA determines to issue the proposed Consent Order as a final Order, the proposed Order will be made final and effective by publication of a Notice in the     Federal Register    .         Issued in Washington, D.C., on July 21, 1994.           Robert R. Nordhaus,        Acting Administrator,   Economic Regulatory Administration,   General Counsel.

The Director notes that the proposed State standards are substantively different from the Federal standards set forth at 30 CFR 846.5.  First, the Federal standard is the same for both individual civil and criminal penalties, while the State proposes two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the Federal rules, a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to either civil or criminal penalties if that individual both ``knowingly''     and     ``willfully'' authorized, ordered, or carried out the act or omission that constitutes the violation. In contrast, the State has proposed two separate standards for individual civil and criminal penalties. Under the State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent may be individually subject to criminal penalties in connection with a violation committed by the corporate permittee if the individual knowingly caused the violation. In comparison, under the State proposal, a corporate director, officer, or agent is subject to individual civil penalties if that individual commits a violation ``willfully''     or     ``negligently.''  Although North Dakota and OSM use some of the same terms in describing their standards for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties, the terms are not defined the same in the State program as they are in the Federal program. For example, the Federal definition of the term ``knowingly'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:         ``Knowingly'' means that an individual knew or had reason to know in authorizing, ordering or carrying out an act or omission on the part of a corporate permittee that such act or omission constituted a violation, failure or refusal.         In addition, the Federal definition of the term ``willfully'' at 30 CFR 846.5 reads as follows:         ``Willfully'' means that an individual acted  (1) Either intentionally, voluntarily or consciously, and  (2) With intentional disregard or plain indifference to legal requirements in authorizing, ordering or carrying out a corporate permittee's action or omission that constituted a violation, failure or refusal.         After conducting an independent review and analysis, the Director agrees with North Dakota that its proposed standards for the imposition of individual civil and criminal penalties appear to be more stringent than the Federal standards. Pursuant to section 505(b) of SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on coal exploration operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) dictate that such provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Accordingly, the Director is approving North Dakota's proposed definitions of the terms ``knowingly,'' ``willfully,'' and ``negligently'' and that portion of North Dakota's Criminal Code at section 12.10202 that contains those definitions, as incorporated at NDAC 43020105, as part of North Dakota's coal exploration program.

0,FT933-582 ,"FT933-582 _AN-DI1CRAF8FT 930928   FT  28 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Environmental promotion planned for jute      By KUNAL BOSE      CALCUTTA   A FOUR-day international consultation on jute and the environment will be held in the Hague from October 26 to promote the market for environment-friendly jute products. The consultation is being organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation with financial support from the European Community and the Rockefeller Foundation. According to an official of the Indian Jute Mills Association, the three main objectives of the consultation will be to encourage research and development in the production and marketing of environment-friendly jute products; establish closer links between the jute research laboratories and the markets; and develop marketing strategies to create an awareness of and demand for jute products. The jute goods producing countries like India, Bangladesh, China and Thailand, which believe the decline in jute demand can be arrested by projecting the environmental attributes of the natural fibre, are attaching great importance to the consultation. While jute scores over the synthetic substitutes because of its biodegradability, doubts arise about its carcinogenic attributes when the fibre is softened with petroleum products. According to the IJMA official, the problem has now been overcome with non-edible castor oil replacing petroleum as the softening agent. Following this development, the hazelnut producers in Turkey have started using hydrocarbon-free jute bags on a large scale and the Indian industry thinks that it should now be possible to convince the coffee and cocoa producers to use jute as the packaging material. The FAO meeting will try to identify marketing opportunities for jute products by taking into account 'the experience of selected exporting and importing countries', said the official. The producing countries acknowledge that they will have to bring about 'modifications in jute and kenaf products' to conform to the environment and health policies of the developed countries. Producers hope to get assistance from international agencies for environment related research and development and technological improvements.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

0,FT921-10927 ,"FT921-10927 _AN-CBDCGAB2FT 920204   FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Anglo United prepares for coal bid with sales      By ROLAND RUDD   MR DAVID MCERLAIN, chair-man of Anglo United, owner of the Coalite smokeless fuel business, has detailed his strategy for selling businesses worth about Pounds 100m which would enable him to proceed with his ambitious plan to buy British Coal's assets. The Department of Energy is studying Anglo's plan to acquire British Coal through a reverse takeover of the corporation. A new company would be established to acquire both Anglo and British Coal by issuing new shares. But Anglo does not want to acquire the corporation through borrowings and would thus like to reduce its current debt. The latest disposals will also reduce Anglo's interest payments which in the last six months totalled Pounds 16.6m. Cash generated from the planned disposals will be used to repay the largest part of the loan repayment schedule established after Anglo bought Coalite for Pounds 487m in 1989. While the present schedule is being paid from the first wave of disposals and cash generation, Mr McErlain has decided to embark on a second round of disposals to enable the group to pay back Pounds 108m - the biggest single amount owed and due in 1996, within the next 18 months. Mr McErlain is confident that he can raise about Pounds 100m, possibly within the year, by selling the following businesses: Liquid fuels, with sales of Pounds 200m and operating profits of Pounds 11.2m for the year to end-March 1991 and valued in the balance sheet for Pounds 23m, may raise some Pounds 50m by way of a flotation. If a public offer takes place Mr McErlain would maintain a 20 per cent stake so he could classify it as an associate. Chemicals, with turnover of Pounds 28m, operating profits of Pounds 5.6m and valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 7m, is lined up for a possible management buy-out for about Pounds 40m. If Anglo did proceed down this route Mr McErlain said he would want to keep 15 per cent in order to benefit from the increased productivity that MBOs normally generate. Instruments, Seaham Harbour and Pozament, with combined sales of Pounds 19.7m and operating profits of Pounds 3.8m, may be sold as a package to one entrepreneur for Pounds 3m. The Falkland Islands Company and its associated businesses on the south Atlantic Islands, with net assets of Pounds 7m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m, is on sale for about Pounds 10m. Mr McErlain has already received offers of interest.  The Financial Times   London Page 19  "
0," FR940711-2-00038   FR940711-2-00023        The OHA has applied these procedures in numerous cases since the April Notice,     e.g., New York Petroleum, Inc.,     18 DOE 85,435 (1988) (    NYP    );     Shell Oil Co.,     17 DOE 85,204 (1988);     Ernest A. Allerkamp,     17 DOE 85,079 (1988) (    Allerkamp    ), and the procedures have been approved by the United States District Court for the District of Kansas as well as the Temporary Emergency Court of Appeals. Various states filed a Motion with the Kansas District Court, claiming that the OHA violated the Stripper Well Agreement by employing presumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly calculating the refund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, Judge Frank G. Theis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety.     In re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,     671 F. Supp. 1318 (D. Kan. 1987),     aff'd,     857 F. 2d 1481 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1988). Judge Theis concluded that the Stripper Well Agreement ``does not bar [the] OHA from permitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmatively demonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.''     Id.     at 1323. He also ruled that, as specified in the April Notice, the OHA could calculate refunds based on a portion of the M.D.L. 378 overcharges.     Id.     at 132324.     The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who may have been injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of the refund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see     Office of Enforcement,     9 DOE 82,508 (1981), and     Office of Enforcement,     8 DOE 82,597 (1981). After reviewing the records submitted in support of the three Petitions, we have concluded that a Subpart V proceeding is an appropriate mechanism for distributing the $521,200.64 in funds obtained from Western, Gray and Valentine. We therefore propose to grant the ERA's Petitions and assume jurisdiction over distribution of the funds.         III. Proposed Refund Procedures         A. Refund Claims         We propose to apply the procedures discussed in the April Notice to the crude oil Subpart V proceedings that are the subject of the present determination. As noted above, the monies deposited with the DOE in settlement of the alleged crude oil violations totalling $521,200.64, plus accrued interest, are covered by this Proposed Decision. We have decided to reserve the full twenty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amount, or $104,240.13 plus interest, for direct refunds to claimants, in order to insure that sufficient funds will be available for refunds to injured parties.     The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on alleged crude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has used in Subpart V proceedings to evaluate claims based upon alleged overcharges involving refined products.     E.g., Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,     14 DOE 85,475 (1986). As in non-crude oil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumes of covered products and prove that they were injured as a result of the alleged violations. Generally, we will presume that an applicant incurred a crude oil overcharge in the purchase of a product if the product was either identified as a covered product in the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, 15 U.S.C. 751760, or if the product was purchased from a crude oil refinery or originated in a crude oil refinery and was purchased from a reseller.     Notice of General Interest Concerning DOE's Crude Oil Overcharge Refund Program,     57 Fed. Reg. 30731, 30732 (July 10, 1992);     Great Lakes Carbon Corp.,     22 DOE 85,248, at 88,662 (1993). Applicants who were end-users or ultimate consumers of petroleum products, whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry, and who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to have been injured by any alleged crude oil overcharges. In order to receive a refund, end-users need not submit any further evidence of injury beyond the volume of petroleum products purchased during the period of price controls.     See, e.g., A. Tarricone, Inc.,     15 DOE 85,495 at 88,89396 (1987). However, the end-user presumption of injury can be rebutted by evidence which establishes that the specific end-user in question was not injured by the crude oil overcharges.     See, e.g., Berry Holding Co.,     16 DOE 85,405 at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.     See, e.g., NYP,     18 DOE at 88,70103.     Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and may not rely on the presumption of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They may, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the     OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, reprinted in     6 Fed. Energy Guidelines 90,507.    Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for a crude oil refund under Subpart V.     Mid-America Dairyman Inc., v. Herrington,     878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989);     accord, Boise Cascade Corp.,     18 DOE 85,970 (1989).    As we have stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds.     E.g., Allerkamp,     17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund Application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another Application. That previously filed Application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.     Anchor Gasoline Corp.,     22 DOE 85,071 (1992); 58 Fed. Reg. 26318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed before June 30, 1994, at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants who filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.     See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co.,     21 DOE 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the     Federal Register    .         B. Payments to the Federal Government and the States         Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government, for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.     It Is Therefore Ordered That:    The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., Gibson Oil and Refining Co., and Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels, pursuant to the Consent Order signed on May 30, 1984; by Gray Trucking Company pursuant to the Consent Order signed on March 29, 1982; and by William Valentine and Sons, Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement signed on January 24, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

See, e.g., Berry Holding Co.,     16 DOE 85,405 at 88,797 (1987). If an interested party submits evidence that is sufficient to cast serious doubt on the end-user presumption, the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.     See, e.g., NYP,     18 DOE at 88,70103.     Reseller and retailer claimants must submit detailed evidence of injury, and may not rely on the presumption of injury utilized in refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They may, however, use econometric evidence of the type employed in the     OHA Report to the District Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, reprinted in     6 Fed. Energy Guidelines 90,507.    Applicants who executed and submitted a valid waiver pursuant to one of the escrows established in the Stripper Well Agreement have waived their rights to apply for a crude oil refund under Subpart V.     Mid-America Dairyman Inc., v. Herrington,     878 F. 2d 1448 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1989);     accord, Boise Cascade Corp.,     18 DOE 85,970 (1989).    As we have stated in previous Decisions, a crude oil refund applicant will only be required to submit one application for its share of all available crude oil overcharge funds.     E.g., Allerkamp,     17 DOE at 88,176. Any party that has previously submitted a refund Application in the crude oil refund proceedings need not file another Application. That previously filed Application will be deemed to be filed in all crude oil refund proceedings as the procedures are finalized. The DOE has established June 30, 1994 as the final deadline for filing an Application for Refund from the crude oil funds.     Anchor Gasoline Corp.,     22 DOE 85,071 (1992); 58 Fed. Reg. 26318 (May 3, 1993). It is the policy of the DOE to pay all crude oil refund claims filed before June 30, 1994, at the rate of $0.0008 per gallon. However, while we anticipate that applicants who filed their claims within the original June 30, 1988 deadline will receive a supplemental refund payment, we will decide in the future whether claimants that filed later Applications should receive additional refunds.     See, e.g., Seneca Oil Co.,     21 DOE 85,327 (1991). Notice of any additional amounts available in the future will be published in the     Federal Register    .         B. Payments to the Federal Government and the States         Under the terms of the MSRP, the remaining eighty percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Proposed Decision, or $416,960.51, plus interest, should be disbursed in equal shares to the states and federal government, for indirect restitution. Refunds to the states will be in proportion to the consumption of petroleum products in each state during the period of price controls. The share or ratio of the funds which each state will receive is contained in Exhibit H of the Stripper Well Agreement. When disbursed, these funds will be subject to the same limitations and reporting requirements as all other crude oil monies received by the states under the Stripper Well Agreement.     It Is Therefore Ordered That:    The refund amounts remitted to the Department of Energy by Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., Gibson Oil and Refining Co., and Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels, pursuant to the Consent Order signed on May 30, 1984; by Gray Trucking Company pursuant to the Consent Order signed on March 29, 1982; and by William Valentine and Sons, Inc., Valentine Construction, Inc., Dale L. Valentine, Verna Valentine, and James L. Marchant, pursuant to the Settlement Agreement signed on January 24, 1990, will be distributed in accordance with the foregoing Decision.

Mr O'Reilly has bought out the entire interest of Dundee Bancorp in Conroy through Columbia Investments, a company which he controls. Last month Dundee Bancorp and Outokumpu, the two principal shareholders, successfully ousted Conroy's entire board, including Mr Richard Conroy, the chairman. The two shareholders were incensed at Mr Conroy's decision last year to take over Mr O'Reilly's Atlantic Resources, an ailing oil and gas exploration company. Mr Brendan Gilmore, the new co-chairman, following Mr O'Reilly's increased stake, said: 'We are looking forward to a long-term relationship with Outokumpu at shareholder and board level.' He said that 'no commitments' had been made regarding future ore marketing arrangements but added: 'I would hope we would be able to develop a relationship which would be positive for all the shareholders.' Mr O'Reilly's beneficial interest in Conroy is now 20.5 per cent and together with Mr Conroy and 'those who are deemed to be concert parties with him' now controls a total of 28.9 per cent. The 9.025m shares held by Dundee were sold at 80p each, a substantial premium over the previous day's trading when Conroy's shares closed in London at about 50p.

The objectives of that committee are to assess and predict  the practical possibilities of future energy technologies that  are seen as important, e.g., atomic energy, solar power,  hydrogen power, and to get a grasp on how Japan's energy supply  and demand will appear 60 years from now. The following is how  the committee's report depicts Japan's energy situation in 2010.    ""The trend toward exhaustion of petroleum resources will be  conspicuous, prices will rise, and those resources will be  limited to noble uses such as for the chemical industry and  transport.""    ""There will be calls for conversion to other energy sources  because the regulations on COinf 2/inf  emissions will be  strengthened to prevent global warming. And, COinf 2/inf  recovery and processing will become more practical, though the  costs will be high.""    ""There will be more dependence on solar energy, which is a  perpetual source of energy. Because of that, basic changes in  urban social systems and lifestyles will be needed.""    ""The development and utilization of renewable and clean  energies will expand globally."" ""As for atomic energy, an  optimal nuclear fuel utilization cycle involving new types of  reactors will be established."" ""The practical use of humanity's  most revolutionary energies (nuclear fusion, solar power  generation in space) will become possible.""    As a result of those, the committee estimates that the  primary energy supply in 2010 will consist of 15 new  energies,  2-3 hydro power, 1 geothermal energy,  30-35 atomic energy,  15-17 natural gas power, and 13 petroleum  energy.

The scenario would have been far  brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public  enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. [Rupees] 4,000 crore.    This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for  1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil  Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings,  with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rashtriya Ispat Nigam  is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568  crores.    The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to  reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as  usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores  but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial  increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore.    The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall  performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that  the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104  companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores.    In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which  are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits  of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous  year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of  very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of  sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a  competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are  mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises  as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the  manufacturing and service sectors.    The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment,  in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen  only marginally from 2 percent in 1991-92 to 2.43 percent in  1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital  employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 percent to  18.02 percent.    According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the  background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public  enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In  order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to  take into account the obligations of public enterprises which  transcend the concepts of production and profits. The  performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in  view the contributions made in discharging socioeconomic  obligations, development of backward regions, provision of  public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at  administered prices.    The Survey which had taken the performance of 245  enterprises  into account, notes that the investment in these companies had  risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 percent.  Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807  crores, a 9.5 percent rise. Value added in production  enterprises also rose by 8.24 percent, from Rs. 35,212 crores to  Rs. 38,114 crores.    Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey  are, the 13.67 percent rise in gross internal resources. These  have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723  crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have  also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during  the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate  tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend  increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the  previous year.    The company with the highest investment during the year is  the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment  of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs.  10,508 crores.    In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises  during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 percent  increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores.    The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital  employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of  any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 percent in 1992-93,  compared to 104.78 percent the previous year. Group-wise  analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement  in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services,  contracts and construction, textiles and consumer goods. Another  13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium, and light  engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing.    Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various  industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses  had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the  fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564  crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs.  313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector  had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had  registered some increase in profits are coal, financial  services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows  a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for  the services sector.    On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98  enterprises entered into such agreement with their  administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were  rated as `excellent,' and 35 as `very good'.    The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest  Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during  the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public  participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of  Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting  around five percent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In  the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight percent  of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs.  3,038 crore.    Another significant development during the year was the  identification of 44 central public enterprises as being sick  following the amendment to the Sick Industrial Companies  (Special Provisions ) Act, 1985. Of these, 40 have been  registered by the BIFR [Board of Industrial Finance and  Reconstruction]].     "

""China has irrefutable sovereignty over the Spratly islands  and adjacent waters and this fact enjoys full international  legal basis,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a  weekly press briefing.    ""Oil contracts between Chinese companies and foreign  countries concerning these waters is action totally within  China's sovereignty and is therefore totally legal,"" Wu said.    Hanoi reacted strongly Wednesday to what it described as the  ""illegal"" contract signed by China and Colorado-based Crestone  Energy, warning that the deal marked a ""serious escalation of  the situation in the South China Sea."" The Spratly islands are  claimed wholly or in part by China, Vietnam, Brunei, Malaysia,  the Philippines and Taiwan. The crux of the dispute revolves  around what are believed to be vast oil deposits in the area.    Crestone had announced Tuesday that it would sink  exploratory  wells under the protection of the Chinese Navy, which has  recently stepped up its operations around the disputed island  chain. The contract provides Crestone with access to a 25,155  square kilometer (10,062 square miles) area -- the largest ever  included in a prospecting contract in Southeast Asia.    Wu also returned Hanoi's accusations that mineral  exploration  around the Spratlys constituted a violation of Vietnamese  sovereignty. ""In recent years, Vietnam has carried out a lot of  oil and gas exploration in Chinese waters. These activities are  illegal and encroach upon China's sovereignty,"" Wu said.    Historical enemies China and Vietnam normalised diplomatic  relations in November 1991 after a 12-year freeze, agreeing at  the time to peacefully settle border disputes through  negotiations. But mutual suspicion and allegations of violating  bilateral understandings have continued to strain relations,  with rival claims to the Spratly and Paracel islands the main  point of contention.

Repsol said it was delighted with the results, 'particularly if one compares them with the rest of the sector'. Operating profits fell nearly Pta10bn to Pta119.8bn, while cash-flow, after tax, fell 10.4 per cent to Pta154.06bn. The Spanish government is planning to place up to 40m shares in Repsol - roughly 13.3 per cent of the group - with institutions in the Spanish and international markets before the end of May. The flotation could raise close to Dollars 1bn and, if fully used, will reduce the state's holding from 54.5 per cent to just over 40 per cent. Repsol said it had managed to squeeze the most out of a difficult year thanks to good returns on some recent investments and the impact of a tough cost reduction programme. The group had shed nearly 2,000 jobs over the year, bringing the workforce to 19,632 people. It posted a 77 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta18.6bn in its exploration and production division thanks, it said, to exploration successes and to a 20 per cent increase in crude production. As expected, however, Repsol's troubled chemicals division continued to suffer along with the rest of the international chemicals industry, losing Pta7.9bn after making a meagre operating profit of Pta1.2bn in 1991. The Repsol refining and marketing division saw operating income fall more than 16 per cent to Pta86.6bn partly because of new accounting rules, partly because it is having to shed service stations belonging to the Campsa group under EC monopoly rules and, lastly, because of tighter margins for refined products in international markets.

0,FT944-1438 ,"FT944-1438 _AN-ELTDSAECFT 941220   FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Premier Cons confirms talks over Pict stake      By CHRISTOPHER PRICE   A bid battle among Britain's independent oil exploration companies was signalled yesterday when Premier Consolidated Oilfields confirmed it was in discussions to buy a 48.3 per cent stake in Pict Petroleum, as part of a Pounds 80m full offer for its smaller rival. Premier is negotiating with Amerada Hess, the US oil and gas exploration group, to buy the shares it has held since 1987. As part of a possible deal, Amerada would trade its holding for a stake in Premier and subscribe for further shares to a maximum of 25 per cent. Last night, Mr John Lander, Pict managing director, said: 'We have been notified by Amerada Hess of their discussions with Premier, but as such we have not had any approach.' He refused to comment further on any ramifications of an offer from Premier. Premier said that any offer would be made on the basis of the group's relative share prices at the close of trading last Friday. Pict shares were then 141p, while Premier stood at 21 1/2 p. Premier added: 'Any offer for Pict is unlikely to value the company at a significant premium to that price.' Yesterday, Pict shares closed 14p up at 155p, valuing the company at Pounds 80m, while Premier shares finished 1 1/2 p up at 23p. Analysts said that at this level of valuation, an all-paper offer would probably involve about seven Premier shares for every one Pict, giving Amerada a stake of about 24 per cent in Premier. In the event of an offer, the US group would pay 30p a share to increase its stake to the 25 per cent ceiling. Mr Iain Reid, oil analyst at SG Warburg, said: 'At this price, this deal does not reflect the upside in Pict's drilling programme. We feel a more appropriate offer should be nearer the Pounds 2 a share level.'   Companies:-  Premier Consolidated Oilfields.     Pict Petroleum.     Amerada Hess Corp.

R. 645201110 and 645201120 to provide that only coal exploration operations on lands which are not subject to 43 CFR parts 34803487 will be regulated by the Division is thus an appropriate limitation on the Division's regulatory authority and is consistent with the corresponding limitation in the Federal regulations.    In addition, although the specific responsibilities of a State regulatory authority in administering the coal exploration program within a State are not addressed in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 772 for coal exploration, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1) requires each State to have enacted and promulgated laws and regulations which will allow the State to implement, administer, and enforce its program, and to regulate coal exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations in accordance with SMCRA. Utah's proposed regulations at Utah Admin. R. 645200220 and 645200230, specifying the regulatory responsibilities of the Division, are thus consistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 731.14(c)(1).    Therefore, based on the foregoing discussion, the Director finds that Utah Admin.

None of the revisions that Utah proposed to make in its amendment pertained to air or water quality standards. Therefore, OSM did not request EPA's concurrence with the proposed amendment. However, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), OSM solicited comments on the proposed amendment from EPA (administrative record No. UT891). EPA responded by letters dated February 15 and June 8, 1994 (administrative record Nos.

With the petroleum companies  having achieved a significant improvement in performance,  central public enterprises recorded a 44 per cent increase in  net profits during 1992-93. The scenario would have been far  brighter, but for the fact that losses by sick public  enterprises had mounted to nearly Rs. 4,000 [rupees] crore.    This is disclosed in the Public Enterprises Survey for  1992-93 which was presented in Parliament today. The Indian Oil  Corporation (IOC) heads the list of profitable undertakings,  with a net profit of Rs. 935 crores, while Rastriya Ispat Nigam  is the highest loss-making concern with a net loss of Rs. 568  crores.    The net profit for the year had risen by Rs. 1,040 crores to  reach Rs. 3,395 crores during the year. The petroleum sector, as  usual, is responsible for the lion's share with Rs. 551 crores  but non-oil sector companies also achieved a substantial  increase in net profit estimated at Rs. 489 crore.    The impact of the loss-making enterprises on the overall  performance of the public sector is indicated by the fact that  the net profits of 131 enterprises is Rs. 7,346 crores while 104  companies suffered Rs. 3,950.50 crores.    In an analysis of the performance of non-oil companies which  are not sick, the Survey finds that these have shown net profits  of Rs. 1,798 crores compared to Rs. 1,574 crores the previous  year. The study had been carried out to exclude the effect of  very high profits of the oil enterprises and the large losses of  sick companies and evaluates performance of other units in a  competitive environment. It concludes that sick enterprises are  mainly responsible for low profitability of public enterprises  as these account for net losses of Rs. 2,524 crores in the  manufacturing and service sectors.    The Survey notes that the overall net return on investment,  in terms of ratio of net profit to capital employed, had risen  only marginally from 2 per cent in 1991-92 to 2.43 per cent in  1992-93. The gross profit, when viewed as percentage of capital  employed, also shows a marginal decline from 18.83 per cent to  18.02 per cent.    According to the Survey, this has to be viewed in the  background of the multi-dimensional objectives of public  enterprises and the divergent constraints faced by them. In  order to be fair to them, it is felt, it will be necessary to  take into account the obligations of public enterprises which  transcend the concepts of production and profits. The  performance of public enterprises had to be evaluated keeping in  view the contributions made in discharging socio-economic  obligations, development of backward regions, provision of  public utility services and selling basic inputs or products at  administered prices.    The Survey which had taken the performance of 245  enterprises  into account, notes that the investment in these companies had  risen by Rs. 11,526 crores, an increase of 8.5 per cent.  Similarly, gross sales had recorded an improvement of Rs. 12,807  crores, a 9.5 per cent rise. Value added in production  enterprises also rose by 8.24 per cent, from Rs. 35,212 crores  to Rs. 38,114 crores.    Other highlights: Other highlights of the Survey  are, the 13.67 per cent rise in gross internal resources. These  have increased by Rs. 1,780.51 crores, to reach Rs. 14,723  crores from Rs. 12,942 crores last year. Export earnings have  also risen by Rs. 1,366 crores to touch Rs. 10,345 crores during  the year. Contribution to the exchequer in the form of corporate  tax, Excise duty, Customs and other duties and dividend  increased by Rs. 2,136 crores from Rs. 19,951 crores the  previous year.    The company with the highest investment during the year is  the National Thermal Power Corporation with a total investment  of Rs. 17,700 crores followed by Coal India Limited with Rs.  10,508 crores.    In absolute terms, the gross profit of public enterprises  during the year had risen by Rs. 2,303 crores, a 17 per cent  increase from Rs. 13,675 crores in 1991-92 to Rs. 15,978 crores.    The Survey notes that the ratio of net turnover to capital  employed brings out the efficiency of utilisation of funds of  any enterprises. This had fallen to 95.77 per cent in 1992-93,  compared to 104.78 per cent the previous year. Group-wise  analysis, however, indicates that there had been an improvement  in the ratio in eight sectors, including tourist services,  contracts and construction textiles and consumer goods. Another  13 sectors had shown a decline, including medium and light  engineering, petroleum and trading and marketing.    Providing an overall picture of profit and loss in various  industry groups, the Survey notes that the steel sector losses  had fallen by Rs. 430 crores. On the other hand, losses of the  fertiliser sector had risen from Rs. 394 crores to Rs. 564  crores while the textiles industry losses had increased from Rs.  313 crores to Rs. 572 crores. Profits of the petroleum sector  had risen by Rs. 551 crores, while other sectors which had  registered some increase in profits are coal, financial  services, and telecom. The manufacturing sector as a whole shows  a rise in a profit of Rs. 530 crores against Rs. 510 crores for  the services sector.    On memoranda of understanding (MOUs), it is stated that 98  enterprises entered into such agreement with their  administrative Ministries during the year. Of these, 34 were  rated as `excellent,' and 35 `very good.'    The Survey says that a major initiative to disinvest  Government shareholding in public sector units was taken during  the year in order to raise resources, encourage wider public  participation and promote greater accountability. An amount of  Rs. 1,912 crores was mobilised during the year by disinvesting  around five per cent equity holding of 16 public enterprises. In  the previous year, the Government had disinvested eight per cent  of the shareholding in 30 enterprises at a total value of Rs.  3,038 crore.    Another significant development during the year was the  identification of 44 central public enterprises as being sick  following the amendment to the Sick Industrial Companies  (Special Provisions) Act 1985. Of these, 40 have been registered.      "

For generations the great British moaner has been an object of ridicule and even the target of a wartime advertising campaign, Don't Be A Moaning Minnie. Top of the list for the professional grouser are public services such as British Rail and the privatised utilities including British Telecommunications. The Cabinet Office Citizen's Charter Unit wants them to use consumer complaints to improve services. Mr David Davis, the junior public service minister, said yesterday: 'Complaints are a valuable management tool in identifying weak areas in service provision.' He was launching a Complaints Task Force to help the public services improve their handling of disgruntled customers. An earlier task force set sail to the south Atlantic to liberate the Falkland Islands from the Argentinian invader. This task force also has a hard mission - to come up with the perfect complaints system. Mr Davis said people in the public services should not be defensive about complaints but should see them as an opportunity to improve themselves. He should know. After complaints about the chancellor's management of the economy he was promoted in the recent cabinet reshuffle from junior whip to his new post as Lord Whitelaw's deputy. He has already been tipped as a future prime minister. It is a far cry from Mrs Thatcher's heyday, when Mr Bernard Ingham, then No 10's irascible press supremo, used to lambast the moaning minnies who complained about unpopular government decisions. He once memorably likened Lord Pym, then lord president, to Mona Lott for expressing mild dissidence. The Citizen's Charter Unit helpfully provided examples of how responding positively to complaints had improved particular services. The Employment Service had redesigned its offices so that 'customers' (the unemployed) could enjoy more privacy during interviews with staff. This was in response to complaints from the customers that other people were listening in when they were discussing their personal details. How had the complaint been identified? By listening in on the customers, of course. Lady Wilcox, the businesswoman who has been making waves at the National Consumer Council, will command the new task force. She will lead a six-person team of ombudspeople and customer service specialists in drawing up a whinger's charter. She wants to make sure that the Citizen's Charter is about more than being 'fobbed off with a fiver' when things go wrong. 'People want to know that their complaints will lead to the service being improved,' she said. She may, however, be misjudging why the British are so fond of complaining. As Mona Lott used to say: 'It's being so miserable as keeps us going.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9651 Regulation of Miscellaneous Commercial Sectors.

The company also benefited from improved product margins in Latin America and cost-cutting. Excluding charges of Dollars 300m for accounting changes last year, first-quarter earnings rose 20 per cent to Dollars 278m, or 97 cents a share, from Dollars 232m, or 80 cents. The company reported a net loss of Dollars 68m, or 36 cents, in the 1992 quarter, including the charges. Revenues slipped to Dollars 8.5bn in the first three months of 1993, from Dollars 8.6bn the previous year. On Wall Street, shares in Texaco firmed Dollars  3/4 to stand at Dollars 63 5/8 at the close. Mr Alfred DeCrane, who recently replaced Mr James Kinnear as chief executive, said: 'Texaco has been able to contain its costs and expenses and maintain its operational competitiveness through improvements in its business processes.' Higher prices for crude oil and natural gas, and lower operating expenses, helped Texaco's operating earnings from domestic exploration and production soar to Dollars 133m, from Dollars 86m a year ago. Earnings from US manufacturing and marketing fell to Dollars 53m, from Dollars 78m last year, reflecting a glut of supply which depressed refinery margins on the east coast and Gulf of Mexico coast. In contrast, Texaco's west coast operations had improved margins. International exploration and production profits slipped to Dollars 79m in the 1993 quarter, from Dollars 102m. Last year's earnings benefited from currency gains of Dollars 29m from lower UK deferred taxes. Stronger margins in Latin America and the Caltex operating area lifted Texaco's international manufacturing and marketing earnings to Dollars 123m from Dollars 81m. Texaco's petrochemical operations lost Dollars 7m in the 1993 quarter, compared with earnings of Dollars 8m a year earlier.   Companies:-  Texaco Inc.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Russia Has Separated Itself from Integration  Processes in the Central Asian Region""]    [Text] Russian political scientists, diplomats,  strategists, and publicists speak about Central Asia as ""a zone  of Russia's vital interests,"" about ""Russia's foreign political  priorities"" in the region, etc. To look at the region's economic  problems in depth, from at least two sides--both the Russian and  the Central Asian--is the intention of this article.    Viewpoint    Economic interdependence and, correspondingly, the need for  close economic cooperation are such obvious things that it is  awkward even to recall them. Russia and Central Asia are parts  of a unified national economic complex of the former USSR. This  complex was formed as a system with elements that supplement one  another. The region is largely the source of a number of raw  material resources that are either completely lacking in Russia  or exist in insufficient quantities. The extremely large  copper-porphyry, pyrite and stratiform deposits of Central Asia  and the Transcaucasus lay beyond the borders of Russia. The  situation was no better with respect to a number of other  mineral-raw material resources. Russia has insignificant  reserves of copper, manganese, chromites, strontium ores,  germanium, potassium salts, etc. It is also necessary to mention  cotton here. Russia's main supplier of it was Central Asia (with  Russia's demand for 1,175,700 tonnes, Uzbekistan alone provided  544,000 tonnes). This list could easily be continued.    Not only Russia depends on deliveries from the post-Soviet  ""South""; Central Asian countries are interested in them as well.  Coal from the Kazakhstan Ekibastuz is intended for heating and  electric power plants operating on the territory of Russia. The  Karaganda Metallurgical Combine delivers to Russia about 2  million tonnes of rolled metal a year. The problem of selling  these and other products will inevitably arise if exports to  Russia are excluded.    The existing organizational forms of economic cooperation  between Russia and states of the post-Soviet Central Asia are  developing (true, without very good results) within the  framework of the CIS: An Economic Union of CIS States has been  created, a number of interstate organs have been  instituted--Interstate Bank, Interstate Council on Questions of  Industrial Policy, etc. Cooperation is developing at the level  of enterprises and branches. There is also a future for such  forms as economic interaction at the level of border oblasts  (for example, Omsk Oblast of Russia and Pavlodar Oblast of  Kazakhstan).    But one gets the impression that the Central Asian states,  while not destroying economic ties with Russia willfully, are  trying to find an alternative to them, working within other  organizational frameworks with states of the world South. Russia  is jealous of this, but itself is exerting no active or positive  resistance to it.    In my view Russia should take a considerably more active  part  in the regional and interregional organizations in whose work  the states of the post-Soviet Central Asia have already become  involved.    One of these organizations is the Organization of Caspian  States (OPG, created in February 1992). Representatives of Iran,  Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia participated in  its creation. The degree of interest of the aforementioned  states in this organization is shown also by the level of  representation at the constituent assembly: The first three  states were represented by the president, the fourth--by a  deputy prime minister, and the fifth (Russia)--by the ambassador  to the Islamic Republic of Iran. There is no need to enumerate  the problems that could be resolved simply through joint  efforts: raising the level of the Caspian, ecology, extraction  of oil in the open sea, on the shelf, and along the coast,  fishing, etc. Russia's passiveness could quite well be regarded  as one of the reasons why nothing has come of the OPG so far and  the aforementioned states are cooperating (if they are  cooperating) in the aforementioned areas either on a bilateral  or multilateral basis or within the framework of associations  that do not include Russia.    Another example is the Organization for Economic Cooperation  (OES, sometimes designated as EKO), which initially (since  1984-1985) included Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. With the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, all the Central Asian states  and also Azerbaijan joined the OES. Russia became a kind of  initiator of maximum self-isolation from the OES. Moreover, the  Central Asian states were given an ultimatum: either economic  cooperation with Russia or participation in the OES. Not to  mention the fact that the condition for Russian-Central Asian  cooperation given above is insulting and unacceptable to the  independent states of Central Asia, the question could have been  posed differently. Why should Russia not join the OES? As far as  I can judge, the OES regulations do not preclude that.    In order to give a full picture it is necessary to mention  the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Zone (ChZES) created in 1992,  in which both Russia and a number of states interested in  cooperation in the neighboring Central Asia region (Turkey,  Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia) participate. The coordination  of this regional organization, to which Russia pays considerably  more attention than to the one mentioned above, can be  facilitated by untying several knots right in Central Asia.    Integration processes in Central Asia itself is a topic unto  itself. They began ""reactively,"" they were forced--as a  completely natural reaction to the creation of the CIS as a  quasi-Slavic association. Subsequently this separation and  intraregional consolidation were reinforced by plans for a  Russian-Ukrainian-Belarusian economic alliance and zigzags in  Russian policy regarding post-Soviet Central Asia. True, the  integration processes are extremely weak. It is difficult to  imagine Russia's participation in these processes.    The plans to create new transportation communications  (railroads and highways, pipelines, etc.) are a visible sign of  future trends in economic cooperation. The building of  communications routes tells us considerably more than serious  agreements and widely announced declarations.    One Central Asian leader noted: ""Previously all roads to the  East (from Europe--A.I.) passed through Moscow."" Now the new  states of the region are looking for different roads, which very  frequently bypass Russia.    The program of the Commission of European Communities (CEC),  which is oriented toward the creation of a combined (rail,  ferry, and sea) transportation corridor ""Europe--Caucasus--Asia""  is very attractive to the Central Asian states. The main route  would bypass Russia--along the line of  Almaty-Ashgabat-Turkmenbashi (formerly  Krasnovodsk)-Baku-Poti/Batumi.    Each Central Asian country is exerting a fair amount of  effort to create its own transportation access to communications  centers of world significance. Thus Kazakhstan, having  established rail communications long the route of  Almaty-Beijing, is intending to extend this route to the  territories of Turkmenistan, Iran, and Turkey, in order to reach  Western Europe. Turkmenistan is speeding up the construction of  the railroad route of Tedzhen-Serakhs-Mashkhad, which will make  it possible to link this Central Asian country to Tehran,  Ankara, and West European capitals. Iranian territory with  renewed communications in the interests of Turkmenistan will  become for the latter a kind of bridge to the Persian Gulf and  the Indian Ocean. Through Kazakhstan, which is joined by  railroad to China (Beijing), it is also possible to gain access  to the Far East--the Asia-Pacific region (APR). Turkmenistan is  also exerting efforts to create a gas line through  Turkmenistan-Iran-Turkey-West Europe. Turkmenistan leaders also  dream of laying a gas line to Southeast Asia, China, and Japan.  Pakistan is prepared to open routes to the Indian Ocean for  Central Asian states.    Regional communications could be affected by the  implementation of an agreement between Turkey and Azerbaijan for  the creation of a petroleum line, which will make it possible to  transport Azerbaijani petroleum to a terminal on the Turkish  coast of the Mediterranean Sea: Azerbaijan--Northern  Iran--Nakhichevan--Turkey (Erzurum--the region of the  Syrian-Turkish border--Yumurtalik).    The plan for transporting oil through a pipeline from the  oil  region of Tengiz (western Kazakhstan) to Novorossiysk is  promising and mutually advantageous for both Kazakhstan and  Russia. But there are serious obstacles to the implementation of  this plan, the main one being Turkish interests: In the first  place, since 1990 (because of UN sanctions against Iraq, which  was prohibited from trading in oil in the full volume) the  petroleum terminal of Yumurtalik on the Mediterranean Sea and  the petroleum pipeline leading up to it have been inactive and  Turkey is trying to put them to work; second, Turkey (largely  because of the preceding factor but also because of a real  concern for the ecological situation in the densely populated  regions) is trying to prohibit large tankers containing oil from  passing through the Bosphorus. If these Turkish interests (or  one of them) are honored, the significance of the petroleum  terminal in Novorossiysk will drop sharply. And oil from Tengiz  could go not to Novorossiysk but to Turkey, changing the  aforementioned route somewhat: Tengiz-Azerbaijan-Northern  Iran-Azerbaijan (Nakhichevan)-Turkey (Mediterranean Sea coast).  As far as one can judge, in this case too it is necessary to  observe Russian interests: On the one hand, the petroleum  pipeline should not extend through the recreation zone or the  productive agricultural land in the south of Russia; on the  other hand, Russia itself could hook up to this petroleum  pipeline for its own advantage. This kind of untangling of  communications problems which is convenient both for Russia and  for the Central Asian states in the newly formed geopolitical  and economic space is possible, apparently, in other cases as  well, say, with the utilization of mechanisms for regional and  interregional economic cooperation.    Thus Russia will undoubtedly be able to derive an advantage  for itself from the existence of the transportation corridor  ""Europe-Caucasus-Asia."" It could hook up to railroad lines  through Chelyabinsk, and then the possibilities of the  Transsiberian main line would also be taken advantage of. For  many reasons the new Astrakhan-Kizlyar-Baku railroad line would  not be superfluous either. Through the Caspian, Russia could  join transportation flows along the Astrakhan-Baku route. One  gets a sense of satisfaction that Russia is participating in the  actions for coordinating the program (as an equal with the  Transcaucasian and Central Asian states and also Iran, Turkey,  China, Pakistan, Ukraine, and the states included in the CEC).    There is a mutual interest in having Russia supply the armed  forces of the Central Asian states with various kinds of  weapons, military equipment, and ammunition. All these products  of the military-industrial complex can come only from Russia: It  supervised the formation of the infrastructure, combat  regulations, tactics--everything the armies of the newly  independent states of Central Asia have inherited; further, the  products are cheaper than in the West and of better quality than  the Chinese, which coincide with ours in terms of many  tactical-technical characteristics; regular deliveries are  guaranteed; some of the states of Central Asia in cooperation  with Russia could produce their own arms (from cartridges in  Kyrgyzstan to aircraft of the AWACS type in Uzbekistan).    As for Russia's interests, they include above all the  availability of a large and promising market for selling  products of the military-industrial complex, cooperation with a  number of enterprises of the Central Asian military-industrial  complex, the use of testing grounds (especially Baykonur), and  the acquisition of important military-strategic raw material.    Military cadres are a promising area of cooperation. At the  present time there is a critical shortage of officers  representing the ""titular"" population in the formation of armies  of the Central Asian states. Russians and other Slavs make up  from 70 to 90 percent of the officer corps. It will take at  least several years to create a highly professional officer  corps from local residents (again, not without help from Russian  instructors and military training institutions). The service of  Russian officers in armies of the states of Central Asia will  help Russia to relieve a fairly critical problem of returning  military servicemen to Russian territory.    In addition to the already tested forms of cooperation it  would be possible to consider the following as well: The search  for new forms of regional collective security (naturally, with  the mandatory participation of Russia and, possibly, enlisting  certain adjacent states); expansion of bilateral cooperation  (for example, in the form of legal documentation with interstate  agreements of Russia's military presence with Russian military  bases); the transformation of collective (and essentially mainly  Russia) forces into real coalition armed forces intended for  protecting all the former border of the USSR in the Central  Asian region; development of contract service for Russian  citizens in armies of Central Asian states. It is not ruled out  but rather suggested that there be military cooperation within  the framework of the CSCE and the United Nations.     "

But Only A Real Manager Can Extract It From There""]    [Text] It is an indisputable fact, as they say, that the  fuel service base in the army and navy has come to a halt in its  development. Most of it was built more than 30 years ago, during  the missile-fuel boom, when the fuel service provided full  support for the launching of missiles into space, the emergence  of the navy onto the world ocean and increased motorization of  the army. The base has recently become fairly obsolete, however,  and since the collapse of the Union it has found itself in an  altogether critical state.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA raised the need to renew this very important  material base at the beginning of last year. The report was  titled ""Where Are We to Get Two and a Half Billion?"" Today, in  view of the fact that we have not managed to solve the problem  and that prices have spiraled to hundreds of times what they  were, a trillion would not be enough. Just what can be done?    Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention. The  solution was made easier by the fact that the interests of the  fuel service coincided with the nation's economic interests.  More precisely, those of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, which  has recently begun experiencing a shortage of containers and  pumping equipment, and simply of space. In the armed forces, on  the contrary, due to a shortage of fuel and lubricants (caused  by inadequate financing), fuel bases and depots are idle, and  everything is being off-loaded directly into the military units  and onto the ships. Incidentally, empty containers corrode more  rapidly.... So why not help the Ministry of Fuel and Energy with  the transfer, storage and distribution of petroleum products,  and thereby earn some money for improving and renovating the  materials and equipment base?    The Central Missile Fuel Directorate came out with an  initiative to this effect. And it was supported by the Rear  Services of the Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defense, and  then by higher authorities. Decree No. 219, ""On the Construction  of and the Renovation of Operating Petroleum Transshipment  Facilities,"" issued by the government on 14 March 1993,  specifically authorized the Fuel Service of the Armed Forces to  take part in this undertaking. In other words, the military  bases and depots were given the opportunity to provide services  for outside, civilian organizations for a charge and without  detriment to the combat training.    In accordance with this decree, the Minister of Defense of  the Russian Federation issued Order No. 355 on 15 July of last  year, with an appendix listing the bases and depots authorized  to provide services, and also containing complete regulations on  their activities.    What do these documents say? I took this question to  Major-General P. Gorupay, chief of the Central Missile Fuel  Directorate of the Ministry of Defense.    ""These documents are extremely important to us,"" Pavel  Ivanovich said. ""They are based on an agreement between the base  and an outside organization. They include a list of services,  diverse services: The transfer of liquid petroleum products from  reinforced concrete tanks to the reservoirs of bases and depots,  the unloading of apportioned fuel into storage facilities and at  open sites, the chemical analysis of oil, technical assistance  with the accounting, the allocation of vehicles for hauling the  fuel, the provision of depot sites and containers for storing  various materials, and so forth. The charges for the services  are open but no lower than the current market prices in the  given area. Rigid monitoring is specified to prevent possible  violations.""    I was told at the Central Directorate that there is rapid  development of the fuel service for the Moscow, Volga and  Leningrad districts, the Northern and Baltic Fleets. The  military fuel base located at Murmansk, for example, concluded a  one-year agreement with the Murmansk Maritime Shipping Line on  the transferring of petroleum products. Payments under the  agreement should amount to more than one million dollars.    For six months now a Baltic Fleet fuel base has been  transferring fuel belonging to a large joint enterprise--under  an agreement permitting this, of course--with visible results. A  major overhaul of the railroad platform and the pipeline have  been carried out with the several million dollars earned,  several pumping units have been installed with the assistance of  the Swedes, and the installation of standing tanks is underway.    Even a service on a lesser scale is profitable. The central  base located at Naro-Fominsk has concluded an agreement with one  of the enterprises whereby incoming motor transport equipment is  off-loaded and stored on the latter's tracks. The amount  involved is 600,000 rubles per day. The base at which A. Kustov  is chief does not have much space, but it is within the Moscow  city limits. He said that an agreement has been reached on the  storage of expensive assemblies and devices, for which the  charge is considerably greater....    In short, the minister's order has opened up extensive  possibilities. Some people have taken it the wrong way, however.  Some of them are in no rush to execute it. There is plenty of  time, they say, and have not taken the initiative to look for  customers. There have also been overly clever ""executives.""  Colonel V. Basalayev, chief of a fuel dump, conducted operations  involving petroleum products for a joint-stock company not at  the market price, as should have been the case, but at a  preferential price. There would have to be some abuses, of  course. This incident was rapidly halted, and all of the fuel  services were apprised of it.    Additional problems arose for the fuel service. Additional  personnel are needed for organizing the services and for strict,  universal monitoring: Financial experts, economists, legal  experts and others. This was taken into account in the order  issued by the Minister of Defense. A group consisting of three  officers and two civilian employees is being added to the T/O of  the Central Directorate, to be maintained out of income from the  services provided. The group exists only on paper for now, to be  sure. It has been impossible thus far to arrange all of the  necessary formalities.     "
0,FT932-13820 ,"FT932-13820 _AN-DDVCCAAKFT 930422   FT  22 APR 93 / Red Cross urges control of 'callous' landmines      By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent   THE International Committee of the Red Cross yesterday launched a campaign to focus arms control efforts on one of the most common and callous of weapons, the anti-personnel landmine. A symposium aimed at increasing awareness about the effects of mines, reckoned to cause 800 deaths and 450 injuries every month, is being held this week in Montreux, Switzerland. The initiative has come from Red Cross and Red Crescent medical staff who see mines being used increasingly to terrorise civilian populations. Dr Robin Coupland, a British surgeon with the Geneva-based organisation, said records from five ICRC hospitals in Asia and Africa showed that, out of more than 17,000 war-wounded patients, 24 per cent were mine victims. A third of these needed one or both legs amputated. The aim is to build up pressure on governments ahead of a review of the 1981 United Nations convention covering 'inhumane' weapons. A conference, which France's President Francois Mitterrand called for while visiting Cambodia in February, could be held at the end of the year. The convention restricts the indiscriminate use of mines. But it applies only to international conflicts, and many countries including Britain and the US have yet to ratify it. Although the ICRC is not tabling specific proposals, suggestions for strengthening control include the prohibition of certain kinds of mine, regulation of manufacture and an export ban. Mr Ed Cairns, a policy adviser to Oxfam, the British overseas aid organisation, said: 'The onus is on governments that oppose such measures to come up with alternative solutions to protect civilian populations.' The US Congress last October introduced a one-year moratorium on exports of anti-personnel mines. The former Soviet Union and China are the biggest supp-liers among more than 35 countries making mines. Italy's role as leading western European supplier was highlighted in early 1991 when seven executives of the company Valsella Meccanotecnica were convicted for illegally exporting 9m mines to Iraq in the 1980s. Anti-personnel mines come in two main categories: blast mines, detonated just beneath the surface, and fragmentation mines, which explode above ground, hurling metal fragments or ball bearings. Types range from the pocket-sized Russian 'butterfly' mine, widely found in Afghanistan, to the Italian Valmara 69 used by the Iraqis, which bounces into the air and fires 1,000 metal splinters over about 25 metres. Small mines known as 'toe-poppers' are designed to maim rather than kill, with the idea that a wounded soldier will require assistance from several others. Detection and clearance is made much harder by modern plastic mines with only tiny metal components. The number of uncleared mines across the world is estimated at more than 100m. In the Falkland Islands, for example, 11 years after the UK-Argentine conflict there are reckoned still to be about 15 mines per head of population. In former Yugoslavia mines are expected to pose a threat for decades.   Countries:-  CHZ  Switzerland, West Europe.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The Gold Mine on the Mekong River's  Bank""]    [Summary] ""Somphong Mongkhonvilai, vice chairman of the  Laos Commission for Cooperation and Planning, confirmed that the  LPDR [Lao People's Democratic Republic] is quite rich in natural  resources compared to other countries in this region. At  present, forests cover 47 percent of the total area of the  country. Geographically speaking, Laos can build as many as 18  hydroelectric dams with a combined production of electricity of  14,000 megawatts. Forty percent of the water in the Mekong River  comes from Lao territory."" French geologists have confirmed  that huge deposits of over 10 precious minerals were found in  different parts of the country.    Dr. Wiraphong Ramangkun, former economic advisor to the Lao  Government and secretary of the Thai-Lao Friendship Association,  disclosed that the lignite deposit discovered in the area of  Hong Sa Special Zone ""is three times larger than that of  Thailand's Mae Mo mine and sufficient for electricity production  for up to 60 years""    Moreover, zinc, tungsten, and gypsum can also be found in  large quantities in Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang, and Xieng  Khwang Provinces while blue sapphire is also plentiful in Bokeo  Province. Phadaeng Industry Company of Thailand reported the  discovery of additional huge deposits of zinc and other minerals  in southern Laos, while a French oil exploration company is  considering the commercial viability of tapping the country's  petroleum resources.    ""Speaking about the advantage of Laos' geographic location,  Somnouk Khaiy-gnavong, deputy secretary general of the Lao  National Trade and Industries Council and former director  general of Laos' National Economic and Social Development  Planning Department, said Laos shares common borders with five  countries namely Thailand, China, Burma, Vietnam, and Cambodia.  Therefore, it can serve well as a trade center for this region.""    Laos' first four-year economic development, covering the  period from 1981 to 1985 was designed to heal the wounds of war.  The second economic development plan, 1986 to 1990,  concentrated on promoting the free trade system and establishing  a strong currency. The year 1989 saw bright economic prospects  as a result of the influx of foreign investment. The current  third development plan, according to Somphong Mongkhonvilai,  emphasizes the endeavors to tap and fully exploit the country's  natural resources and bring about self-sufficiency to Laos.  Under this development plan, 1991-1995, Laos will find ways to  attract more foreign investors and promote production of goods  for domestic consumption to alleviate the country's dependence  on imports.    ""The drafting of the fourth economic development plan  (1996-2000) is complete. The blueprint is currently under  scrutiny by the National Assembly. The major contents are  likely to be left untouched. The plan must pass through the  National Assembly before its promulgation.""    Somnouk Khai-gnavong, also a member of the committee in  charge of drafting the development plan, revealed that ""the  fourth plan opens the door wider because the Lao Government's  objective is to turn the country into the energy and free trade  center of the region. The LPDR will use Singapore as a good  example in doing trade.""    ""Under this development plan, Laos will divide the country  into five development zones. The northern region with Xieng  Khwang Province as its center will emphasize animal husbandry.  The central region including Vientiane Municipality will  concentrate on tourism and industrial development. Khammouane  Province will stress electricity production and processing  industries while the two southern provinces -- Savannakhet and  Champassak -- will pursue agricultural development and trade.""    Moreover, the economic development programs for the  northern region comprising Bokeo, Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang,  Oudomsai, and Phong Saly are also designed to be compatible with  the Northern Quadrangle Economic Development Scheme. Bokeo,  Phong Saly, and Luang Namtha are classifed as trade zones,  whereas Luang Prabang and Oudomsai will become a special zone  for tourism and mining industry.    Following the opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge,  Vientiane Municipality will be turned into a trade and  investment center. A cultural and arts center inside the  municipality will help promote tourism. A business area will be  located in Tha Naleng near the bridge. The industrial zone will  be in Saithani District along Road No. 13 from kilometer markers  18 to 27. The industrial area in the southern region will be  located at Nakai in Khamouan Province because of its proximity  to the seaport in Vietnam.    Savannakhet Province will become the free port town, a  transit point for the transportation of goods from Danang port  to Thailand and vice versa. Savannakhet's trade system will be  similar to those of other free port towns elsewhere. There will  be tax-free shops, wholesalers, and retailers. Champassak  Province, after the construction of Pakse Bridge, will be able  to trade with both Thailand and Cambodia.    In its attempts to review economic management, the LPDR has  passed an economic law for the promotion and protection of  foreign investment in the LPDR.    However, common shortcomings observed by business people who  went to explore investment opportunities in Laos are:    1. Laos has no laws for protecting the operation of  financial institutes, insurance, and real estate businesses.  The revenue of financial institutes in Laos comes from fees  collected from loan transfers and related services.    2. Investors are left to face inconveniences caused by  bureaucratic red tape, bribery, and a sluggish attitude among  officials concerned.    3. The country lacks a quality work force and has no  business administration schools to produce qualified graduates.    4. Public facilities such as roads, electricity, and running  tap water are insufficient.    5. The government is unable to control the unrealistically  high cost of living. The cost of living is incompatible with  the people's income and may later become a major problem in the  country.    ""The present LPDR might resemble Thailand 30 years ago. But  in 2000, Laos might be able to compete with Brunei in terms of  per capita income. But this depends on how well the Lao  Government can build the country's economy. If everything  proceeds as planned in the fourth economic plan, the realization  of such a dream is not beyond the reach of the Lao Government.     "

By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      Unocal Corp. said Wednesday that it would cease manufacturing at its Beaumont  oil refinery in Texas early next year, suspending virtually all operations at  the unprofitable 65-year-old plant, which employs 462 people.    In doing so, Unocal admitted that it had failed to turn around the aging plant  even after eliminating 160 jobs and cutting money-losing production of  petroleum fuels last summer. Unocal said it has no offers to buy and no plans  to sell the plant in Nederland, Tex., about 75 miles east of Houston.    ""Despite efforts to increase profitability at the refinery, the facility has  continued to lose money every month since the downsizing last year,"" Richard J.  Stegemeier, Unocal's chairman, said in a statement.    The company did not detail losses, except to say they amounted to several  million dollars a year.    The move was seen as part of Unocal's continuing effort to streamline  unprofitable operations under Stegemeier, who succeeded longtime Unocal  Chairman Fred L. Hartley last year. But some analysts said the closing runs  counter to a trend in the industry that has kept refined products in strong  demand.    It was reported earlier that Hartley had opposed efforts to close or cut output  at Beaumont, giving rise to unfounded rumors that he had his first Unocal job  at the plant. Hartley first worked for Unocal in San Francisco.    Under Stegemeier, Unocal has systematically sold assets, including its downtown  Los Angeles headquarters. Last month, the company said it would significantly  reduce its retail operations in the Pacific Northwest.    Last summer, Unocal discontinued making gasoline and other petroleum fuels at  the 120,000-barrel-per-day Beaumont plant. The plant could only process costly  low-sulfur crude oil, and profit margins for refined products were thin in the  Gulf area, a company spokesman said.    By focusing on relatively small production of high value-added specialty  chemicals and lube oil at the plant, the company had hoped to stem the flow of  red ink. The plant now processes about 50,000 barrels of crude per day.    The company will begin shutting down operations in mid-January, with all  manufacturing to stop by the end of the first quarter of 1990. The company may  continue to operate the plant as a terminal, to accept oil for shipment  elsewhere.    The plant's 462 workers will be transferred to other operations or be  dismissed. Unocal must negotiate severance terms with labor unions representing  about 337 of the workers. Only about 10 employees will be needed if the plant  becomes a terminal.    Some analysts attributed the Beaumont plant's lack of profits to lackluster  markets for its products, which include lube oil and two hydrocarbons:  aromatics and aliphatic solvents.    Aromatics include benzene and xylene, used to make gasoline, and toluene, used  as an industrial solvent. Aliphatic solvents are chemicals used to make paints,  dry cleaning fluids and ink.    ""The real profits are going to companies with refining and marketing together,  and Unocal has that on the West Coast,"" said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an  economist and fellow at the Institute for International Economics in  Washington. ""But orphan refineries like Beaumont must dispose of their products  on the open market, and that is very competitive.""    Despite that competition, most refiners have enjoyed strong demand for refined  products over much of the past year. Earlier, the industry had a slump that  resulted in the closure of several plants around the country.    Refineries have run at record rates of capacity for much of the year to meet  relatively strong demand for fuel. Refining capacity could remain tight if  there are more accidents such as the explosion that disabled a Phillips  Petroleum Co. plastics plant in Texas last month.    As a result, some companies have reopened previously mothballed refineries and  others have reportedly shopped around to buy refining companies, particularly  on the West Coast.    On Tuesday, Tosco Corp., the West Coast's largest independent oil refiner, said  it had received offers from three multinational suitors for either the entire  Santa Monica-based company or its Northern California refinery.    Unocal itself is about to close a $500-million joint venture deal with the  national petroleum company of Venezuela that includes selling a half interest  in its Chicago oil refinery.

The chief executives of the two companies said yesterday that the agreement 'effectively realises many of the benefits' identified during last year's abortive merger talks. Final details of the pact are expected to be completed soon. It includes development of the Deep and Lower Post ore body adjacent to Barrick's Goldstrike mine, as well as exploration and development along common property boundaries, and sharing of Newmont's bioleaching technology. The Post body straddles the border between the two companies' properties and contains an estimated 9m troy ounces of gold. Barrick has agreed to expand its existing Betze pit at Goldstrike to include Deep and Lower Post. The expanded pit will be known as the Betze-Post pit. Stripping of the expanded area is due to start next year, and mining of most of the Deep and Lower Post ore will begin in 1997. Mining of the Post body will also give access to 580,000 ounces of gold from near-surface material on Newmont land. Until now, neither company has shown gold from the Deep and Lower Post body in its production forecasts. Newmont owns 5m ounces of the Post deposit, while Barrick's share is about 4m ounces. The companies plan to share the costs of mining the Deep and Lower Post reserves in proportion to benefits received. Production costs will thus be the same for both companies. They said that an agreement for joint exploration and sharing of data will enable 'rapid and economic development' of new discoveries along common boundaries.  The Financial Times   London Page 28  "

LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the  Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders  for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to  savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a  morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more  than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary  exploration. If it didn't, it would be just another on a list of  disappointments NASA has handed to Friedman in the past 17 years.    He moved a few feet from his friends among the crowd of spectators at Cape  Canaveral and positioned himself in clear view of the launch pad. Then he  stared into the distance at the space shuttle Atlantis, which was scheduled  momentarily to take the spacecraft Magellan into Earth orbit and then send it  on its way to Venus.    As a 31-year-old engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in 1972, Friedman's  first supervisory job was study leader and program manager for the then-unnamed  Magellan project. Had anyone told him then that he would be a grandfather by  the time Magellan flew, he wouldn't have believed them. But since the  mid-1970s, he had gradually become disillusioned with the false starts and  delays in the American space program.    This day, he had flown from California to Florida to watch the launch and take  part in a panel discussion, a sort of celebration of America's return to space  exploration. Standing alone at the edge of the crowd as the countdown entered  its last minute, he half expected another delay. An optimist about most things,  he had never had much faith in the wisdom of using the space shuttle instead of  conventional rockets to launch spacecraft.    At T-minus 30 seconds, the countdown stopped. A malfunction had been detected;  the shuttle engines shut down. Friedman was disappointed, and he couldn't help  but immediately see the irony.    ""When that thing didn't go, and I was looking out from the causeway, I could  also see a Titan (rocket) the Air Force was getting ready for another launch,""  he recalls a few weeks later. ""Boy, did I wish we were using that.""    A week later, the shuttle carrying Magellan successfully took off. By then,  Friedman was back in his office watching the event on television with his staff  at the Planetary Society. He is enough of a space groupie, he says, to enjoy  any successful launch -- even one that comes years late.    IN THE PLANETARY SOCIETY'S 16-room headquarters, in a turn-of-the-century  Greene and Greene mansion, Louis Friedman has the smallest office. (""Size is  not power,"" he says.) He sits at an old oak desk above which hangs a  needlepoint of Saturn stitched by his mother. When he's not on the phone, he's  likely to be bounding downstairs to consult with his secretaries or Tim Lynch,  the society's director of programs and development. He jogs each morning to  work off the calories of an occasional beer, but seeing him scurry around, one  wonders if the jogging isn't overkill.    For nearly a decade, Friedman has spent most of his waking hours as the pivotal  man in an exercise in mass salesmanship: finding ways to persuade Americans --  the public, politicians, bureaucrats and space scientists -- to rally behind  planetary exploration as they did in the 1960s, after the Soviets launched  Sputnik. In the past 25 years, he has evolved from space engineer to salesman  of dreams in an era of diminished dreaming. ""What I want to do,"" Friedman says,  ""is make space exploration happen.""    Under Friedman's direction, the Planetary Society is to planetary exploration  what Common Cause is to political campaigning or the Sierra Club is to  conservation. But in addition to calling for a general reform of the nation's  space program, it has channeled most of its energies into promoting a single  great notion: that of a joint U.S.-Soviet manned mission to Mars. The group's  leaders believe that the Mars mission -- with its underpinnings of global peace  through technology -- is the only aspiration grand enough to drum up the public  interest needed to fuel real-life star trekking. And, Friedman hopes, that  grass-roots enthusiasm will eventually bubble up to influence the Washington  policy-makers and budget writers who can put the civil space program back on  its old, optimistic track.    As executive director, Friedman is administrator, policy-maker, publicist and  even carnival barker, trying to lure passers-by inside the tent to see the  exotica -- in this case, the planets in Earth's solar system. Despite his  background as a card-carrying scientist, this may be the job he was born to do.  ""I live, breathe and eat Mars,"" he says.    Early one morning, he is in Lynch's office discussing the logistics of  scheduling Carl Sagan to testify before the House of Representatives on the  NASA budget. Moments later, he is in his own office meeting with Angela Brown,  a former Planetary Society staffer turned consultant, reviewing details for a  society-sponsored festival to coincide with Voyager II's encounter with Neptune  in August. By way of JPL, Voyager's live images of Neptune will be transmitted  to the festival.    Friedman squeezes his eyes shut to contain his enthusiasm when Brown tells him  a national auto maker is interested in sending Neptune images from the JPL feed  to all its dealerships through its internal cable system. ""Oh, I would love a  downlink (in the dealerships),"" he groans. ""Anything we can do to get this  stuff into peoples' hands across America.""    Later still, he returns calls from the Washington Post and an aerospace trade  magazine. One reporter wants a quick response from Friedman about news that the  Soviets have activated a camera on a spacecraft sent to the Martian moon  Phobos. Friedman raves over this development; the next day, he is the only  American quoted in the story.    His workday often starts early, with phone calls from home to the East Coast or  the Soviet Union, and doesn't end until evening. One night, Friedman, red-eyed  and weary, is the host at a Planetary Society reception. He has just heard a  colleague in the society suggest to a visitor that America's next space goal  should be to send more astronauts to the moon to set up a base. To Friedman,  the suggestion is close to heresy. It makes no sense to send more humans to the  moon because the whole idea bores the public, Friedman says, his voice rising.  Manned lunar missions would only drain America's civil-space budget away from a  more important, profound, exciting goal -- namely, Mars.    Friedman is forceful but good-humored as he argues. He is slightly rumpled, and  his mop of graying black hair hints of Harpo Marx. If he was selling something  simpler, like the women's hats his father once helped produce in New York, his  charm and persistence would probably have made Friedman a rich man. This  evening, though, his colleague can't be swayed. Friedman, undeterred and  indefatigable, wanders over to another knot of guests, prepared to make his  argument for a mission to Mars all over again.    WHO WOULD HAVE predicted in the 1960s that a role like Friedman's would exist,  much less be considered by so many to be necessary? Then, the promotion of  planetary exploration, fueled by Soviet space advances and Cold War  competitiveness, was led by an American President. John F. Kennedy talked about  the dreams and set the goals, rallying Americans to create grand technologies,  explore the universe, land on the moon -- and do it all before the Soviets  could. It was called the Space Race, with all the urgency that implies.    Through the 1970s, NASA launched 69 manned and unmanned missions. It was during  those boom times, in 1970, that Friedman joined JPL, after working on the  technical staff of a Massachusetts aerospace firm and then earning a doctorate  in astronautics and aeronautics at MIT. He immediately went to work on Mariner  10, which was launched just three years later and eventually flew by Venus and  Mercury, taking pictures that gave the earthbound the first detailed knowledge  of the innermost planets. When Friedman recalls the end of those heady days, he  sounds almost wistful. ""Then the shuttle came, and it just ruined everything.""    After Kennedy's death, White House-level passion for planetary exploration --  the key to funding -- began to dry up. Interest declined with each new  President and each new escalation of the dollar-draining Vietnam War. Then, in  1972, shortly after the last Apollo spacecraft landed a man on the moon,  President Nixon unveiled a plan to build a space shuttle, promoted as a  quicker, cheaper way to fly in space. (""You don't go to space to be cheap,""  Friedman grouses today. ""You stay home to be cheap."") Nixon rejected another of  the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending  humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after  his White House tenure.    Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began  to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would  be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's  annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last  year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8  billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration  changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According  to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation,  planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for  planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years  ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation.    After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches  stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to  the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and  a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman  applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate  committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance  to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space  policy-making in Washington.    Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the  stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of  JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab.  Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager  spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that  this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President  Carter told Sagan as much at the White House.    Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their  gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would  have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to  start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in  anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new  organization.    In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary  Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to  attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to  influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research.  And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space  policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and  Murray, too.    By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a  sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members.  Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and  full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known  space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million,  supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations.    During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly  conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees  and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA  budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing  campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986  while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated  10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby.    Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later  when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for  signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing  a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000  to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that  still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone.    But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they  believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when,  in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the  effects of space weapons on civilian use of space.    The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S.  Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between  the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to  hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader  of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested  that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation  displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier.  What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of ""electricity""  through the audience.    ""If you are interested in pumping the economy,"" Sagan told the audience, ""there  are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of  the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological  capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars  technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to  Mars.""    Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later  adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet  scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country  performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to  Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The  Planetary Society had found its goal.    IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was  entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an  ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13  years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space  commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching  satellites and spacecraft.    Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had  promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its  critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The  shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine  failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was  it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets.    To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an  effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams  of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency  -- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some  of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles  Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on ""the timing of goals and  funding."" Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in  the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and  the society were tense at best.    Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive  soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher  commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could  regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's  goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon  with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly:  ""America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to  continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth.""    Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved  Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that  these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a  precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened  without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society.    Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and  Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance,  it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon  planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through  legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer,  an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it  goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat --  in Congress.    For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the  Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the  society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars  goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first  private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment.    That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two  tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make  up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an  experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon,  which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an  unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary  Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a  chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United  States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal  without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up.    The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to  design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact  Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium  guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface  of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for  analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the  balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere.    The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first  prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost  $450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency  was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in  donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated  $30,000.    The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest  engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has  volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on  weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August  in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to  France in September.    A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of  it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador  Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its ""Mars  Declaration,"" an 800-word statement published last year calling for human  exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the  space agency, he says, thinks it would ""be a great thing to do."" Then come the  caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the  Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? ""Making Mars (exploration) dependent on  peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars,"" says John Logsdon, a  Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute  at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that  it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars.    Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission  would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate.  To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have  to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the  agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget  demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely.    Scientists have another question about the economics. ""There's sort of a  knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree,""  says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory  board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth.  However, he sees the Mars mission as a ""vastly expensive undertaking"" that  would ""seriously handicap"" valuable unmanned projects.    The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona,  slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a  chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped  generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the  Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he  argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of  linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is  pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge  price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national  purpose, he says.    And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually  matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with  presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars  Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the  first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman  concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the  Mars initiative, ""the whole momentum will be lost"" for at least the next four  years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The  challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in  the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell  the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a  waste?    Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant  as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John  Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key  advice on how to set up a public-interest group. ""Reform is never completed.  You never succeed,"" Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. ""It's a process. It  goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We  always keep hope alive.""      Photo, COLOR, Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, . .  .

LOUIS Friedman, one-time rocket scientist and now, as head of the  Pasadena-based Planetary Society, one of the nation's most vocal cheerleaders  for planetary exploration, had waited a long time for this moment and wanted to  savor it in solitude. Launches always made him nervous, but this one, on a  morning last April, was special. If it worked, it would mark the end of more  than a decade of waiting for the United States to return to planetary  exploration.

(""You don't go to space to be cheap,""  Friedman grouses today. ""You stay home to be cheap."") Nixon rejected another of  the space program options recommended by a presidential commission -- sending  humans to Mars, an expensive project that would be completed many years after  his White House tenure.    Friedman considers Nixon's shuttle decision a turning point. NASA budgets began  to drop and planetary exploration, which a generation had come to believe would  be a continuing part of American achievement, suffered. In the mid-'60s, NASA's  annual budget climbed to $26 billion (in 1988 dollars). From 1972 through last  year, the agency's total budget averaged less than a third of that, about $8  billion a year (in 1988 dollars). Within that budget, planetary exploration  changed from favorite child to sad stepsister of the space shuttle. According  to one study of NASA budgets, when measured in dollars adjusted for inflation,  planetary funding dropped 75% between 1974 and 1978. The 1989 budget for  planetary exploration (about $417 million) remains lower than it was 15 years  ago, when the figures are adjusted for inflation.    After Pioneer Venus 10 blasted off toward Venus in 1978, exploration launches  stopped. Several unmanned planetary missions in development were relegated to  the back burner, including Magellan, the probe of Jupiter known as Galileo and  a joint European-U.S. mission to study the sun. Out of frustration, Friedman  applied for and won a yearlong fellowship to work on the staff of the Senate  committee that addresses space program goals and funding. It gave him a chance  to reassess his career while allowing him a bird's eye view of space  policy-making in Washington.    Meanwhile, back at JPL, two prominent space scientists also were alarmed at the  stagnation of NASA's planetary program. One was Bruce Murray, then director of  JPL; the other was star-astronomer Carl Sagan, a frequent visitor to the lab.  Both had been gratified to see public interest build as the two Voyager  spacecraft, launched in 1977, approached Jupiter. But they were distressed that  this public interest did not translate into money from Washington. President  Carter told Sagan as much at the White House.    Murray and Sagan, so accustomed to looking beyond the stars, readjusted their  gazes earthward. An organization to rally around planetary exploration would  have to start at the grass roots, they believed. But neither had the time to  start or run such a group. In spring, 1979, when Friedman visited JPL in  anticipation of returning in the fall, Murray asked him to direct the new  organization.    In late 1979, from his dining room table, Friedman launched the Planetary  Society. It had little money, three members and a vague idea about how to  attract more. The three co-founders had only their goals: to educate, to  influence space policy and, perhaps, to provide funding for planetary research.  And they decided they could do it all 3,000 miles from the hub of space  policy-making, in Pasadena, the home not only of JPL but of Friedman and  Murray, too.    By the end of its first year, the society had established the roots of a  sophisticated direct-mail operation and signed up more than 20,000 members.  Today, it has about 125,000 members in 104 countries and 26 part-time and  full-time employees. It is the largest (by about five times) and best-known  space-interest group in the world, and its annual budget exceeds $3.5 million,  supported mostly by membership fees of $20 to $30 and donations.    During its first years, the Planetary Society leaders hewed to a fairly  conservative line, advocating unmanned missions, testifying before committees  and spearheading studies to salvage planetary programs threatened by NASA  budget cuts. In 1981, Friedman organized society members in a letter-writing  campaign entreating NASA to reverse its decision to stay earthbound in 1986  while Halley's comet made one of its rare appearances. The campaign generated  10,000 letters but failed to get the government to plan a Halley's flyby.    Chastened by this defeat, the society took more aggressive action a year later  when the Senate refused to fund a NASA project that would have listened for  signs of intelligent life in outer space. The Planetary Society began financing  a similar project of its own. Film maker Steven Spielberg contributed $100,000  to help a Harvard scientist build and monitor a sophisticated radio system that  still operates today, waiting for a signal that earthlings are not alone.    But the society's leaders had not yet fixed upon the one grand goal that they  believed would get planetary research back on track. Inspiration arrived when,  in January, 1985, the society co-sponsored a symposium in Washington on the  effects of space weapons on civilian use of space.    The Reagan White House was gearing up its Star Wars program. Mikhail S.  Gorbachev had not yet come into power in the Soviet Union. Relations between  the two countries were tense. One afternoon, 600 people crowded into a room to  hear a panel that included Murray, Sagan and Roald Z. Sagdeev, then the leader  of the Soviet space program. In the course of the discussion, Sagdeev suggested  that the United States and the Soviet Union follow up on the cooperation  displayed in the docking of the Soyuz and Apollo spacecraft 10 years earlier.  What Sagan was to say next, Friedman recalls, sent a current of ""electricity""  through the audience.    ""If you are interested in pumping the economy,"" Sagan told the audience, ""there  are far better ways to do it (than the Strategic Defense Initiative). Think of  the major cooperative programs which are fully within our technological  capability and which could be done at a tiny fraction of the cost of Star Wars  technology. Think about a joint U.S.-Soviet-manned, and womanned, mission to  Mars.""    Sagan's words so ignited the Planetary Society board members that they later  adjourned with Sagdeev to a private room to discuss the idea. The Soviet  scientist talked excitedly about a split-mission idea, with each country  performing independent tasks that would add up to a complete manned mission to  Mars. Sagdeev's enthusiasm seemed to open new worlds of possibility. The  Planetary Society had found its goal.    IN 1985, AS THE Planetary Society was becoming euphoric about Mars, NASA was  entering one of its most depressing periods. The agency had spent an  ever-expanding amount of time and money developing a space shuttle that, 13  years after conception, seemed far from keeping its promise to boost space  commercialization by providing an oft-scheduled, reusable craft for launching  satellites and spacecraft.    Its proponents, led by now-retired NASA Administrator James Fletcher, had  promised that the shuttle could be built for billions of dollars less than its  critics claimed. By the mid-'80s, the critics were beginning to look right. The  shuttle was plagued by engineering problems, including faulty tiles and engine  failures, and was still unable to meet its flight schedule. So unreliable was  it that the Air Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  made plans to launch their satellites from conventional rockets.    To NASA, the Planetary Society was a sometimes useful civilian adjunct, an  effective promoter of planetary science, but little more. The society's dreams  of a return to the glory days of space exploration were just that to the agency  -- dreams easily dismissed, economically unrealistic, not on the agenda. Some  of the society's goals were shared by NASA, says NASA spokesman Charles  Redmond, but the two organizations disagreed on ""the timing of goals and  funding."" Friedman and the Planetary Society acknowledge that their efforts in  the mid-'80s had little policy effect on NASA. Relations between Fletcher and  the society were tense at best.    Then came the Challenger shuttle disaster of January, 1986, and massive  soul-searching at NASA. In 1987, as the agency looked for redirection, Fletcher  commissioned former astronaut Sally K. Ride to recommend how the agency could  regain its leadership in space. Ride sounded some of the Planetary Society's  goals when she called for NASA to expand exploration by returning to the moon  with one eventual mission of landing humans on Mars. She advised moving slowly:  ""America should not rush headlong toward Mars; we should adopt a strategy to  continue an orderly expansion outward from Earth.""    Ride's report, coupled with growing publicity for the Mars initiative, moved  Mars from the back burner to the national agenda. Friedman points out that  these days, when NASA talks about going to the moon, the goal is framed as a  precursor to an eventual Mars trip. He believes this would not have happened  without the constant prodding of the Planetary Society.    Any space project comes about as a budgetary interaction between NASA and  Congress, and on Capitol Hill, the society has had more success. For instance,  it claims some credit for blocking the Reagan Administration's plans to abandon  planetary exploration in 1981. It is generally credited with pushing through  legislation assuring that a conventional rocket will launch the Mars Observer,  an unmanned spacecraft designed to orbit and photograph the planet, when it  goes up in 1992. And now, occasionally, a resolution to support a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars venture will be introduced and voted on -- so far to defeat --  in Congress.    For Friedman, small victories aren't enough. If all goes according to plan, the  Planetary Society will get to Mars before NASA does. In mid-February, the  society took its boldest step so far to stimulate public interest in the Mars  goal. It signed an agreement that, Friedman says, will make it the first  private group to participate with the Soviet Union in a space experiment.    That is why, on a recent afternoon, eight space engineers are seated around two  tables pushed together in the main room of the Pasadena headquarters. They make  up the team brought together by the society to develop one part of an  experimental balloon that is to be built by France's space agency. The balloon,  which will float just above the surface of Mars, will be released from an  unmanned Soviet spacecraft expected to be launched in 1994. For the Planetary  Society, this project is more than a simple engineering challenge. It is a  chance to prove that space cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United  States is possible. It is a symbolic way to move ahead with the Mars goal  without waiting for NASA and the White House to catch up.    The engineers at the table have volunteered or been hired by the society to  design a prototype of what is officially named the Surface Navigation Kontact  Experiment. The SNAKE, as it has been dubbed, will be a 30-foot-long titanium  guide rope that will dangle 100 feet from the balloon as it skims the surface  of Mars. The SNAKE will gather dirt and pebbles from the red planet for  analysis by the small instruments it will carry, which will also study the  balloon's speed and the Martian atmosphere.    The society has agreed to finance production of the SNAKE through its first  prototype; Friedman figures that the first two years of development will cost  $450,000, one-third to one-fifth of what it would cost if a government agency  was conducting the project. The society has already garnered $75,000 in  donations from one mailing to its members. A private foundation has donated  $30,000.    The meeting goes slowly. By the time it ends, after 8 p.m., the youngest  engineer, Jim Cantrell, a graduate student at Utah State University, has  volunteered to make the first prototype in his garage. He builds race cars on  weekends, he says, so he has the necessary tools. They agree to meet in August  in the Mojave Desert to test Cantrell's creation before they deliver it to  France in September.    A 1988 TIME MAGAZINE poll reported that 72% of Americans believe that a joint  U.S.-Soviet Mars mission is a good idea; newspapers editorialize in support of  it; the Planetary Society even got 250 celebrities, from former U.N. Ambassador  Jeane J. Kirkpatrick to Nobel laureate Linus Pauling, to sign its ""Mars  Declaration,"" an 800-word statement published last year calling for human  exploration of Mars. Even Redmond, at NASA, admits its appeal: Everyone at the  space agency, he says, thinks it would ""be a great thing to do."" Then come the  caveats. Is basing a mission on cooperation between the United States and the  Soviet Union ridiculously optimistic? ""Making Mars (exploration) dependent on  peace on earth undermines the chance of going to Mars,"" says John Logsdon, a  Planetary Society advisory board member who directs the Space Policy Institute  at George Washington University. And Redmond says that NASA is concerned that  it does not have the technological know-how to send people to Mars.    Most naysayers, though, talk money. By Friedman's estimate, the joint mission  would cost $60 billion. Redmond says $100 billion is a conservative estimate.  To get to Mars, he says, and complete other existing projects, NASA would have  to squeeze at least $20 billion a year from Congress over 10 years. Today, the  agency is barely able to get $12 billion annually. Considering competing budget  demands and the U.S. deficit, he says, the needed level of funding is unlikely.    Scientists have another question about the economics. ""There's sort of a  knee-jerk enthusiasm for a grand mission, and I join in that to some degree,""  says physicist James Van Allen, a member of the Planetary Society's advisory  board and discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belt that surrounds Earth.  However, he sees the Mars mission as a ""vastly expensive undertaking"" that  would ""seriously handicap"" valuable unmanned projects.    The criticisms cause Friedman to launch into his best salesman persona,  slightly irritated because the naysayers just don't understand. It's a  chicken-and-egg proposition, he says. Just as the moon goal of the 1960s helped  generate financing for other planetary projects, he says, so, too, would the  Mars goal enhance all planetary exploration. We set the moon as a goal, he  argues, before the technology existed to take men there. As for the wisdom of  linking an exploration goal to unstable earthly relations, Friedman is  pragmatic and optimistic there, too. A human mission to Mars, with its huge  price tag and risks, can only be justified if it serves a strong national  purpose, he says.    And when it comes to the price, the society has a strategy that actually  matches NASA's. Redmond says that the only way to obtain the funding is with  presidential backing. Friedman is asking that all 130,000 signers of the Mars  Declaration write to President Bush before July 20, the 20th anniversary of the  first moon landing, urging him to support the Mars goal. However, Friedman  concedes that if even this anniversary cannot inspire Bush to acknowledge the  Mars initiative, ""the whole momentum will be lost"" for at least the next four  years. But patience and persistence are part of Friedman's strategy, too. The  challenge for the Planetary Society in a changing world is to keep the verve in  the Mars initiative. And if Friedman fails? What if, in the end, he cannot sell  the Mars vision to the White House or Congress or NASA? Will it all have been a  waste?    Friedman is sitting over a lunch of beer and bratwurst at a Pasadena restaurant  as he considers this. He pauses for a moment and then begins talking about John  Gardner, the founder of Common Cause who, early on, provided Friedman with key  advice on how to set up a public-interest group. ""Reform is never completed.  You never succeed,"" Friedman says, paraphrasing Gardner. ""It's a process. It  goes on and on and on and on. We always look at our goal as long range. We  always keep hope alive.""      Photo, COLOR, Louis Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, . .  .

During the second round table with the Cuban Government,  which ended yesterday, Portal gave a detailed report on foreign  participation in the island's mining and petroleum development  to more than 170 businessmen and bankers from 23 countries.    According to official figures, Cuba estimates there are more  than 300 million tons of nickel and cobalt reserves in 30  deposits in the country. To date, Portal said, Cuba has signed  26 contracts for mineral prospecting and exploration, two  service contracts for exploitation of copper in Mantua, Pinar  del Rio Province, and two partnerships for feasibility studies  on gold, lead, and zinc deposits. These agreements already  cover 50 percent of the area open to bidding in a total area of  40,000 square km.    Portal said the nickel industry has recovered and increased  its markets, adding the Cuban-mined mineral is now exported to  26 countries. This sector obtained financial support from  institutions in Canada, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and  Italy.    In petroleum prospecting, 16 of the 33 areas with  potentially  great prospects have already been contracted out to French,  Canadian, British, and Swedish companies. The minister also  said the total area will have been contracted by the end of the  year, so ""it is not a matter of the North Americans arriving  late; they are already too late"" to participate in these  projects.    The companies that are already participating are prospering,  recovering the invested capital with part of the extracted  petroleum. Partnerships have been established for the useful  life of the fields, and this exhibits confidence in Cuba's  guarantees, Portal added. During his participation in the round  table, Portal received investment proposals.    The cosponsorship of the conference by the Canadian firm  Sherritt, which has made large investments in Cuban petroleum,  gas, and nickel, is evidence of foreign interest in the  prospects of this sector of the local economy.

Vinayak: ""Larger Role for Private Sector in  Mining""]    [Text] The Centre's new mineral policy envisages a larger  role for the private sector in areas hitherto reserved for the  public sector. Among the minerals dereserved are: copper,  zinc-lead ores, molybdenum, gypsum, tungsten and others, but  coal, lignite and atomic minerals are still retained in the list  for the public sector.    The new policy favours induction of foreign technology and  participation in mineral exploration and mining for high-value  and scarce minerals. Foreign equity investment in joint ventures  in mining, promoted by Indian companies, will be encouraged.  While foreign investment in equity will normally be limited to  50 per cent, this limitation will not apply to captive mines of  any mineral processing industry. Enhanced equity holding can  also be considered on a case-to-case basis, says the official  statement.    In respect of joint venture mining projects for minerals and  metals in which the country is deficient or does not have an  exportable surplus, a stipulated share of production will have  to be made available to meet the needs of the domestic market  before exports from such projects are allowed.    The country has vast mineral resources, but mining small  deposits scattered all over the country poses problems for big  public sector ventures. The private sector can tap this market  with modest investments and short lead times.    Mining, being labour-intensive, can open up job  opportunities  in backward areas. Efforts will be made to promote small scale  mining in a scientific and efficient manner while safeguarding  vital environmental and ecological imperatives, says the  official statement.    The management of mineral resources has, therefore, to be  closely integrated with the overall strategy of development; and  exploitation of minerals is to be guided by long-term national  goals and perspectives. It is against this backdrop, the  Government has felt the need to spell out the features of its  new policy, the statement said. But the delay in the amendment  of the Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act 1957  has created some confusion in the field.    Admittedly, the country is not endowed with rich resources  of  high grade ores in strategic areas except bauxite and iron ore.  This underlines the need for adopting scientific mining,  together with beneficiation processes for economic utilisation  of the available mineral resources. Mineral economists however  agree that progress in this direction over the the past three  decades has been rather tardy except in some sectors.    Focus on future needs    At the same time, the Government has to keep in view the  future needs of defence and development and try to ensure  indigenous availability of basic and strategic minerals to avoid  disruption of supplies during emergency.    The national mineral policy has also focussed on aspects  like  sea-bed mining, development of proper inventory, linkage between  exploitation of minerals and development of mineral industry,  conservation of forest resources and protection of environment.    The Centre will consult the States before formulating legal  measures for the regulation of mines and the development of  mineral resources to ensure basic uniformity in mineral  administration and development of the industry in tune with the  national policy aims. The new policy aims at exploring mineral  wealth in the land and in the off-shore areas; developing  mineral resources taking into account the national and strategic  considerations and ensuring their adequate supply and best use  keeping in view the present needs and future requirements; and  promoting necessary linkages for smooth and uninterrupted  development of the mineral industry to meet domestic needs.    In the development of the mineral industry the role of the  Government, both Central and States, has been spelt out in the  1957 Act. This Act has been amended through an ordinance issued  recently to accommodate the reforms envisaged by the Centre in  this field. It is time the Government updates the national  mineral inventory before it opens up this sector to the private  sector, both domestic and foreign.    The Geological Survey of India (GSI) will be the principal  outfit for geological mapping and regional mineral resources  assessment including in its exclusive economic zone. It will  continue to be responsible to draw up action-oriented plans in  association with other agencies.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Proved and Total Reserves of Five Major Ores and Minerals(in million tonnes) |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Proved                   |Total Reserves           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Bauxite                  |1,487                    |5,863                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore                 |10,384                   |21,799                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Iron ore magnesite       |4,506                    |13,732                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Manganese ore            |93                       |548                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chrome ore               |62                       |270                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Copper ore               |216                      |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Special attention will be given to the development of  strategic minerals through systematic investigation of various  potential sources of supply. Further, the focus will be on the  survey and exploration of minerals in which the country has a  poor or just adequate resource base.    Ecological problems    Environmental problems associated with mining activity,  particularly open cast mining, land subsidence in underground  mining, deforestation and atmospheric pollution call for  appropriate strategy for mitigation of their adverse effects on  the eco-system. The new policy says that mining operations shall  not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile  and biologically rich areas. Strip mining in forest areas should  be avoided in accordance with prescribed norms and established  forestry practices shall form an integral part of mine  development strategy.    The research and development (RD) activities will  focus on  the entire gamut of activities from geological survey,  exploration, mining, beneficiation and extraction of minerals to  development of materials. The new policy seeks to promote  development of new technologies for conversion of existing  mineral resources into viable economic resources. Appropriate  technologies shall be developed to enable indigenous industries  to utilise the available resources and as substitutes for  minerals whose reserves are poor.    The RD efforts shall be directed to find new and  alternative  uses for minerals whose traditional demand is on the wane, says  the statement. Indigenous technology has to be upgraded through  R  D and adoption of technological innovations from abroad.  Research in mining methods shall also receive priority attention.    The liberalisation of imports and reduction of customs duty  on finished metals like copper, zinc and aluminium, has hit  companies like Hindustan [HCL] Copper, Hindustan Zinc [HZL] and  National Aluminium.    While the Government has dereserved 15 minerals, ilmenite,  siliminate and mica have been kept out of this list. Bauxite  also does not appear in the deleted list although India ranks  fifth among bauxite rich countries in the world.    According to Mr. I.G. Jhingran, Secretary to Union Ministry  of Mines, liberalisation of the mining policy will help  indigenous companies to foster closer ties with mineral-rich  Third World countries for joint exploration and development of  ore resources.    Hindustan Copper could explore the possibility of joining  hands with Zambia which has rich copper ore deposits for  exploration and tie up imports of the richer grade ores for  blending with its low grade material. It has acquired  considerable expertise in mining and smelting operations.  Similarly, HZL also could go global with its expertise skills to  find partners abroad to develop the mineral deposits in Third  World countries. HCL is now free to even enter the metal trade.  For expanding its Khetri copper smelter capacity from 35,000  tonnes to one lakh tonnes a year, it could source ore imports  from Zambia to make its products competitive in the market.    These public sector companies are moving from an era of  protection to a competitive market and they should tap all  avenues to make their operations economically viable. HZL is  exploring the scope for setting up a joint venture in Vietnam  for developing a gold ore deposit in collaboration with BRGM  [Geological and Mineral Research] of France.    Mr. A.C. Wadhawan, Chairman, HZL, says some Australian  companies have evinced interest in exploration activities for  base metal ores, including gold, in India. The finds in  Karnataka and other southern States are promising for further  evaluation and assessment. These projects for transition need  long gestation period.    If, meanwhile, LME zinc prices continue to drop, HZL may  find  itself in an unenviable position as the Government is unlikely  to give it any budgetary support to weather the storm. The  Mineral Exploration Corporation Ltd., with special skills in  exploration activities, is facing a bleak future as it may run  out of business if foreign mining companies enter the field. It  will have to seek foreign collaboration for survival and  technology upgradation.    Its capacity utilisation has dropped in 1992-93 as the  public  sector mining companies are starved of funds. Even the GSI is  now being asked to gear up to become market-oriented and try to  earn its keep, at least partly. It now remains to be seen how  the mining reforms will help the development of this core  industry and whether it will lure foreign investment for the  industry's rapid development.      "

General Information for This Florida General Permit       This general permit places limitations on discharges from   treatment systems which are used to treat common contaminants   found in petroleum fuels and allows the permittee to expedite   startup of a hydrocarbon recovery system once a leak has been   detected and groundwater has been contaminated. The general   permit also allows general dewatering for uncontaminated sites.   Normally, such a recovery system consists of monitoring wells   that are used for sampling and delineating plume movement.   Recovery wells, which may be vertical or horizontal, are used to   recover contaminated groundwater in the impacted area. The   placement of recovery wells is generally determined after   consideration of geologic conditions and groundwater movement in   order to maximize recovery of petroleum hydrocarbons. The rate   of movement by the contaminants is affected by the varying   permeability and adsorptive characteristics of the water-filled   pore spaces and depth of the water table. After the   contamination reaches the water table, the free-floating   contaminant is usually pumped from the recovery wells to an   above ground storage tank. Additionally, vapor recovery systems   are often used to remove volatiles from the soil. The dissolved   organics in the contaminated water are pumped to an air stripper   and treated using packed-tower aeration and, when necessary,   carbon adsorption. Both of these treatment processes have   proven effective in removing up to 99% of the volatile compounds   before discharge into surface waters.   The Florida FDEP and EPA Region IV estimates that of the sites   for which a RAP is prepared in any given year, a maximum of 100   facilities may propose discharge to surface water under this   general permit. In order to allow hydrocarbon recovery   operations to be performed without processing individual   applications for permit issuance, EPA proposes to reissue this   general permit to sources identified within the political   boundaries of the State of Florida.   This general permit may be used to authorize discharges of   treated groundwater and storm water incidental to groundwater   cleanup operations. Long term cleanups, over thirty (30) days,   must have an approved remedial action plan (RAP) before   submitting a NOI to discharge under this NPDES General permit.   The RAP Approval Order must be submitted with the applicant's   NOI and is required before authorizing cleanups over thirty (30)   days. This permit is not limited to cleanup operations funded   by the State of Florida, but may cover all such cleanup   operations if the NOI requirements are satisfied.       5. Basis for Final Effluent Limits and Permit Conditions       The effluent limits for the general permit are based on   treatment technology data obtained from previous individual   application requests. The general permit has been written to   require an effluent limit on three (3) chemicals, i.e., benzene,   naphthalene and lead.   Benzene is a potential carcinogen according to EPA 440/5800180   and Florida has adopted a WQS for this parameter. However, the   previous technology-based effluent limit of 1.0     m    g/l is more   stringent than Florida's water quality standard of 71.28     m    g/l at   (FAC 17302.530(9)), dated April 25, 1993; therefore, the more   stringent technology based limit, which is also protective of   water quality, will be included in the reissued permit.   Based on the ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Benzene,'' this   maximum contaminant level for benzene is well below the 10    ^6       risk factor of 40     m    g/l for consumption of contaminated aquatic   organisms. This limit of 1.0     m    g/l is also between the 10    ^5     risk factor of 6.6     m    g/l and 10    ^6     risk factor of .66     m    g/l for   consumption of contaminated water and aquatic organisms.   Most facilities have been able to meet the technology based   effluent limit for lead of 30     m    g/l, which is required since   older gasoline sites may have marketed fuels with leaded   compounds added in the form of tetraethyllead. Based on the   ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Lead,'' this limit is well   below the current human health standard of 50     m    g/l, which is   protective of human health against the ingestion of contaminated   water and contaminated aquatic organisms (EPA 440/580057).   The naphthalene limit of 100     m    g/l was developed based on FDEP   petroleum contamination site cleanup criteria   (17770.730(5)(a)2e), amended February 20, 1990. According to   the ``Ambient Water Quality Document for Naphthalene,'' acute and   chronic toxicity to freshwater aquatic life occurs at   concentrations as low as 2300     m    g/l for the Rainbow Trout and   620     m    g/l for the Fathead Minnow and would occur at lower   concentrations among species that are more sensitive than those   tested. Also, according to the ``Handbook of Environmental Data   and Organic Chemicals,'' tainting of fish flesh occurs for   naphthalene near 1000     m    g/l. The petroleum site criteria limit of   100     m    g/l for naphthalene is more stringent than EPA's water quality   document for this parameter and should provide adequate protection   for more sensitive aquatic organisms.   The pH requirements were established based on water quality criteria   at Florida Administrative Code (FAC) 17303.530(52)(c), dated   April 25, 1993. For fresh waters and coastal waters, the pH of the   effluent shall not be lowered to less than 6.0 units for fresh   waters, or less than 6.5 units for marine waters, or raised above 8.5   units, unless the permittee submits data during the NOI request   confirming a natural background pH outside of this range. If the   natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling   data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be less   than 6.0 standard units for fresh waters, or less than 6.5 standard   units in marine waters, the pH shall not vary below natural   background or vary more than one (1) unit above natural background.   If natural background of the receiving water, as revealed by sampling   data from the permittee in the NOI request, is determined to be   higher than 8.5 units, the pH shall not vary above natural background   or vary more than one (1) unit below natural background. The   continuous monitoring for pH is an option granted to the permittee   and is based on 401.17 of the Clean Water Act.   The permittee may request an individual permit to seek less stringent   end-of-pipe effluent limitations for benzene, total lead, and   naphthalene dependent upon resulting instream concentrations during   critical low flows of the receiving stream.

The Diesel fuel family includes both Diesel     #    1 and Diesel     #    2 formulations. The base fuel for this family is specified in 79.55(c).     (iii) The Methanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent methanol by volume and their associated fuel additives. The M100 and M85 base fuels are specified in 79.55(d).     (iv) The Ethanol Family includes fuels composed of at least 50 percent ethanol by volume and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is E85 as specified in 79.55(e).     (v) The Methane Family includes compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuels containing at least 50 mole percent methane and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for the family is a CNG formulation specified in 79.55(f).     (vi) The Propane Family includes propane fuels containing at least 50 percent propane by volume and their associated fuel additives. The base fuel for this family is a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as specified in 79.55(g).     (vii) A manufacturer seeking registration for formulation(s) which do not fit the criteria for inclusion in any of the fuel families described in this section shall contact EPA at the address in 79.59(a)(1) for further guidance in classifying and testing such formulation(s).     (2)     Fuel/Additive Categories.     Fuel/additive categories (Table F947, rows 13) are subdivisions of fuel families which represent the degree to which fuels and fuel additives in the family resemble the base fuel(s) designated for the family. Three general category types are defined in this section. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions   refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to 79.51(h)(1).     (i) Baseline categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family and conform to specified limitations on the amounts of certain components or characteristics applicable to that fuel family.     (ii) Non-Baseline Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain no elements other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family, but which exceed one or more of the limitations for certain specified components or characteristics applicable to baseline formulations in that fuel family.     (iii) Atypical Categories consist of fuels and fuel additives which contain elements or classes of compounds other than those permitted in the base fuel for the respective fuel family or which otherwise do not meet the criteria for either baseline or non-baseline formulations in that fuel family. A fuel or fuel additive product having both non-baseline and atypical characteristics pursuant to 79.56(e)(3), shall be considered to be an atypical product.     (3) This section defines the specific categories applicable to each fuel family. When applied to fuel additives, the criteria in these descriptions refer to the associated additive/base fuel mixture, pursuant to 79.51(h)(1).     (i)     Gasoline Categories.     (A) The Baseline Gasoline category contains gasoline fuels and associated additives which satisfy all of the following   criteria:     (    1    ) Contain no elements other than carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and/or sulfur.

Hisham Nazir, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Petroleum and  Mineral Resources, suggested joint development of China's oil.    Nazir, on his first trip to China, discussed petroleum  exploration, development and processing with high-ranking  Chinese officials.    According to the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), which  arranged the visit, Nazir made the proposals to President Jiang  Zemin, CNPC president Wang Tao and Sheng Huaren, president of  the China Petrochemical Corp.    An oil delegation from Saudi Arabia is expected to visit  China later to explore further possibilities.    The delegates are expected to visit petroleum processing  projects in Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province and Dagang in  Tianjin, at which time specific details will be discussed, a  CNPC official said.    Nazir said Saudi Arabia hopes to set up refineries in China  to help meet China's domestic needs.    With the refineries, Saudi Arabia would ensure China a  stable, long-term supply of crude oil, he said.    Saudi Arabia expects to set up the same type of  joint-venture  refineries it has in the United States, South Korea and the  Philippines, Nazir said.    Economic and trade ties between the two nations can be  developed, since their economies are complementary, he said,  adding that Saudi Arabia wants to tap the China market.    Saudi Arabia, a leading oil producer, would also be able to  help supply the crude needed for China's development, Nazir said.    He said he hopes Jiang Zemin will support his proposals and  help forge agreements as soon as possible.    Jiang said China will carefully consider the Saudi oil  minister's proposals and support any deals that promote  bilateral co-operation.    China has considerable undeveloped oil reserves. Despite its  large output, domestic supply cannot meet the country's soaring  demand.    China produced 142 million tons of crude oil last year. It  also imported, officially, 15 million tons of crude oil and 20  million tons of oil products, although sources say the figures  are probably low.    Experts say that imports will probably increase since the  country is planning for 9 per cent economic growth over the next  seven years.     "

Although It Could Have Been Worse""]    [Text] According to data of the West Siberian territorial  center for hydrometeorology and monitoring environmental  pollution, several emergency situations were observed at the end  of March and in April.    On the night of 29 March in Leninsk-Kuznetskiy, while  discharges from the worsted cloth combine were being pumped,  electric power was cut off in the second microrayon, as a result  of which the sewerage pumping station went out of operation. The  disposal of household fecal wastes into the Meret River (a  tributary of the Ina) amounted to 1,800 cubic meters a day. It  was not until the evening of 4 April that the sewerage pumping  station was brought back into operation.    On 30 March 12 tonnes of crude oil were poured onto the ice  of the Ob River, five miles below Kolpashevo (the pollution area  totaled 3,800 square meters). Part of the oil was pumped out,  and the rest was burned on the ice. The Tomskiy Geophysical  Trust was guilty of the pollution.    On 22 March an observer of the hydrometeorological post of  Shelabolikha (Ob River) noticed a yellow foam across the whole  river. Water analysis tests conducted in the rayon of  Kamen-na-Ob showed increased content of petroleum products (39  PDK [maximum permissible concentration], arsenic (14 PDK), and  synthetic surface substances (10-12 PDK)). The Altay Kray  Ecology Committee believes that the arsenic got into the water  along with pesticides that were washed off from the fields.    In April three incidents of high pollution (above 5 PDK) of  the atmosphere by nitrogen dioxide was observed in Novosibirsk.  One of the incidents (8.5 PDK) occurred as a result of waste  from the refinery plant Atoll.    Four incidents of atmospheric pollution by nitrogen dioxide  and one incident of methanol were registered in April in Tomsk.  The source of the pollution were the petroleum combine and  TETs-3 [thermal electric power plant].    The plant rayon industrial center and the coke and chemical  plant were the source of pollution of the atmosphere in Kemerovo  with ammonia (5.5 PDK) and carbon disulfide (24 PDK).     "

In Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and other petroleum-producing states, analysts  said the price rise could help sagging regional economies rebound from years of  stagnation -- but only if oil continues to sell for $25 a barrel for a year or  longer.    ""If it continues for a long-term period, our economy will benefit at the  expense of other parts of the nation,"" said Nancy McCallin, chief economist  with the Colorado Legislative Council, a research arm for the legislature.    In Denver, the decline in local oil production is blamed, among other things,  for a slumping real estate market and construction industry. The city has a 23%  vacancy rate in office space, mostly in the gleaming downtown towers built to  house Texaco, Exxon and other companies that worked the Colorado oil fields.    The glut of cheap oil in the '80s has had an even more severe impact in Texas,  where annual oil production declined from nearly 1.3 billion barrels during the  Arab oil embargo in 1973 to only 762 million barrels in 1988.    At one point, housing values in Houston fell by 30% or more as those who  settled in the region during the good times left in droves.    Now, four years after hitting the bottom of the slump in 1986, some parts of  the Oil Patch have made a comeback. And some regions stand to benefit more from  higher oil prices than others, analysts said.    In recent years, Houston and Dallas have developed more diversified economies  that are less dependent on the whims of the international petroleum market.  High-technology industries have played an important role in the economic  recovery of Texas' two largest cities.    Stephen Brown, senior economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank, estimates  that every $1 increase in the price of oil could add 15,000 jobs in Texas, 40%  of them in the oil industry and the rest in retailing, service and other  industries. So if oil hovers at $22 a barrel, Brown predicts 50,000 new jobs in  Texas, which represents less than a 1% increase in employment in the state over  the next two years.    ""The increase (in oil prices) will help some, but we're really not talking  about very much here. Even at $25 a barrel, it isn't very exciting,"" he said.  The energy industry represents only 10% of the gross state product, compared to  20% in 1981, he said.    But in Louisiana and the West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa, a sustained  period of high oil prices would be a desperately needed boost to the local  economies.    ""(Midland-Odessa) is still largely energy-dependent. Clearly, the thing that  would bring that area back is energy,"" said Ralph Carestio, vice president for  real estate and energy with NCNB, a Dallas bank. ""If this isn't just a  short-term spike, it's good news for the Texas economy and for domestic  producers in general.""    John Faulkinberry, chief financial officer of Paramount Petroleum Co., a  four-year-old Houston-based independent oil producer, said: ""We hate to see a  war key this chain of events, but we've all been smiling. We're steaming right  ahead."" Faulkinberry said Paramount drilled 22 wells in 1989 and is planning to  drill 45 in 1990.    Still, despite a $5 increase in oil prices the past week, officials in Colorado  and Texas said they are unwilling to link the future of their regional  economies to what they see as an inherently volatile and unstable situation in  the Middle East.    ""It's too uncertain right now,"" added McCallin, the Colorado economist. ""I  can't imagine that you're going to see any large oil producers saying it makes  more sense to drill in Colorado right now.""    Indeed, few in the oil industry were willing to predict an increase in domestic  drilling any time soon.    ""You'll see a lot of companies that are gun-shy. After coming off this  depression, they're going to wait and see what happens,"" Faulkinberry said.    ""It's far too early to say this is going to mean anything wonderful for  domestic production,"" said Jere Smith, a spokesman for Phillips Petroleum Co.  in Bartlesville, Okla. ""You can't base your capital spending on one week of  price increases.""    Smith added that Phillips is more likely to initiate new drilling abroad than  it is domestically.    Bernard Weinstein, an economist at the University of North Texas, said he  believed oil prices would have to stay in the mid-20s for at least three months  before the oil industry would consider stepping up domestic production.    And, Weinstein added, it could be from one to three years before an overall  improvement in the Texas economy could be felt.    ""On balance, Texas stands more to gain than lose in higher prices,"" Weinstein  said. If $25-per-barrel oil sticks, Weinstein said $8 billion will be added to  the gross state product over the next year, creating 64,000 new jobs and $258  million in state and local tax revenue.    While oil is ""not the dominant industry it once was in Texas, higher energy  prices will give our oil and gas sector a shot in the arm that it needs,"" he  said.    Small and independent producers fueled much of the Texas oil boom in the '70s  and '80s. Many of those companies went under when crude prices sunk to $10 per  barrel in 1986. Even as oil pushed toward $30 per barrel this week, most  independents were sounding a word of caution.    ""There's a lot of uncertainty involved in all of this,"" said Don Covey,  president of the exploration and production division of Houston-based Mitchell  Energy & Development Co. ""We've just been in this a few days, and we don't  know how long it's going to last. It's going to take time to see how it shakes  out.""

The loss reflected a change in accounting policy and the subsequent write-off of Pounds 42.3m of costs of unsuccessful exploration. The year earlier net loss was a restated Pounds 1.2m after a Pounds 32.7m write-off. Turnover dropped to Pounds 83.3m (Pounds 87.2m) Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said the rights issue would give the company a cash cushion following the go-ahead of its development of the Gryphon field in the North Sea later this year. 'This is a major sea-change within Clyde - we're moving to the fast track development of Gryphon,' he said. Originally, Gryphon was due to come on stream in 1996 but Clyde now plans to start production in the final quarter of this year. That would involve investment of Pounds 90m - Clyde has a 35 per cent stake in Gryphon - this year which would push the company's debt to equity ratio to over 100 per cent. Mr Malcolm Gourlay, chief executive, said: 'We're at a peak of our expenditure this year and the rights issue will help keep that under control'. The rights issue, of 79.86m shares on a 1-for-4 basis, will give Clyde the flexibility to continue its exploration programme overseas while it proceeds with UK developments. Cashflow will increase to Pounds 350m next year as the company's production rises to 55,000 barrels a day in the second quarter from a current level of 23,874 b/d. With the strong cashflow, the company plans to pay down its debt quickly and reduce gearing from the 100 per cent level to 60 per cent by 1994 and 15 per cent by the end of 1996. The company is looking at break-even this year with possibly a small profit or loss. For 1994, when it hopes to return to profit, it plans to pay an interim dividend of 0.5p followed by a final of 1p.   Companies:-  Clyde Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

First, the editorial about Neil Bush, who used his  privileged position to have his bank lend funds to business associates, deals  that benefited him financially, loans that were not properly secured. For this  caper Neil was slapped on the wrist by the government Office of Thrift  Supervision, banned from the banking industry because he had ""engaged in  personal dishonesty,"" and had ""willfully breached his fiduciary duties."" And,  of course, he is appealing that judgment.    Contrast this with the same day report on Anthony Essex, a Los Angeles black  bank executive, who, horrors, ""exaggerated his income"" to obtain a home loan of  $121,500. He was booked for this crime on eight fraud charges. He will have to  pay the bank $63,000, spend six months in jail, serve 640 hours of community  service and be on five years probation when he leaves jail.    Obviously, Essex had the wrong father. Meanwhile and more glaringly, George  (""kinder, gentler"") Bush announces part of his plan to meet the current rising  deficit is ""by relying heavily on reductions in Medicare and other health  benefits."" The President balanced his announcement by ""denouncing angrily a  House subcommittee's refusal to fully fund his space exploration initiative and  declared the American people want us in space."" He went on to ""challenge those  who would tackle the nation's social ills before proceeding with a renewed  exploration of the heavens.""    I wonder which sector of the ""American people"" Bush is talking about? If he  were to conduct a poll tomorrow stating that given an option of voting $10  billion (an arbitrary figure) to explore Mars or spending that same amount of  money to help feed our homeless, provide more treatment centers for alcoholics  and other dopers, leave our Medicare budget untouched and provide better care  for our indigent elders, I am certain that the voters, cynical, befuddled and  uncaring as they often seem to be, would overwhelmingly choose the second  option.    What is the point of solving the problem of putting even a regiment of space  travelers on Mars when our own domestic problems, typified by violence and dope  dealing and illiteracy, are unsolved?

For this  caper Neil was slapped on the wrist by the government Office of Thrift  Supervision, banned from the banking industry because he had ""engaged in  personal dishonesty,"" and had ""willfully breached his fiduciary duties."" And,  of course, he is appealing that judgment.    Contrast this with the same day report on Anthony Essex, a Los Angeles black  bank executive, who, horrors, ""exaggerated his income"" to obtain a home loan of  $121,500. He was booked for this crime on eight fraud charges. He will have to  pay the bank $63,000, spend six months in jail, serve 640 hours of community  service and be on five years probation when he leaves jail.    Obviously, Essex had the wrong father. Meanwhile and more glaringly, George  (""kinder, gentler"") Bush announces part of his plan to meet the current rising  deficit is ""by relying heavily on reductions in Medicare and other health  benefits."" The President balanced his announcement by ""denouncing angrily a  House subcommittee's refusal to fully fund his space exploration initiative and  declared the American people want us in space."" He went on to ""challenge those  who would tackle the nation's social ills before proceeding with a renewed  exploration of the heavens.""    I wonder which sector of the ""American people"" Bush is talking about? If he  were to conduct a poll tomorrow stating that given an option of voting $10  billion (an arbitrary figure) to explore Mars or spending that same amount of  money to help feed our homeless, provide more treatment centers for alcoholics  and other dopers, leave our Medicare budget untouched and provide better care  for our indigent elders, I am certain that the voters, cynical, befuddled and  uncaring as they often seem to be, would overwhelmingly choose the second  option.    What is the point of solving the problem of putting even a regiment of space  travelers on Mars when our own domestic problems, typified by violence and dope  dealing and illiteracy, are unsolved?    I do not expect an answer. Just asking.    BEN IRWIN    Studio City      Letter to the Editor    "

Mr Savit Bhotiwihok, the minister responsible for energy policy, told a meeting of the Petroleum Institute of Thailand that the government would focus on developing domestic and regional energy supplies to meet electricity demand which is growing by an annual 10 to 15 per cent - or by roughly 1,000 megawatts a year. He said he expected to sign a memorandum of understanding next month with the government of Laos on the purchase of between 1,000 Mw and 1,500 Mw of electricity from proposed hydro-electric and coal-fired power stations in that country. By the end of this year, he added, Thailand and Malaysia could have completed negotiations on the sale of Malaysian gas to feed a power station with a capacity of about 1,800 Mw on or near their common border. A pipeline to the frontier area is already under construction on the Malaysian side. He said other possible sources of energy for Thailand included the offshore exploration zone shared by Malaysia and Thailand, the hydro-electric potential of the Mekong river, Burmese gas, and hydrocarbons from Cambodia and Vietnam. Mr Savit acknowledged that Thailand would continue to import oil from the Middle East but he raised the possibility of a European-style regional gas network and said: 'A lot of our effort nowadays is spent on studying the integration with our neighbouring countries'. The Thai government would vigorously support exploration and development of oil and gas fields in Thailand, and study the possibility of establishing a nuclear power industry. Development of lignite resources would also probably continue, but the government was unlikely to proceed with building new dams solely for the purpose of generating electricity. Mr Savit said that the Petroleum Authority of Thailand would be assigned to explore the possibility of building export refineries and establishing a 'huge' oil storage capacity in southern Thailand to 'stabilise' the regional oil market.

Transportation by far accounts for most of our energy use, upward of 70% to  80%. And motorists in Southern California buy more gasoline and drive more  miles than anywhere in the country. So it's no surprise that motor vehicles and  oil refineries, which spew forth pollutants and toxic chemicals, are a major  source of environmental problems.    In addition, ocean drilling for crude oil and transporting petroleum to  refineries hold the threat of spills that would damage marine life. On land,  plumes of leaked petroleum contaminants move from refineries toward ground  water supplies. Also, more than 5,000 underground fuel storage tanks are  believed to be leaking in Southern California.    Our stewardship of electricity and natural gas also has an impact on the  environment. Conventional power plants -- 455 in the Los Angeles Basin,  including major utilities and small, co-generation units -- burn fuel oil and  natural gas to generate electricity, all of which add to air pollution. Nuclear  power plants produce radioactive wastes that must be stored for thousands of  years. Hydroelectric dams tame wild rivers and flood scenic areas.

Federal fuel economy standards are  being toughened to conserve energy. There is a push for vehicles that run on  cleaner fuels, like methanol, natural gas, and electricity.    Despite conservation measures by residents and industry, natural gas  consumption in Southern California is expected to grow 2% per year through the  year 2000 because of population growth.    The same scenario holds for electricity use, driven by the twin forces of  population growth and increasing demands for air conditioning.    Also, energy conservation measures, while important, do not necessarily  contribute to cleaner air locally. About 80% of the electricity used in the Los  Angeles Basin is generated outside the area, such as the Pacific Northwest and  New Mexico.    The reliance on imported electricity is expected to gradually increase in the  years ahead. To the extent that such electricity is generated by coal, oil or  natural gas-fired power plants, we are, in effect, exporting our pollution.

The increase was due to a 53 per cent jump in the contribution of American Barrick, the gold producer in which Horsham has a 20 per cent stake. Barrick contributed Dollars 18.4m in earnings as well as a fourth-quarter dilution gain of Dollars 15.5m stemming from a public issue of shares at a price above Horsham's carrying value. A similar dilution gain of Dollars 17.6m was posted during 1990. Horsham also has a 60 per cent stake in Clark Oil  Refining, a St Louis-based petroleum refiner and distributor. Clark contributed Dollars 23m to Horsham last year, down from Dollars 27.7m in 1990. The fall was due to a maintenance programme at one refinery as well as slimmer retail margins. Horsham bought 195 hectares of undeveloped land on the outskirts of Berlin last September, which it plans to develop into a commercial and shopping centre. A company official said yesterday that the project was still in the planning stage, but that the aim was to start construction by the end of the year. The spokesman added that Horsham was also looking at other properties in the Berlin area. DONOHUE, the Quebec newsprint producer, had a final fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 38.5m, or CDollars 1.20 a share, including special charges, compared with a profit of CDollars 7.9m, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Sales fell to CDollars 110m from CDollars 155m last time because of lower pulp and newsprint shipments and weak prices. For all 1991, Donohue's loss was CDollars 58m, or CDollars 1.82 a share, against a profit of CDollars 29.1m, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 470m against CDollars 611m.

Blocks in Epirus and the Ionian Sea would be made available to international bidders after parliament passed a new law on oil exploration and exploitation, 'probably in late spring', according to Mrs Teresa Fokianou-Malaveta, the corporation's chairman. DEP's research department said seismic studies in Epirus produced encouraging results, while test drilling in the Ionian Sea had established the existence of oil-bearing levels, she added. Under production-sharing arrangements included in the new legislation DEP would have the right to participate with a minority stake in consortia exploiting oil deposits in Greece. Meanwhile, a new test drilling is being made by North Aegean Petroleum Corporation at the Prinos offshore field near Thassos island in the north-eastern Aegean. The drilling is the first by NAPC, a Canadian-led consortium, since Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war in 1987 over conflicting claims to offshore oil rights in the Aegean. The dispute has prevented NAPC from exploring for oil east of Thassos. Production at the Prinos field, situated west of Thassos in Greek coastal waters, has declined from 26,000 barrels a day in the early 1980s to about 8,000 b/d last year. However, the introduction of gas re-injection techniques, using natural gas from the nearby South Kavalla offshore field, has lifted production to around 12,000 b/d. If successful, the Dollars 5.3m drilling project, reaching 2,000 metres below sea level, could yield up to 6,000 b/d, Mrs Fokianou-Malaveta said. The Greek government last year signed a new six-year production agreement with NAPC, giving the consortium a more favourable tax arrangement than previously. The consortium had considered shutting down its operations because of the political obstacles to exploiting known oil and gas deposits east of Thassos. It has invested Dollars 700m in Greece since it won the Prinos concession 20 years ago. Denison Mines of Canada controls 58 per cent of the consortium. DEP holds 15 per cent, with subsidiaries of three other international oil companies, Wintershall Greece, Hellenic Overseas Holdings and White Shields Greece, holding smaller stakes.

Elf will hold two-thirds of the joint company, Elf Enterprise Petroleum, and Enterprise a third. The agreement involves the transfer of part of Enterprise's stake in the large North Sea Nelson oilfield to the joint venture company. In return, Elf will reduce its 25 per cent stake in Enterprise to 10 per cent. The shares will be distributed via an issue of Pounds 438m of exchangeable bonds to finance the acquisition. The bonds are issued by Elf but convert into Enterprise shares. Further financing of Pounds 347m for the asset purchase will initially be provided by Elf. Enterprise will assume one-third of the burden when it becomes a shareholder in the new company. The Occidental interests bought by the new venture include 23.4 per cent of the Claymore field and 36.5 per cent of the Scapa field. The deal also includes 36.5 per cent of the Flotta oil pipeline and terminal in the Orkney Islands. In addition, the sale involves a 36.5 per cent interest in the Piper B, Saltire A and Chanter fields which are under development, as well as a wide spread of exploration acreage. The new venture will hold 19 per cent of the Nelson oilfield. Mr Graham Hearne, Enterprise chief executive, said the company is gaining 'a broader, more balanced portfolio of assets with earlier production'.

The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard]  branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste,  as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered  to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation.    As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed  26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for  administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in  Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been  established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and  zinc deposits.    These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for  bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km  of national territory; they do not include agreements for the  exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of  the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field  of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and  foreign firms.    Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation  blocks into which the country has been divided, have already  been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms  and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all  of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the  year.    The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of  increasing its production after a strong decline that began  following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was  its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today  exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic  partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and  Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians,  production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital  branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is  guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of  which, in fact, are from the United States.    Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has  backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of  participation in attractive business opportunities.     "

The  system under consideration is designed to generate power using  heavy gravity oil A as well as to make effective use of waste  heat. Showa Shell will offer design and know-how of the method  of evaluating the system's cost effectiveness. In Asia,  including Korea, cogeneration technology has yet to enjoy a  widespread use. Noting a rapid increase in energy demand, the  company had decided that cogeneration technology shows promise  and begun aiming for building a foothold for entry into the  Korean market.    The petroleum cogeneration system is an electric power  saving  system which, in addition to generating power mainly used in  diesel engines, utilizes waste heat used in meeting demands for  hot water and air conditioning. According to the contract signed  by both parties, Showa Shell Sekiyu will provide the design  techniques for optimal equipment. The figures used for the level  of usage of heat and electricity by building owners and other  types of users are based on assumption. The company also will  allow the use of its own programs specifically developed for  assessing the system's cost effectiveness.    In the area of training, Showa Shell already has received  two  technical trainees from Korea. When a purchase order has been  successfully concluded in Korea, the company will send its own  engineers/technicians if requested by the Korean firm. The term  of the contract on technical cooperation is two years.    Showa Shell installed a 3000kW cogeneration system in a  shopping center, which opened last year in Sagamihara City,  Kanagawa Prefecture, to provide its retail store tenants with  heat and electricity. This was the first time oil was sold in  this way in Japan, directly from the petroleum company to users.  In the future, the similar method will be used in  variously-located regional development projects.    In Asia, economic development is creating a rapid growth in  energy demand, resulting in shortage of electric power supply  which is becoming extremely serious. Although development of  electric sources is moving rapidly, it is not possible to catch  up with demand at present. For this reason, such a distributed  electric source as an oil cogeneration system is attracting  attention, If the Korean venture should prove successful, then  the technology could spread to other regions of Asia.

However, the price of North Sea Brent crude for March delivery slipped back towards the close of the market to end barely changed from Friday. Traders expressed the belief that the US proposals for an import tax, even if they came to nothing, could galvanise the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to take action to support oil prices. Indeed, initial steps by Mr Alirio Parra, Opec president, to secure agreement for a cut of around 1m barrels a day in Opec output for the second quarter seems to have formed a consensus. Nigeria indicated yesterday it would cut its production from its current output level which it says is 2.4m b/d. Overall Opec output remained high in January at 25.05m b/d according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the trade publication, compared with the organisation's ceiling of 24.58m b/d. Market traders believe Opec could have problems making its next deal stick since members have signally failed to abide by the current programme of cuts. 'There is no doubting their seriousness over a production cut, but will they follow through and will it be 1m barrels?' said Mr Gary Ross, chief executive of Petroleum Industry Research Associates in New York. Nevertheless, hopes for a production cut by Opec members should support crude prices in the run-up to the next meeting on February 13. There is some doubt about whether refined product prices in Europe will benefit from any action by Opec as much as crude prices. Cambridge Energy Research Associates points to high product stocks, low demand and mild weather which have depressed prices. Algeria's state oil and gas monopoly, Sonatrach and British Petroleum signed a Dollars 45m exploration agreement in Algiers at the weekend, Francis Ghiles reports.

The end of the ""cold war"" minimized the importance of  military potential as a factor determining a country's position  in the international arena and assigned priority to indicators  of economic, scientific-technical, and financial strength. As a  result, Russia, which had been the United States' equal as a  leader in world development and which had essentially determined  the course of this development in conjunction with the United  States, turned into one of the large but economically weak  states with claims to only a ""secondary role.""    The collapse of the USSR, the severe economic crisis in  Russia, and the uncertainty of emergence from it made our state  even more vulnerable in world politics and international  economic relations. Members of the U.S. military-political,  business, and scientific communities, however, know that Russia  still has significant economic and scientific-technical  potential in addition to nuclear strength and political  influence. If the reforms are successful, this could turn it  into one of the United States' principal competitors in the  international arena and the world market, particularly in  several advanced fields. This is one of the main factors  motivating the United States to become actively involved in the  reform of the Russian economy according to guidelines convenient  for the United States.    Freedom of Choice?    One of the main elements of the present U.S. policy on  Russia  is the encouragement of the Russian Government to choose  patterns of economic reform meeting the long-term economic and  political interests of the West. In this context, the United  States was instrumental in imposing the IMF stabilization  program on Russia. This program has obvious foreign economic  goals in addition to internal economic objectives. The  experience of other states with comparable programs proves that  their main results are ""favorable"" economic conditions for the  servicing of foreign debts and the rapid growth of energy and  raw material exports, which have always been convenient for the  United States and the other leading nations that are the largest  creditors and consumers of fuel and raw materials.    The results of Russian economic development since 1992 prove  conclusively that the United States and other leading Western  nations managed to create the necessary conditions for Russia's  integration in the world economy as a country specializing in  the export of fuel and raw materials and of finished goods  requiring only the slightest processing. Serious negative  tendencies of a structural nature, resulting from the IMF  stabilization program, are already apparent in the Russian  national economy. One of these tendencies is the ""weight gain""  of the Russian economy, in which the processing industries'  share of physical production had already decreased to 64.5  percent in the first half of 1993 in comparison to 65.6 percent  in 1992 and 67.9 percent in 1991. This was accompanied by the  noticeable growth of the fuel and raw material sector, which  accounted for 25 percent of physical production in 1993 in  comparison to 11.3 percent in 1991.    Besides this, the accelerated decline of industrial  production as a result of the ""shock therapy"" also made  additional fuel and raw materials available for export, which  more than compensated for the reduction of output in various  industries. When aluminum production in Russia decreased by 8  percent in 1990-1993, for example, its domestic consumption was  reduced by a factor of almost 2.2, which allowed for a more than  3.7-fold increase in exports of this metal. Exports of crude oil  from Russia increased by more than 20 percent just in 1993, in  spite of the 6-percent reduction in output. As a result, exports  of fuel and raw materials already exceed 80 percent of the  Russian total.    The expansion of Russian exports of fuel and raw materials  to  the world market is in the long-term and short-term interests of  the United States and other developed Western countries. Russian  shipments in recent years were the main factor destabilizing  these markets and lowering prices. The index of world prices of  nonferrous metals, for example, had reached its lowest level in  the last eight years by the end of 1993--40 percent below the  1990 indicator. Comparable tendencies were apparent in the  markets for energy resources. These price dynamics are extremely  convenient for the industrially developed countries, stimulating  their economies and helping them surmount economic difficulties  of a cyclical nature.    Welcome, or Off-Limits to Outsiders    The United States' attempts to accomplish the Russian  economy's integration in the world economy as a fuel and raw  material appendage of the industrially developed nations are  also evident from the development of trade and economic  relations between the two countries. Raw materials are clearly  prevalent, for example, in Russian exports to the United States:  The overwhelming majority of export shipments to the American  market consist of nonferrous metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc,  copper, and others), metals of the platinum group, silver and  precious stones, petroleum and petroleum products, inorganic  chemicals, and fertilizers. Russian fuel and raw materials have  been of the greatest interest to American private businessmen,  who invested around 400 million dollars in Russia in 1993. It is  no coincidence that the biggest project will entail a consortium  of U.S. oil and gas companies investing a total of 3.4 billion  dollars in the exploration and development of new oil and gas  deposits in West Siberia and on the shelf of Sakhalin Island.    All of this has been accompanied by U.S. attempts to crowd  Russian exporters out of traditional markets and to keep Russia  out of the world markets in which it could compete, particularly  the markets for high-tech goods.    In the last seven years Russia's share of world arms exports  decreased from 38 to 17 percent, while the United States managed  to increase its share from 30 to 58 percent. In the last two  years alone, the United States almost doubled its own arms  exports. Meanwhile, the United States, which has a monopoly in  the world market for space services, is constantly spreading  rumors about Russian dumping in this field, although this  industry is no longer subsidized by the state in Russia, and the  low overhead costs of production are due to effective technology  and cheap manpower. A similar situation is taking shape in the  world uranium market, where Russian shipments still account for  only 4 percent of the total, although the Russian output  represents around 25 percent of the world total.    Furthermore, the United States is in no hurry to make any  cardinal improvements in the trade and economic status of  Russian goods. Most-favored-nation status in trade was extended  to Russia for only one year, the Jackson-Vanik amendment is  still in effect, and anti-monopoly legislation is still being  applied vigorously to Russian goods.    Integration processes on the North American continent are  having an increasing effect on the development of foreign  economic relations between the two countries. The more active  recent steps to form a North American free trade zone (NAFTA)  created even more difficulties for Russian goods in American  markets. The sale of Russian motor vehicles in the United States  with minimal customs duties, for example, would require  two-thirds of the components to be produced in the NAFTA states.  There are even more serious restrictions on textiles. The  exporter of Russian linen fabrics to the United States has to  prove that the goods have no analogues in the North American  countries. The perceptible relaxation of CoCom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control] controls on exports  of several high-technology goods to Russia was dictated  primarily by competition in the world market. The findings of a  study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in particular,  indicated that existing restrictions were ineffective because  high-power computers could be obtained in the world market in  circumvention of all controls. According to statements by  American officials, the liberalization of computer exports will  enhance the competitiveness of American companies substantially  without hurting U.S. national security.    In spite of Russia's increasingly severe socioeconomic  difficulties, most of the West's financial aid is being extended  in the form of comparatively expensive credits from  international financial institutions, and not in the form of the  nonrefundable aid that was extended to, for example, Japan and  Germany during their periods of economic reform in the 1940s and  1950s. This provides more evidence that the West has no  intention, or even the potential, to offer Russia sweeping  economic assistance comparable to the famous Marshall Plan (the  American aid in the restoration of the postwar economy of  Western Europe), which would amount to 60-75 billion dollars in  today's prices.    The `Triangle' Will Not Become a `Square'    This approach to the Russian reforms is a reflection of the  way in which the United States and other Western powers see the  new balance of power in the world economy and international  relations after the end of the ""cold war."" At present there is  an obvious tendency toward more vigorous efforts by the leading  Western countries to set up an effective system for the  collective regulation of world economic processes and  international relations, which should be based on the three  ""poles"" of economic strength--the United States, the European  Union, and Japan, which account for around two-thirds of the  world GDP. As Director F. Bergsten of the distinguished  Institute of the World Economy remarked in this context, the  ""big three"" should begin acting like an unofficial managing  committee of the world economy. Under these conditions, Russia's  many attempts to become an equal member of the group of leading  Western countries for the collective resolution of global  problems will not win any support. We must not forget that the  harsh laws of competition were always at work in the world  economy and international politics, and there was always the  determination to secure national interests, frequently by  infringing the national interests of others....

BP Exploration yesterday declined to comment on its plans for Tex/Con. But sources in the energy industry said the sale would be in keeping with BP's shift of emphasis in its exploration activities from the lower 48 US states to 'frontier' areas, such as Alaska and central and south America. An analyst in London said Tex/Con is likely to fetch between Dollars 650 and Dollars 1bn. According to US reports, BP has appointed investment bank JP Morgan to handle the sale, and prospective buyers will soon be invited to inspect details of Tex/Con's financial and operating condition in New York and Houston. Tex/Con's business, which includes exploration, production and pipelines, is centred in Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas. It has interests in 3,000 wells and operates 1,500 miles of gas-gathering pipelines. Tex/Con produces about 11,800 barrels of oil and 121m cu ft of gas a day. BP does not disclose revenue or profit figures for Tex/Con. But low natural gas prices, an inability to fully replace reserves and falling oil production appear to have contributed to BP's disillusion with Tex/Con, which was set up as an autonomous, entrepreneurial venture. Staff numbers have been sharply cut back in recent months as part of an effort to reduce overhead. The company's problems came into public view last week when BP announced that Tex/Con's chief executive Mr Bill Johnson was taking early retirement. Mr Johnson has been replaced by Mr Bill Sears, formerly vice-president for offshore exploration.

In response to Chinese accusations that Vietnam had been  harassing its oil survey vessels, a Foreign Ministry statement  said the area in question was entirely within Vietnam's  exclusive economic zone and had been never been part of the  Spratly Islands.    The statement implicitly denied any harassment of Chinese  vessels, saying that Vietnam had only been carrying out  legitimate survey work completely within its rights.    ""China should not make declarations or carry out acts that  violate Vietnam's incontestable sovereignty over this area,"" the  statement said, adding that this would not help efforts to  improve relations or secure peace in the region.    Vietnam has accused China of acting illegally by granting  Crestone Energy Corp. a concession to explore in a huge swathe  of the South China Sea that includes what the Vietnamese call  the Tu Chinh area.    ""Declarations that the Tu Chinh area lies within the  maritime  zone of the Spratly Islands and China's signature of an oil  exploration contract with Crestone run contrary to legal  principles and international conventions, in particular the 1982  Law of the Sea,"" the statement said.    Vietnam's parliament is expected to ratify the UN maritime  law during its session this month in a move seen as boosting  Hanoi's legal arsenal in the dispute. [passage omitted covered  by referent item]    Both sides have repeatedly pledged to resolve the dispute  over the Spratly and Paracel islands through negotiations and  avoid a repetition of the brief naval clash they fought in 1988.    But stepped up oil exploration across the area and new  technology that enables oil firms to drill cheaper wells in deep  waters is threatening to complicate the problem.    Oil firms here have downplayed the risk of confrontation,  saying that they are more concerned over whether the promising  geology under the South China Sea will actually yield commercial  quantities of oil and gas.    ""You're not going to see gunboats out there firing at each  other,"" said one oil executive who insisted on anonymity, adding  that he thought the dispute was mostly ""shadow playing.""     "

And It Is""]    [Text] Havana -- Gold, that highly coveted mineral which  has cost the life of more than one person, also benefits Cuba  with its presence in at least five of the country's regions, two  of which look like good prospects. The authorities see the new  possibility of gold production opening up for Cuba as a means of  diversifying national production and at the same time as another  source of revenue and another opportunity to trade with foreign  investors.    According to Jose Casa de Valle, technical director of the  Geological-Mining Union of Cuba, the possibilities of producing  the valuable metal in Cuba are excellent because he considers it  to be highly profitable, especially in the Pinar del Rio region  where the mining process has already begun.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official said they  expect to produce 300 kg in 1994 from the Castellanos deposit in  Pinar del Rio, in the western part of the country, and 500 kg  per year is expected in the near future.    He said a sulfometals [sulfometales] plant there was adapted  to obtain gold ingots through mass lixiviation. The final  product is 99.999-percent pure gold.    From that deposit, he added, 1 to 1.5 grams of gold per ton  are extracted, which is the average measure for gold.    He said they are conducting gold exploration and  exploitation  on their own, without foreign investments, at that plant. In the  case of polymetals [polimetales], such as lead, zinc, and other  minerals, however, we are exploring the Pinar del Rio zone with  help from foreign companies, mainly Canadian.    When asked about the participation of foreign companies in  the exploration and exploitation of minerals in the country,  Casa de Valle explained the island is divided into 37 blocks for  geological prospecting and more than 20 contracts have already  been signed with foreign investors, particularly Canadians, for  the random exploration of solid minerals.    That is also the case of Delita on the Isle of Youth; El  Descanso in Villa Clara, in the central part of the country;  Jobabo in eastern Camaguey Province; and Aguas Claras in Holguin.    The executive, with 27 years of experience in the field,  thinks the deposit at Delita is the most promising because,  according to geological studies, it is currently the largest ore  deposit in the country.    Notwithstanding, gold mining there is complicated because  the  mineral is mixed with large quantities of arsenic, an  undesirable element from every point of view.    He said: The exploitation of that deposit is being  negotiated  with foreign companies, and the research was carried out by  Cuban specialists.    He explained: We believe that if those investments are made  within two or three years, Delita will yield between 2.5 to 3  tons of gold per year.    He said the remaining deposits, El Descanso and Melonera, in  Villa Clara, are currently in the research phase. They are  relatively small but they have a high content of the mineral.    He thinks the region is the most promising as far as gold  discovery is concerned. Canadian companies are conducting  explorations at random there, but there is still no final  evaluation.    Casa de Valle reiterated that the prospects in that zone are  vast because conditions are similar to the deposit in Nevada,  United States, and Pueblo Viejo, in the Dominican Republic.    In referring to the Aguas Claras mine in eastern Holguin  Province, the specialist said negotiations are under way with  foreign companies to explore areas around that mine since it is  presumed it contains gold. Until recently, and even prior to  1959, molten gold was taken from that region to Pinar del Rio,  where it was processed. The reserve ran out some time ago,  however, and mining stopped.    Speaking about the island's gold prospects, which is so  useful in the electronic's industry because it is an excellent  electricity conductor and is rustproof, Casa de Valle said  mining and processing were highly profitable in Pinar del Rio  because investments there had been minimal (between $6 million  to $8 million). Delita is also considered profitable despite the  complexity of the zone, given its proximity to the sea. It  requires an investment of between $40 and $50 million but the  gold there could be exploited for at least 20 years. He said  that with these prospects, the country will soon become one of  Latin America's gold producers, led by Chile, Brazil, and Peru,  among other nations.     "

If correct, the new Saudi numbers would boost by about 10% the free world's  proven reserves of crude oil to the 900-billion-barrel range. This would tend  to prolong the oil era and underscore the reliance of industrialized nations on  the Middle East.    Some Saudi watchers said the dramatic upward revision is legitimate and  overdue, while others said it was at least partly inspired by the politics of  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Both views might be correct,  analysts said.    ""This was a political announcement. On the other hand, they may well have the  oil,"" said William D. Dietzman, a retired Energy Department geologist who has  studied the Saudi oil fields for the U.S. government.    Several other OPEC nations, including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela, have  also increased their own oil reserve estimates sharply in the past year. The  higher a country's reserves, the greater its influence and production quota in  OPEC. Within the oil community, Iran's claims are widely discounted while the  others are accepted to varying degrees.    The Saudis, through their Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco, said that six  years of studies at their new oil exploration and engineering computer center  showed that they have 252.4 billion barrels of proven crude oil underground and  177.3 trillion cubic feet of gas.      U.S. Estimates Similar    For many years, the official Saudi government number was 110 billion barrels.  But since at least 1975, the scientific community has carried Saudi Arabia on  its books as having 150 billion to 170 billion barrels, the estimate varying  annually with oil prices, discoveries and production levels.    The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., said its estimate a year ago was 167  billion barrels, similar to the Saudis' own numbers at that time. The USGS put  the natural gas estimate at 130 trillion cubic feet, while Aramco had  previously estimated 141 trillion.    Dietzman and others said the timing of the announcement dramatically boosting  the Saudis' official oil reserve estimate strongly suggests that it was  inspired by the need to hold their ground within OPEC for the purposes of  determining quotas.    ""They're saying, if Iraq says it has 100 billion barrels, then we say we have  250 billion,"" Dietzman said.    Even without the political element, any assessment of how much oil is  underground and how much of it can be recovered with known technology and  current prices is inexact. But in Saudi Arabia, the reserves are considered so  large that it is hard to challenge any estimate.    Consultant Joseph Story of McLean, Va., a former Aramco executive, said there  is so much oil in Saudi Arabia that until recently, not much effort has been  expended at determining just how much there is.    But skyrocketing oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s prompted Saudi  Arabia to spend some of the financial windfall on establishing a  state-of-the-art oil exploration and engineering center in Dhahran in 1982 that  is the envy of oil geologists.    Aramco, calling the latest estimates ""very conservative,"" said the work done at  the Dhahran center is the basis for the big increase in the official reserve  estimates.    ""There was no need to look for oil. But now they've put a lot of money into  upgrading their seismic capabilities and into exploration activity,"" said  Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services Inc. ""The point of this is, the  numbers are probably true. But in announcing it, they might also be trying to  alleviate any worries that there are going to be shortages any time soon.""    The more plentiful the supplies of low-cost crude oil such as Saudi Arabia's,  the lower prices are likely to remain. However, the Middle East oil fields --  which already account for about 70% of free world oil reserves -- are expected  to account for a steadily increasing share as other producing countries such as  the United States run low.    Aramco, once a joint venture of the Saudi government and the U.S. oil giants  Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, operates Saudi Arabia's oil fields.

Houston-based Bellwether Exploration has said that in December it approached the UK-quoted company with merger proposals on the basis of 3.75 Aberdeen shares for each of its own. Based on an exchange price of Dollars 1.5395 to the pound, and Bellwether's share price of 62 1/2 cents, the proposal values each Aberdeen share at 10 3/4 p. The shares last night closed  1/8 p higher at 8 5/8p. Mr Darby Sere, chief executive of Bellwether, said the announcement was made in light of the almost-50 per cent rise in Aberdeen shares since the approach had first been made. He stressed the synergies between the two groups, which both own and operate North American assets. If an eventual offer succeeds, then the enlarged company would lose the USM quotation. Bellwether, an oil and gas exploration and production company, is traded on Nasdaq in the US. It has a market capitalisation of about Dollars 11.5m (Pounds 7.5m) and is 80 per cent held by three UK institutions and Torchmark, the US insurance company. It is extremely unlikely, however, that Aberdeen would accept the initial proposals from Bellwether. Both companies have been in informal discussions for more than a year, said one observer close to Aberdeen. Yet the Bellwether proposal was believed to be somewhat different from the tentative arrangements discussed in the earlier informal meetings. The irony of yesterday's announcement was not lost on Aberdeen, which last month received short shrift from Brabant Resources, another USM-quoted company, to its own surprise merger proposals. Last week Brabant issued a strong statement stressing that Aberdeen's plan did not have the support of the board. Brabant said its North Sea assets and focus on exploration did not fit with Aberdeen's largely American base. Mr George Robb, the new chairman of Aberdeen, said his company was meeting with financial advisers to determine an appropriate response. The announcement would not alter the situation with Brabant, he added.   Companies:-  Aberdeen Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Shkarban, President of of the Association of  Farmers of Ukraine: ""`Inexpensive' Fuel""]    [Text] According to the decision of the Cabinet of  Ministers of 9 February 1994, the exchange of farm production  for material-technical resources is foreseen. The concern  ""Ukragrotekhservis"" will realize this in exchange for the funds  allotted for the financing of the state contract for the  purchase of agricultural production. In particular, it is  foreseen that 28.7 trillion karbovantsi will be used for the  purchase of petroleum products, including 13.3 trillion  karbovantsi for spring field work. From this sum, the Ministry  of Finance has already paid 630 billion karbovantsi to  ""Ukragrotekhservis."" This concern, which has great advantages in  transportation and tariffs, buying hard currency at a fixed rate  (12,610 karbovantsi per dollar), for the use of state resources  for wheat storage and processing enterprises, would have to do  this so that charges would not exceed 50 percent of the customs  cost of the fuel. Therefore ""Ukragrotekhservis"" raised the price  for petroleum products and gets 4.3 trillion karbovantsi for  this from the producers, including 2.5 trillion karbovantsi for  gasoline. This happened because the ratio of prices for so  called ""inexpensive"" fuel is worse than the ratio of prices on  the world market. For example, at the ""inexpensive"" wholesale  price for diesel fuel of 3.9 million karbovantsi per tonne and  the starting cost of grain at 1.29 million karbovantsi per  tonne, the ratio becomes approximately one to three, while on  the world market it is one to 1.5 (in the commercial structures  of Ukraine, one to 2.12).    Reference to the point that, supposedly, the ratio of one to  three will be lowered by future indexation is baseless, since  there is no guarantee that, with the change in the price for  grain as a result of indexation, the price for fuel will not  also change at the same time.    In our view, it would be better if the state paid in advance  with funds allotted in the budget (on the basis of a futures  agreement) for the full price, equivalent to the world price,  that part of the contract, which the producer transfers to the  state as a pledge for the future harvest.    The agricultural producers have to consider seriously  everything while making contracts for the sale of grain,  sunflower and sugarbeet, so that another robbery of the  villagers by state structures will not take place.

By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER      Leading oil companies have agreed to spend $800 million -- more than three  times their earlier estimate -- to staff and equip five around-the-clock teams  capable of quickly responding to a major oil spill anywhere in U.S. coastal  waters, industry sources said Wednesday.    The regional response centers, to be announced by oil industry executives today  in Washington, D.C., are at Port Hueneme, Seattle, Lake Charles, La., the New  York-New Jersey area and Port Everglades, Fla.    In California, satellite staging areas are planned in San Diego, Los Angeles  and San Francisco. The centers will be staffed by 64 full-time personnel.    The response centers are expected to be operational within 2 1/2 years, and  will augment existing cooperatives that are not equipped to deal with a major  oil spill.    The chief executive officers of 14 major oil companies organized a task force  after the disastrous March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez spill that dumped 11 million  gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. The task force quickly  concluded that the petroleum industry had ""neither the equipment or the  personnel"" to handle a catastrophic tanker spill.    ""If oil is spilled close to a shoreline and if the drift of the oil caused by  wind and current is onshore, it is unlikely that anyone can prevent shoreline  contamination, no matter how ideal the conditions,"" the task force warned.    Last February, two environmental groups completed a yearlong study that found  that oil tanker traffic to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York harbors is  so heavy -- at least 1,000 tanker visits to each port annually -- that a major  oil spill was inevitable.    This study came weeks after the 394,000-gallon spill off Huntington Beach from  the tanker Pacific Trader.    The 14 petroleum companies had pledged to spend $250 million over five years to  fund the ""Petroleum Industry Response Organization"" (PIRO). By comparison,  Exxon spent more than $2 billion to clean up the Alaska spill.    The organization will be renamed the Marine Spill Response Corporation and will  be headed by retired Coast Guard Vice Adm. John D. Costello.    An estimated $60 million will be spent to set up the Port Hueneme response  center. The Seattle center will cost $46 million, with staging areas planned  for Astoria, Ore., Bellingham, Wash., Port Angeles, Wash., and Alaska.    Each center, industry sources said, will be able to respond to a spill of  216,000 barrels, or about 9 million gallons. If there is a larger spill,  regional centers would join forces to respond, industry sources said.    Despite the effort by the industry, critics have been skeptical that even a  small spill can be satisfactorily cleaned up, not to speak of a Valdez-size  accident.

By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER      Leading oil companies have agreed to spend $800 million -- more than three  times their earlier estimate -- to staff and equip five around-the-clock teams  capable of quickly responding to a major oil spill anywhere in U.S. coastal  waters, industry sources said Wednesday.    The regional response centers, to be announced by oil industry executives today  in Washington, D.C., are at Port Hueneme, Seattle, Lake Charles, La., the New  York-New Jersey area and Port Everglades, Fla.    In California, satellite staging areas are planned in San Diego, Los Angeles  and San Francisco. The centers will be staffed by 64 full-time personnel.    The response centers are expected to be operational within 2 1/2 years, and  will augment existing cooperatives that are not equipped to deal with a major  oil spill.    The chief executive officers of 14 major oil companies organized a task force  after the disastrous March 24, 1989, Exxon Valdez spill that dumped 11 million  gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound. The task force quickly  concluded that the petroleum industry had ""neither the equipment or the  personnel"" to handle a catastrophic tanker spill.    ""If oil is spilled close to a shoreline and if the drift of the oil caused by  wind and current is onshore, it is unlikely that anyone can prevent shoreline  contamination, no matter how ideal the conditions,"" the task force warned.    Last February, two environmental groups completed a yearlong study that found  that oil tanker traffic to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York harbors is  so heavy -- at least 1,000 tanker visits to each port annually -- that a major  oil spill was inevitable.    This study came weeks after the 394,000-gallon spill off Huntington Beach from  the tanker Pacific Trader.    The 14 petroleum companies had pledged to spend $250 million over five years to  fund the ""Petroleum Industry Response Organization"" (PIRO). By comparison,  Exxon spent more than $2 billion to clean up the Alaska spill.    The organization will be renamed the Marine Spill Response Corporation and will  be headed by retired Coast Guard Vice Adm. John D. Costello.    An estimated $60 million will be spent to set up the Port Hueneme response  center. The Seattle center will cost $46 million, with staging areas planned  for Astoria, Ore., Bellingham, Wash., Port Angeles, Wash., and Alaska.    Each center, industry sources said, will be able to respond to a spill of  216,000 barrels, or about 9 million gallons. If there is a larger spill,  regional centers would join forces to respond, industry sources said.    Despite the effort by the industry, critics have been skeptical that even a  small spill can be satisfactorily cleaned up, not to speak of a Valdez-size  accident.    Oil spill cleanup technology is considered fairly primitive, involving the  skimming of surface waters, the use of chemical dispersants to break up the  oil, or cleaning up beaches after the fact.

The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.           Appeals             Ivan J. Broussard, 6/21/94, LFA0383           Ivan J. Broussard filed an Appeal from a determination issued to him by the Privacy Act Officer of the Idaho Operations Office (Idaho) of the Department of Energy (DOE) in response to a request Mr. Broussard had submitted under the Privacy Act. In that determination, Idaho released to Mr. Broussard his entire Personnel File and portions of his Personnel Security File. Idaho withheld under Section 552a(k)(2) of the Privacy Act portions of Broussard's Personnel Security File which Idaho termed ``confidential source information.'' In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Idaho had not adequately justified the application of Exemption (k)(2) to the information withheld from Mr. Broussard. Therefore, the DOE remanded the matter to Idaho with instructions to explain why Exemption (k)(2) applies to the facts of this case, and/or consider, and adequately justify if necessary the application of other exemptions to the facts at issue.           KECI Corporation, 6/20/94, LFA0382            Keci Corporation filed an Appeal from a denial by the Richland Operations Office (DOE/RL) of its request for documents concerning a whistleblower complaint that had been filed by a Kaiser Engineers Hanford contractor employee, Mr. George Lengas. DOE rejected Appellant's claim that Exemption 6 could never protect the requested information from disclosure, but remanded the Appeal to DOE/RL because the determination failed to describe the withheld documents or to state with particularity the justification for withholding such documents. On remand DOE/RL will either release the requested documents or issue a new determination which contains a descriptive index and specific justification for withholding the requested documents.            Williams  Trine, P.C., 6/24/94, LFA0884            Williams  Trine, P.C. filed an Appeal from a determination issued to the law firm on April 22, 1994, by the Manager/FOI Authorizing Official of the Rocky Flats Office of the Department of Energy (DOE). In that determination, the Manager stated that the DOE did not find any documents responsive to the appellant's information request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). In considering the Appeal, the DOE confirmed that the Manager followed procedures which were reasonably calculated to uncover the requested information. Accordingly, the DOE denied the law firm's request.             Request for Exception         Pledger Oil Co., Inc., 6/24/94, LEE0080            Pledger Oil Co., Inc. (Pledger) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA782B, the ``Reseller/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering Pledger's request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a gross inequity or serious hardship. On April 8, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. No Notice of Objection to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Pledger's Application for Exception.         Refund Applications         Donco Carriers, Inc., 6/20/94, RR272130            Bassman, Mitchell  Alfano, Chartered, filed a Motion for Reconsideration on behalf of Donco Carriers, Inc. (Donco) and McMickle  Edwards in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. The Motion requested a modification of the estimation technique used in the Supplemental Order issued on April 5, 1994, which partially rescinded the original refund granted to Donco on November 30, 1993. Bassman argued that Donco based its gallonage claim on its dollar purchases according to Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) reports which exclude taxes. Therefore, Bassman argues that the price per gallon figures used to convert the dollar purchases to gallon should also exclude taxes. The DOE found this argument to be convincing and used tax-excluded prices when revising the estimation technique used to calculate the gallonage purchase. The applicant received an additional refund.            Good Hope Refineries/Exxon Company, USA., 6/22/94, RF33918            The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed in the Good Hope Refineries special refund proceeding on behalf of Exxon Company, USA, a purchaser of covered Good Hope petroleum products during the refund period. In the Decision, the DOE determined that during the consent order period (August 19, 1973 to July 31, 1976) Exxon's purchases from Good Hope were made on a spot basis. Exxon was, therefore, found ineligible for a refund based on the allocation of total Good Hope overcharges (2.0854%) calculated by ERA and listed in the Good Hope audit file. The refund period, however, extends beyond the time frame covered by the ERA audit, until July 31, 1979; and Exxon had established 32,518,051 gallons of regular Good Hope purchases made after July 1976 and before August 1979. The firm was, therefore, found eligible for a volumetric refund under the mid-level presumption of injury and its Application for Refund was granted for $50,000 plus interest.            Nashua Corporation, 6/21/94, RF27225435,   RD27225435            The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting an Application for Refund filed by Nashua Corporation (Nashua), a manufacturer of paper coatings, in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding. A group of States and Territories (States) objected to the application on the grounds that the applicant was able to pass through increased petroleum costs to its customers. In support of their objections, the States claimed that in 1979 the pulp and paper industry experienced record sales and profits, and that in 1973 and 1974 the return on shareholders' equity increased. The States further asserted that while energy costs increased during the 1970s, the pulp and paper industry was able to reduce its petroleum costs unit through energy conservation and use of alternate energy sources. Specifically with respect to the applicants, the States claimed that Nashua's sales and net earnings increased throughout the period of crude oil price controls. In addition, the States submitted an affidavit of an economist stating that, in general, the pulp and paper industry was able to pass through increased petroleum costs. In response to the State's Objection, Nashua argued that the States inappropriately relied on generalizations about the pulp and paper industry. Moreover, Nashua stated that it is not a pulp and paper manufacturer, but is in the coated paper products business. The applicant submitted an affidavit of the President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Nashua, stating that the company's products were sold in a highly competitive market, forcing Nashua to absorb increased product costs. The DOE determined that the evidence offered by the States was insufficient to rebut the presumption of end-user and that the applicant should receive a refund. The DOE also denied the States' Motion for Discovery, finding that discovery was not warranted where the States had not presented evidence sufficient to rebut the applicant's presumption of injury. The refund granted to the applicant in this Decision was $17,680.

IT COULD  COST HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS AND HOLD GRAVE RISKS FOR ASTRONAUTS.      By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER      KINGSVILLE, Tex.      Turning away from a capital immersed in its latest budget battle, President  Bush on Friday set his sights on Mars.    He renewed his commitment to landing Americans on the planet -- and for the  first time set a public deadline for the mission: July 20, 2019, the 50th  anniversary of the first moon landing by U.S. astronauts in the Apollo space  program. But he did not say how the multibillion-dollar centerpiece of his new  ""Age of Exploration"" would be financed.    ""It's time to open up the final frontier. There can be no turning back,"" Bush  said.    ""I believe that before Apollo celebrates the 50th anniversary of its landing on  the moon, the American flag should be planted on Mars,"" the President said in a  commencement address at Texas A&I University here.    While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm  commitment to spend the necessary billions of dollars that will be needed to  achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the  cooperation of Congress -- his fiscal 1991 budget has asked for a 24% increase  in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the largest  increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the  President's plan, NASA would receive $15.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning  Oct. 1.    Bush's renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a  commitment he made last July 20, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on  the moon, to return America to the business of space exploration and to send a  manned spaceship to Mars.    At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission,  directing Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, to  work out the details.    The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in  permanent orbit around Earth by the end of the century as the first step toward  a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime  afterward a manned laboratory on the moon.    The Mars mission would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three  decades -- one estimate has it costing $30 billion to $35 billion annually --  and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years.    Asked aboard Air Force One as he was about to leave Washington for Texas  whether the United States could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he  replied: ""You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there.""    As for where the money would come from, he replied, ""Thirty years is a long  time.""    The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide  with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent  storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if  their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on  Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to  return.    For his speech Friday, Bush chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip  of Texas, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. Texas A&I  has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, 57% of whom are Latino. It  graduated 407 students Friday.    Bush said that the nation's renewed commitment to exploration of space -- and  his related plan to use space vehicles to better chart conditions on Earth,  including changes in climate -- would generate widespread benefits.    ""Our space program will help rekindle public interest in science and  mathematics and revitalize an area of our educational system that has become  disturbingly weak,"" the President said. ""It will revolutionize everything from  computers to communications, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining  America's high-tech competitive edge. It will create new technologies, new  industries and new jobs.""    While the mission to Mars is the most dramatic element in Bush's overall space  policy, the program dubbed ""Mission to Planet Earth"" is geared to produce more  immediate results.    It is intended to use satellites with a new array of sensors to measure sea and  land temperatures, deforestation, and other elements in the phenomenon known as  global warming over a period of several years.

While the President's deadline for a landing on Mars does not amount to a firm  commitment to spend the necessary billions of dollars that will be needed to  achieve the goal -- that commitment can be accomplished only with the  cooperation of Congress -- his fiscal 1991 budget has asked for a 24% increase  in spending for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the largest  increase in funding for any major government agency next year. Under the  President's plan, NASA would receive $15.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning  Oct. 1.    Bush's renewed focus on Mars, and space exploration in general, reflects a  commitment he made last July 20, on the 20th anniversary of man's arrival on  the moon, to return America to the business of space exploration and to send a  manned spaceship to Mars.    At that point, however, he set no timetables or budgets for the Mars mission,  directing Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, to  work out the details.    The President also has set a goal of placing an operating space station in  permanent orbit around Earth by the end of the century as the first step toward  a permanent manned presence in space. He called for establishing sometime  afterward a manned laboratory on the moon.    The Mars mission would cost hundreds of billions of dollars over the next three  decades -- one estimate has it costing $30 billion to $35 billion annually --  and would culminate in a dangerous space voyage of two to three years.    Asked aboard Air Force One as he was about to leave Washington for Texas  whether the United States could indeed reach his Mars goal in 30 years, he  replied: ""You have to go fairly fast. It's a long way out there.""    As for where the money would come from, he replied, ""Thirty years is a long  time.""    The risks of the journey are awesome: The astronauts' spaceship could collide  with a meteoroid that could cause rapid decompression -- and death; violent  storms on the surface of the sun could blast them with deadly radiation, if  their craft is unprotected, and the team could be forced to spend a year on  Mars, waiting for the planet to be aligned properly with Earth to allow them to  return.    For his speech Friday, Bush chose a 65-year-old university in the southern tip  of Texas, a state heavily involved with the aerospace industry. Texas A&I  has an enrollment of nearly 6,000 students, 57% of whom are Latino. It  graduated 407 students Friday.    Bush said that the nation's renewed commitment to exploration of space -- and  his related plan to use space vehicles to better chart conditions on Earth,  including changes in climate -- would generate widespread benefits.    ""Our space program will help rekindle public interest in science and  mathematics and revitalize an area of our educational system that has become  disturbingly weak,"" the President said. ""It will revolutionize everything from  computers to communications, from medicine to metals, regaining and retaining  America's high-tech competitive edge. It will create new technologies, new  industries and new jobs.""    While the mission to Mars is the most dramatic element in Bush's overall space  policy, the program dubbed ""Mission to Planet Earth"" is geared to produce more  immediate results.    It is intended to use satellites with a new array of sensors to measure sea and  land temperatures, deforestation, and other elements in the phenomenon known as  global warming over a period of several years.

The commission voted unanimously to approve the remarks, which brand the  proposed federal rules as inequitable and significantly weaker than  pollution-control standards enforced on land.    Noting that prevailing winds in California's coastal area blow toward shore,  bringing offshore pollutants onto the land, the 47-page report drafted by the  state agency's staff suggested that new oil rigs could add to pollution  problems in parts of Southern California already burdened by the worst air  quality in the nation.    The document represents perhaps the harshest and most wide-ranging assault on  the federal air-quality plan for offshore oil operations issued by the  Department of the Interior in January.    ""I think they'll take our comments seriously,"" said Susan Hansch, the  commission's energy and ocean resources manager. ""As they are written now,  these rules promise only to exacerbate the serious existing problem with  onshore air pollution.""      No Comment From U.S.    Department of the Interior officials in Washington could not be reached for  comment Tuesday. Officials of the agency's Mineral Management Service in Los  Angeles said they had not seen the commission's remarks and declined comment.    But, at a Coastal Commission workshop Monday, an Interior Department official  said the federal agency would carefully consider the commission's remarks along  with others received before the April 17 deadline for comments on the proposed  regulations.    ""This rule is not cast in stone,"" said Michael Poling, a deputy assistant  secretary of Interior. ""What we have is a starting point.""    Although the recent oil-tanker accident in Prince William Sound off the Alaskan  coast has focused attention on the dire effects of spills, air pollution from  oil exploration and operations represents an equally vexing environmental  threat, experts contend.    If an Interior Department plan to lease oil tracts in federal waters off the  Southern California coast goes forward, a fleet of new platforms would sprout  from the sea, each belching pollution during drilling operations and attracting  a swarm of support ships to add to the smog, critics argue.    The federal drilling proposal for California waters is on hold while a  presidential task force studies the offshore oil issue, but some state and  local officials remain concerned that the plan could be revived, and many see  the air-quality issue as perhaps the best avenue of attack.    The proposed federal rules stem from nearly a decade of unsuccessful efforts to  devise a palatable strategy for con    trolling pollution from oil rigs off California.    In 1981, the state sued the Interior Department over the issue. As a result,  negotiations were launched in 1986 among officials of local, state and federal  governments, industry and environmental groups. After two years, however, a  consensus had not been reached, and the Interior Department dropped the effort  and set about drafting the existing proposal.    Aside from criticizing the proposed rule as ""significantly weaker"" than onshore  pollution regulations, the commission suggested that the plan would allow broad  exemptions and disrupt efforts to meet air-quality standards on land.    Under the regulations, thousands of tons of nitrogen oxides would be permitted,  causing ""an adverse impact far exceeding any gains"" that some regions would  hope to make by regulating pollution sources such as factories and automobiles,  according to a commission report.    The result would be ""deteriorated human health, deteriorated agricultural  productivity, and economic and social costs,"" including possible bans on  industrial and residential development on the coast, the report said.      Notable Exemptions    Among the exemptions in the federal rule is air pollution emitted by support  vessels as well as ships and equipment used by oil companies during exploration  and construction of offshore platforms, it said.    If the exemptions are allowed, more than 1,000 tons of nitrogen oxides will be  permitted in each air basin along the coast, according to the report. That load  of pollution is the equivalent of adding 125,000 cars traveling 10,000 miles a  year to a region's roads.    Moreover, construction of a typical dual-platform project would result in about  620 tons of nitrogen oxides in a year, equal to adding 77,500 vehicles  traveling 10,000 miles, the report said.    The commission report also said the federal standards lack strong monitoring  and enforcement provisions and leave too broad a decision-making role to the  regional director of the federal Minerals Management Agency, the oil  exploration arm of the Department of the Interior.    The report also criticizes the Department of the Interior for suggesting that  an environmental review of the proposed rule is not needed because it ""does not  constitute a major federal action affecting the quality of the human  environment.""

""Boom, an explosion. The whole block was doused with gasoline,"" De Laat  remembered Friday. ""Now this. It's almost identical.""    In 1976, nine people were killed and a block of businesses were leveled in the  Culver City-Palms explosion after a gasoline pipeline was punctured by a  bulldozer.    This week, three people were killed and 10 homes destroyed when a pipeline  ruptured after a train wreck at the same site two weeks ago. The train  derailment is being investigated as a possible cause of the gasoline explosion.      Prevent Recurrence    De Laat, a retired auto mechanic, said he wonders whether anything has been  done in those 13 years to prevent such a recurrence.    What new rules, he asked, protect those who live near the state's greatest  concentration of petroleum pipelines -- the 2,000-mile maze of major lines that  run into and out of the 18 crude oil refineries in Los Angeles County?    State and federal officials charged with ensuring the safety of petroleum  pipelines say the Venice fire and a pipeline explosion that destroyed nine  homes in west Long Beach in 1980 have prompted a raft of changes in  pipeline-safety regulations.    The cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach passed laws requiring annual  inspections for leaks in most pipelines, and those ordinances have since been  folded into state and federal laws, state officials said.      Flaws Acknowledged    They acknowledge, however, that serious flaws remain in those regulations. For  example, state law requires that before excavators begin digging at  construction sites, they must check with a central utilities clearinghouse to  find out where pipelines are located in the area.    But builders who ignore the law face no penalty, said Tom Lael, one of five  engineers in the tiny unit for pipeline safety in the state fire marshal's  office.    ""There is no enforcement provision. There is quite a bit of non-compliance,""  Lael said.    Also addressing the problem of excavation damage, which accounts for about 60%  of pipeline leaks, the U.S. Department of Transportation this summer will begin  requiring that pipeline operators notify companies whose operations pose a  danger to pipelines where the lines are located, said Jim Thomas, deputy  director of pipeline safety for the Transportation Department.      Inadequate Rules    Serious problems detecting the corrosion of the oil pipelines, which is the  second-biggest cause of leaks, have also emerged despite new testing  requirements, according to state and federal officials.    The National Transportation Safety Board warned in 1987 that federal rules are  inadequate to ensure that corrosion protection systems on the steel pipelines  are working properly. In response, the National Assn. of Corrosion Engineers is  reviewing the methods being used to evaluate such systems. The association's  recommendations are expected this year, said Thomas.    One Mobil Oil Corp. pipeline that runs through the San Fernando Valley  illustrates the failure of tests to detect corrosion, Lael said. Even though  the line has been found to be secure when tested under federal standards, it  has leaked at least six times during the last three years. Last September,  thousands of gallons of gooey, foul-smelling crude oil leaked onto valley  streets from the line.    Congress has asked federal regulators to soon implement stiffer federal rules  for corrosion testing, Thomas said.    For example, one new rule will require operators of all new pipelines to make  the length of the pipelines accessible to a camera and ultrasound devices that  will be able to detect erosion of the inner walls of the lines, he said.    Another concern on the Mobil Oil line was the lack of pressure-check valves at  regular intervals. Regulatory agencies have suggested, but do not require, that  such valves be installed to reduce the amount of oil lost during a break, Lael  said. But the federal Department of Transportation has concluded that such  valves would be prohibitively expensive.    Though government's decade-long push toward safer oil pipelines has been only  partially successful, Lael said, federal and state studies have repeatedly  found that shipment of oil through pipelines is far safer than the  alternatives.    Federal figures show that between 1982 and 1985, moving petroleum by pipeline  was about 50 times safer than moving it by truck and 135 times safer than by  rail.    For example, Mobil estimates that to substitute trucks for pipelines on its  troubled San Fernando Valley line, it would take a fleet of more than 600  tankers making round trips each day to carry crude oil from production fields  in Kern County to its Torrance refinery.

One Mobil Oil Corp. pipeline that runs through the San Fernando Valley  illustrates the failure of tests to detect corrosion, Lael said. Even though  the line has been found to be secure when tested under federal standards, it  has leaked at least six times during the last three years. Last September,  thousands of gallons of gooey, foul-smelling crude oil leaked onto valley  streets from the line.    Congress has asked federal regulators to soon implement stiffer federal rules  for corrosion testing, Thomas said.    For example, one new rule will require operators of all new pipelines to make  the length of the pipelines accessible to a camera and ultrasound devices that  will be able to detect erosion of the inner walls of the lines, he said.    Another concern on the Mobil Oil line was the lack of pressure-check valves at  regular intervals. Regulatory agencies have suggested, but do not require, that  such valves be installed to reduce the amount of oil lost during a break, Lael  said. But the federal Department of Transportation has concluded that such  valves would be prohibitively expensive.    Though government's decade-long push toward safer oil pipelines has been only  partially successful, Lael said, federal and state studies have repeatedly  found that shipment of oil through pipelines is far safer than the  alternatives.    Federal figures show that between 1982 and 1985, moving petroleum by pipeline  was about 50 times safer than moving it by truck and 135 times safer than by  rail.    For example, Mobil estimates that to substitute trucks for pipelines on its  troubled San Fernando Valley line, it would take a fleet of more than 600  tankers making round trips each day to carry crude oil from production fields  in Kern County to its Torrance refinery.

0,FT932-435 ,"FT932-435 _AN-DF2CGACRFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Oil companies look west to a wild frontier - A guarded optimism revealed by the latest batch of exploration licences      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   WHEN MR Tim Eggar, energy minister, awarded the latest batch of oil exploration licences recently, he confirmed the trend for many companies to look for oil in some of the less traditional areas around UK waters. As the North Sea and the southern gas basin to the east of the country approach maturity - which means they have been so heavily explored, companies do not expect to make important discoveries there - the oil industry is focusing more of its exploration work in waters to the west and the south. This has seen companies planning to explore west of Shetland, closer to shore in the Irish channel, in Cardigan Bay and even in the south-western approaches. Mr Eggar is enthusiastic about this trend. 'I think we are on the verge of proving up a major new oil province which is significant for the future of the industry and UK oil production,' he said last week. The government has particularly strong hopes for the west-of-Shetland area, since several discoveries have been made there. 'It is yet more evidence that the UK continental shelf continues to yield great benefits for the economy,' Mr Eggar said. But Mr Eggar is probably more enthusiastic than some in the oil industry, who point to the enormous difficulties to be overcome before discoveries in these 'frontier' waters can be turned into commercial production. Mr Richard Hardman, exploration director at Amerada Hess which has made a discovery of around 200m barrels of oil west of Shetland, says he is optimistic but cautious. 'It's good to know there are big structures there and large potential reserves, but there is a huge challenge to find the technology and get it out at a reasonable cost.' If companies can find sizeable amounts of oil to exploit, these new provinces could prove extremely lucrative. The proposed changes to Petroleum Revenue Taxes abolish tax on new fields, whereas the rate for existing fields is 50 per cent. This gives an added incentive to explore frontier waters. Many of these 'new' areas have been explored before - the Clair field which is estimated to contain 3bn barrels of oil was discovered in the region west of Shetland 20 years ago. The field has never been exploited because of complex geological problems associated with it and the lack of technology for extracting the oil. Improvements in technology for appraising and exploiting oil discoveries could make some of these more marginal areas viable for the first time. Nevertheless, it could be well into the next century before oil starts flowing from the west of Shetland region, although the waters of Cardigan Bay and the Irish channel could yield oil sooner. However, companies hoping to find oil in Cardigan Bay must work within strict environmental conditions. The area is one of great natural beauty and has a resident population of bottlenose dolphins. Environmentalists are threatening to challenge at an EC level the government's award of licences in sensitive areas such as Cardigan Bay. They say the licences could infringe EC environmental directives. The drawbacks in the west-of-Shetland waters are more prosaic. The operating conditions are among the harshest in the world because of the depth of the water and the bad weather. The water west of Shetland can be up to 6,000 ft deep, whereas the deepest producing platform in the North Sea is in water 600 ft deep. The weather is bad and companies are unable to gather seismic data needed for evaluating oil discoveries in winter as they can in the North Sea. In addition, the lack of infrastructure adds to the cost of development and production. British Petroleum made an important discovery of between 250m and 500m barrels of oil west of Shetland in March, which could cost Pounds 2bn to develop. 'You might be able to use a floating production system to extract the oil and then collect it in tankers,' said Ms Caroline Noble, industry analyst at Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh. 'But the weather is so bad, you probably wouldn't be able to use it all year round.' BP is conducting its largest-ever offshore seismic programme in waters west of Shetland at a cost of Pounds 9.4m in order to gather more data on its discovery and hopes to drill another well before the end of the year. Mr Hardman points out that Amerada drilled 15 wells in this area before it made a discovery. It lies in only 410 ft of water and should be easier to exploit, but Mr Hardman is still cautious. He was encouraged by the fast flow of oil from one well at a rate of 8,000 barrels a day. But Amerada plans to drill a couple more wells before it decides whether the discovery can be exploited commercially - that decision will be taken in 1995. A group of companies is looking again at the Clair discovery in the hope of establishing a development programme for that towards the end of the decade. But the complexity of the field means that only 150m barrels from the 3bn in place could be extracted. In spite of the enormous challenges to be overcome in these areas, the industry remains keen to search for oil which could be flowing well into the 21st century.

According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal  Service  on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical  Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities  (observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains  unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin  (the so-called priority list), it increased considerably between  1988 and 1992. Pollution by certain ingredients increased  somewhat in 15 cities. Only in 18 cities has it practically not  changed or declined slightly because of the drop in production.  For instance, in Irkutsk, Krasnodar, and Saratov the average  concentration of formaldehyde increased severalfold and exceeded  the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] by a factor of six to  seven. In Kemerovo the average concentration of carbon bisulfide  reached six MAC (a sixfold increase); in Krasnodar the  concentration of phenol in the air increased from two to three  MAC. The nitrogen oxide, dust, and phenol concentration  increased in Lipetsk (to 1.5-2.9 MAC); nitrogen dioxide and  ammonia concentration in Saratov--to 2.0-2.9 MAC; and in  Cherepovets the concentration of carbon bisulfide increased from  3.2 to five MAC in Bratsk and from 2.4 to 3.8 MAC. The degree of  air pollution in the capital remains very high; the  concentration of phenol did decrease, but at the same time there  was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (mainly  because of increased automotive traffic).    The hygienic state of air basins over the cities on the  priority list has changed to a different extent over the past  five years. For instance, the concentration of ammonia,  formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides increased in St. Petersburg;  of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Barnaul;  of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in  Orenburg; of phenol and nitrogen oxides--in Ryazan; and of  phenol, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides--in Kazan. The air quality  has not changed perceptibly in Perm, Kaliningrad, Groznyy.  Samara, Ivanovo, and Vyatka.    Water reservoirs. Observations of dry land surface water  pollution are conducted at 1,341 reservoirs in 2,624 ranges. At  851 of these ranges (32 percent) the average annual  concentration of at least one pollutant exceeds the MAC by a  factor of 10 or more. This ratio has not changed perceptibly  over the past few years.    According to official data, in 1992 as compared to the  preceding year in water reservoirs with a high degree of  pollution the quality of water improved at 35 ranges,  deteriorated at 99 ranges, and remained basically unchanged at  717 ranges.    Overall, the level of pollution of water reservoirs on the  territory of Russia remains high.    There has been a serious deterioration in the water quality  in the largest Siberian rivers--the Ob, Irtysh, Vakh, Taz, and  their numerous tributaries, where the concentration of petroleum  products increased from five-10 MAC in the early 1980's to 10-60  MAC in the early 1990's, and of phenols--from three-eight to  10-45 MAC, respectively. This is a result of the low efficiency  of environmental protection measures of oil- and gas-producing  enterprises and river transport.    The level of pollution of Volga water reservoirs remains  high--the content of many pollutants in them, including  petroleum products, phenol, copper, and nitrogen nitrite  measures five-15 MAC. The eutrophication process there continues  to progress at a faster rate.    There has been a substantial deterioration in the condition  of rivers in Tula Oblast, where in the upper reaches of the Don,  Shatskiy reservoir, and Ula river the concentration of phenol  and nitrogen compounds increased from two-eight to 20-35 MAC--a  result of operations of Novomoskovsk industrial complex chemical  enterprises; the situation also deteriorated in Stavropol Kray  rivers. Here, because of the unsatisfactory work of city  purification systems the concentration of petroleum products  increased from four-five to 20-50 MAC; of suspended  particles--from 150 to 950 mg per liter, and of organic  substances--from 50 to 100-300 mgO2 per liter.    Over the past four years the Moscow river has unfailingly  made it to the priority list of the most polluted water  reservoirs in the country; the average annual content of phenol  and nitrogen compounds in it measures 10-15 MAC, with a trend  toward an increasing level of pollution.    Monitoring data on dry land surface waters for 1992 showed  practically no change in the trends of pollution levels at water  reservoirs in Russia: the Kola Peninsula rivers, the Oka and Ob  basins, and rivers in the Urals industrial region remain the  most polluted water reservoirs.    The results of the 1993 monitoring are currently being  processed; the work will be finished in February.     "
0,FT933-1251 ,"FT933-1251 _AN-DIXCIAF4FT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Yemeni oil industry enters a new era - A development that has increased the country's output by two thirds      By ERIC WATKINS   CANADIAN Occidental Petroleum yesterday boosted Yemen's oil production by 60 per cent with the opening of its new fields in Masila. Brought on stream after an accelerated programme of development, Canadian Oxy's 120,000 barrels a day will increase Yemen's total output to just over 300,000 b/d. But more importantly, the new fields may open the way to further discoveries in coming months. Yemen's oil was first discovered in 1984 by the Dallas-based Hunt Oil Company, with further finds in 1986 by the former Soviet company, Technoexport. Taken together, the two sets of finds suggested the presence of a north-south oil trend and prompted Canadian Occidental to bid for a concession of its own in 1987. Concentrating its exploration efforts in the north-west corner of its 37,200 sq km concession area, Canadian Oxy began drilling in September 1990 and struck oil with its first well in January 1991. By December 1991, the company had drilled 14 wells and declared commerciality with an estimated 235m barrels of recoverable oil. Since then it company has drilled another 37 wells and increased its estimate of recoverable reserves to 460m barrels. Following its declaration of commerciality, the company began an accelerated construction programme to develop its production and export facility. In addition to the 51 wells and 55km of oil-gathering pipelines, Canadian Oxy has now constructed a central processing facility to purify and blend the oil, a 138km pipeline to the Gulf of Aden and an export terminal at Ash-Shihr with a loading rate of 60,000 barrels an hour. According to the production sharing agreement, the Yemen government will take 70 per cent of the liftings and Canadian Oxy 30 per cent. That shareout will sharply increase the country's export earnings. Prior to the new production levels, the government was understood to receive about 90,000 b/d from the Hunt field, of which 65,000 were used for domestic consumption. Added to the remaining 25,000 b/d per day, the new production figures from the Canadian Oxy field should give the government roughly 109,000 b/d day for export. The increased production will be a boon to Yemen's sagging economy and political structure. Since the Gulf War unemployment has stood at 36 per cent and annual inflation at 100 per cent. In October 1991 and again in December 1992, there were protest riots which left over 100 dead and many more injured. To maintain optimism, the government has long played up news of the country's oil potential and Canadian Oxy production will provide some justification for the its claims. Apart from the immediate rise in production figures, however, the Canadian Oxy discoveries have created a sense of optimism about further oil potential in the country. So far the company has fully explored only about 20 per cent of its own concession area and has now stepped up the pace of exploration to the east and south of Wadi Masila. Mr Ray Irani, chairman of the boards of US and Canadian Occidental, has expressed optimism that more oil will be found in the concession area and in the country as a whole. 'With oil production now at 300,000 b/d and increasing in the future, the prospects for Yemen's hydrocarbons industry are bright,' Mr Irani said. That view is shared by other companies operating in the region, particularly Total, Clyde Petroleum, and Lasmo Oil (Aden), which hold concession areas adjacent to Canadian Oxy's. Indeed, Total's recent discovery of 12,000 b/d in block 10, just east of Wadi Masila, now suggests that there may be another trend running to the north-east through the Canadian Oxy concession into those of Clyde and Lasmo. Mr Rod Makin, Lasmo's general manager, confirms the possibility of such a trend and is cautiously optimistic about his company's prospects regarding it. 'We are very hopeful about our chances in the Hood block, which is on one of the oil pathways of Yemen. We think we are on a trend and it just depends how far the trend extends,' he says. Lasmo began drilling its first well on September 1 and preliminary results could be available within a few weeks. Mr Makin underlines the significance of the results with care. 'This well and our next could be the turning point by proving the extension of the trend into the north-east,' he says. Mr Peter Bradley, general manager of Clyde, could not agree more. 'Yes', he says, 'the big question now is how far the trend extends. In that regard the Lasmo wells are important and could be most encouraging for us. They would automatically tell us that similar structures are in our fields. We have our fingers crossed.' According to Mr Bradley, Clyde will begin its exploratory drilling on November 1 this year. 'Clyde is reasonably optimistic, but we don't want to overplay it,' he says. 'This still is the exploration business and the next six to nine months will be a very intersting time for us.' Exploring for oil in Yemen is indeed risky. Most production sharing agreements now call for the collection of seismic data from at least 1,000km of survey lines and the drilling of three exploratory wells, all within 30 months. Elsewhere, according to Mr Bradley, the time frame for exploration is normally three or four times as long. Thus, in Yemen, companies are under considerable pressure to produce quickly. That pressure is increased by the size of concession areas and the nature of their terrain. With concession areas ranging from 1,200 sq km to 37,200 sq km, the odds are very clearly against exploration teams finding anything at all. As Mr Bradley put it, 'no company can possibly cover its entire concession area'. Thus, companies have to select carefully even before undertaking their seismic surveys. Because of the difficulties of the terrain, such surveys themselves can be costly and the results hard to interpret. Clyde, Lasmo, and Canadian Occidental are all operating on a plateau deeply incised by meandering Wadis. That means seismic data must frequently be collected by specialised vehicles - often helicopters - which can send costs as high as USDollars 13,000 a kilometre. The variable nature of the terrain, moreover, can affect the direction of seismic vibrations and produce misleading data. And, with drilling rigs estimated to cost between USDollars 2m and USDollars 6m each, such mistakes can be very costly. The odds against discovering oil in Yemen are therefore high and, not surprisingly, the list of dry wells is growing. But the achievement of Canadian Oxy is undeniable and has turned the eyes of oil men in new directions. 'One thing is for sure', says Mr Bradley.

The remodeling will aim to cut costs and reinforce the H-2's  launch capability to assist various related projects, such as  construction of the Japanese space shuttle ""Hope"" and  exploration of the moon and other planets. Armed with funds  totalling approximately 11 billion yen in the draft budget for  fiscal 1994, NASDA plans to first change the design of the  engine and airframe.    As the H-2 rocket is capable of launching a 2-ton-class  satellite into geostationary orbit, projects have already been  worked out to use it to launch meteorological satellites and  other satellites capable of monitoring the global environment.  NASDA has also started to develop a prototype of an unmanned  space shuttle to be called Hope, which is scheduled to be  launched by H-2. Without modification, however, the H-2 will be  used in only a few, specialized areas and launch costs would be  nearly double those of other countries.    NASDA will, therefore, first try to cut manufacturing costs  and modify the design to simplify the pipe arrangements and  welding parts of the engine and airframe. It aims, reportedly,  to cut launch costs by 30 percent.    There are three different methods of reinforcing the  rocket's  launch capability: Increasing to six the two sets of solid fuel  rocket boosters (SRB) which add driving force; installing two  sets of a new type of booster which is composed of two units of  the LE-7 main engine; and installing two sets of boosters  composed of four units of the modified LE-7 engine, which uses  hydrocarbon as its fuel.    The capability of the H-2 rocket, which is capable only of  launching 10-ton-class satellites into a low-altitude orbit at  present, will be increased so that it can launch satellites of  15 tons, 17 tons, and 27 tons respectively.    The government's Space Activities Committee is now studying  a  long-term space development program. Projects connected with  future space activities in the 21st century are under discussion  now. Suggestions include, for example, carrying out various  space experiments on the HOPE, and also retrieving surface soil  from the Mars using exploration spacecraft. Teruo Sofue, a  staff member of the comprehensive development department at  NASDA, said: ""By reinforcing the H-2 rocket, we can expand the  range of space development. We would like to develop it into a  rocket capable of engaging in a number of activities.""     "

Dates of Filing: July 17, 1992;   December 7, 1993;   April 13, 1994.  Case Numbers: LEF0047, LEF0120, LEF0123.   In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively. The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company (Gray) and William Valentine  Sons, Inc. (Valentine).       I. Background       During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling. 1  The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210, 211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations, a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R. 212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit $300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program after September 30, 1980.         1     Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., and Gibson Oil and Refining Company, were all controlled by Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels during the price controls period. Textual references to ``Western'' in this Decision include all parties to the consent order.          Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L. Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However, the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86, plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations.      Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980. 2  Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms.

In accordance with the procedural regulations of the Department of Energy (DOE), 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart V, the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) of the DOE filed three Petitions for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures with the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) on July 17, 1992, December 7, 1993 and April 13, 1994, respectively. The Petitions request that OHA formulate and implement procedures for the distribution of funds received pursuant to settlement agreements entered into by the DOE and Western Asphalt Service, Inc. (Western), Gray Trucking Company (Gray) and William Valentine  Sons, Inc. (Valentine).       I. Background       During the period of Federal petroleum price controls, Western was engaged in crude oil refining and reselling. 1  The firm was therefore subject to regulations governing the pricing of crude oil set forth at 10 C.F.R. Parts 205, 210, 211, and 212 of the Mandatory Petroleum Price and Allocation Regulations. As a result of an ERA audit of its operations, a Proposed Remedial Order (PRO) was issued to Western on April 4, 1984 pursuant to 10 C.F.R. Part 205, Subpart O (ERA Docket No. 940X00182). The PRO alleged violations of the pricing and certification rules that applied to crude oil resellers. Essentially, the firm was charged with selling price-controlled crude oil as uncontrolled stripper well crude oil at unlawfully high prices in violation of the provisions of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subpart L and 10 C.F.R. 212.131. In another enforcement proceeding, on May 7, 1981, a Notice of Probable Violation was issued to Western which alleged that the firm unlawfully received Small Refiner Bias Entitlements (ERA Docket No. N00S90197) in April and May 1977. These alleged violations of DOE crude oil regulations by Western were settled by a Consent Order between the firm and DOE on May 30, 1984. The PRO was therefore withdrawn and the NOPV was rescinded. Western agreed to remit $300,000, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. Western has complied with this obligation, remitting a total of $390,059.12 to the DOE. In return, the DOE has released Western from any liability regarding its failure to comply with the Federal petroleum price and allocation regulations during the period August 19, 1973 through January 27, 1981, with the sole exception of any potential violations of the Entitlements Program after September 30, 1980.         1     Western Asphalt Service, Inc., W.F. Moore and Son, Inc., and Gibson Oil and Refining Company, were all controlled by Wilfred Paige van Loben Sels during the price controls period. Textual references to ``Western'' in this Decision include all parties to the consent order.          Gray was also a crude oil reseller during the period of price controls. On March 29, 1982, Gray and the DOE entered into a Consent Order whereby Gray would remit $31,500, plus interest, to the DOE for deposit in an interest-bearing escrow account. The DOE agreed not to pursue its claim that, during the period March 1977 through January 1980, Gray overcharged its customers by charging unlawfully high prices for crude oil in violation of 10 C.F.R. Part 212, Subparts F and L. Despite its agreement with the terms of the Consent Order, Gray failed to comply fully with its financial obligations to the DOE, and remitted only $4,738.86 to the DOE. On October 15, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division, granted the DOE an Amended Judgment against Gray for an additional $34,625. However, the Amended Judgment has not resulted in any additional payments to DOE by Gray. ERA has petitioned that the $4,738.86, plus accrued interest, obtained from Gray be distributed by OHA in accordance with the Subpart V regulations.      Valentine was engaged in crude oil reclamation during the period May 1979 through December 1980. 2  Through an unincorporated subsidiary, Big Muddy Oil Processors Inc. (Big Muddy), Valentine obtained waste crude oil from oil spills, pipeline ruptures, waste oil pits and oil tank bottoms. After numerous separation and filtering processes, the waste oil was mixed with various blending agents (naphthas, natural gasoline, natural gas by-products, etc.) and the resulting product was sold as pipeline-quality crude oil.

Energy Undersecretary Rufino Bomasang said in the drilling  bulletin released yesterday that Anderman Smith Philippines  Inc., operator of the Cambayan well in onshore Mindoro,  encountered gas readings of propane at various intervals while  drilling.    Bomasang said the U.S.-based Anderman Smith has drilled the  Cambayan-1 well to a depth of 6,285 feet. The operator will  continue drilling this week. It is targeting to reach a depth  of 8,000 feet.    Anderman Smith is slated to drill two wells in Mindoro  within  the year requiring some $2 million in investment. The second  well will be drilled right after the first well.    Anderman Smith's partners in the exploration of the Cambayan  area in Mindoro are the PNOC [Philippine National Oil Company]  Exploration Corp., The Philodrill Corp., Basic Petroleum and  Minerals Corp., Terra Grande Resources and Exploration Inc.,  Vulcan Industrial and Mining Corp., and Anglo-Philippines Oil  and Mining Corp.    Still on oil exploration, Bomasang said the Australian oil  firm Ampolex Ltd. spudded the Villaba-1 well in offshore Leyte  last 1 May. Its drill ship, the ""Ocean Clipper,"" has drilled to  a depth of 1,723 feet. Ampolex is scheduled to drill to a depth  of 6,234 feet.    At the same time, the French Government through Trans Energy  has signed an agreement with the Energy Department of conduct a  technical and feasibility study for the setting up of a  liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility in Luzon. [sentence as  published]    Bomasang said the project will not entail any cost on the  part of the government.    Trans Energy according to Bomasang, will also provide a gas  market profile for Luzon. He said that it was the French  Government that broached the idea of undertaking such a  feasibility study.    The French company has started a preliminary survey among  economic planners, policy makers, and different agencies  involved in power generation to assess the technical and  economic feasibility of setting up an LNG tanker facility.    The DOE is planning to tap natural gas as a source of energy  by the turn of the century especially with the ongoing  exploration at the Camago-Malampaya field in northwest Palawan.    Shell Philippine Exploration and Occidental Petroleum are  currently drilling a well at Camago-Malampaya to confirm  reserves of some two to five trillion cubic feet of gas.     "

Electricity Generation Efficiency and Relative Scarcity   Factor        The last term in the Petroleum Equivalency   Factor formula takes account of the remaining   parameters listed in the Motor Vehicle Information and   Cost Savings Act: The national average electricity   generation efficiency and the relative scarcity and   value to the Nation of all fuel used to generate   electricity. The term is the ratio of total output   electricity generation mix to input electricity   generation, weighed by a relative scarcity factor. The   derivation of values for this term, and therefore, for   the Petroleum Equivalency Factor, depends on the   availability of data for (1) total electricity   generation, (2) energy sources used in electricity   generation, (3) electricity generation mix, (4) fuel   source reserves, and (5) consumption of electricity   generation fuel sources.     Section 503(a)(3)(A)(ii) of the Motor Vehicle   Information and Cost Savings Act requires DOE to take   into account average electricity generation efficiency.   Electricity generation efficiency is defined as the   total output electricity generation mix (E    total    )   divided by the sum of the input electricity generation   mix (I    2i    ) values. The updated Petroleum Equivalency   Factor equation includes the effects of off-peak   electric vehicle charging in its calculation of average   electricity generation efficiency. The input   electricity generation mix values, based on off-peak   electric vehicle charging, were multiplied by the ratio   of electricity generation fuel source (quadrillion   BTUs) output (E    qi    ) to input (I    qi    ) values (Table I), to   obtain output electricity generation mix values (Table   II).

Reyes]    [Text] Beijing has reaffirmed its commitment to a common  economic exploration and development program for the disputed  Spratly Island group but has remained silent on an accompanying  proposal for a phased military force reduction among contending  claimants in the area.    In an official statement, House Speaker Jose de Venecia Jr.,  who is currently in Beijing in his official capacity as  president of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  Inter-parliamentary Organization (AIPO), said Chinese  Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen reaffirmed his  country's support for the adoption of a common economic  exploration and development program in the area.    Messrs. de Venecia and Qian agreed that a common economic  development program in the island group ""could include  fisheries, minerals, oil and gas exploration, maritime  arrangements, and weather forecasting.""    But Mr. Qian was noncommittal on Mr. de Venecia's remarks  regarding a four-year old proposed ""concomitant reduction of  forces (which) would be a prelude to eventual demilitarization  of the Spratlys."" However, Vice Chairman Wang Hanbin of  Beijing's National People's Congress (NPC) assured the AIPO  delegation that Chinese parliamentarians support proposals for  contending parties to temporarily shelve their claims to  sovereignty to the islands.    Current strategic assessments of forces stationed in the  islands have manifested continuing constructions of air and  naval support facilities, aimed at facilitating force buildup  during crisis situations.    The AIPO delegation had earlier held discussions with  President Jiang Zemin, NPC standing committee chairman and  former security chief Qiao Shi, as well as Foreign Relations  Committee Chairman Zhu Liang, during which Mr. Jiang had vaguely  assured the delegation that his government would ""play a  positive role, not a negative role"" in dealing with the  currently brewing crisis in the Korean peninsula.    Mr. Jiang had also issued the customary assurance that his  country ""will not be a threat to its neighbors in Asia or to  world peace,"" pointing out that increases in his country's  defense budget were caused merely by ""inflation adjustment.""    For his part, Mr. de Venecia sought views on China's  experiences with special economic zones, reforestation, forest  conservation, mass housing, operation of township enterprises,  and waste disposal.    Mr. de Venecia led a 12-man ASEAN delegation composed of  Reps. Antonio Cuenco of Cebu, Victor Ortega of La Union, and  Roque Ablan Jr. of Ilocos Norte; Deputy Speaker Eugene Yap Giau  Cheng and Teo Tee of Singapore; Tjokong Tarigan Sibero and  Benjamin Massakh of Indonesia; Shahidan Kassim and Chor Chee  Heung of Malaysia; and, Adm.

0," FR940406-0-00185   FR940406-0-00012        Although dependence on insecure oil supplies is *** projected to grow, energy security depends in part on the ability of importing nations to respond to oil supply disruptions; and this is improving. The decontrol of oil prices in the United States, as well as similar moves in other countries, has made economies more adaptable to changing situations. Furthermore, the large strategic oil reserves that have been established in the United States (and to a lesser extent, in other major oil-importing nations) will make it possible to respond far more effectively to any future disruptions than has been the case in the past.   The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future include both opportunities and risks. The oil price drop of 1986 showed how consumers can be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies of oil and other energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices, this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the same time, the projected increase in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risks for the United States and the free world. These risks can be summarized as follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate the world's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (or just sharp upward and downward price swings), which would necessitate difficult economic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers.   Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupt a large volume of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf, inflicting severe damage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil price increases precipitated by the 197879 Iranian revolution contributed to the largest recession since the 1930's. Similar or larger events in the future could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even military implications.          Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a continuing need for the nation to conserve energy.   The increase in market share of light trucks points to the need for enhanced fuel economy for this class of vehicle. Light trucks are less fuel efficient and are driven more miles over their lifetime than passenger automobiles. Currently, more than half of the energy in the transportation sector is used by light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks). Light trucks have steadily increased their share of petroleum use in the transportation sector. In 1973, light trucks accounted for approximately 12 percent of transportation petroleum use, a figure which increased to roughly 20 percent by 1991.   Light trucks meeting the MYs 199697 standard will be more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle in the current light truck fleet in service, thus making a positive contribution to petroleum conservation.       VII. Determining the Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy Level       As discussed above, section 502(b) requires that light truck fuel economy standards be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In making this determination, the agency must consider the four factors of section 502(e): technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.       A. Interpretation of ``Feasible''       Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar language in other statutes, the agency has in the past interpreted ``feasible'' to refer to whether something is capable of being done. The agency has thus concluded in the past that a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.       B. Industry-wide Considerations       The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis or on an industry-wide basis. Legislative history may be used as an indication of congressional intent in resolving ambiguities in statutory language. The agency believes that the below-quoted language provides guidance on the meaning of ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.''   The Conference Report to the 1975 Act (S. Rep. No. 94516, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 15455 (1975)) states:         Such determination [of maximum feasible average fuel economy level] should take industry-wide considerations into account. For example, a determination of maximum feasible average fuel economy should not be keyed to the single manufacturer which might have the most difficulty achieving a given level of average fuel economy. Rather, the Secretary must weigh the benefits to the nation of a higher average fuel economy standard against the difficulties of individual manufacturers. Such difficulties, however, should be given appropriate weight in setting the standard in light of the small number of domestic manufacturers that currently exist and the possible implications for the national economy and for reduced competition association [sic] with a severe strain on any manufacturer ***.         It is clear from the Conference Report that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Rather, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy level.

The current world energy situation and the outlook for the future include both opportunities and risks. The oil price drop of 1986 showed how consumers can be helped by a more competitive oil market. If adequate supplies of oil and other energy resources continue to be available at reasonable prices, this will provide a boost to a world economy. At the same time, the projected increase in reliance on relatively few oil suppliers implies certain risks for the United States and the free world. These risks can be summarized as follows: If a small group of leading oil producers can dominate the world's energy markets, this could result in artificially high prices (or just sharp upward and downward price swings), which would necessitate difficult economic adjustments and cause hardships to all consumers.   Revolutions, regional wars, or aggression from outside powers could disrupt a large volume of oil supplies from the Persian Gulf, inflicting severe damage on the economies of the United States and allied nations. Oil price increases precipitated by the 197879 Iranian revolution contributed to the largest recession since the 1930's. Similar or larger events in the future could have far-reaching economic, geopolitical, or even military implications.          Based on the above, NHTSA concludes that there is a continuing need for the nation to conserve energy.   The increase in market share of light trucks points to the need for enhanced fuel economy for this class of vehicle. Light trucks are less fuel efficient and are driven more miles over their lifetime than passenger automobiles. Currently, more than half of the energy in the transportation sector is used by light-duty vehicles (automobiles and light trucks). Light trucks have steadily increased their share of petroleum use in the transportation sector. In 1973, light trucks accounted for approximately 12 percent of transportation petroleum use, a figure which increased to roughly 20 percent by 1991.   Light trucks meeting the MYs 199697 standard will be more fuel-efficient than the average vehicle in the current light truck fleet in service, thus making a positive contribution to petroleum conservation.       VII. Determining the Maximum Feasible Average Fuel Economy Level       As discussed above, section 502(b) requires that light truck fuel economy standards be set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level. In making this determination, the agency must consider the four factors of section 502(e): technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.       A. Interpretation of ``Feasible''       Based on definitions and judicial interpretations of similar language in other statutes, the agency has in the past interpreted ``feasible'' to refer to whether something is capable of being done. The agency has thus concluded in the past that a standard set at the maximum feasible average fuel economy level must: (1) Be capable of being done and (2) be at the highest level that is capable of being done, taking account of what manufacturers are able to do in light of technological feasibility, economic practicability, how other Federal motor vehicle standards affect average fuel economy, and the need of the nation to conserve energy.       B. Industry-wide Considerations       The statute does not expressly state whether the concept of feasibility is to be determined on a manufacturer-by-manufacturer basis or on an industry-wide basis. Legislative history may be used as an indication of congressional intent in resolving ambiguities in statutory language. The agency believes that the below-quoted language provides guidance on the meaning of ``maximum feasible average fuel economy level.''   The Conference Report to the 1975 Act (S. Rep. No. 94516, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 15455 (1975)) states:         Such determination [of maximum feasible average fuel economy level] should take industry-wide considerations into account. For example, a determination of maximum feasible average fuel economy should not be keyed to the single manufacturer which might have the most difficulty achieving a given level of average fuel economy. Rather, the Secretary must weigh the benefits to the nation of a higher average fuel economy standard against the difficulties of individual manufacturers. Such difficulties, however, should be given appropriate weight in setting the standard in light of the small number of domestic manufacturers that currently exist and the possible implications for the national economy and for reduced competition association [sic] with a severe strain on any manufacturer ***.         It is clear from the Conference Report that Congress did not intend that standards simply be set at the level of the least capable manufacturer. Rather, NHTSA must take industry-wide considerations into account in determining the maximum feasible average fuel economy level.        "

Pakistan had received 'an overwhelming response' to its efforts to attract foreign investment in power generation, receiving applications for four times the country's needs, she told a meeting of businessmen at the Confederation of British Industry. Now it needed investment in power transmission, oil pipelines and terminals and dedicated railway tracks as part of its effort to ensure that power shortages were not a constraint on growth. Ms Bhutto was at the CBI to sign agreements covering more than Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.56bn) of UK investments in Pakistan's energy, chemical and tourism sectors. Among these are a letter of intent from ICI to build a pure terephtalic acid plant costing Dollars 400m at Port Quasim. Other agreements signed by Lasmo, British Gas, Shell and Premier Consolidated Oilfields cover exploration and development of Pakistan's oil and gas fields. British Gas' initial investment with partners including Monument Oil and Gas will be Dollars 15m, but the figure could rise to Dollars 250m if its exploration in the Sulaiman mountain range of Baluchistan is successful. Businessmen say the rush of investment in Pakistan reflects its liberal approach, under which there is no limit on foreign ownership of any production facilities. All restrictions on repatriation of principal, interest, dividends and profits have been lifted and the domestic currency is fully convertible on current account. Although Pakistan has received a large number of investment commitments in power generation, some businessmen believe that fresh opportunities could arise if financing on existing deals falls through. Investment in power transmission could prove more difficult than in generation, not least because of the difficulty in ensuring supplies are paid for, they add. Pakistan is also seeking to privatise two existing power stations at Kot Addu and Jamshoro. National Power, which yesterday signed an agreement covering its Hub River power project, is bidding for these stations. Other companies involved in yesterday's signing were Midlands Electricity, Greyhound House, which is involved in tourism, and Biwater, which plans to build a Dollars 30m hydroelectric power station near Gilgit.

0,FT944-10663 ,"FT944-10663 _AN-EKIEIAG5FT 941109   FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (8): A cherished ambition - Richard Bauer assesses Bolivia's role as an energy exporter      By RICHARD BAUER   Bolivians are sloughing off their century-old dismay at being landlocked. Suddenly, the condition is perceived as a positive asset. 'We aim to become the natural gas distribution hub for the southern cone of Latin America,' says Mr Mauricio Gonzalez, president of the state-owned petroleum company YPFB. Mr Claude Besse, adviser to the government on the capitalisation of state power company Ende, is in equally optimistic and expansionist mood. 'We want to use our geographical position to satisfy growing demand for electric energy in surrounding countries which have poor supply and high prices,' he says. The idea of serving both as an energy 'bridge' and exporting gas and electricity to its neighbours has become a Bolivian leitmotiv. 'Macro-economic stability and the possibilities of sustained growth depend in large measure on the health of the hydrocarbons sector,' says Mr Herbert Muller, the former Bolivian energy minister who helped engineer the ground-breaking February 1993 gas export agreement with Brazil. 'The projected gas pipeline will be the engine for Bolivia's economic growth.' Bolivia's proven natural gas reserves of 6-7 trillion cubic feet are enough to meet south-west Brazil's energy needs for the next decade, says Mr Fred Drew of the Santa Cruz office of Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian gas exploration and production specialists. Bolivian gas output has been steady at about 500m cu ft a day for the past 12 years. Hydro-electric generation, meanwhile, has scarcely been touched. Presently, only 2 per cent of an estimated 18,000MW potential is exploited. Possibilities for cheap hydro projects abound, according to Mr Julio Leon Prado, founder and president of ICE, Bolivia's largest construction company. He believes local construction costs will be substantially lower than in neighbouring countries. For 22 years past, Bolivia has exported 200m cu ft a day of natural gas to Argentina via a 600km, 24-inch pipeline originally co-financed by the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank and the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF). The contract expired in 1992 but delivery continues uninterrupted at Dollars 1 per 1mBtu despite recent Argentine deregulation and competition from the local hydrocarbons industry. But Bolivia's cherished ambition is to break into the huge Brazilian market. For years, it has been thwarted by internal squabbles within Bolivian governing elites on the one side and protectionist, oil-burning Brazilian state industry on the other. Now, the two state hydrocarbons companies, YPFB and Petrobras, have reached a 20-year sales purchase agreement. Initially, YPFB will supply 280m cu ft a day rising to 560m cu ft within seven years. But Brazilian demand for natural gas could well increase to 1,500 cu ft a day by the year 2000 and 2,300 cu ft by 2005, says Mr Gonzalez. He predicts: 'There will be Bolivian gas in Sao Paolo by the end of 1997'. The projected 32-inch 1,800km pipeline will run from Bolivia's Rio Grande to Campinhas, 90km west of Sao Paulo. In a second stage, a 420km, 22-inch line would serve the town of Curitiba. And Petrobras plans another 570km line running south from Curitiba to Puerto Alegre. Brazilian-Bolivian negotiating tensions were relaxed by President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's personal intervention in August. Now Petrobras will have only a 15 per cent stake in the 560km Bolivian section and 80 per cent in the Brazilian stretch of the pipeline. YPFB will have 85 per cent of its home stretch and 20 per cent of the Brazilian end. Bolivia's partner on both sides of the border will be Texas-based Enron, which has a 40 per cent stake in the YPFB participation. Petrobras, meanwhile, has gone into association with the 'BTB' Group, which holds 25 per cent of the holding for the Brazilian side. 'BTB' comprises BHP, US natural gas company Tenneco and the experienced distributors British Gas. Biggest nuts still to crack are finalising finance for the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 2.6bn project, the largest of its kind ever in Latin America, and fixing the gas price. The World Bank, meanwhile, still appears reluctant to commit itself to a venture where Petrobras, a state-owned company, holds the majority stake. Industry sources, however, say the pipeline will easily secure private sector financing provided there are adequate guarantees against political risk - particularly against a possible Petrobras pull-out. Analysts say Bolivia could deliver gas to Sao Paulo at a highly competitive rate of les than Dollars 2 per 1mBtu, half the ceiling price it would cost to ship Venezuelan or Nigerian liquefied gas to the region. Bolivia's negotiating position as a purveyor of clean natural gas has been strengthened since the 1992 Rio 'earth summit' boosted ecological awareness in badly-polluted Sao Paulo, according to Mr Muller. A Bolivian government adviser points out another crucial factor: 'The Brazilians have realised that, without Bolivian gas, they'll be suffering energy brown-outs in two or three years.' A similar project for exporting gas to northern Chile is in an advanced stage of planning. The 1,100km Villa Montes-to-Antofagasta pipeline could start delivering to one of Chile's main mining regions by early 1997. A 20-year agreement in principle has been signed between YPFB and Enap, Chile's state oil company. YPFB has entered a joint venture with BHP. The two will split equally a 90 per cent stake in constructing and operating the pipeline, while Enap will take the remaining 10 per cent. US investment bank Morgan Stanley has been selected as financial adviser. While gas exports to Argentina are already two decades old, and new ventures with Brazil and Chile are presently top priority, exporting electrical energy from Bolivia would be a complete innovation. The idea apparently sprang up only recently when state power company Ende was being offered to foreign investors. 'We were told our tiny, 750MW internal market is not attractive enough for overseas bidders,' says Mr Gonzalo Chavez of the energy ministry. 'Investors are seeking opportunities to convert Bolivia into a major electrical energy distributor for the southern cone.' Mr Fernando Campero, a former industry minister and now chief executive officer of Saxxon Capital, a Bolivian stockbrokerage, is more sceptical about this late-in-the-day brainwave. 'They invented the scheme of electrical energy exports to speed up Ende's capitalisation but without proper feasibility studies,' he says. Other experts fear that electricity exports may directly compete with natural gas in little-developed markets.   Companies:-  Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales Bolivianos.

Today's proposed rule is not intended to present a barrier for states to receive state program approval.

However, EPA encourages states to adopt statutory and/or regulatory provisions comparable to the final federal UST lender liability rule so that credit-worthy UST owners and operators will have access to funds to upgrade or replace their tanks.   If a state program includes an UST security interest exemption, EPA will evaluate it against the criteria in 281.39, as proposed in this notice. These criteria stem from the key components contained in this proposed rule. A state program that exempts a holder from UST corrective action, financial responsibility, and technical requirements as an owner may be approved if: The holder is maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a security interest in a petroleum UST or UST system; the holder does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system; and the holder does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing. In addition, a state program may be approved if it exempts a holder from corrective action and financial responsibility as an operator and if, in addition to the three previous criteria, it requires the holder to demonstrate that its tanks have been emptied and secured, and that it has either permanently or temporarily closed the UST or UST system.

During this stage interplanetary stations are to study the sun  and reach Pluto, the outermost known major planet of the solar  system. Scientific delegations on space exploration of the  United States and Russia discussed this bold idea and a number  of other projects for cooperation in the exploration of the  universe. Their meeting ended on Saturday.    Under the programme a U.S. probe will carry a Russian  optical  module to the sun. A complicated trajectory of the flight has  been charted. With the use of a highly-reliable Russian carrier  ""Proton"" the probe will be put on a trajectory of a flight to  Jupiter. When the probe is near Jupiter, the gravitation field  of the huge planet will turn it, and it will be directed to the  sun. Close to the sun, the Russian module will be separated and  will collect information about the solar atmosphere and surface.    Another joint flight is planned for the beginning of the  21st  century. It will be the flight to Pluto and its satellite  Charon. The main planets of the solar system, except for Pluto  and Charon, have already been studied by Russian and American  interplanetary stations. So the planned flight is of vast  scientific interest. During the flight the Russian probe will be  separated from the apparatus and will reach either Pluto or its  satellite. Experts believe much promise is offered by the idea  of using a U.S.-made small-size apparatus with new instruments  and a large-capacity Russian booster-rocket and a Russian-made  descendable probe meant for measurements in the atmosphere and  surface photography. Aside from other advantages, this  cooperation will make it possible to reach the remotest planet  of the solar system in less than ten years.    Exploration of Mars is planned to be continued. Two  spacecraft carrying Russian and American scientific equipment  are planned to be launched to Mars in 1998 and 2001.    Plans for cooperation in astronomy and astrophysics were  also  considered. Experts believe that spectro-roentgen-gamma project  will make it possible to create an orbital observatory to try  unravel space mysteries such as black holes, neutron stars,  pulsars, novas and supernovas and to study the universe. There  is also an interesting project for an orbital radio observatory,  Radioastron.    The final document of the meeting was signed by Wesley  Huntress, a chief of NASA, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration, and Yuriy Milov, deputy general director of the  Russian Space Agency.

He said: In 1993, the people of all nationalities in  Xinjiang thoroughly implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  important talks and the guidelines of the 14th national party  congress and actively carried out the tasks put forward by the  fifth enlarged plenary session of the fourth autonomous regional  party committee. Our economy continued to maintain a fairly  high growth rate. The gross product for 1993 is expected to be  37.7 billion yuan, or up about 10 percent from 1992. The  autonomous region enjoys economic development, political  stability, unity between nationalities, and social progress.  The general situation is good. However, we have soberly  realized that while other parts of the country are accelerating  their reform and development, the gap between Xinjiang and the  interior and coastal provinces and regions is constantly  widening. This year is a year of reform, and the state is  comprehensively promoting fiscal and tax, banking, investment,  and planning systems reforms. We are facing a rigorous test in  accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic  structure. We must strive to adapt ourselves to the situation.  Party committees and governments at all levels should fully  understand the situation, formulate concrete measures while  considering realities, turn passivity into activity, and change  unfavorable conditions into favorable ones. At the same time,  we should know that during the shift from the old to the new  structure, new circumstances and new problems will inevitably  emerge in our economic and social life, and they will create  some difficulties for our work.    Abulaiti Amudurexiti said: In light of the new situation  created in the process of establishing a socialist market  economy and taking Xinjiang's specific conditions into  consideration, our guiding ideology for accelerating economic  development is: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we  will implement in an all-around way the guidelines of the 14th  National Party Congress and Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee; take reform as an impetus to focus our  efforts on development; make use of our favorable natural  resource conditions to adjust our industrial structure; open  ourselves wider to the outside world; and increase economic  efficiency to bring about the rapid and highly efficient  development of the national economy [shi xian guo min jing ji  kuai su gao xiao fa zhan] and raise Xinjiang's overall economic  strength to enable it to enter the level of a comfortable life  along with the rest of the country. Based on this guiding  ideology, our development strategy is to orient toward three  markets, seize three major Opportunities, take advantage of our  strong position in two aspects, and achieve breakthroughs in  four aspects. Specifically, we must orient ourselves toward the  domestic and international, as well as Xinjiang's regional  markets; seize the Opportunities brought by a national policy of  encouraging industrial development in Western China, by the  completion of the second Eurasian Continental Bridge, and by the  development of our petroleum industry; take advantage of our  strong position in natural resources and in geographical  location; and achieve breakthroughs in the transformation of  traditional industries by focusing primarily on improving  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and changing  enterprise operating mechanism, in the development of the local  economy by concentrating on mass-scale agriculture and secondary  and tertiary industries, in foreign trade and international  economic and technological cooperation by opening our doors wide  on every side and diversifying the international market, and in  services and other industries related to oil exploration and  development. From now on, we need to concentrate on carrying  out the following tasks: Continue to strengthen the position of  agriculture as the foundation of the economy, and accelerate the  development of agriculture and the rural economy; vigorously  develop the rural economy and revitalize the local economy by  focusing on secondary and tertiary industries; step up the  construction of infrastructure and basic industries to improve  our ability to achieve sustained economic growth; accelerate  technological transformation of our enterprises by orienting  ourselves toward the market; open wider to the outside world and  do a good job in foreign trade and economic relations; step up  the development of oil and other industries in which we have  strong resources to promote local economic development; and show  concern about the masses' well-being and bring tangible benefits  to them.    Speaking of all-around in-depth reform to increase the  motive  force and vitality of economic development, Abulaiti Amudurexiti  said: We must further emancipate our minds, change our way of  thinking, and based on the tasks laid down in the decision of  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  keep in step with the rest of the country in terms of the  general reform programs while boldly blazing new trails and  advancing in a pioneering spirit to tackle major problems of  economic development in light of Xinjiang's reality. We must  earnestly conduct experiments to build a modern enterprise  system and carry out basic work to change the operating  mechanism of state-owned enterprises. We must change the  government's functions, strengthen and improve our ability to  macroeconomically adjust and control the regional economic  operation. We must step up the cultivation and development of a  regional market system based primarily on the market of  essential factors of production. We must deepen our foreign  trade structure and open ourselves wider to the outside world.  We must continue to deepen rural reform and establish a rural  economic operation and management system that meets the  requirements of a socialist market economy. We must step up the  reform of our social security and housing systems to create a  favorable condition for our region's reform to advance in depth  and breadth. We must further deepen our scientific and  technological and educational structural reform.    Abulaiti Amudurexiti also gave specific instructions on  earnestly strengthen party leadership to ensure the smooth  progress of reform, opening up, and modernization.     "

0,FT922-2188 ,"FT922-2188 _AN-CFRBNAC0FT 920618   FT  18 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mixed feelings on Indonesian oil - Industry executives are down in the mouth      By WILLIAM KEELING   THE INDONESIAN oil sector is proving the adage that there are two sides to every story. Government officials are celebrating a record number of production sharing contracts signed with foreign oil companies. But at the same time the executives of the latter are looking increasingly down in the mouth about the industry's future in Indonesia. 'Something doesn't add up,' explained one company executive, head in hands. The figures compiled by government give the industry a rosy hue. Government officials say 22 production sharing contracts were signed last year, and a total of 61 in the last four years, more than during the most active periods of exploration in the 1960s and early 1980s. There have also been higher levels of seismic work: 84,000 sq km in 1990, more than double the average for the past 15 years. Such a level has not been reached since the initial broad seismic mapping of Indonesia between 1969-1972. With only 36 of Indonesia's 60 known basins so far explored, the country would appear to hold great potential. Talk to some of the oil companies, however, and a very different picture emerges. The last block to have reserves discovered in excess of 100m barrels was awarded in 1971, officials say. Production is dominated by seven large fields, some of which are reaching maturity. The majority of Indonesia's fields, however, are small and discoveries have not kept pace with demand. Oil executives say the level of drilling relative to the number of new contracts of work is low. In 1990 actual exploration and development expenditure of Dollars 1.26bn fell short of budgeted levels by Dollars 90m. The companies believe last year also saw an expenditure shortfall and that the government's target of 176 exploration wells a year, necessary for maintaining existing proven reserves, estimated at 10.9bn barrels, is not being met. Government officials say new technology may boost recoverable reserves and estimate that there are 20bn barrels with 'proven ultimate recovery'. However, neither enhanced recovery nor the assigning of new contract areas are expected to arrest a decline in output. The World Bank estimates current production (including condensate) at 1.6m b/d, but expects this to decline to 1.35m b/d by the turn of the century. With domestic consumption of about 520,000 b/d last year and increasing by at least 6 per cent a year, government officials concede that Indonesia will become a net importer of oil by 2005 and will have to leave the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Some industry officials believe the day of reckoning may be as early as 1997. Some of the problems facing the industry are intractable. The bulk of Indonesia's proven reserves lie in the western half of the archipelago where past exploration has been most intense. The future lies in the pioneer country of the Timor Gap and the seas and islands between Sulawesi and Irian Jaya. The geological structure of the area, however, is immensely complex - twisted rock formations crushed between two converging continental shelves. Potential fields are likely to be small and, even with three-dimensional seismic technology, the search for them will be a hit-and-miss affair. On the land mass of Irian Jaya, building pipelines from the interior to enable the export of production would be hugely expensive. Oil companies admit that tapping the oil fields of countries of the former Soviet Union is likely to divert funds from Indonesia for the immediate future. The problem is compounded, they say, by an industry wide shortage of funds. ""Indonesia is getting a smaller share of a diminishing pool of finance,' one executive explained. The situation is worsened, he says, by contract terms which, particularly in relation to tax structure, are amongst the toughest in the world. Government officials discount many of the oil companies' complaints as simple posturing. They say conditions for deep water and pioneer areas have been relaxed and point to the high number of new contracts as evidence of the oil companies' commitment to Indonesia. The contracts, however, may be at the heart of the industry's problems. Whilst their conditions remain tough, the contracts have commited companies to relatively low levels of exploration; under the 45 contracts signed between 1987-1990, companies agreed to spend Dollars 2.8bn over a six to ten year period. The contracts have opened up new areas for exploration, but the financial commitments of the companies are unlikely to be adequate for the task. The contracts will prove difficult to renegotiate should the government wish to boost exploration and it may rue the decision to sign so many contracts so quickly. Company executives admit, however, that the government may yet get the last laugh. 'The oil companies have proven to be poor negotiators in the past. The Indonesians have tended to get the better of us,' one executive admitted. It need only take one big discovery to prove the government right.  The Financial Times   London Page 38  "

Statement B"," FR941116-0-00074   FR941116-0-00012        The Commission concludes that it is appropriate to include origin markets in the geographic market information. At this time, the Commission is still concerned about the possibility of monopsony power. The Commission agrees with the Farmers that the ultimate burden of proof is on the oil pipeline to establish the relevant geographic market. However, a proponent of corridor geographic markets must come forward with an adequate presentation to warrant rebuttal by the oil pipeline.       B. Statement B_Product Markets       In Statement B, the Commission is requiring the oil pipeline to identify the product market or markets for which it seeks to establish that it lacks significant market power. The oil pipeline must explain why the particular product definition is appropriate.     Under the ICA, the Commission regulates the transportation of oil by pipeline.    45     In a market power analysis, the Commission must determine the oil pipeline's ability to exercise market power over this transportation service. However, a market power analysis in general cannot be made solely in the context of transportation rates. Where competitive alternatives constrain the applicant's ability to raise transport prices, the effect of such constraints are ultimately reflected in the price of the commodity transported. Hence, the delivered commodity price   (relevant product price plus transportation charges) generally will be the relevant price to be analyzed for making a comparison of the alternatives to a pipeline's services. However, in some instances such as for origin markets or crude oil pipelines, it may be appropriate to make a case based only on transportation rates. A pipeline may elect to file such a case and a protestant may argue that such a case is appropriate. In either event, the burden of establishing the relevant product market remains on the oil pipeline.               45     49 U.S.C. 1(1)(b).          The Commission is not requiring a specific way to define the product markets. The relevant product market first would be distinguished between the transportation of crude oil and the transportation of refined products. Crude oil transportation could further be divided to include transportation of natural gas liquids while products transportation could be delineated by type, such as motor gasoline, distillates, or jet fuel. The oil pipeline should, in the first instance, select its product market and the burden is on the oil pipeline to justify its choice.     The AOPL argues that the Commission is unjustifiably retreating from the standard of     Buckeye     and     Williams    _``delivered pipelineable petroleum products.'' It maintains that this standard should be the generally applicable method for identifying relevant product markets, with participants free to argue for exceptions as appropriate.     Total maintains that the Commission has correctly recognized that crude and product markets can and should be divided further into differentiated products. It argues that, in order to minimize the need for discovery, the Commission should require that the delivery data be submitted by crude and product type and that capacity relied upon in HHI calculations should be segregated by crude types and product types. It further submits that oil pipelines should be further required to identify all alternatives of the same crude type or products which are being transported by the pipeline seeking a market-power demonstration.     The Commission reiterates that it is up to the oil pipeline to identify the product market or markets for which it seeks to establish that it lacks significant market power. As stated above, the Commission is not establishing at this time any presumptions as suggested by the AOPL. Nor will the Commission require the oil pipeline to submit information by crude and product type as proposed by Total. This would be too onerous at the outset. However, in identifying competition, as suggested by Total, the type identification should match that of the oil pipeline's commodity type used to determine the product market.     The AOPL also contends that the Commission's discussion of transportation in the product context is ``problematic.'' It argues that if it ``is intended to address relevant price for the purpose of comparing competitive alternatives to all pipeline transportation, it simply is misplaced and should be shifted to a discussion of how to define market power,'' but if the Commission intends to require relevant product markets to be defined to include transportation, or the transportation of particular products, the discussion would represent a significant break with     Buckeye     and     Williams     which recognized that relevant product market could include non-transportation alternatives, such as refiners.    46     It asks the Commission at a minimum to clarify that ``no such narrowing of the definition of `relevant product markets' was intended.''    47                 46     Comments at 44.                47         Id.          The Commission is not narrowing the definition of relevant product market by defining it in terms of the transportation of the commodity. That definition of relevant product market simply recognizes that the Commission regulates the transportation rate. As the AOPL maintains, non-transportation factors, such as competition from refiners, are an element in an analysis of an oil pipeline's market power with respect to the pertinent product.     Sinclair is concerned about the NOPR's statement that ``the delivered commodity price (relevant product price plus transportation charges) generally will be the relevant price.''    48     It assumes, and seeks clarification, that the term ``product'' applies to both petroleum products and crude oil. It further urges that the Commission ``state that the use of any delivered price concept in a market power analysis is directed to the market power which a pipeline exercises with respect to shippers_not with respect to the price ultimate consumers pay for refined petroleum products.'' It maintains that the Commission should do this because shippers, and not end users, are the protected class under the ICA.    49     Sinclair further urges the Commission to reflect on the particular situations in which the delivered price concept is useful in market power analysis, such as in developing the geographic contours of the market. It further contends that it must be recognized that it is a pipeline's ability to increase its transportation rates, and not the delivered price, that must be the ultimate focus of the analysis. It specifically refers to crude oil origin markets, where the net-back price is pertinent, and to captive refiners in the origin market of a product pipeline, which refiner could be adversely affected by a rate increase by an inability to raise prices in the retail market. Sinclair suggests that protestants should always be given the opportunity to conduct discovery and present evidence with respect to a pipeline's ability to unilaterally raise its transportation rates and that there should not be any narrow bounds on the relationship between the commodity price and a pipeline's market power.             48     IV FERC Stats.  Regs. Proposed Regulations 32,508 at   p. 32,890.                49     Citing Williams Pipeline Co., 21 FERC 61,260 at p. 61,584 (1982).          Sinclair is right that the product referred to in the NOPR was both petroleum products and crude oil. Sinclair is also correct that the Commission's analysis reflects market power     vis a vis     shippers and not consumers. This is because, whether or not the ICA is intended to protect consumers, it is the rate paid by shippers that must be just and reasonable.    50     Sinclair's other arguments should be presented in a particular case when the Commission must consider the appropriate determination of the geographic and product market. The Commission will consider requests for discovery when it determines what future proceedings are appropriate after protests are filed.             50         Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc.     v.

The report offers no guidance on the frequency of monitoring for methane and carbon monoxide, while paragraphs (i) and (l) of proposed 148.240 set out minimum testing frequency for that coal which is most likely to create dangerous conditions. Under proposed 148.240(n), it would be within the discretion of the master to reduce the frequency of monitoring in certain situations.   b. The report does not specify that the temperature of a self-heating coal must be monitored. Paragraph (j) of proposed 148.240 would require such monitoring.   c. The report directs the master to seek expert advice and to consider heading for the nearest suitable port of refuge if it is determined that the coal is heating. Proposed 148.240(k) would require the master to contact the nearest Coast Guard Captain of the Port when a coal cargo is heating.   Other comments about coal concern the effects of designating coal as a hazardous material and question the necessity of regulating barge shipments of coal. These issues are addressed in the discussion on the designation of certain materials as potentially dangerous, and in the discussion of the treatment of barge shipments.   12.

The requirement is retained in this proposal in order to comply with the revisions to Chapter VI of SOLAS 74/83.

The Central Bank of Ecuador, BCE, has issued its monthly  report for March 1994. It states the Ecuadoran trade balance  recorded a surplus of $104 million, a 41.3-percent increase over  the same month last year. Exports totaled $250 million, and  imports reached $146 million. Exports for the quarter were 4.6  percent less, however, than in 1993, $688.8 million versus  $722.4 million. Oil was, as usual, the major export item, with  sales totaling more than $264 million for 20.3 million barrels.  Exports of items other than petroleum produced $294.5 million  during the quarter, approximately $100 million less than the  first quarter of 1993.

He announced 28 firms, grouped into 13 consortiums,  participated in the bid. There are 17 well sites in six sectors  of the Amazon region that are expected to require an overall  investment of $141.7 million. The winners are Amoco-Mobil,  Triton, Orix, City-Ramrod, and the Ecuadoran consortium  Tripetrol.

In a deal which saw the company sell its interests in the Ninian field to Sun Oil and Ranger Oil for Pounds 84m in cash and Sun's 20 per cent interest in the new Birch field, the management released the asset on which the company's fortunes were founded. The Ninian sale also marked the end of the disposal programme which followed its Dollars 1bn acquisition in 1992 of Ultramar, the event which analysts cite as being the start of the company's present troubles. Mr Joe Darby, chief executive, yesterday said he was prepared for a negative reaction from some board members when he brought the sale before them. It was Ninian's discovery in 1974 which transformed a venture capital company, formed in the early 1970s to look for oil at the start of the North Sea's exploration phase, into a fully fledged oil company. It was the cash flow from Ninian which allowed the company to expand, mainly through acquisition. The board, however, thought the sale 'was exactly the right thing to do,' said Mr Darby. 'We got excellent value for a mature, high cost field.' The sale was the latest in a series of asset disposals the company has made recently to bolster a financial position that has been undermined by low oil prices. Late last year it sold a package of assets, including a 5 per cent stake in its main development project, the Liverpool Bay gas field, to PowerGen for Pounds 123m. However it has recently taken the Markham gas field off the market and Mr Darby said yesterday: 'The bulk of the disposal of assets are over. There may be some swaps . . . but I don't see any major asset disposals this year.' Analysts say the sale of Ninian symbolises Lasmo's strategy to shift its production away from high cost reserves. These have led to the company having a cost of sales per barrel of Pounds 8.15, compared with present sterling oil prices of about Pounds 9.30. Chevron, Ninian's operators, say there is scope for steady cost reductions in coming years and additional potential as technology enables companies to extract greater amounts of a reservoir. Lasmo is in a hurry, however, to implement its new low cost strategy, which it says should reduce its operating costs per barrel to Pounds 3.70 this year, compared with Pounds 4.10 last year and Pounds 5 in 1991.

0,FT943-989 ,"FT943-989 _AN-EI0DNABLFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Pakistan's energy sector attracts Dollars 4bn      By FARHAN BOKHARI      ISLAMABAD   Pakistan's efforts to attract investments in power generation and in oil and gas exploration have borne fruit in the form of contracts with US companies worth about Dollars 4bn. Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, described the contracts as 'a landmark in the history of private sector investment' in Pakistan. The bulk of the new contracts involve power generation projects backed by US businesses, including AES Corporation, Enron, GE Capital and Tenaska. Occidental and Union Texas are involved in oil exploration contracts worth Dollars 275m and many officials hope that new oil finds will help the country's power generation efforts by providing lower cost fuel. Domestic businesses have suffered production losses due to disrupted power supplies. The rains that followed a long dry spell restored the country's hydro-generation capacity and narrowed the gap between demand and supply. However, the relief may be only temporary. Many transmission lines are in a state of disrepair and the government estimates that up to 33 per cent of the power generated in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, is lost in breakdowns, leakages and power thefts. In the rest of the country, up to 23 per cent of generated power is lost in similar ways. An energy policy announced this summer has set the tone for fresh investments. The government has eliminated much red tape by replacing a series of official procedures with a one window set-up in Islamabad. Moreover, investors have been assured of a bulk tariff rate of 6.5 cents per kilowatt hour, considered to be one of the more attractive rates among developing countries. The government's private power board estimates that up to Dollars 5bn worth of investments could come in power generation, in addition to the American commitments, during the next three years. However, for some investors, the signing of the deals may just be the beginning of a difficult process involving financing. The financial package requires them to put up a 20-30 per cent equity, while raising the rest in loans or other financing. Senior Pakistani officials concede privately that some of the sponsors may not be able to put together their financial packages, especially as international demands for financing remain high. Concerns have also been raised over the delay on Pakistan's plans to float its first sovereign Eurobond offer worth Dollars 200m. It was originally scheduled to take place this month but was postponed due to recent turbulence on international bond markets. Pakistani officials hope that the US commitments have opened the most important window to attract fresh investments, and that other foreign investors may follow.   Companies:-  AES Corp.

This  direction justified itself with the discovery in the 10th  Five-Year Plan of very large gas and oil fields, which made it  possible to create a powerful base for the country's oil and gas  production. But the oil and gas condensates that emerged, unique  in their reserves, and the fields contain a substantial  concentration of aggressive components, which impeded their  processing, because of the unresolved aspects of many  technological and technical problems. It is enough to recall  that the USSR lagged behind the West for almost 20 years in the  level of development of production technologies.    All of this made it compelling to sign an agreement with the  Chevron Corporation. Difficult negotiations were conducted in  the course of several years, and a contract was signed as a  result within the framework of the USSR. According to the new  contract (1992), the period of validity was set at 40 years.  This transaction will be appropriate, although the contract has  not been subject to expert ecological examination as yet.    Analysis of the results of geological prospecting work in  the  12th Five-Year Plan showed that their effectiveness in the  Caspian gas and oil bearing province is one of the highest in  the former Union. The five-year task for increasing the reserves  of oil and condensate in the republic as a whole and in West  Kazakhstan was fully implemented owing to the exploration of  previously discovered productive sites (Karashagana, Zhanazhol,  Tengiz, and Korolevskoye).    Active prospecting in the subsalt deposits that was  undertaken in the last 15 years was not crowned with success, at  least at depths up to 5-5.5 kilometers in a number of areas that  were studied in detail from a geophysical standpoint and drilled  intensively, and with which a high promise of gas and oil  presence was associated. And this will create a tense situation  in increasing the raw materials base of the republic, although  today, as never before, there is a need for highly profitable  oil and gas fields that are accessible for quick and highly  efficient development.    The main reason for the difficult situation that has  developed, in my opinion, is the elimination in 1982 of the  Kazneftegazrazvedka administration, which was formed over the  decades and which explored very large oil and gas condensate  fields. Also having a negative influence is the disunity of the  geophysical service in West Kazakhstan and its inadequate  resolution capability in the preparation of deep drilling  structures.    The necessity for combining the geophysical organizations of  the former Nefteprom and the Ministry of Geology, which will  make it possible to reduce administrative expenditures, urgently  suggests itself. Moreover, the demarcation of territories of  West Kazakhstan between departmental organizations will be  removed, which will make it possible to concentrate prospecting  geophysical research in the most promising directions.    In the meantime, the scientific organizations of the branch  are not very concerned about the development of methods of  qualitative evaluations of fields in the early stages of  prospecting work. This leads to delays in the dates for  prospecting and exploration and also to an unjustified increase  in their costs. The oil and gas prospecting areas of Tortay,  Elemes, and others, where several dozen subsalt deep wells were  drilled almost without results serve as an example here.    As for the academic scientific organizations, in my opinion,  they are still engaged in unspecific research, such as: ""The  study of the sedimentary basin evolution to evaluate their oil  and gas bearing potential and determine the priority directions  in the development of the Republic of Kazakhstan fuel-energy  complex,"" or the ""compilation of a prediction map of gas and oil  in the Caspian Depression.""    The main task of the geological prospectors always remained  to shift predicted reserves to a proven reserve category; that  is, industrial. All efforts should be directed at exactly this.    There are no new discoveries, and the old ones have already  been sold at a loss, including Kenbay (Moldabek-Kotyrtas), the  largest super saline oil field, now named the Munay SP [joint  enterprise]. Its reserves were successfully protected by  KazNIGRI in 1990, and the field has been readied for  exploitation. Unfortunately, it remains to this day a subject of  discussion between Kh. Biderman, an American businessman, and  the administration of Kazakhstan's Atyrau Oblast.    The conservation of reserves, instead of their accelerated  involvement in processing, is at the least an impermissible  luxury, bordering on crime, for the economy of the state. It is  paradoxical that no one bears any kind of responsibility for  such mistakes. It would be proper, in accordance with the 5  April 1994 Kazakhstan presidential edict ""On Additional Measures  for Regulating the Use of Mineral Resources for Geological Study  and the Mining of Minerals,"" to accelerate the conduct of strict  order in the use of mineral resources.""    The situation is no better with the development of marginal  [zabalansovy] or suspended oil fields. For example, Zholdybay  and Akhmeshet were transferred with the approval of the oblast  administration to the Atyrau trading house. The latter, having a  vague idea about the oil business, is creating the Sanako firm,  which plans to invite Western partners as contractors, in order  to take their equipment and technology. Moreover, they want to  settle with them with money, and they are again taking credit  from the state.    It turns out to be more profitable in such cases to rely on  foreign investments than on credits and loans, inasmuch as they  ensure direct access to modern technologies, etc. The main thing  is that a heavy burden is not assumed by an already depleted  budget and, to the contrary, this promotes its increase. It is  not without reason that world practice recommends that investors  should be involved primarily for the development of already  explored fields.    Kazakhstan is blindly imitating Russia in many aspects,  forgetting that since 1992 it has been the law there that the  one who finds and produces oil is the one who trades in it. But  in our republic, as before, it does not serve the workers. As a  result of which the oblast that is the richest in an industrial  sense was transformed into an impoverished and backward kray. As  is known, 94.3 percent of the explored reserves of oil and gas  and more than 90 percent of the potential resources of  hydrocarbons are located in West Kazakhstan, and its  significance as the main region of the republic for producing  oil and gas will not change even in the long run, which should  be made the basis of the strategy for the development of the  fuel-energy complex. All of these arguments are intensified many  times over, if the unsold predicted resources on the land and  especially in the water area of the Caspian Sea are taken into  account. Kazakhstan unquestionably will become a second Kuwait  to the extent that the Caspian shelf is developed while  observing clean geological protection.    It should be added to what has been said that 149 of the 160  oil and gas fields, and five of the six oil and gas producing  associations, are situated in this kray, and the Yuzhkazneft PO  [Production Association] acquires its development through the  organization of the Caspian oil and gas-bearing complex. This  connection must be maintained permanently.    The total of the aforementioned facts dictates the need for  moving the headquarters of the Kazakhstanmunaygaz to West  Kazakhstan. With time it will be necessary to examine the  question concerning the location of the Kazakhstankaspiy shelf.  It must be assumed that the industrial development of the  continental shelf will start in the northeast of the Caspian,  and not on the ""Trans-Il Alatau shelves.""    The degree of exploration of resources in Kazakhstan is  relatively low. This means that a significant and stable  increase in oil production in the republic depends not only on  the development of known fields, but also on the results of  prospecting-exploratory work. Their level in recent years is  sharply lowered, while, given the existing geological potential,  it should grow steadily.    There is an extremely difficult situation in the geological  industry today. At the present time, geological exploratory work  has been stopped in many organizations. For example, in the  former Atyrauneftegazgeologiya PGO [expansion not identified],  now the Akbota holding company, 65 percent of the oil and gas  exploration enterprises this year are functioning thanks to the  Kazakhstanturkmunay, and out of the remaining staff, a majority  has been cut, and the rest are on indefinite leave. In the  advanced North-Emba oil and gas exploration expedition, out of  10 drilling brigades, three remain today that maintain  themselves on state budgetary infusions of the Ministry of  Geology. Field geologists do not receive their wages for months.    Recently, after conversion to joint-stock companies, the  Embaneft PO became the Embamunaygaz Joint-Stock Company and the  Tengizneftegaz PO in Kulsary became the Tengizmunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The sum of their annual oil production  totals not more than 2.3 million tonnes, of which 823,000 tonnes  is the share of the latter. I think it would be advisable to  combine them into one under the aegis of the Embamunaygaz  Joint-Stock Company. The common process in oil and gas  production is artificially divided into indicators that are not  related to each other, which consist of: an increase in  reserves, preparation in linear kilometers, meters gone through  or drilled wells, tonnes of produced raw materials, kilometers  of laid pipelines, etc.     "

The company's solicitors added that they had been advised that Mr Thomas Meiklejohn, a former employee of Normandy, would also be charged. Normandy, which made the announcement after the stock market closed, said full details of the charges had not been disclosed but continued: 'It is understood that they relate to the takeover by Brunswick NL in 1989 of Bendigo Gold and that the charges allege that Mr de Crespigny and Mr Meiklejohn allegedly failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Part A statement delivered to Bendigo Gold shareholders did not contain misleading information. 'It is understood that Mr Meiklejohn is also to be charged for allegedly having knowingly published false information in relation to the financial position of Brunswick.' Brunswick started corporate life as Brunswick Oil, but sold its oil interests and moved into the gold exploration business in Western Australia. Control was then acquired by interests related to Mr de Crespigny who, in 1989, was chairman of the company. Mr Meiklejohn, at that time, was Brunswick's managing director. The merger with Bendigo Gold was agreed in 1990. A 'Part A' document is one of the offer documents formally required under Australian takeover practice  -and the one which tells shareholders in the target company about any information relevant to them in deciding whether to sell their shares. Mr de Crespigny, one of the most influential figures in Australia's mining industry, denied any wrongdoing. 'The laying of these is entirely unexpected and very disappointing,' he said in a statement. 'The DPP has never spoken to me nor made any serious attempt to canvass its concerns with me.' He said he was completely innocent of the charges and would defend them vigorously. He was confident of an acquittal, 'although clearly the laying of these charges is bound to cause me enormous personal damage'. Last night, Mr Andrew Corletto, Normandy's company secretary, said that he did not believe that the charges had actually been laid to date, although he conceded that it was possible this would happen before the holiday weekend.

0,FT934-15083 ,"FT934-15083 _AN-DJMCRAF1FT 931013   FT  13 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Swedish gold miner aims to up the stakes - A small but profitable business that is coming to market      By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES   THE UNLIKELY site for Europe's largest gold mine is a place called Bjorkdal only 300km south of the Arctic circle in northern Sweden. Until now it has enjoyed an obscurity to match its remote location, but that will change next month when the mine's operator, Terra Mining, comes to the Swedish stock market, with a range of international institutions among its new owners. The company says it will be Europe's only listed mining group concerned purely with gold. Bjorkdal claims its status as Europe's leading gold mine with 1992 production of 2,310kg (74,250 troy ounces) and expected output of 2,475kg this year. Since it started production in 1988, total output has amounted to 9 tonnes. On the scale of the world's biggest gold mines, such as those in South Africa, this is insignificant, representing a mere one-tenth of 1 per cent of total annual gold output worldwide. But Terra Mining prides itself not on scale of production but on the efficiency and profitability of its operations. Its production costs are lower than 90 per cent of its western world rivals, with mine site cash costs dropping to Dollars 145 an ounce in 1993 from Dollars 209 last year. The improvement will help the company to achieve a pre-tax profit of SKr71m (Pounds 5.75m), a 35 per cent margin on sales of SKr202.3m and a level of profitability that will match the very best in the Swedish corporate sector. Part of the reason for the low cost base has been the dramatic strengthening of the US dollar against the Swedish krona from an average of SKr5.83 in 1992 to SKr7.75 this year - a significant boost for a company that has virtually all its expenses in krona and all its revenues in dollars. But it is also lean in terms of staff numbers - it employs just 45 people - and it has benefited from the efficiency of both its exploration and its mining techniques. The company prides itself on the effectiveness of its exploration technique, which uses modern data-processing methods and an understanding of the movement of glaciers during the last ice age to find commercial ore deposits. Analysis of the glacial till, the layer of terrain that collected small fragments of minerals as they were scraped off the underlying bedrock by glaciers, is at the heart of the process. Modern data processing allows huge numbers of deposits from many different areas to be analysed systematically. In this way Terra Mining has tested 150,000 samples for 30 different elements (a total of 4.5m analyses) from a grid covering nearly all of Sweden and parts of Finland, Norway and Ireland. The company has spent SKr100m on exploration since it was founded in 1980, and had spent only SKr30m by the time it identified the potential of Bjorkdal in 1983. It took just five years from the moment a claim was first lodged on the mine to the time production started - a short lead time by industry standards. The fact that the mine is open cast, rather than underground, helps to keep operating costs down. It has also modified its mining methods, changing bench height, blast size, and drilling patterns to enhance metallurgical recovery. The result has been a steady improvement in the ore grade from 2.56 grams of gold a tonne in 1990 to 3.31 grams this year, although this is still lower than a typical South African mine. Further efficiency has been achieved by tripling the amount of ore treated annually from 300,000 tonnes in 1988 to 900,000 tonnes today. The amount is not likely to rise any further, as the company is restricted under the terms of its concession to a maximum production of 1m tonnes of ore a year. Even when the gold price plunged to the equivalent of SKr56,000 a kilogram in July 1992 Bjorkdal remained profitable, with a break-even level of SKr51,000. When the gold price soars to SKr107,000 a kilogram - as it did this year, with a built-in benefit from the krona's devaluation - it is highly profitable, and remains so at the SKr92,000 level which prevailed at the end of September. Perhaps Terra Mining's biggest problem, from a potential investor's viewpoint, is that it has just one mine in operation at present, and one with only seven years of proven and probable reserves at that. The mine's president, Mr Torsten Borjemalm, is sensitive to this, but he brushes the criticism aside. 'How many other industries have an order stock of seven years? We know we have material to sell - it's only a question of price,' he says. Not only is the company confident that Bjorkdal's 'possible' reserves will extend its life further, it also has 60 other prospects on its books and expects to have at least one more mine, and possibly two, in operation by the year 2000. The most important exploration project is at Pahtavaara in Finland, which has proven reserves of 695,000 tonnes at a grade of 3.33 grams a tonne. A final decision on whether to develop this mine will be taken next year. Another interesting deposit is at Barsele in Sweden. It is partly because of the need to fund new mining developments that the company and its owners now want to broaden Terra's ownership base when it is listed. They will sell up to 1.3m shares at SKr140 a share. Norsk Hydro, the majority shareholder with 61 per cent, is to sell about 30 per cent of its stake as are the other two big shareholders, Euroventures Nordica and Mr Christer Lofgren, one of the company's founders. Presentations have been held in London, Paris, Stockholm and Edinburgh as part of the campaign to attract new owners from the Swedish and international investment community.

0,FT923-2403 ,"FT923-2403 _AN-CIRBKAHNFT 920918   FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (11): Power for the people - The widening quest for energy sources      By FARHAN BOKHARI   POWER CUTS periodically show that Pakistan cannot meet the energy needs of a rapidly growing consumer market and industry. While the government has given fresh incentives to set up factories, providing investment in transportation and energy is also needed. In energy, Pakistan is seeking private sector investments in new electricity projects and oil and gas production. Industrial entrepreneurs are allowed to set up their own generation plants but that adds to the cost of new projects. Electricity generating capacity is projected to rise to 9,356 megawatts by the middle of next year, but demand is expected to rise to 11,000 MW by 1995. The supply is currently estimated to fall 10 to 15 per cent below demand depending on the output of hydro electric schemes which rely on rainfall. The government has let the private sector set up independent power plants to help meet the shortfall. Fresh measures have also been announced to increase production of petroleum, as the country produces 65,000 barrels of oil per day but needs to import about 170,000 b/d. Last year fresh incentives were introduced to stimulate exploration and refining. The government has promised to process applications for exploration licences within three months of submission. In the past, approvals have taken up to three years. Mr Sartaj Aziz, the finance minister, hopes there will be a surge in private power projects given the size of the country's population. 'In this expanding market, efficient generation of power is required. With privatisation, we expect to get the investment. Very few markets are that large and offer opportunities for investment', he says. Pakistan also sees opportunities for importing power, oil and gas from the newly independent central Asian republics and Afghanistan. An agreement has been signed with Tajikistan for the supply of 1,000 MW for which new transmission lines will be built. Imports of gas from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan will also be studied, and recent oil discoveries in Uzbekistan raise the possibility of importing oil from that country. All these proposals are fraught with difficulties, however. Energy investments will be repaid only in the long term. Although the population is rising, prosperity will also have to rise to ensure a bigger energy consumption. In spite of the inducements for oil and gas exploration, some businessmen believe that crime and violence, especially in remote areas of the southern province of Sindh, are a barrier to new exploration projects. The government has said it will set up a special force to protect oil installations, but it remains to be seen if that will reassure potential investors. Prospects for importing energy from central Asia depend on future events in Afghanistan. Pakistani officials who support the country's central Asian initiatives argue that the intra-mujahideen infighting in Kabul is likely to die down in the next two or three years, the time frame needed to begin establishing some of the projects. But no-one knows how long it will take before peace and stability are restored to Afghanistan. A durable peace there may be the key to Pakistan's central Asian strategy and its ability to draw on that region to meet its energy needs.  The Financial Times   London Page VI  "

0,FT943-5294 ,"FT943-5294 _AN-EIECYACZFT 940905   FT  05 SEP 94 / Truly, deeply and profitably: Oil companies are successfully tapping previously inaccessible reservoirs      By ROBERT CORZINE   For much of this year US-registered exploration rigs have been flocking to the Gulf of Mexico to take part in what promises to be one of the most remarkable changes in the fortunes of an oil-producing area. After nearly 45 years of production, one of the world's most extensively drilled pieces of oil and gas-bearing seabed is attracting renewed interest from oil companies - in spite of relatively low world oil prices. The reason is that new technology has given oil companies the ability to explore large, geologically-complex areas, which were previously not thought to contain oil, or which defied conventional exploration methods. Industry observers say the new reserves in the Gulf of Mexico that can now be tapped could be large enough to slow the steady decline in overall US domestic production. The new techniques could also extend the productive life of other mature areas, including the UK and Norway's reserves in the North Sea. The resurgence of interest in the Gulf of Mexico results from two innovations. One is the growing technical ability to operate oil production platforms in deep water. The other is the extensive use of a new seismic technique which, combined with advances in computing power, is pinpointing oil and gas reserves where previously they could not be seen. The first of these innovations is the most visually dramatic. Until recently, most of the world's offshore oil platforms sat above a lattice work of steel, firmly fixed to the ocean floor. But the volume of steel needed to fix a deep-water platform to the seabed would make them uneconomic. To overcome this problem, oil companies working in the Gulf of Mexico are using the first of a new generation of floating structures known as 'tension leg platforms'. These are held in place by 12 steel pipes, each more than half a mile long, that run from the floating hull to the ocean floor. The design eliminates most unwanted vertical movement while allowing the structures to move with the waves. The first of these new structures came into operation in April when production commenced at Shell Oil's Auger platform in the Gulf of Mexico. It lies in 2,860 feet of water, a US record and one of the deepest oil platforms in the world. A new US depth record will be set in 1996 when Shell and its partner, British Petroleum, install a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 770m) platform in 2,933 feet of water over the Mars field, found in 1989 and the largest discovered in the gulf in 20 years. Lessons learnt in the Gulf of Mexico are being applied elsewhere. Shell and BP are partners in two UK deep-water projects west of the Shetland Islands that are currently being assessed for production. Mr Bob Howard, vice-president of domestic operations for Shell Oil, says the new drilling technology could help exploit an additional 8bn-15bn barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. In contrast to the small reservoirs common in the shallow water of the gulf, the new deep-water fields have much larger reserves. In the early 1980s, most geologists thought that these off-shore deep-water fields contained few oil-bearing sands, says Mr Howard. If these estimates are confirmed, it would place the Gulf of Mexico deep-water reservoirs in the same league as Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the biggest single oil field in the US, which accounts for a quarter of the country's daily output of 6.6m barrels. The change in exploration outlook was largely brought about by the second innovation that is opening up more of the world's oil reserves - the use of a three-dimensional seismic technique. This has allowed geologists to 'peek around corners', says Mr Howard. The new technique uses the same principle as conventional two-dimensional seismic surveys. Air guns towed by boats generate sound waves. The reflections from rocks under the seabed are picked up by lines of underwater sound receivers, known as hydrophones, towed by the boats. But three-dimensional surveys use many more air guns and hydrophone lines placed in parallel. That allows seismic 'snapshots' to be taken every 25 metres, compared with typically every 2km-3km in the past. The large amount of data generated would be useless, however, without rapid advances in computer processing. Mr David Work, group vice-president for exploration at US oil company Amoco in Houston, says increased computer power has cut the cost and the time it takes to interpret the data. 'It now costs Dollars 50,000 to process the same information that five years ago cost Dollars 250,000,' he says. BP officials say such technical advances have cut the time between the first seismic shot being fired and an exploration well being drilled to as little as six months. A couple of years ago the process would have taken two years. The Dollars 1bn or more that it takes to build a new generation deep-water platform has restricted interest to big oil companies. But smaller ones are among those leading the way in using three dimensional seismic surveys to explore beneath the seabed, where sheets of salt until recently formed a impenetrable blanket over as much as 60 per cent of the Gulf of Mexico. 'Five years ago if you hit salt you would stop drilling,' says Mr Clive Fowler, vice-president of Amoco's offshore business unit in New Orleans. The two-dimensional seismic technique then in use gave geologists insufficient detail to determine where the salt ended and any oil-bearing rocks began. But three-dimensional seismic combined with computer power have helped geologists to 'see' below the salt sheets, which can be about 5,000ft thick. The race to discover new fields in the Gulf of Mexico began last year when a consortium comprising Philips Petroleum, Amoco and Anadarko, a US independent explorer, announced a big commercial sub-salt discovery in the gulf. That set off competition to secure new government leases in areas covered by the salt. Experts are divided over whether the sub-salt reserves will rival those in deeper water. But 'if the sub-salt play is for real, it could be like rolling the clock back 30 years in the Gulf of Mexico', says Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, the New Orleans broker specialising in the energy industry. Unlike the deep-water finds, many of the most interesting sub-salt areas are in shallow water close to existing platforms and pipelines. That should keep development costs low. But even with the advantage of existing infrastructure and new seismic techniques, Mr Work does not expect the commercial success rate in developing sub-salt fields to lead to big improvements from the 10-12 per cent success rate in traditional areas. There are many technical problems, including the difficulty of drilling through the plastic-like salt without causing the well walls to collapse. Some industry observers predict that there will be 'many disappointments'. Earlier this summer, Philips and Anadarko announced the abandonment of a sub-salt exploration well due to problems with the well, even though it had hit large amounts of oil and gas. Some oil executives believe the full potential of the gulf will not be realised without government help. They say the high risk associated with deep-water development means that as much as half of the potential reserves might not be exploited unless the government provides royalty relief or a production tax credit. Both proposals are being considered in Washington. But Ms Hazel O'Leary, energy secretary, says any relief would have to be 'revenue neutral', and not add to the federal budget deficit. The industry says any financial aid would pay for itself, with up to 100,000 jobs created by full-scale, deep-water development. But even if the full potential of the Gulf of Mexico is realised, it is unlikely to be enough to reverse the decline in US domestic production, caused mainly by the depletion of mature onshore fields. The government says large reservoirs of oil remain to be discovered in US coastal waters apart from the Gulf of Mexico. But most of these areas are covered by Congressionally-imposed environmental bans on drilling. The impact of the technical innovations on the reserve base and cost structure on the US oil industry will be substantial, however, even if their application is mainly confined to the Gulf of Mexico and other existing oil regions. In addition to pinpointing new reserves, three-dimensional seismic surveys of existing fields have uncovered nearby deposits missed in earlier studies. The technique has also given companies a better idea of how more oil and gas can be extracted from an existing reservoir, while the increase in information available to geologists has reduced the number of expensive, exploratory wells that need to be drilled in prospective fields.

He says the state has the potential to rank alongside Western Australia, Chile and South Africa in the mining industry. This follows a ADollars 16m geological survey - one of the most comprehensive ever seen in the western world - carried out by the state government. The survey was needed because two-thirds of South Australia is covered by soil and sands which hide the mineral-bearing bedrock. However, advanced aeromagnetic surveys are able to penetrate this cover. 'The results are staggering,' says Mr Fardon. 'We've discovered bedrock terrains under shallow cover, which are equivalent to those containing the giant mineral deposits at Broken Hill, Mount Isa and Olympic Dam, all world-class deposits.' About 500,000 square kilometres, an area the size of Spain, are being mapped and tied in with other high-quality data and the details are being made available at very little cost to exploration companies. Mr Fardon is at present on a three-week tour of Europe and South Africa to spread the word. 'We would welcome foreign expertise and money.' So far about 30 per cent of the survey data has been released and applications for exploration licences have trebled in the first eight months of this year. The early data also sparked a diamond rush after aeromagnetic and radiometric pictures revealed about 60 geological 'bubbles' which closely resemble diamond-bearing kimberlite pipes. 'We could be sitting on diamond resources comparable to the world's biggest diamond mine at Argyle in Western Australia,' says Mr Fardon enthusiastically. About 10 companies have started a diamond search and are expected to spend about ADollars 2m this year. They include De Beers' local subsidiary Stockdale, CRA, Ashton Mining, and Poseidon. The department of mines believes that the region could contain deposits of gold, copper, lead, zinc, iron ore, nickel, chromium and tin in addition to diamonds. The main focus of interest is the Gawler Craton, a huge geological block that stretches over the Eyre Peninsula and north beyond Coober Pedy. Mr Fardon says: 'Foreign companies are welcome in their own right but we would prefer them to joint venture with an Australian company.

How these contested claims are resolved will  tell us much about the future economic and security arrangements  in post-Cold War Southeast Asia.    The surprise agreement between China Petroleum (Taiwan),  China National Offshore Oil (China) and Chevron (U.S.) to form a  joint venture for oil exploration in the East China and South  China Seas suggests a way out. Although the spectre of a  China-Taiwan ""united front"" on South China Sea issues is not  without its dangers, it may make an agreement easier now that  the competition between them will be muted and other claimants  will no longer have to choose between China and Taiwan.    For with the U.S. role perceived to be diminishing, China's  longer term intentions are of particular concern. Partly in  response, Asean has begun to consider security cooperation;  Indonesia is attempting to assert some leadership in Southeast  Asia; and Vietnam, isolated and vulnerable, is attempting to  embrace Asean. All of these factors come together in the  Spratlys. A major sticking point today is that despite Beijing's  initial offer to put the sovereignty issue aside and to develop  the area jointly, it now appears to insist that other claimants  first recognise its sovereignty before joint development is  possible.    This complicates a solution, but it does not make it  impossible. The key is first to settle the outstanding  grievances between Vietnam and China, which involve areas  outside the core Spratly area -- on land, in the Gulf of Tonkin  and at sea in the Vanguard Bank area, where China awarded a  concession to Crestone Oil of the U.S. Certainly Vietnam's  interests lie in coming to some kind of agreement. One way out  would be for China and Taiwan to set aside their ""historic""  claim to most of the South China Sea in exchange for a combined  share of 51 percent in a multilateral Spratly Development  Authority, which would administer the core area and manage the  exploration and exploitation of resources there. If Vietnam  received a favourable settlement in the Tonkin Gulf and Vanguard  Bank areas, it might consider settling for less shares in the  Spratly area. Since Brunei claims only a tiny portion of the  core area, its share would be very small. The remaining shares  would be allocated among Vietnam, the Philippines and Malavsia.  Although China and Taiwan might argue that their 51 percent  share in the Spratly Development Authority constitutes tacit  recognition by the other claimants of the validity of China's  sovereignty claims, the other could rightly counter that, far  from relinquishing their claims, all they did was agree to  shelve them.    Indeed, under this cooperative regime the area would be  demilitarised, sovereignty claims would be frozen and the  Authority would resolve user conflicts, facilitate exploration  and development of resources, manage fisheries and maintain  environmental quality. The legitimate transit of vessels would  be allowed. The authority might also promote international  cooperation in scientific research and in protecting vulnerable  ecosystems.    Since the core area would be removed from contention, and  China and Taiwan would have set aside their historic line claim,  the relevant countries could then focus their efforts on those  areas outside the core area claimed by only two or three  governments, e.g., the southwestern margin claimed by Indonesia  and Vietnam; the southern margin claimed by Brunei and Malaysia;  and the northern portion claimed by China, Taiwan, Vietnam and  the Philippines. Eventually, sovereignty over the islands and  rocks themselves might either pass to the occupants or be  allocated among the different countries on an equitable basis.  Either way, the involved countries would be entitled only to  narrow territorial seas, could not use their respective areas  for military purposes and would have to grant access for  scientific research and -- more important -- any resources the  areas might harbour.    Certainly this solution is not perfect. It is complicated,  and the claimants would doubtless have various objections. But  it deserves some consideration, especially given the general  recognition that conflict would have far-reaching negative  implications for regional and great-power relations. Indeed,  already the governments involved continue to talk both  informally (the Indonesia-sponsored meetings), bilaterally  (China and Vietnam) and regionally (e.g., the Manila Asean  Post-Ministerial Conference and probably in the Asean Regional  Forum). In principle they all have agreed to a peaceful  settlement. There is, moreover, wide support for the concept of  joint development. Malaysia and. the Philippines, for example,  have agreed to cooperate in fisheries in their area of overlap.    But the window of opportunity may be closing. Unless these  nations move quickly, they may find that they have lost not just  a solution to the Spratlys but the opportunity to take an  important step towards a collective security arrangement that  could guarantee the peace and development of the region well  into the future.

And now, six centuries later, West Africa is seen by mining companies as one of the world's great unexplored gold prospects. Carbon dating of pottery fragments found in ancient workings at Syama in the far south of Mali, near the border with the Ivory Coast, indicate that oxide ore was worked 740-400 years ago. BHP Minerals International, the first major exploration and production company to establish a presence in the region's gold fields, is negotiating with the Malian government before making a final decision on an additional Dollars 70m investment in Syama. Syama will yield 2.5 tonnes of gold this year and is expected to produce 3 tonnes for the next two years. Then, the company, which up to now has been shifting dirt, will hit hard rock. The new investment will extend the life of the main open cast mine, 1 km long and 330 metres across, by up to 20 years, while exploratory drills at a further half a dozen satellite sites have indicated promising reserves. Total reserves at Syama have been estimated at 80 tonnes. The Australian-based multinational is investing a further Dollars 5.5m a year on minerals exploration in West Africa as a whole, and in Mali, Ghana and the Ivory Coast in particular. BHP, among the world's largest minerals companies, has already invested Dollars 40m in the pit in the three years since the signing of the exploration agreement. The initial lease covered an area of 1,500 sq km, now slightly reduced. The production agreement covers 20 sq km. The average concentration of gold is currently 3.1 grams per tonne of ore. But each day 13,000 tonnes of dirt is excavated from the main pit, of which only 3,000 tonnes is processed through the mill. 'To justify our investment in management and infrastructure in West Africa, BHP has to plan for a series of productive sites in the region,' says Mr Daniel Johnson, mine manager at Syama. 'Syama is of huge significance for Mali as its first, and so far only, large scale commercial venture into gold mining using modern techniques. But for BHP it has to be seen in the context of a turnover last year of Dollars 10bn.' Syama by itself is also small in a regional context. For Mali, it represents 6 per cent of GDP. In Ghana, it would be considered a small to medium-sized operation. Nevertheless, Mali is believed to have considerable, as yet unexplored potential, similar to that of Ghana. Mali has been bypassed by the major exploration companies, partly because of the difficulties of detecting deposits, generally covered by thick layers of laterite. Its poor infrastructure has been another factor  - for example, industrial consumers pay 5 cents per kw hour for electricity in Ghana compared with 25 cents in Mali. The gold has to be transported long distances as Mali is landlocked  - BHP flys it first to Bamako, then to Brussels, and finally to Geneva. Mali's government ministries have been considered to be among the least well-informed in the region. But things are changing. The United Nations Development Programme recently completed an Dollars 8m, 12-year project to give the country its own centre of expertise in minerals. UNDP's first involvement in Mali's mineral sector dates back to 1979, when it located early traces of mining. That provided the justification for heavier involvement in exploration, and training of Malians. It was during this phase that the Syama deposit was uncovered. During the follow up, UNDP and the UN Department for Technical Co-operation for Development, helped the Malian government negotiate and finalise the agreement with BHP. The Malians struck what appears to be a favourable deal at Syama, and it is one they are already starting to tighten up. In future, the government is expected to take 6 per cent royalties, and a 20 per cent stake. Taxation on profits will be levied at 45 per cent. UNDP soon realised that the Malians themselves could take care of some exploration at least. It financed teams to provide on-the-job training, equipment for a geochemical laboratory and assistance with drilling. PDRM  - the Programme pour le Developement de Resources Minerales  - has already carried out contracts for analytical work, drilling, digging shafts and the analysis of geological samples. Minerals experts believe that Mali will now benefit considerably from an aerial geophysical data set for the south and west of the country as a back-up to surface mapping carried out by the Belgians, French and the UN, much of it from the 1960s. BHP is itself concerned to transfer as much expertise as possible to Malians. For example, it already has ten West African exploration geologists working in the region. The company expects to start making a net return on its Syama investment by the end of this next year. Operating costs at Syama are thought to be in the range of Dollars 200 to Dollars 250 a troy ounce, while the gold price has fallen from over Dollars 400 to Dollars 340 an ounce since Syama went into full scale production last year. The feasibility study, on which the Syama investment was based, assumed a price of Dollars 400 an ounce at 1988 exchange rates. Elsewhere in Mali, the French Bureau de Recherches Geologiques et Minieres has a concession on a deposit at Loulo, the west of the country. Here it is negotiating a joint venture with the government and an as yet undisclosed third party. These beds contain some 30 tonnes of gold to a depth of 100 metres, with between five and 10 grams of gold to every tonne of ore. Mali will be hoping that it turns out to be more successful than its first joint venture. The Kalana mine, which has gold reserves of 30 tonnes, and the first large scale deposit to be exploited, was opened in 1984 and mined with Soviet assistance. Officially, it was producing about 2 tonnes of gold a year. It has just closed, amid rumours that much of the production bypassed official channels and was shared out by the country's now disgraced former president, Moussa Traore, ousted in a coup in March last year, and the Soviets. Most of what was left is said to have been exchanged by the government for Soviet military hardware, much of it now useless with no-one to service it or provide spare parts since the end of Soviet expansionism in Africa.

0," FR941219-1-00025   FR941219-1-00014        The Energy Policy Act of 1992 amended section 513 of the Cost Savings Act to expand the scope of the alternative fuels it promotes. The amended section provided incentives for the production of vehicles using, in addition to alcohol and natural gas, liquified petroleum gas, hydrogen, coal derived liquid fuels, fuels (other than alcohol) derived from biological materials, electricity (including electricity from solar energy), and any fuel NHTSA determines, by rule, is substantially not petroleum and would yield substantial energy security benefits and substantial environmental benefits.       Section 513 continued to provide incentives for the production of dual fuel vehicles, i.e., vehicles that operate on one of a now expanded list of alternative fuels and on gasoline or diesel fuel. NHTSA notes that some statutory terminology was changed by the 1992 amendments. Among other things, the terms ``dual energy'' and ``natural gas dual energy'' were dropped, and the terms ``alternative fueled automobile,'' ``dedicated automobile,'' and ``dual fueled automobile'' were added.       Section 513 also continued to require dual fueled passenger automobiles to meet specified criteria, including meeting a minimum driving range, in order to qualify for the special treatment in the calculation of their fuel economy for purposes of the CAFE standards.       One change made by the 1992 amendments concerning driving ranges was that, under section 513(h)(2), the minimum driving range set by NHTSA may not be less than 200 miles for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles. The amendments also provided that the agency may not, in response to petitions from manufacturers, set an alternative range for a particular model or models that is lower than 200 miles, except for electric vehicles.       The 1992 amendments necessitate amending part 538. First, the existing 100 mile minimum driving range for vehicles previously categorized as ``natural gas dual energy'' vehicles must be raised to at least 200 miles. Also, NHTSA must establish a minimum driving range for the expanded scope of dual fueled vehicles. Part 538's petition procedures also need to be amended to conform to the new statutory provisions.       In addition to necessitating amendments to part 538's driving range provisions, the 1992 amendments also require NHTSA to ``determine the appropriate gallons equivalent measurement for gaseous fuels other than natural gas ***.'' Such a measurement is needed to carry out the special fuel economy calculations that apply to alternative fuel vehicles.         Proposal           In this document, NHTSA is proposing to amend part 538 to make it consistent with the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act. As discussed below, the agency is proposing to set the minimum driving range for all dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles. NHTSA is also proposing to remove the petition procedures until it sets a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles.     The agency notes that, due to the complexity of the issues relating to establishment of a minimum driving range for electric dual fueled passenger automobiles, otherwise known as hybrid electric vehicles, it is addressing that issue in a separate rulemaking. On September 22, 1994, NHTSA published in the     Federal Register     (59 FR 48589) a request for comments seeking information that would help it develop a proposal in that area.       The agency is also proposing in this document to add   to Part 538, gallons equivalent measurements for compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, hydrogen, and hythane.   NHTSA notes that, on July 5, 1994, the Cost Savings Act was revised and codified ``without substantive change.'' The provisions formerly found in section 513 of the Cost Savings Act are now at 49 U.S.C. 32901, 32905, and 32906.           A. Minimum Driving Range for Dual Fueled Passenger Automobiles Other Than Electric Vehicles        In light of the 1992 amendments to the Cost Savings Act, NHTSA is proposing to set the minimum driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles at 200 miles.     As before, the agency is required to consider the following factors in prescribing a minimum driving range: The purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988, consumer acceptability, economic practicability, technology, environmental impact, safety, driveability, performance, and any other factors considered relevant. Moreover, given the purposes of the Alternative Motor Fuels Act and its legislative history, NHTSA continues to believe that the minimum driving ranges should be low enough to encourage the production of dual fueled passenger automobiles, yet not so low that motorists would be discouraged by a low driving range from actually fueling their vehicles with the alternative fuels.       As discussed above, NHTSA addressed the appropriate level for minimum driving range in April 1990. The agency believes that the only relevant changed conditions since that time are: (1) the decision by Congress to require the minimum driving range for dual fueled passenger automobiles other than electric vehicles to be at least 200 miles, and (2) the expanded scope of dual fueled passenger automobiles for which a minimum driving range must be established.       Part 538 currently specifies a minimum driving range of 200 miles for alcohol dual fueled passenger automobiles. The agency does not believe that any relevant events have occurred since that range was established that should lead to a different range. NHTSA notes that alcohol dual fueled vehicles are designed so that the same fuel tank is used for either alcohol or gasoline. The available space in a passenger automobile for fuel tanks is limited. In setting a driving range of 200 miles for these vehicles, the agency was concerned that a higher minimum range could require some automobiles to be redesigned to accommodate larger fuel tanks, thereby discouraging the production of such vehicles.

In setting a driving range of 200 miles for these vehicles, the agency was concerned that a higher minimum range could require some automobiles to be redesigned to accommodate larger fuel tanks, thereby discouraging the production of such vehicles.

OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the August 27, 1993,     Federal Register     (58 FR 45305, administrative record No. UT865), and in the same document, opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on September 27, 1993. The public hearing, scheduled for September 21, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.    During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns for (1) Utah Admin. R. 641112, regarding the incorrect reference to its rulemaking authority at UCA 4093.5(2), which was repealed by Utah in 1993; (2) Utah Admin. R. 645103441, regarding the need for agreement between the petitioners and intervenors to change the location of a public hearing on a petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (3) Utah Admin. R. 645203200, regarding the proposed deletion of the phrase ``and the information is confidential,'' which would impart a change in the criteria for determining coal exploration information that is or is not allowed to be held confidential under the Utah program, and the proposed reference to Utah's GRAMA in that certain aspects of GRAMA were previously found to be less effective than the Federal regulations with regard to the restrictions Utah's GRAMA imposes on the availability of coal exploration information; and (4) Utah Admin. R. 645302314.110, regarding the need to use the prime farmland soil survey standards in USDA Handbook 436, as it existed on October 5, 1982, and USDA Handbook 18, as it existed on November 16, 1982. OSM notified Utah of these concerns by letter dated December 9, 1993 (administrative record No. UT878).    By letter dated January 7, 1994, Utah responded to OSM's concerns by submitting revisions to its proposed program amendment (administrative record No. UT881). Utah proposed the following revisions to its existing rules. At Utah Admin. R. 641112, Utah proposed to reference UCA 4086(1), which applies to rulemaking authority under the Utah Mined Land Reclamation Act. At Utah Admin. R. 645103441, Utah proposed that (1) unless the petitioners and intervenors agree otherwise, the Board shall hold a public hearing within 10 months after receipt of a complete petition to designate lands unsuitable for mining; (2) if all petitioners and intervenors agree that a public hearing is not needed, the hearing need not be held; and (3) all hearings held under Utah Admin. R. 645103441 will be held in the locality of the area covered by the petition. At Utah Admin. R. 645203200, Utah proposed to require that the Division will not make coal information available for public inspection if the person submitting it requests in writing, at the time of submission, that it not be disclosed and the information is confidential under the standards of the Federal Act (SMCRA). At Utah Admin. R. 645302314.110, Utah proposed to require that USDA Soils Handbooks 436 and 18 are incorporated by reference as they respectively existed on October 5, 1982, and November 16, 1982.    OSM announced receipt of the revised amendment in the January 24, 1994,     Federal Register     (59 FR 3530, administrative record No. UT887) and in the same document, reopened and extended the public comment period. The comment period closed February 8, 1994.        III. Director's Findings        As discussed below, the Director, in accordance with SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, finds, with an additional requirement, that the proposed program amendment as submitted by Utah on August 2, 1993, and as revised on January 7, 1994, is no less effective than the corresponding Federal regulations.        1.

0,FT934-841 ,"FT934-841 _AN-DLVCCAE4FT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Dutch gas deal threatens 'horizon pollution' - Ronald van de Krol on plans for exploratory drilling in a much prized nature reserve      By RONALD VAN DE KROL   The Dutch are bracing themselves for a short bout of 'horizon pollution' in one of their best-loved nature reserves. Last week, under a deal worked out with three natural gas companies, the government cleared the way for exploratory drilling in the Wadden Sea, a much prized beauty spot that each year attracts millions of migratory birds  -as well as thousands of Dutch and German tourists. The prospect of drilling platforms has prompted environmental campaigners in this intensely flat country to decry what they see as 'horizon pollution', a uniquely Dutch preoccupation. However, they are far more concerned about the long-term dangers of seabed subsidence, the possibility of an oil and gas 'blow-out' and disruption to wildlife, both in the sea itself and on the Wadden (or West Frisian) Islands. In keeping with the environmental sensitivity of the area, the government has said that actual commercial exploitation of the gas fields beneath the sea must be done 'laterally' for at least the next five years. This means that any production platforms will have to be located elsewhere, probably on the Dutch mainland, the Wadden Islands or the North Sea, with drilling taking place at an oblique angle from some distance away rather than straight above the gas field, as would normally be the case. The drawback to lateral drilling is that it may be able to extract only about 70 per cent of the Wadden Sea gas. The rest will have to be considered unrecoverable, unless direct drilling in the sea is permitted after the year 2000. This month's agreement, which must be worked out in detail in early 1994, is a delicate and controversial compromise between economic and environmental considerations. It means that, although there will be no permanent drilling sites in the Wadden Sea over the next five years, there will be exploratory drilling at 21 sites over the period. Of these sites, about half will be in the sea itself, with the rest planned for the surrounding area. Exploratory drilling will be limited to the winter months, when the area is not visited by as many migratory birds, and to about three months per exploration site. The three energy companies - Elf Petroland, Mobil and Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, a joint venture between Shell and Esso - are confident that they can produce gas from the Wadden Sea without running environmental risks. In 1984, the three companies, which hold long-term concessions in the area, agreed to a 10-year moratorium on exploration and drilling. The voluntary stand-still expires on January 10, and the new agreement will cover the next five years until 1999. What is still unclear, however, is whether the gas companies will be able to drill directly in the Wadden Sea once the latest agreement expires. The Wadden Sea's environmental significance means that little detailed work has been done until now on assessing its natural gas riches. The area clearly has potential to yield natural gas because it is sandwiched between the huge Slochteren gas field in the Dutch province of Groningen and the gas fields in the North Sea and the continental shelf. Rough estimates for the amount of gas located between the Wadden Sea range from 72bn to 221bn cubic metres, representing a monetary value of between Fl 14bn (Dollars 7.4bn) and Fl 44.2bn. Well over the half of the proceeds would flow into state coffers. If the Wadden Sea proved to contain 221bn cu m, this would be equivalent to nearly three full years of Dutch gas production at current rates of extraction. The government says that its cautious opening of the Wadden Sea to exploration is motivated not so much by financial gain as by the desire to bolster its 'small fields' strategy for the natural gas sector. This strategy aims to preserve, as far as possible, the Groningen field, which is still the largest gas field discovered so far in western Europe. Unlike most gas fields, Groningen can quickly raise or lower its output in response to seasonal or other types of fluctuation in demand, making Dutch gas sales more flexible than they would otherwise be. By giving priority to finding and exploiting smaller fields in places like the Wadden Sea, the Netherlands hopes to be able to use its Groningen gas to greater effect. 'Seen in this light, the potential gas reserves under the Wadden Sea are of great importance,' the ministers of economic affairs and of the environment said in a letter to parliament.

Alternative Measure of Relative Scarcity and Value         Inherent in the calculation of the petroleum equivalency is a measure of the relative scarcity and value to the Nation of all electric generation fuels. This proposed rule uses a resource based measure of scarcity and value. It utilizes the estimated reserves of electric generation fuels and their rate of consumption as an estimate of each fuel's scarcity and value. Though we are confident of the soundness of this approach, we recognize that there is some support for a measure of resource scarcity and value based on its market price. The previous rule utilized this approach. It has been suggested that a BTU adjusted market price of fuel might be a more realistic and measurable reflection of the scarcity and value of electric generation fuels. Under this approach, long term price projections such as those made by the Energy Information Administration could be used instead of marginal prices to address the problems associated with frequent updating of the petroleum equivalency factor to reflect market prices. We seek comments on this alternative market price based approach as well. Comments are sought on the merits of the market price based approach and its impact on the users of the petroleum equivalency factor.         D. Public Access to Information         To assist the public in commenting on this proposed rulemaking, copies of the sources of information used in developing this rulemaking (which will be incorporated by reference) are available in Docket No. EERM94101 for public inspection and copying in the DOE Freedom of Information Reading Room 1E190, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW, Washington, DC, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.

0,FT942-12430 ,"FT942-12430 _AN-ED2DAAEMFT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / UK Company News: Industrial logic that's very compelling - How the Enterprise Oil chairman sees the future with the prospect of Lasmo in the pipeline      By DAVID LASCELLES   'This is a big boys' game', said Mr Graham Hearne, chairman and chief executive of Enterprise Oil, yesterday. It is a message he will have to press home hard, judging by the generally sceptical reaction in the City to his Pounds 1.4bn bid for fellow independent oil company Lasmo. But there are several points to his game plan. As his opening remark suggests, Mr Hearne is looking for size and strength. In an environment where low oil prices are exposing the weaknesses in the oil industry, he believes that a company needs 'clout and credibility' if it is to succeed. The combination of Enterprise and Lasmo, two medium-sized exploration and production companies, will have 'critical mass' he says, as well as the financial and technical strength needed to operate on a world scale. The deal would virtually double Enterprise's reserves and production. But having said that, Mr Hearne is also keen to dismiss the idea that he is after size for its own sake. 'This is not megalomania. I feel very passionately about this,' he said. And though a successful bid would greatly enlarge Enterprise, it would still be small relative to the oil 'majors' - about one tenth the market capitalisation of Shell, for example. So there was no question of stifling Enterprise's flair but of creating more opportunities to put it to work. Mr Andrew Shilston, finance director, said: 'We aim to create further value, not just add the two companies together.' Although both companies are strong in the North Sea, their operations have relatively little overlap elsewhere, and cover all the continents. The financial match is also good, Mr Hearne says. Lasmo is strapped for cash whereas Enterprise has completed the bulk of its Pounds 1.3bn capital spending programme and is about to reap the benefits in swelling cash flow. By merging Enterprise's strong balance sheet with Lasmo's, he expects to end up with a gearing of 44 per cent. This is lower than Enterprise's existing gearing of 48 per cent because it will include the proceeds of Lasmo's current Pounds 219m rights issue. 'We have the cash and they have the exploration prospects,' he said. 'The industrial logic is very compelling'. Above all, Mr Hearne believes that Enterprise can make more of Lasmo's oil and gas assets than Lasmo itself, though he was unwilling to come up with any specific examples yesterday - or point fingers at particular members of Lasmo management, though he says it suffers from 'continuing weakness' despite a reshuffle at the top. However, some market sceptics point out that Enterprise's own recent record has not been that brilliant, despite its stronger market standing compared to Lasmo. Its earnings per share are down from late 1980 levels, and its exploration record has tailed off even though capital spending has gone up. In particular, the market is worried that Enterprise is about to make the same mistake as Lasmo when it paid Pounds 1bn for Ultramar in 1991 in a bid for expansion, only to plunge into loss. Mr Hearne points to several differences. One is that his bid will be paid for with shares rather than topped up with cash, leaving the balance sheet in good shape. 'It is our policy to fund big deals with paper,' he says. A second is that, unlike Ultramar, Lasmo is not in the hard-pressed refining business. Another is that Enterprise is not planning on a 'fire sale' of Lasmo assets to finance the deal, as was the case with Ultramar. And lastly, Mr Hearne believes that his offer has been pitched at a realistic level given the unexciting outlook for the oil price. 'It's wrong to suppose that if you invest, the oil price will bail you out.' Mr Hearne says 'I honestly do not know' when asked what might happen to the oil price. But he says the offer has been examined in the light of a whole range of assumptions from Pounds 9 to Pounds 12 a barrel.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          COMPANY PROFILES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                              Enterprise    Lasmo   Combined                              Oil  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Reserves (mboe)              881           747*    1628 Production ('000 boepd)      159           167      326 Acreage ('000 net sq km)      75            53      128 Countries of operation        18            12       26 Net assets (poundsm)         951          1058     2498** Net debt (poundsm)           459           794     1034** Gearing                       48            75       44  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *after disposals **does not add up due to accounting adjustments Pro forma balance sheet figures includes Lasmo rights issue proceeds (pounds219m) but exclude disposal proceeds.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Enterprise Oil and annual reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Companies:-  Enterprise Oil.

Under the Chinese constitution, all mineral resources belong  to the State.    The fee will be levied on all 9,000 State and 250,000  collective mining enterprises as well as foreign-funded and  private mining operators.    Each mining business will have to pay an average of less  than  4 percent of its sales income from mineral products as a fee.    Such a ratio, far lower than royalties abroad, treat foreign  investors the same as domestic firms, according to Fu Mingke,  deputy head of Mineral Development Management Bureau.    The bulk of the levy will be channelled to geological  surveys  and exploration work that are now stymied by a severe lack of  investment, said a senior official with the Ministry of Geology  and Mineral Resources.    The remainder will flow into general State revenue.    About 2-3 billion yuan ($230-344 million) a year is expected  to be raised from the levy.    The State Council is reviewing detailed rules on the levy  presented by the ministry, said Fu.    ""The levy measures will come into force in the first half of  this year,"" Fu said. He did not give a specific date.    The levy is aimed to help develop the State's economic  resources.    The government's annual spending on geological surveys and  exploration work is about 8 billion yuan ($919 million), far  below what is needed to detect new mineral deposits and  guarantee stable mining production.    In China, about 95 per cent of the energy and 80 percent of  industrial raw materials come from non-renewable mineral  resources.    The rules favour those with a higher mining recovery rate.  They will be charged less to inspire more efficient and  rational mining development.    Presently, enterprises and individuals which exploit  minerals  only pay small part of their income in resource tax. Many  enterprises and individuals exploit mineral resources with  inefficient mining practices or methods which damage the  environment. This causes severe waste and loss of precious  resources.    ""The new measures are in line with the international norms,""  Fu said adding that almost all foreign countries charge mining  firms a royalty.    The ministry prepared a draft of the rules in 1987, but met  strong protest from mining firms allegedly unable to bear the  financial burden owing to low State prices or mineral products.    ""The time is ripe now. China's market economy has freed up  the price of most minerals, including oil, coal and iron,"" Fu  said.    Another consideration is that overseas investors involved in  Chinese mines -- once an area forbidden to them -- should be  charged with the fee.     "

The discovery is the biggest in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could be another North Sea. The Mars discovery, at a depth of 3,100 feet, makes it one of the deepest commercially-viable oilfields. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's Auger operation nearby. British Petroleum, which has a one-third interest in the Mars field, said it was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Shell said further engineering studies were required before it could estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK sector of the North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels. Oil could be produced from the Mars discovery within five years of starting development, the company said yesterday. Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery at these depths'. The depth of the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep  -makes it more complicated and expensive to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it takes about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. Oil revenue taxes in the US are much lower than in the UK, however, and the discoveries will be more profitable. The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has implications for the area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years.

The meeting takes place against a backdrop of the continuing territorial disputes involving three Asean members - China, Vietnam and Taiwan - over the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea, a quarrel which could deteriorate shortly with the expected start of oil exploration in the area. The foreign ministers' gathering is their first since the January accord among the six Asean governments - Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Brunei - to transform the region into a free-trade area by 2007. They will discuss ways to strengthen Asean's ability to cope with a changing international environment and then discuss trends in trade, investment and development with counterparts from their main economic partners: the EC, US, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Raul Manglapus, chairman of the Asean Standing Committee and Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary, said yesterday that the Spratley disputes will also be discused. The three Asean members involved - Brunei, Malaysia and the Philippines - and China, Vietnam and Taiwan all have claims on the islands. With the exception of Brunei, all also have troops on some of the islands, under which may lie oil and gas reserves. China and Vietnam have awarded contracts separately to western companies to drill for oil in the disputed territories, and Vietnam recently increased its campaign by wooing Malaysia to participate in one exploration venture. Over the past few weeks, China is said to have planted a territorial marker on a reef and had earlier authorised its army to use force, if necessary, to control the islands. Nevertheless, Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, has been invited to the Manila meetings and is expected to hold talks with his Asean counterparts as a group and individually. Mr Manglapus said this week's meetings will tackle 'some guidelines (that) will provide us with the start of a kind of modus vivendi between contesting nations before a final resolution is arrived at'. And, while analysts are not optimistic that a definitive end to the disputes can be reached this week, Mr Manglapus noted 'a strong feeling on the part of our partners (for) a peaceful solution.'

This was sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 16m, struck after a Pounds 16m loss on the Panocean disposal and a charge of Pounds 8.4m for the management restructuring. The latest figure represents a 9 per cent rise on 1992's underlying profits of Pounds 40.4m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 875m to Pounds 964m, including Pounds 10.7m from discontinued operations. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the management changes had contributed about Pounds 5m to profits, and movements in the exchange rate a further Pounds 4m. He described the markets for most of the group's services as tough. 'In these conditions the growth in our results was encouraging,' he said. Operating profits from the freight and distribution division, which operates on fine margins, eased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m on turnover ahead from Pounds 644m to Pounds 748m. The profits fall was mainly due to Hull Blyth, which was seriously affected by the war in Angola. Profits at MSAS, the air freight brokerage company, were 15 per cent ahead on exchange gains and the benefits of a new computer system. Large new clients included Eastman Kodak. The marine services division, which contributes the bulk of profits, also benefited from exchange rates which countered lower oil prices. They rose by 25 per cent from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 30.1m on turnover of Pounds 132m (Pounds 122m). The group succeeded in moving its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed North Sea to areas of strength in west Africa and south-east Asia. Profits from environmental services rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The UK domestic waste business had a good year. Earnings per share were up to 20.3p (1.4p). An unchanged final dividend of 9.62p is proposed giving an unchanged total for the year of 14.33p. COMMENT Ocean has been running hard to stand still. The benefits from the restructuring and exchange rate movements have saved it from a flat year or worse. Most of the profits come from the marine services area, where low prices are curbing oil exploration budgets. Overall there appears to be nothing to get excited about from the rather mixed bag of activities. However, there is a further Pounds 3m benefit to come from the restructuring, and the balance sheet is strong, with gearing down from 35 per cent to 17 per cent. A yield of 6.6 per cent makes the shares worth holding.   Companies:-  Ocean Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4412 Deep Sea Foreign Transportation of Freight.

MAUGH II, Times Science Writer      Everywhere you turn, you encounter the hype: on radio, the basso profundo voice  of actor James Earl Jones talking about cleaning up the environment; on  television, images of gasoline pumps jutting from the Los Angeles skyline; in  newspapers, full-page ads singing the praises of Arco's new Emission Control-1  gasoline.    For once, the hype may be correct.    Arco says EC-1, designed to replace the leaded regular gasoline used by  pre-1975 cars, cuts pollutant emissions from those older cars by 20%. The  amount is substantial considering that such cars represent only 15% of all  automobiles registered in Southern California but account for 30% of automotive  pollution. If all owners of the older cars were to use EC-1, the company  promises, ""350 tons of pollutants would be removed from the air each day.""    State and local authorities, even environmentalists, agree that the claims are  on target. Arco is definitely ""ahead of the pack"" in reducing auto emissions,  said Alan Lloyd, chief scientist of the South Coast Air Quality Management  District. ""We've been trying to get people to do this for years,"" added William  Kelly, an AQMD spokesman.    Other gasoline companies seem likely to follow suit -- if not immediately, at  least in the foreseeable future. Already, several refiners have contacted Arco  seeking information about the new gasoline, and the company says it will  release full details of its manufacture and testing Friday.    The concept of redesigning gasolines to reduce emissions -- ""reformulating,"" in  industry jargon -- will soon spread to fuels used by newer cars. Within the  next year, the California Air Resources Board will mandate that petroleum  companies selling in California reformulate all grades of gasoline in a similar  fashion to reduce emissions.    And earlier this month, petroleum companies and U.S. auto makers confirmed the  formation of a consortium to work toward combining reformulated gasolines with  improved engine technology in an effort to avoid government-imposed shifts to  alternative fuels, such as methanol, by the mid-1990s.    But even the most enthusiastic supporters of reformulation agree that EC-1 is  not a panacea. Arco has the capacity to produce only 36 million gallons per  month, all of it destined for use in Southern California. But it is only a  fraction of the total needed for the 1.2 million pre-1975 cars and pre-1980  pickup trucks in the region.    For now, the fuel cannot be used in newer cars without using a funnel. The big  nozzles on the EC-1 pumps fit only into older cars.    Furthermore, extending the same principle to other gasolines will require at  least four years and a substantial capital investment, according to Dan  Townsend, Arco's manager of operations support. The company's refineries would  need to be upgraded, resulting in an increased cost to consumers. For now, the  company is selling EC-1 for the same price it charges for leaded regular.  Nonetheless, the advent of EC-1 is ""a good sign,"" according to Mary Nichols of  the Natural Resources Defense Council. It shows that the petroleum refiners  ""can make gasoline a whole lot cleaner.""    Arco created EC-1 by taking three major steps to change its regular gasoline:  removing lead, lessening volatility, and reducing the concentration of  so-called aromatics and olefins -- hydrocarbons that contribute to air  pollution and so are themselves health risks.    Volatility refers to the ability of gasoline to evaporate so that it can  readily be mixed with air and drawn into the engine for combustion. High  volatility promotes good drivability when the car is first started, but it also  promotes evaporation of gasoline into the atmosphere when the car is parked,  particularly when the engine is warm.    Townsend said Arco was able to reduce the volatility of EC-1 by about 14%  without impairing performance, primarily by removing butane, which was used for  cold-start drivability. California had already forced refiners to cut butane  content below levels in other areas of the country and Arco simply went one  step further.    The ARB will require all refiners to meet the volatility level of EC-1 during  the 1990s.    Lead compounds represent an inexpensive way to raise the octane of gasoline.  Octane is a measure of the energy content of the fuel and the speed with which  it burns. High octane is necessary to prevent premature ignition of gasoline,  which produces the ""pinging"" or ""knocking"" that robs a car of its power and  increases pollutant emissions.    Lead compounds already have been removed from about 85% of all gasolines  because lead fouls the catalytic converters that reduce exhaust emissions on  newer cars. Lead is also a health threat, causing a wide variety of  neurological damage, and refiners have slowly been reducing the amount of lead  in gasoline for vehicles without catalytic converters.    But without lead, something else must be added to maintain high octane. In the  unleadedgasolines now marketed, octane comes primarily from olefins and  aromatics. These have a high energy content and they burn slowly so that  premature ignition is avoided.    But because they burn slowly, some of the aromatics and olefins escape into the  exhaust system, according to Ron Jones of the Washington-based American  Petroleum Institute. In cars equipped with catalytic converters, the compounds  are generally destroyed. But in older cars, they escape into the atmosphere.    In the skies, the unburned components react with other pollutants to form smog.  Some also are health hazards in themselves. One aromatic, benzene, is a  carcinogen that is ""the No. 1 toxic in Southern California air,"" according to  ARB spokesman Bill Sessa.    Overall, about one-third of the olefins and aromatics have been removed from  EC-1, and about 50% of the benzene.    To replace them, Arco uses a compound called methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or  MTBE, an oxygen-containing molecule. Like olefins and aromatics, MTBE has a  high energy content and is slow burning. But if it escapes into the air, it  does not contribute to smog formation and it has no adverse health effects.    A different gasoline formulation that includes MTBE already is used in  high-altitude cities, such as Denver and Phoenix, where the oxygen it contains  promotes complete combustion of gasoline during winter.    But it is more costly than olefins and aromatics, raising the manufacturing  cost of EC-1 about 2 cents per gallon above the cost of leaded regular. Arco  has decided to absorb the extra cost to maintain a competitive pricing  position.    Two independent laboratories recently tested the reformulated gasoline in 16  Japanese and American cars from model years 1970 to 1978 and four Japanese and  American pickups from model years 1975 to 1979.    The labs found that EC-1 cut evaporative emissions by 21%, carbon monoxide by  9%, nitrogen oxides by 5% and hydrocarbons by 4%, Townsend said. Drivability  tests conducted by Arco, he said, also showed that it gave ""more power and  performance under load"" than leaded regular.    The labs have so far tested EC-1 in five new cars as well. Preliminary results  indicate, Townsend said, ""that this will clean up new cars just as good or  better than it did the older cars. ""    But, he said, producing a complete line of gasolines like EC-1 will require  renovating the refineries, at a cost of at least $100 million apiece.

GASOLINE; VEHICLE EMISSIONS; POLLUTION CONTROL; AIR POLLUTION -- SOUTHERN  CALIFORNIA; PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT; ATLANTIC RICHFIELD CO    "," LA092889-0138   113442    September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition      Part 1; Page 1; Column 5; Metro Desk      1359 words      ARCO HYPE MAY BE RIGHT -- GASOLINE CAN BE CLEANER      By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, Times Science Writer      Everywhere you turn, you encounter the hype: on radio, the basso profundo voice  of actor James Earl Jones talking about cleaning up the environment; on  television, images of gasoline pumps jutting from the Los Angeles skyline; in  newspapers, full-page ads singing the praises of Arco's new Emission Control-1  gasoline.    For once, the hype may be correct.    Arco says EC-1, designed to replace the leaded regular gasoline used by  pre-1975 cars, cuts pollutant emissions from those older cars by 20%. The  amount is substantial considering that such cars represent only 15% of all  automobiles registered in Southern California but account for 30% of automotive  pollution. If all owners of the older cars were to use EC-1, the company  promises, ""350 tons of pollutants would be removed from the air each day.""    State and local authorities, even environmentalists, agree that the claims are  on target. Arco is definitely ""ahead of the pack"" in reducing auto emissions,  said Alan Lloyd, chief scientist of the South Coast Air Quality Management  District. ""We've been trying to get people to do this for years,"" added William  Kelly, an AQMD spokesman.    Other gasoline companies seem likely to follow suit -- if not immediately, at  least in the foreseeable future. Already, several refiners have contacted Arco  seeking information about the new gasoline, and the company says it will  release full details of its manufacture and testing Friday.    The concept of redesigning gasolines to reduce emissions -- ""reformulating,"" in  industry jargon -- will soon spread to fuels used by newer cars. Within the  next year, the California Air Resources Board will mandate that petroleum  companies selling in California reformulate all grades of gasoline in a similar  fashion to reduce emissions.    And earlier this month, petroleum companies and U.S. auto makers confirmed the  formation of a consortium to work toward combining reformulated gasolines with  improved engine technology in an effort to avoid government-imposed shifts to  alternative fuels, such as methanol, by the mid-1990s.    But even the most enthusiastic supporters of reformulation agree that EC-1 is  not a panacea. Arco has the capacity to produce only 36 million gallons per  month, all of it destined for use in Southern California. But it is only a  fraction of the total needed for the 1.2 million pre-1975 cars and pre-1980  pickup trucks in the region.    For now, the fuel cannot be used in newer cars without using a funnel. The big  nozzles on the EC-1 pumps fit only into older cars.    Furthermore, extending the same principle to other gasolines will require at  least four years and a substantial capital investment, according to Dan  Townsend, Arco's manager of operations support. The company's refineries would  need to be upgraded, resulting in an increased cost to consumers. For now, the  company is selling EC-1 for the same price it charges for leaded regular.  Nonetheless, the advent of EC-1 is ""a good sign,"" according to Mary Nichols of  the Natural Resources Defense Council. It shows that the petroleum refiners  ""can make gasoline a whole lot cleaner.""    Arco created EC-1 by taking three major steps to change its regular gasoline:  removing lead, lessening volatility, and reducing the concentration of  so-called aromatics and olefins -- hydrocarbons that contribute to air  pollution and so are themselves health risks.    Volatility refers to the ability of gasoline to evaporate so that it can  readily be mixed with air and drawn into the engine for combustion. High  volatility promotes good drivability when the car is first started, but it also  promotes evaporation of gasoline into the atmosphere when the car is parked,  particularly when the engine is warm.    Townsend said Arco was able to reduce the volatility of EC-1 by about 14%  without impairing performance, primarily by removing butane, which was used for  cold-start drivability. California had already forced refiners to cut butane  content below levels in other areas of the country and Arco simply went one  step further.    The ARB will require all refiners to meet the volatility level of EC-1 during  the 1990s.    Lead compounds represent an inexpensive way to raise the octane of gasoline.  Octane is a measure of the energy content of the fuel and the speed with which  it burns. High octane is necessary to prevent premature ignition of gasoline,  which produces the ""pinging"" or ""knocking"" that robs a car of its power and  increases pollutant emissions.    Lead compounds already have been removed from about 85% of all gasolines  because lead fouls the catalytic converters that reduce exhaust emissions on  newer cars. Lead is also a health threat, causing a wide variety of  neurological damage, and refiners have slowly been reducing the amount of lead  in gasoline for vehicles without catalytic converters.    But without lead, something else must be added to maintain high octane. In the  unleadedgasolines now marketed, octane comes primarily from olefins and  aromatics. These have a high energy content and they burn slowly so that  premature ignition is avoided.    But because they burn slowly, some of the aromatics and olefins escape into the  exhaust system, according to Ron Jones of the Washington-based American  Petroleum Institute. In cars equipped with catalytic converters, the compounds  are generally destroyed. But in older cars, they escape into the atmosphere.    In the skies, the unburned components react with other pollutants to form smog.  Some also are health hazards in themselves. One aromatic, benzene, is a  carcinogen that is ""the No. 1 toxic in Southern California air,"" according to  ARB spokesman Bill Sessa.    Overall, about one-third of the olefins and aromatics have been removed from  EC-1, and about 50% of the benzene.    To replace them, Arco uses a compound called methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or  MTBE, an oxygen-containing molecule. Like olefins and aromatics, MTBE has a  high energy content and is slow burning. But if it escapes into the air, it  does not contribute to smog formation and it has no adverse health effects.    A different gasoline formulation that includes MTBE already is used in  high-altitude cities, such as Denver and Phoenix, where the oxygen it contains  promotes complete combustion of gasoline during winter.    But it is more costly than olefins and aromatics, raising the manufacturing  cost of EC-1 about 2 cents per gallon above the cost of leaded regular. Arco  has decided to absorb the extra cost to maintain a competitive pricing  position.    Two independent laboratories recently tested the reformulated gasoline in 16  Japanese and American cars from model years 1970 to 1978 and four Japanese and  American pickups from model years 1975 to 1979.    The labs found that EC-1 cut evaporative emissions by 21%, carbon monoxide by  9%, nitrogen oxides by 5% and hydrocarbons by 4%, Townsend said. Drivability  tests conducted by Arco, he said, also showed that it gave ""more power and  performance under load"" than leaded regular.    The labs have so far tested EC-1 in five new cars as well. Preliminary results  indicate, Townsend said, ""that this will clean up new cars just as good or  better than it did the older cars. ""    But, he said, producing a complete line of gasolines like EC-1 will require  renovating the refineries, at a cost of at least $100 million apiece. Before  Arco makes that kind of investment, Townsend said, it wants to make sure there  is not a better formula than EC-1.    Townsend estimated that it would require one to two years to develop the  specifications for gasolines to replace the current unleaded fuels, then three  years to rebuild the refineries.

He has filled two of the most sensitive portfolios - justice and education - with men the late President Mohamed Boudiaf, assassinated three weeks ago, would have wished to see at the posts. Professor Ahmed Djebbar, the new minister of education, returned to Algeria six months ago with the former president after several years of exile in France. Mr Abdelhamid Mahi-Bahi, the justice minister, was state prosecutor in the western town of Oran. Mr Abdessalam retained seven ministers from the outgoing government. They include Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, the respected foreign minister, who two years ago brokered a measure of peace in Lebanon; Mr Abdenour Keramane, the minister for industry; Mr Farouk Tebbal, minister of housing; and General Khaled Nezzar who, as minister of defence and member of the five-man collegiate presidency, appears to be a key player in Algeria. Mr Hacen Mefti, a senior manager of the state oil and gas monopoly Sonatrach, replaces Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine as minister of energy. The latter piloted a more liberal oil and gas exploration bill through a hostile national assembly last December and recently presided over the signing of exploration agreements with Atlantic Richfield, Mobil Oil, Phillips Petroleum and British Petroleum. Mr Laoussine had asked to step down. Mr Mohamed Hardi, a civilian, takes over the Interior Ministry where he will be seconded by Colonel Mohamed Tolba. This marks the exit, from the government at least, of General Laarbi Belkheir, a close associate of former President Chadli Bendjedid. Mr Hardi has worked closely with Mr Reda Malek, who was co-opted into the collegiate presidency after the death of Mr Boudiaf and the appointment of Mr Ali Kafi as acting head of state. The five men have publicly ruled out running for the post of president in any future election. Mr Messaoud Ait-Chaalal, who becomes a special adviser to Mr Abdessalam, is a former Algerian ambassador.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The  nomenklatura blames it on the ""disruption of ties"" and ""collapse  of the Union"". To explain the true causes of the severe crisis  and how it could be solved we invited Yuriy Orobets, candidate  in technical sciences and a specialist in managing the energy  industry.    [Orobets] Our country is not particularly poor in energy  sources. Coal deposits alone, even if worked intensively, could  satisfy Ukrainian demand for more than two centuries. However,  conditions in the coal industry as a whole do not meet current  requirements. Twelve 12 percent of mines are older than 50  years, while 60 percent have not been overhauled for the past 30  years. These factors negatively impact on the production of  fuel. Substantial investment is also required to modernize the  industry.    The outlook is good also for brown coal deposits in the  Dnieper basin. Especially since coal can be mined there the  cheapest way: in open pits. Experts estimate that brown coal  could yield 600,000 tonnes of cheap gasoline per year.    The situation is difficult in the oil and gas industry. The  peak of its development in the Carpathian region and eastern  oblasts is long past, and Ukraine supplies only 9 percent of its  oil demand and 22 percent of its gas needs. It was the discovery  of rich deposits in Siberia and Central Asia that lead to the  contraction of exploration and development works here. Another  negative factor was our ground yield coefficient for oil, which  is low (but, nonetheless, twice as high as in the U.S., where  geological conditions are similar.)    [Kulchynskyy] What is the cause of the energy crisis in  Ukraine?    [Orobets] Supply and demand for energy have developed over  the past 30 years without regard for world prices, which have  the decisive impact on the development of energy producing and  processing operations. This has caused an energy crisis not only  in Ukraine and other new countries, but in Russia itself.    The discovery of rich deposits of oil and gas in Siberia led  to the intensive production of light products, such as gasoline,  kerosine and diesel fuel, and a huge quantity of heavy fuels.  Moreover, low yields from refining were tolerated. Ukrainian  refineries get only 40 percent of light fuels from processed  crude, whereas US refineries get up to 70 percent.    The existence of rich deposits of inexpensive natural gas  allowed us to bring gas to most cities and towns, and to use it  widely in industry. The low prices on oil and natural gas were  based on costs, and not set to match world prices. This  principle resulted in the construction of a large number of  cheap but wasteful energy using systems.    Unfortunately, delivery of oil and gas to Ukraine is being  used by Russia to apply pressure in solving political problems.  At the same time, Russia itself is experiencing a profound  crisis of oil production. Output has declined by 40 percent.  Therefore, from every point of view, Ukraine must find a general  solution for other sources of energy.    [Kulchynskyy] What is the outlook for the development of  hydroelectric and nuclear power?    [Orobets] Ukraine has resources to develop nuclear power,  but  the entire processing plant of the nuclear power industry is  based in Russia.    As to hydroelectric power, our low-lying country with  slow-flowing rivers would limit the development of this type of  energy. This is why hydroelectric plants produce only 4 percent  of power while their reservoirs take up hundreds of hectares of  some of the richest black soil in the world.    [Kulchynskyy] Recently, in this country and the world over,  the idea of using alternative sources has become popular.    [Orobets] The most realistic sources of alternative energy  are, in practice, the energy of the sun, the wind, sea waves and  photosynthesis. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to tap  solar and wind energy. From the practical point of view, it is  necessary to know exactly how much capacity must be in reserve  for the period when there is no sun or when it goes behind  clouds, or when there is no wind, and how long it will last.  Taking into account these details, as well as the great  expenditures required for the mass production of generating  equipment, commercial production of this ""free"" energy turns out  to be considerably more expensive than traditional sources.  Along with wind-driven generators, the most promising is  research in the production of fuel using photochemical and  photobiological processes. Also, sun batteries can be used  effectively. By the way, Ukraine produces and profitably exports  them. Using alternative sources, the problem of supplying energy  to some remote sites can be easily resolved.    [Kulchynskyy] In your opinion, can the energy crisis be  overcome, or at least mitigated, using domestic capabilities?    [Orobets] Of course. To do this, we must first of all  reorganize import and export of petroleum products. Despite  difficulties with energy sources, gasoline remains Ukraine's  main export. The theft of national property must be decisively  stopped. Moreover, for various reasons, energy is used very  ineffectively. Measures to save energy can be divided into two  categories. The first category consists of organizational  measures, which entail the introduction of strict discipline and  order in industry. The second category is the development of  technical measures to reduce energy intensity in industry. The  first category of measures can be implemented very rapidly.  Moreover, privatization would accelerate this process. This can  save 5-to-7 percent of electric power and 10-to-15 percent of  energy used for heating. The implementation of the second  category of measures will bring results that are 2-to-3 times  greater, but here, major investment and considerable  reconstruction will be required.    Ukraine is building an oil terminal near Odessa, the first  line of which will begin operation in October of this year. We  must also explore the possibility of bringing in oil through  Baltic ports, using the pipeline system in Belarus. In the  future, we could export light fuels produced by the excess  capacity of our refineries. For this, however, investments are  necessary to raise yields. It is extremely important to reduce  the use of gas and heavy fuels in producing electric power. The  necessary condition for this is to modernize our coal-burning  plants, first of all by installing boilers using nontraditional  methods to burn solid fuels with a high soot content. But  Ukraine produces no such boilers.    [Kulchynskyy] What would you like to see happen in the  industry?    [Orobets] To rebalance our fuel and energy complex will  require much work and, as you have already seen, considerable  investment. To attract it, we need a strong government comprised  of specialists and reformers whose deeds would not differ from  their words.     "

0,FT934-16390 ,"FT934-16390 _AN-DJFC5AF1FT 931006   FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lithuania seeks western help with exploration      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI      VILNIUS   LITHUANIA is aggressively seeking western investment to help tap the country's oil reserves and restructure the refining industry. The Baltic state holds a small cache of high-grade crude in its north-west corner. At present 16 fields are being explored, containing 25m tonnes of crude, of which 9m tonnes is recoverable. Total on-shore potential has been pegged at 137m tonnes, of which 40m tonnes is recoverable - not insignificant for a country barely bigger than Belgium, but a far cry from Russia's 152,000 wells and 327m-tonne annual output. Sea Search, a Dutch oil concern, and RWE-DEA, a subsidiary of the German group, are finalists in the competition for rights to a field near Klaipeda, the western Baltic port city, according to Lithuanian energy ministry officials. A contract should be awarded by the end of this month. The two companies had expressed interest along with Svenska Petroleum, Neste and Knight, a US company - which, the officials said, also made preliminary offers before pulling out. This contract will follow an April agreement between Svenska Petroleum and Lithuania's Gargzdai Enterprises to form a joint-venture to develop the north-western fields. Exploration of the Baltic off-shore fields awaits the resolution of political questions. With newly independent states still settling sea borders, Russia and Lithuania are bickering over rights to a field that lies in Lithuanian and the Kaliningrad region's waters. Mr Robertas Timosiunas, a Lithuanian deputy minister of energy, expects that the disputed area designated as D-6 , a tiny plot with some 7m tonnes of oil, will be divided between the two countries. Negotiations are continuing. The undisputed off-shore field holds an estimated 150m tonnes of crude, about a quarter of which is recoverable, and needs outside investment as the Lithuanians cannot afford exploration efforts. The state's refining business similarly lacks western money and know-how to stem the decline in supply and output since the collapse of the Soviet Union. After a 2 1/2 -year dispute with environmentalist, Lithuania plans to restructure the Mazeikiai refinery. A modern structure dependent on imports from former Soviet republics, Mazeikiai operates below its 12m tonnes-a-year capa-city. An Ecu450,000 (Dollars 525,000) grant from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will help restructuring efforts, plans for which are being drawn up by the UK consultancies NM Rothschild and Trichem. The eventual programme, which Lithuanian officials expect to cost at least Dollars 80m, will include a new hydrocarbons port on the Baltic near the Butinge area, a pipeline connecting it with Mazeikiai and renovations at the refinery itself. The Baltic state, weary after two years of intermittent Russian supplies and infrequent payments for deliveries, wants a western partner to ease the move into new market. Above all, however, a refinery needs crude oil: 'We're looking for an investor who can guarantee delivery,' Mr Timosiunas said.   Countries:-  LTZ  Lithuania, East Europe.

0,FT944-3703 ,"FT944-3703 _AN-ELMDEADJFT 941212   FT  12 DEC 94 / Restored to health with new ambition: David Simon and John Browne describe BP's business strategy to Robert Corzine and David Lascelles      By ROBERT CORZINE and DAVID LASCELLES   Healing can be a slow process in the business world. It has taken British Petroleum two-and-a-half years to recover from the crisis of mid-1992 that led to the dramatic ousting of its former chairman Mr Robert Horton. Then, the UK's leading oil company cut its dividend as it struggled to reduce a Dollars 16bn (Pounds 10.6bn) debt mountain and saw its share price plummet. This year, BP's shares have soared to record highs as the company paid its first dividend increase since 1992. Much of the credit for the turnround goes to Mr David Simon, the chief executive, who took over from Mr Horton after the boardroom coup. He describes the company as fully restored to health, but one with new ambitions. Since 1992, Mr Simon and his colleagues have kept a deliberately low profile while they worked to rebuild profits, repay billions of dollars of debt, sell off non-core businesses and refurbish the group's tarnished reputation. In contrast to the expansiveness of the Horton era, he prefers to use words such as discipline, teamwork - and even boring - to describe his style. Two weeks ago, BP announced a top-level reshuffle in which Mr Simon will become non-executive chairman, replacing Lord Ashburton who retires from the board. The new chief executive will be Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration and production division who is credited with orchestrating a marked improvement in the division's results. The changeover marks a new phase in BP's recovery strategy in which the group will set itself more demanding performance targets, including higher earnings, more debt reduction and modest growth in capital spending. The targets are indications of BP's renewed self-confidence - 'the gateway to further disciplined growth', as Mr Simon describes it. These financial targets will be achieved through increases in oil and gas volumes, continued cost-cutting, and improvements in internal organisation to break down barriers between the company's divisions. The company is also committed to further changes in its corporate culture to enhance its competitiveness. This is driven by BP's belief that it will get little help from changes in the external business environment such as higher crude oil prices or wider refining margins, at least in the near future. The company assumes, for example, that oil prices are likely to remain in the Dollars 16-Dollars 18 a barrel range, around current levels. To be on the safe side, it uses a much lower figure, Dollars 14, when testing the economics of new oil fields. 'We have to build in performance under all market conditions,' says Mr Simon. BP also acknowledges that any technological lead it might have in certain areas, such as operating in the deep water west of the Shetland Islands or developing new fuel specifications, is likely to be short-lived in an industry where partnerships and the sharing of information is the rule. The company's competitiveness rests on its ability to get greater efficiencies from its operations. 'Anybody can copy a formulation or your technology,' says Mr Simon. 'But your competitors cannot ape your process.' One of biggest changes that both men want to see is closer co-operation between the exploration, refining and marketing sides of the business. BPX, the exploration unit, 'was in a world of its own five years ago,' says Mr Simon. Its focus was on a 'series of massive projects consuming huge amounts of capital,' with no direct linkage to market concerns. 'Now they are fully integrated into BP.' But the aim is to push the integration even further, especially in the fast-developing international markets in Asia and Latin America that BP is keen to enter. Mr Simon says 'the old mind-set among the explorers was to find the oil and build a pipeline'. But the new emphasis in selected countries will be on whether BP can 'feed in other businesses behind the upstream operation'. Mr Browne says such a strategy also fits in with changes in the way developing countries view international oil companies. 'Governments don't look to us just to drill holes but to help them grow their economies. Now we ask ourselves whether BP can become a part of the countries in which it operates.' One of Mr Browne's main tasks will be to oversee the diversification of BP's production base away from its current US/UK bias. BP's production is overwhelmingly based on giant fields such as Prudhoe Bay in Alaska and Forties in the UK's North Sea. Its most publicised recent forays have been in politically risky areas such as Azerbaijan, Colombia and Vietnam. Mr Browne, however, rejects the argument that growing involvement in such countries will increase the risk of supply disruptions: any shift away from politically stable countries will be 'very slow', he stresses. There is considerable scope for BP to 'strengthen and deepen' its involvement in existing areas, he says. 'Ten years from now, two-thirds of our production will still come from existing members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.' BP is also keen to build up its production in the fast-growing natural gas market, a business in which the company has lagged behind many competitors. The company has experimented with gas trading in the US and become involved in the emerging spot market for liquefied natural gas by shipping LNG from Australia to Spain. Mr Browne says the company is also thinking about entering the gas-fuelled power generation business in developing countries, although any move would be in co-operation with a partner experienced in the sector. Existing partnerships include a long-standing exploration venture with Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company. BP's fastest-growing exploration partnership is with Shell, the Anglo-Dutch oil group. The selection of partners is a priority for Mr Browne, who says the company spends as much time assessing future partners as it does selecting senior executives. 'We keep an eye on the list of competitors to make sure the balance is right,' he says. Acquisitions of assets will continue under Mr Browne's leadership, but there are unlikely to be big structural changes to the company. The divestment of non-oil and gas assets is virtually completed, and he is content that the portfolio of potential oil and gas fields contains a good mix of opportunities. As for investments in other oil companies, Mr Browne has ruled out the possibility that BP will cement its preferred partnerships by taking equity stakes. 'We're not interested in collecting investments,' he says. 'We would rather do the business directly.' Creating a harmonious relationship between Mr Simon and Mr Browne will be vital in making a success of BP's growth strategy. The two men's experience appears to be complementary: Mr Simon's strength is in marketing, while Mr Browne made his reputation as first BP's treasurer and then the widely-respected head of exploration and production. Those familiar with the company say they also complement each other on a more subtle level. Mr Browne has a reputation for experimentation, a tendency that can create breakthroughs in such a technologically-driven business. It can, however, create tensions among more traditional executives in an organisation that is still in the midst of a bruising restructuring. Analysts say Mr Simon represents that more traditional BP culture, which may reassure those who have to be persuaded of the need for change. He is also the one person at BP whom Mr Browne defers to. While Mr Simon will be a part-time, non-executive chairman, he concedes he is unlikely to give up a lifetime habit of 'thinking about BP seven days a week'. That is likely to suit the other BP board members, who are reluctant after the Horton years to put all the responsibility in the hands of one man. There should, in any case, be plenty of work for both men. BP may be restored to health, but it will require continuing efforts for the company to succeed in a business where the global competition is unremitting.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.

0," FR940513-1-00081   FR940513-1-00017        The environmental, costs, energy and economic impacts   of the proposed MACT standards are summarized in Tables 4   through 6, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative A   for facilities emitting less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP   and Regulatory Alternative A for facilities emitting more   than 1 Mg of HAP. There are no projected impacts to   controlling emissions from ballasting.     As discussed in section IV.C.5, the EPA believes that   the potential safety impacts of the standards have been   addressed.     The estimated impacts of the standards are a VOC   reduction of 12,400 Mg/yr of which 1,300 Mg are HAP. The   capital and annualized costs are estimated to be   $570 million and $130 million, respectively.     The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the   MACT determination for this regulation. Potential price,   output, and employment impacts for affected producers and   for the marine transport industry were examined for each   alternative. Potential small business impacts were also   isolated. Additional information on these economic impacts   is available in the docket for this proposed regulation.     Estimated maximum price increases for the affected   products varied but were not large (less than 1 percent) for   any of the products under Regulatory Alternative A of the   MACT determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr.   These price increase estimates reflect both the control cost   increase for transporting crude oil and the control cost   increase for transporting petroleum products. Because these   price increases are small and because the elasticity of   demand coefficients for petroleum products are small,   estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were   minimal. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions   were also small (less than 200).     Under Regulatory Alternative A of the MACT   determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr,   potentially significant economic impacts on the smaller   terminal operations that would have to install controls were   identified. These significant impacts may have resulted   from the high costs overall acting in combination with high   per-barrel control cost differentials between the smaller   and larger terminal operations that would have to control.   It is expected that many of the smaller terminal operations   would not be able to pass all of their control costs forward   to consumers since they would be under increased competitive   pressure from the larger terminal operations. It was   estimated that up to 200 of the 264 affected terminal   operations will have difficulty either absorbing control   costs or passing along these costs to consumers under the   proposed standard.     The potential economic impact on marine vessel owners   is relatively small. Average control cost per barrel for   tankers shipping crude oil or refined products was estimated   to be $0.002 per barrel while owners or barges shipping   refined products would face control costs of $0.08 per   barrel. Because 77 percent of U.S. marine-transported   petroleum product volume would be affected by these proposed   standards, a significant percentage of U.S. marine vessels   will need to be retrofitted. The vessels least costly to   modify (most likely the larger, newer, double-skin vessels)   will be retrofitted first, leading to a significant degree   of dedicated service. It is expected that vessel owners   that do retrofit will be able to pass retrofit costs forward   to consumers.     As discussed above, a primary concern in the   implementation of these proposed regulations is safety.   Though section 112 of the Act does not specifically address   U.S. Coast Guard regulations on safety, the EPA has   endeavored to make sure that safety factors are adequately   addressed and that nothing in the proposed regulations,   whether proposed under section 183(f) or 112, is   inconsistent with current U.S. Coast Guard regulations.     In addition, section 183(f)(2) of the Act requires that   any regulations promulgated by any State or political   subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and   unloading of tank vessels must be consistent with U.S. Coast   Guard regulations regarding safety. This consistency   requirement is equally applicable to any State or local   regulation promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air   Act section 112. Moreover, section 112(l) requires that the   Administrator disapprove any program submitted by a State if   the Administrator determines that the program is not likely   to satisfy the objectives of the Act. The EPA believes that   any State or local program that is inconsistent with   U.S. Coast Guard safety regulations is ``not likely to   satisfy the objectives of the Act'' and would therefore be   disapproved by the Administrator.         F. Selection of Format for the Standards         The chosen format for the standards is a percent of   mass emissions reduction. The percent of mass reduction   format allows a focus on the final control device after good   capture has been ensured. This approach is consistent with   the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). Sufficient   data to develop a mass per unit loaded standard were not   available. Additionally, emission rates can vary between   facilities and between vessels based on loading temperature   and the arrival condition of the vessel, making it difficult   to set an acceptable mass per unit loaded standard while   ensuring good capture and control. Developing a mass per   unit loaded standard would have required extensive testing   and would need to be more stringent than the percent of mass   reduction format in order to accommodate the varying   terminal and vessel conditions. For this reason, a mass per   unit loaded alternative is not being proposed.     The primary format, mass emissions reduction, for the   MACT standards is the same as the RACT standards. However,   because the MACT standards allow the source the flexibility   to control only the portion of total facility emissions   needed to meet the 93 percent reduction requirement,   facilities may choose to calculate both potential   uncontrolled and actual controlled emissions as part of the   compliance demonstration.              "," FR940513-1-00081   FR940513-1-00017        The environmental, costs, energy and economic impacts   of the proposed MACT standards are summarized in Tables 4   through 6, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative A   for facilities emitting less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP   and Regulatory Alternative A for facilities emitting more   than 1 Mg of HAP. There are no projected impacts to   controlling emissions from ballasting.     As discussed in section IV.C.5, the EPA believes that   the potential safety impacts of the standards have been   addressed.     The estimated impacts of the standards are a VOC   reduction of 12,400 Mg/yr of which 1,300 Mg are HAP. The   capital and annualized costs are estimated to be   $570 million and $130 million, respectively.     The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the   MACT determination for this regulation. Potential price,   output, and employment impacts for affected producers and   for the marine transport industry were examined for each   alternative. Potential small business impacts were also   isolated. Additional information on these economic impacts   is available in the docket for this proposed regulation.     Estimated maximum price increases for the affected   products varied but were not large (less than 1 percent) for   any of the products under Regulatory Alternative A of the   MACT determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr.   These price increase estimates reflect both the control cost   increase for transporting crude oil and the control cost   increase for transporting petroleum products. Because these   price increases are small and because the elasticity of   demand coefficients for petroleum products are small,   estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were   minimal. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions   were also small (less than 200).     Under Regulatory Alternative A of the MACT   determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr,   potentially significant economic impacts on the smaller   terminal operations that would have to install controls were   identified. These significant impacts may have resulted   from the high costs overall acting in combination with high   per-barrel control cost differentials between the smaller   and larger terminal operations that would have to control.   It is expected that many of the smaller terminal operations   would not be able to pass all of their control costs forward   to consumers since they would be under increased competitive   pressure from the larger terminal operations. It was   estimated that up to 200 of the 264 affected terminal   operations will have difficulty either absorbing control   costs or passing along these costs to consumers under the   proposed standard.     The potential economic impact on marine vessel owners   is relatively small. Average control cost per barrel for   tankers shipping crude oil or refined products was estimated   to be $0.002 per barrel while owners or barges shipping   refined products would face control costs of $0.08 per   barrel. Because 77 percent of U.S. marine-transported   petroleum product volume would be affected by these proposed   standards, a significant percentage of U.S. marine vessels   will need to be retrofitted. The vessels least costly to   modify (most likely the larger, newer, double-skin vessels)   will be retrofitted first, leading to a significant degree   of dedicated service. It is expected that vessel owners   that do retrofit will be able to pass retrofit costs forward   to consumers.     As discussed above, a primary concern in the   implementation of these proposed regulations is safety.   Though section 112 of the Act does not specifically address   U.S. Coast Guard regulations on safety, the EPA has   endeavored to make sure that safety factors are adequately   addressed and that nothing in the proposed regulations,   whether proposed under section 183(f) or 112, is   inconsistent with current U.S. Coast Guard regulations.     In addition, section 183(f)(2) of the Act requires that   any regulations promulgated by any State or political   subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and   unloading of tank vessels must be consistent with U.S. Coast   Guard regulations regarding safety. This consistency   requirement is equally applicable to any State or local   regulation promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air   Act section 112. Moreover, section 112(l) requires that the   Administrator disapprove any program submitted by a State if   the Administrator determines that the program is not likely   to satisfy the objectives of the Act. The EPA believes that   any State or local program that is inconsistent with   U.S. Coast Guard safety regulations is ``not likely to   satisfy the objectives of the Act'' and would therefore be   disapproved by the Administrator.

When  she arrived in the Cuban capital, Mrs. Sanin de Rubio spoke to  Cuban and foreign journalists about the objectives of her visit  and the outlook for bilateral relations.    [Begin recording] [Sanin] Since the reestablishment of  relations, we have sought to obtain in-depth knowledge of our  mutual circumstances. Therefore, we are going to address  bilateral topics, exchange opinions and information on our  respective countries, and review the bilateral agenda on  commercial, cultural, and educational topics. There might also  be an opportunity to talk with important Cuban personalities. I  want to obtain in-depth knowledge of the reforms undertaken by  Cuba in economic and political areas, because we all have great  hopes that current problems will be overcome and there will be a  greater opening at different levels as a result of Cuba's  achievements and the reforms that have begun, based on Cuba's  self-determination.    [Unidentified reporter] What are the most immediate trade  prospects between the two countries?    [Sanin] Well, our overall trade amounts to $12 million.  There are great opportunities. Colombian businessmen will be  paying a visit. I am interested in speaking with the Cuban  authorities about some points which are important to promoting  greater Colombian investment in Cuba and improving trade. This  brings development and opportunities. Many of our products can  have a market here and many of your products can have a market  in Colombia. I think we have to review certain conditions, such  as the possibility of signing an agreement on investment  protection. I also want to review with the Cuban authorities  the possibilities for foreign investments.    [Reporter] Does Colombia uphold its decision to sell  petroleum to Cuba?    [Sanin] Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba without any  problem as long as Cuba can pay within the terms and conditions  Colombia establishes for the sale of oil. If you can accept the  Colombian terms, we see no problem in selling it. The letter of  credit and the terms are being discussed.    [Reporter] In your view, are relations with Cuba going well?    [Sanin] They are going well because they are developing with  mutual respect for domestic affairs and with a great sense of  cooperation and understanding. There is interest in all sectors  of the two countries.    [Reporter] How much petroleum is being negotiated?    [Sanin] I do not have that exact information because the  quantity would be established based on the terms and conditions.    [Reporter] What priorities or topics does Colombia, as  host, have for the fourth [Ibero-American] summit?    [Sanin] Economic topics as a basis for political reforms and  their sustainability, because economic and political reforms  cannot be carried out without emphasizing social aspects. In  addition to the extreme poverty of a large part of our  population, Latin America's great problem is the inequalities in  our societies. We are going to review the opportunities that  integration provides for economic development and prosperity for  our peoples, but always based on in-depth social reforms.    [Reporter] Will your visit lead to a possible visit by  President Gaviria before (?the end of his presidential term)?    [Sanin] It is not scheduled. The president's agenda is  already quite heavy. We had not [words indistinct] but in any  case we will hold the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and we  will receive President Fidel Castro on 14 and 15 (?July).    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] expect an agreement?    [Sanin] The transaction is being carried out like two normal  countries. There is talk of prices, duration, and guarantees.  The duration is being discussed. You are asking for a longer  duration than what Colombia is willing to offer and you are  offering a guarantee different from the one we are accustomed to  receiving. Nevertheless, it is a normal discussion in commercial  terms. We want it to be a normal commercial operation and we  are discussing it. Therefore, if we reach agreement, there is a  sale, and if not, it will be like so many other commercial  operations that are not carried through. It would not mean  [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Passage indistinct]    [Sanin] That is what we want, that it be a step in the  strengthening of relations, a sign of cooperation and mutual  respect, and of my country's desire to learn up close about the  reforms under way in Cuba. Everyone knows that Cuba is  experiencing various difficulties, but we are very hopeful about  the political resolve and President Fidel Castro's statements  yesterday about this being the beginning and that you are  willing to establish [words indistinct] reforms to resolve the  island's problems. We have great hope that these measures will  be effective. We respect that the reforms will stem from Cuba's  self-determination and we hope that the political resolve that  has been expressed will be clear and real. We all want the  Cuban people to be prosperous, enjoy well-being, and be able to  maintain the reforms the country has achieved in social aspects  such as education, health, and other fields. [end recording]    The program for the Colombian foreign minister's 24-hour  visit to Cuba includes meetings with Carlos Lage, vice president  of the Councils of State and Ministers, and a working luncheon  with Army General Raul Castro. In addition, she will visit the  National Library and the Casa de las Americas to deliver  donations of books and crafts. Along with the Cuban foreign  minister, she will confirm the work program of the joint  intergovernmental commission that was recently created and will  sign an educational agreement. Before leaving Cuba, Mrs. Sanin  de Rubio will hold a news conference.     "

Comibol further hopes to complete two additional joint venture deals before general elections are held in June. Comsur will invest Dollars 13m in Bolivar and anticipates an initial 30 year exploitation plan. Under the terms of the deal Comibol will take 50 per cent of future profits. Future investment in Bolivar will be Comsur's sole responsibility. Both parties have guaranteed the jobs of the mine's existing workforce of about 300 and new jobs may also be created. Local miners are said to be broadly in favour of the deal. However, the directorate of the main miners' union, the FSTMB, remains implacably opposed to joint ventures. Union spokesman Mr Victor Baldivieso said it would try to prevent this joint venture and condemned Bolivar workers in favour of the deal. Mr Jaime Urjel, Comsur's managing director, said the company hoped to take over Bolivar within 45 to 60 days. The mine would then become operational within 15 to 18 months. A new mill - which will be able to deal with 1,000 tonnes of lead/zinc and zinc/silver ore a day - is being built at the site. The plant may process tin in the future. Comibol executive director Mr Armando Guzman said that while the FSTMB union was clearly opposed to the deal, Bolivar workers themselves would carry the day. He said it was possible that RTZ, the UK-based group, which has close associations with Comsur, would be involved in future funding of Bolivar's operations. The International Finance Corporation will also be involved. This is the third joint venture contrast to be signed between Comibol and a private mining company since 1991. But operations in the first two remain blocked by union action. Mr Guzman said both these joint ventures would be activated by August this year. Two further joint venture tenders have been issued by Comibol. The first, for which invitations have yet to be sent, is an exploration venture for alluvial gold deposits in the Pando and Beni Regions. The second, for which invitations were sent out recently, is for the exploration of the Cerro Rico (Rich Hill) in Potosi. A recent study estimated that the hill contained Dollars 400m tonnes of silver ore. Mr Guzman estimates there are between 80m and lOOm tonnes of silver ore reserves. According to figures just released by the Medium Mines Association, Bolivian mining registered negative growth in 1992 of 4.9 per cent, compared with growth in 1991 of 2 per cent. Legal sales and exports of gold fell by 46 per cent. Antimony production was down 34 per cent, wolfram 15 per cent, cadmium 38 per cent, silver 14 per cent and tin 5 per cent.

0,FT931-66 ,"FT931-66 _AN-DC4CXAGYFT 930331   FT  31 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Everything to play for in China's Tarim basin - Tony Walker explains why the oil majors are lining up despite past disappointments      By TONY WALKER   WHEN registrations close in Beijing today for what may prove to be one of the world's last great oil basins, dozens of international oil companies will have signed up for seismic data gleaned from sketchy surveys of China's remote far western region. Mr Liu Song Wei, President of the China National Petroleum Corporation International, said in an interview that the response from the oil industry to the opening of new onshore areas had been 'very encouraging'. Among oil majors that had shown strong interest, he said, were Shell, Amoco, Arco, Unico and BP, among several others. After years of hesitation, China is at last inviting bids to explore its Tarim basin, located in the Central Asian Xinjiang region; and while foreign companies are wary because of the region's inaccessibility - a Tarim basin pipeline would need to be longer than the Alaska one - they feel bound to pursue the opportunity. 'The question is not whether we can afford to be involved, but whether we can afford not to be involved,' said the Beijing representative of a large European oil company. Wariness among foreign oil companies in China is understandable, given the disappointments many suffered in their search for oil offshore. BP, for example, spent about UDollars 200m drilling dry well after dry well in the 1980s in the Yellow Sea and Pearl River Delta, and it was far from alone in its singular lack of success in Chinese waters. China's offshore areas had, incidentally been billed as one of the world's last great 'oil plays,' hence nervousness among oil explorers when similar hyperbole is used to describe prospects in the Tarim basin whose reserves, based on fairly flimsy evidence, are being likened to those of Saudi Arabia. When Dr Wang Tao, President of China National Petroleum Corporation, announced in February that China was opening 12 additional onshore areas in the north of the country to foreign exploration, including the prized Tarim basin, it marked a substantial and belated turnaround in policy, not only for China, but also for Dr Wang himself. Above all, the decision represented a painful admission that China, which is expected to become a net importer of oil by the mid 1990s, simply did not have the capital or expertise to develop a region of the Tarim basin's dimensions, remoteness and technical difficulty. The spiralling demand for energy generated by China's booming economy - economic growth neared 13 per cent last year - almost certainly spurred the change of heart. Mr Liu admitted as much when he said that 'since China's economy is growing so fast we need more energy resources, and if we don't make a big discovery maybe we will have to import. We need foreign investment to speed up activity.' The reality for China is that even if a foreign company strikes it rich immediately, oil would not be flowing from the Tarim basin into the country's pipeline grid much before the end of the century. The Chinese, therefore, are in for a painful few years coping with an oil shortfall. China's current output is about 2.8m b/d, and exports are running at about 400,000 b/d, down from a peak of 600,000 b/d in 1985. Oil production limped upwards by about 1.6 per cent last year, but only after substantial investment in recovery enhancement for the mature Daqing oilfield in the North East, which accounts for 40 per cent of China's oil, and whose reserves are rapidly diminishing. China's success in drawing foreign explorers into the search for onshore oil has been patchy. Since, 1985 when the foreigners were first given access to 11 southern provinces - foreign companies regard these areas as marginal - from Jiangsu in the north to Hainan island in the south, some five exploration agreements were concluded, none of which have yielded a commercial find. Mr Liu said delays in opening the Tarim basin were explained by the time needed by the Chinese side to conduct preliminary surveys and to prepare basic infrastructure such as airports and trunk roads to enable foreign companies to gain access to the region. 'You have to remember,' he said, 'that China itself did not start exploring in the Tarim basin until 1978.' The Chinese official was cautious about prospects in the Tarim basin, but he noted that preliminary studies indicated that reserves might be 'very promising'. China itself did not have a firm estimate of possible recoverable reserves, but he said that a figure of about 10bn tonnes did not seem unreasonable, based on initial studies. China, Mr Liu noted, had found oil near the five blocks covering 72,730 square kilometres being offered for exploration in the southern Tarim basin. It produced about 100,000 tonnes from these small-scale efforts last year. He revealed that design work had begun on a pipeline to carry the oil some 3,700 kilometres from the Tarim basin to Luoyang in central Henan province where it would enter the country's national grid to be pumped to coastal loading terminals such as Qingdao, or to be used domestically. Mr Liu estimated that it would take 3-5 years for the pipeline to be built, but speed of construction would depend on the 'size of the reservoirs' discovered by foreign explorers. CNPC, would participate in the financing of the pipeline, but would also be looking to foreign companies for contributions. In recognition of the costs associated with exploring in such an inhospitable region and moving oil thousands of kilometres from China's vast hinterland, the authorities were reviewing financial conditions. China was 'prepared to do more to improve the investment environment for foreign oil companies' in difficult locales such as the Tarim basin, Mr Liu said. Later this year, State Council or cabinet would probably approve separate regulations from those applying to offshore exploration later this year.

We  cannot yet speak of short-term recovery, but we must refer to  things that are going well and allow ourselves to anticipate  good results, the deputy stated in a lengthy interview with  Sunday's weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE.    Martinez also explained that the country is moving toward an  economic model that, without abandoning the basic principles of  socialism, will function without disregarding the market, with  forms of private property and a strong presence of foreign  capital. Martinez cited tourism, which has a 30-percent annual  growth rate, as the first positive aspect of the island's  economic performance, adding that it will shortly exceed the  sugar industry as the main source of revenue for the nation. He  also mentioned the growing production of petroleum, which is  expected to exceed [word indistinct] 1.1 million tons produced  last year.    There is an investment process of foreign capital in the  area  of petroleum, which shows interest in Cuba's petroleum  potential, Martinez noted. He added that the fact that these  companies challenge the blockade and U.S. threats demonstrates  that there are reasonably good prospects for finding petroleum  deposits.    He also explained that new forms of exploiting state-owned  land, granted for the use of former workers, now organized in  cooperatives, will permit a significant increase in food  production. The measures the government will adopt to cleanse  internal finances, he remarked, will have immediate positive  results for the economy, although its basic effect will require  no less than one and a half years to mature.    He said measures will undoubtedly have positive effects on  the recovery, namely to return to the path of growth. Martinez  added that by the end of the century, Cuba will begin overcoming  this adverse situation and will do so by ""not only returning to  the path of economic growth, but achieving a qualitatively  different economy.""    The lawmaker affirmed the country will have greater levels  of  efficiency expressed in high worker productivity, as well as  domestic and export-related productive efficiency. He said it  must be an economy with a strong state sector that outlines the  economic path and operates following decentralized  administration mechanisms in which economic categories play a  more important role than administrative mechanisms. Martinez  said the model being designed will attach greater importance to  the market and to a strong presence of foreign capital.    A sector of self-employed workers, which is expected to grow  in the future, will coexist together with the guiding role of  the state and a very important cooperative sector in  agriculture, Martinez declared. He stressed that these changes  will not alter the basic foundations of Cuban society, forced to  make its way in a world governed by capitalism.    Our economy will continue to be socialist. This means that  political decisionmaking will be central and politics will  govern the economy, in that it is subordinated and directed  towards the achievement of the social objectives of socialism,  Martinez concluded.

0,FT934-2957 ,"FT934-2957 _AN-DLJDZAGZFT 931210   FT  10 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Doubts surround Indian oil expansion - Fears are growing about excess capacity      By SHIRAZ SIDHVA   India is planning a USDollars 30bn expansion of its oil refining and petrochemicals industries as part of its wide-ranging programme to modernise its economy. Undaunted by the recession in world oil and oil-product markets, the Indian government and private companies are planning to invest Rs500bn (Dollars 16bn) in existing and new refineries, to add 63m tonnes of capacity to the country's current total of 52m tonnes. They also plan to spend Rs240bn on nine new petrochemical ventures and double output of petrochemicals products to about 6.3m tonnes a year by the late 1990s. The total proposed outlay is greater than for any other sector except power. Most of the investment will be funded by Indian money. Mr Anil Ambani of Reliance Industries, a petrochemicals and textiles group, which is the first company in the private sector to obtain government approval to build a grassroots refinery, says 'the government will not be able to wave a magic wand and change the industry overnight, but at least they have started moving in the right direction'. The government believes the investments will help ease India's critical shortage of home-grown energy as well as greatly increasing supplies of oil-based industrial raw materials such as feedstocks for plastics and artificial fibres. But critics believe that if a substantial number of projects go ahead India could be saddled with expensive excess capacity in industries that already have plenty of capacity world-wide. They point out that oil-based industries are protected by stiff import duties and benefit from high government-controlled prices, without which the projects could be unviable. 'There's every likelihood there will be excess capacity,' admits one senior government official. The surge of private investment is highlighted by the government's recent clearance of Reliance's 9m-tonne, Dollars 3bn refinery project at Jamnagar in Gujarat, which will be the first for 11 years. The government has also cleared five other refinery projects - three in the public sector and two private. The nine new petrochemicals projects include Reliance's Rs40bn (Dollars 1.27bn) natural gas liquid/naphtha project at Hazira, Gujarat, and the state-run Gas Authority of India's Rs35bn project in Auriya, Uttar Pradesh. These plans are a radical departure for India, which until the late 1980s retained tight government control over the industry, partly to promote traditional materials such as wood and clay. The government now regards oil-based products as an essential part of a modern economy and wants to cut imports of petroleum-based materials. Private companies are being called upon to invest because of the shortage of public funds. India's oil fields produce only about a third of its requirements and petroleum topped the country's import list in 1991-92, accounting for Dollars 5.4bn or 27.7 per cent of the total. The country also has a vast potential demand for petroleum products. Per capita energy consumption of 231kg of oil equivalent is less than half of China's and a fifth of the world average. Its annual consumption of plastics at 1kg a head is way below the world average of 16kg. Demand for petroleum products is expected to grow at a rate of 6.9 per cent a year, from 62m tonnes in 1993-94 to 80m tonnes by 1996-97. The euphoria generated by liberalisation may be short-lived, however. Industry watchers say recession, coupled with excess capacity in many countries around the world, has led to a sharp decline in the prices of petrochemicals products. Indian companies, which will have to rely on exports to bolster their profits once domestic demand slackens, will find it difficult to survive in an already overcrowded marketplace. Moreover, new producers may be unable to rely on the high administered prices that the industry currently enjoys. The government is steadily dismantling price controls - last month it liberalised the prices of lubricant oils. The profitability of the planned investments will depend critically on how future price decontrol is managed. Indian producers will also suffer competitive disadvantages on the world market. Finance is scarce and capital costs are high; labour costs are low, admittedly, but refineries and petrochemicals plants are capital- not labour-intensive. In addition, infrastructure like pipelines and ports are inadequate and will have to be expanded, at substantial cost. Electric power is in short supply and tariffs are considerably higher than in other countries. Duties on imported capital equipment add to costs. The industry will face increasing foreign competition from low-cost production centres such as the Middle East and Singapore as import tariffs decrease. The sector will be crippled unless planned duty reductions are carefully co-ordinated with changes in domestic prices for products and inputs like power. Mr Ambani warns that the industry could 'perish overnight' if the government does not take adequate steps to co-ordinate reforms. 'The government will have to reconsider feedstock and energy prices, which are very high, and make it difficult for Indian industry to compete internationally,' he says. Mr KK Mathur, a senior official at the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers, says: 'We have to allow for a certain adjustment process and introduce the reform process in phases. The total impact of the reform measures can only be assessed over a period of time. It is imperative that we do not force the pace'.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

The staking rush at Lac de Gras, 200 miles north of Yellowknife, the NWT capital, now covers 13m acres and has reached Echo Bays' Lupin gold mine and its 17,000-acre mining lease. More test results are expected shortly from a 160-tonne bulk sample extracted from the Dia Met/BHP-Utah property. On May 21 the joint venture of Canada's Dia Met Minerals and Australia's BHP group reported indications of 90 carats of diamonds with 25 per cent potentially of gem quality. Echo Bay held exploration leases just east of the discovery, said Mr Richard Kraus, the company's president, after the annual meeting in Montreal. Also the winter road connecting Yellowknife and the Lupin mine crossed Lac de Gras near the discovery. He said diamond exploration was very expensive and if Echo Bay wanted to explore its claims further 'it would be done with partners'. 'We are helping other companies in the logistics of diamond exploration. I can't say more because we are in registration with a USDollars 100m convertible preferred issue.' Echo Bay's four mines, including Lupin, produced 734,000 troy ounces of gold and 5.6m ounces of silver last year. In the first quarter, it posted a small loss because of low bullion prices but the company said it expected a gradual recovery in the gold price to Dollars 360 to Dollars 375 an ounce by the end of the year. This, together with the new stock issue, would bolster cash flow and enable debt to be reduced from the present Dollars 257m. Mr Kraus said Russian sales had peaked and Asian prosperity was creating excellent fundamentals for gold. Far East fabricated demand, mostly for jewellery, was now three times North America's and world mine output was not growing. Echo Bay has cut manpower by 15 per cent to 1,934 without affecting output. The Lupin mill's capacity will rise 15 per cent to 2,300 tonnes a day next year. Other improvements are coming at the Nevada mines and another mine in Washington State. Two Alaskan properties are ready to move ahead when gold prices improve. Exploration is focussed on the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alaska, Washington State, Nevada and the western Rockies.

Yugoslav oil practically belongs to just  Serbia, as it is produced only in Serbia -- Vojvodina -- so all  products have previously ended up exclusively in Serbia. As the  production in Serbia (in addition to stealing Croatian oil from  Djeletovci) is considered Yugoslav in the federal balance of  energy supply and consumption, the Montenegrins hold that this  Yugoslav production must be divided as such.    ""Montenegro did not get a single drop of oil or any other  energy product from the federal balance of energy supply and  consumption, so the Government of Montenegro has reiterated the  demand for solving the problem, which was presented to the  Federal Executive Council a long time ago,"" said Montenegrin  Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Miodrag Gomilanovic,  Montenegrin minister of power industry, says that the situation  regarding oil and petroleum products threatens to block the  economy and lives since all reserves on all levels have been  exhausted. He added: ""We demand joint criteria for the  distribution of oil -- that is, a priority list. The so-called  first priority group should have the same criteria for consumers  in Serbia and Montenegro.""    Petrol Stations Instead of Pillboxes    It is obvious that the federal Yugoslav balance of energy  supply and consumption exists only on paper and is applied  solely to priority consumers in Serbia following the old saying:  ""Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin."" In other words, all  petroleum products in ""the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]""  are produced by the ""Serbian Oil Industry of Nis"" and it is all  distributed to priority consumers, except for some symbolic  amounts for free sale, by the republic (Serbian) emergency  committee. The so-called federal committee is only informed  about the amount that is to be divided by the Serbian republic  committee. Montenegro, therefore, requested (demanded) the  right to buy a certain percentage of total production on the  basis of former consumption ratio.    And while ""the shirt and the skin"" are not being treated as  equal, Kotor ""Jugopetrol"" published the information according to  which three metric tons of gasoline and eight tons of diesel are  being delivered to the Montenegrin market daily, so that the  present monthly balance of Montenegro amounts to approximately  100 tons of gasoline and 250 tons of diesel. However, priority  consumers need about 300 tons of gasoline and 1,800 tons of  diesel.    The amount needed is acquired on the black market under the  auspices of the state. For example, it is an open secret that,  at the Bozaj border crossing toward Albania, Montenegrin customs  officers charge one dinar per liter of gasoline to truck drivers  whose trucks have additional, so-called expanded fuel tanks.  Indeed, it is only done a couple of days each month, while  ""expanded fuel tanks"" are usually tolerated the rest of the  month. Otherwise, oil and gasoline are most often transported  illegally by water, especially across Lake Skadar, which forms  most of the borderline between Montenegro and Albania. Oil  fever has spread to villages on both sides of the lake. In ""the  land of eagles,"" gas stations are being built along the borders,  replacing the string of pillboxes. Researching those oil roads,  correspondents of the Montenegrin independent weekly MONITOR  found out that about 200 boats cross the imaginary borderline  between Montenegro and Albania every day. The boats are used  for smuggling everything from cigarettes to satellite dishes,  but mostly for oil and gasoline. The profitability of the  entire operation is substantiated by the following data: The  Albanians are paid 0.7 German marks [DM] per liter of oil, which  is later sold for DM1.2 -- the equivalent amount in Avramovic's  dinars. Consequently, the profit is about half a German mark  per liter, but since the state takes 70 percent of that,  black-marketeers are left with about DM30 (dinars) per barrel.  (It has become customary in these transactions to use standard  ""Skadar barrels,"" which contain 210 liters each.) In this case,  a recently founded firm ""Transport"" of Podgorica presents a kind  of authority, according to MONITOR, as it issues permits for  black-marketing on behalf of the Government of Montenegro. Just  as every other official document, that permit has serial number,  name, surname, and photograph of the person to which it is  issued. Black-marketeers point out that, on the arrival to the  Montenegrin side of the lake, they can only deliver oil to  certain authorized persons, otherwise the permit ""is gone."" The  permit means so much, among other reasons, because its holders  enjoy the protection of both the police and the army.    The busiest spot on the Montenegrin side of Lake Skadar is  at the ""Plavnica"" motel. The former favorite weekend resort of  Podgorica inhabitants, which, in the past couple of years, has  been more frequently closed than open, has taken on a new life  thanks to oil. The motel was leased for DM1,200 per month. The  lessee rigged up a wharf and every cistern's approach to the  so-called loading pad is charged DM200. Motel ""Plavnica"" also  has an entertainment program featuring Russian strippers. As  many as 10 cisterns with Serb and Bosnian license plates are  filled up here every day. Some of them belong to a Belgrade  firm ""Pizon,"" whose owner is famous former soccer player for  ""Zvezda"" [Belgrade soccer team] Vladimir Petrovic Pizon. Oil is  being smuggled on the Bojana River, which connects Lake Skadar  with the sea, as well as in Ulcinj, by means of a specially  designed raft cistern that is towed by boat along the sea border  between Montenegro and Albania.    Plastic Tube at the Bottom of the Bojana    However, the oil warehouse at Plavnica has recently burned  down. Some five acres of land was burned then, two cisterns,  several hundred tons of oil, a dozen cars, and two tractors were  destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Soon after  that, the Albanian police, in collaboration with the World  Organization of Customs Officers, discovered a plastic tube at  the bottom of the Bojana River that was used to carry oil from  Albania to Montenegro. The Ulcinj connection was also  ""unearthed."" All those events, just as the recent confiscation  of a tanker transporting oil for Montenegro, which was  redirected to Brindisi by NATO and Western European Union  forces, indicate that the ""Skadar connection"" is slowly running  dry. Among others, the Albanian police have also been  instructed by the international community and organizations that  supervise the embargo imposed on ""the FRY"" to cover the entire  area of Skadar and prevent further black-marketing of oil. It  is an open secret that Montenegrin and Albanian black-marketeers  have easily found a common ground in the business, and we must  point out that every black-marketeer caught on the Albanian side  had to pay a fine of DM10.    Those relations were soon strained as a result of the  mentioned haggling over the federal balance of energy supply and  consumption between Serbia and Montenegro, and there is no doubt  that Montenegro will be getting the worst of it for a while.  And so, the Belgrade economic circles will again start working  on ""dividing Yugoslav petroleum products from Serbia,"" but  according to the already known principle. In other words,  Montenegro should offer a certain amount of money to be used for  research and production ""of the very Yugoslav oil in Vojvodina.""  The thesis says that at least one part of the Montenegrin  tourist pie will have to end up in the oil fields of Vojvodina,  for it is senseless to demand federal rights without accepting  federal obligations. Alleged equal status of Montenegro in the  joint federal state is, therefore, still an ideal and the cry of  Milo Djukanovic, one of the architects of ""Zabljak Yugoslavia,""  [the meeting in Zabljak was held to confirm the preservation of  Yugoslavia] does indeed seem grotesque. Oil problems are just  the tip of the iceberg of the ""joint"" economy. The Serbian idea  of a joint market is described by the case of importing 50,000  tons of salt for the needs of Serbia. Meanwhile, there are more  than 35,000 of tons of salt at the Ulcinj salt-works, so the  amount of unsold salt threatens to have serious repercussions on  the harvest this year.... In a nutshell, Montenegro is  suffocating more and more every day.     "

If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. However, regulatory alternatives that would alleviate the potential impact of the proposed standards on directly affected companies were not selected because the CAA requires all facilities that are members of a category or subcategory of major sources to meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the MACT floor.     For the affected industry sectors, the Small Business Administration's definition of small business is independently owned companies with less than 100 employees. The proposed standards directly impact small companies owning gasoline bulk terminals and pipeline breakout stations. Due to downstream wholesale gasoline price increases, the proposed standards would indirectly impact small companies owning gasoline bulk plants and gasoline service stations.     A definitive estimate of the number of small businesses that would be directly and indirectly affected by the proposed standards could not be feasibly obtained because of the lack of data related to the extent of vertical integration in the gasoline distribution chain. However, the EPA believes that a maximum of 56 percent of all gasoline bulk terminals are owned by small companies. Potentially, up to 99 percent of the indirectly affected gasoline bulk plants and service stations are owned by small companies. The percentage of actual small companies in these sectors, especially the gasoline bulk terminal sector, is projected to be much smaller due to vertical integration with petroleum refiners. No estimate has been made of the percentage of pipeline breakout stations owned by small companies, but since they are typically affiliated with petroleum refiners, the percentage is projected to be small.     A preliminary assessment indicates that the proposed regulations would not result in financial impacts that would significantly or differentially stress affected small companies. The compliance costs for all but the smallest throughput facilities in directly affected industry segments are a minute fraction of production costs and revenues. Even so, the per unit compliance cost differential between large throughput and small throughput facilities are minor. Small facilities are likely to be serving small or specialized markets, which makes it unlikely that the differential in unit control costs between large throughput and small throughput facilities will seriously affect the competitive position of small companies, even assuming that small companies own small facilities.

If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. However, regulatory alternatives that would alleviate the potential impact of the proposed standards on directly affected companies were not selected because the CAA requires all facilities that are members of a category or subcategory of major sources to meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the MACT floor.     For the affected industry sectors, the Small Business Administration's definition of small business is independently owned companies with less than 100 employees.

Alan Stern, representative of the  administration, told ITAR-TASS by telephone that this project,  dubbed ""fire and ice"", was now being discussed at top level in  the United States and Russia.    According to Stern, the idea of enlisting Russian scientists  and experts in the programme for the exploration of Pluto, the  only planet of the solar system that has still not been reached  by automatic probes, is explained by NASA's current financial  straits. According to expert calculations, the cost of launching  two space probes by means of the most powerful American ""Titan""  carrier-rockets, would by far exceed one billion dollars. This  made the Americans think seriously about the possibility of  launching the Pluto probes by means of the Russian ""Proton""  carrier-rocket.    However, Stern said that NASA's policy towards international  scientific missions is that every side involved in them should  make its own contribution, not merely provide its technology or  render paid services. The Russians, he noted, did not like the  idea of exchanging their Proton rocket for the right to instal  on board the American probe its instrument, weighing not more  than two kilograms, and to paste a label with a Russian symbol  on the external surface of the probe. The Space Research  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences moved to ""add"" a  Russian jettisonable sonde to each of the two American probes.  They are to be released from the probes approximately 40,000  kilometres from Pluto and to descend: one on the surface of the  planet and the other -- on Pluto's natural satellite Haron. The  sondes are to carry either equipment for measuring the  composition of Pluto's atmosphere or photo- and cine- cameras.    NASA has still not decided what American equipment will be  installed on board the probes, but experts of the Pasadena Jet  Propulsion Laboratory in California, who specialise in long-term  projects for the exploration of planets of the solar system,  move to install only four instruments.    Pluto is the most distant known planet from the sun. It was  discovered 62 years ago. Its period of revolution around the  sun is 250.6 years. The composition of the planet's atmosphere  is unknown. Welsy Huntress, chief of the NASA department for  studying the solar system, is sure that the Pluto fight  programme should be among the first on the list of scientific  priorities. NASA believes that it is inexpedient to further put  off its elaboration. In order to direct a probe towards Pluto  it is necessary to use Jupiter's gravitational field to boost  it. This will be possible only if the space vehicle is launched  in the period between 2001 and 2003.    The solar project also stipulates the launching of an  American probe, which would split in two upon approaching the  sun: into a Russian part carrying an optical telescope, and an  American part -- with instruments to study the physics of the  plasma on board.

0,FT911-2029 ,"FT911-2029 _AN-BEBBRABIFT 910502   FT  02 MAY 91 / Shell in big Gulf of Mexico find      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   SHELL OIL, the US arm of the multinational Royal Dutch/Shell group, announced an important oil discovery yesterday in the Gulf of Mexico which could contain as much as 1bn barrels of oil. The discovery is the biggest made in the US for 20 years, opening up the potential of the Gulf region which the industry believes could become another North Sea. The Mars discovery is at a depth of 3,100 feet which will make it one of the deepest commercially-viable oilfields in the world if the decision is taken to develop it. The only other field of this depth under development is Shell's Auger operation nearby. Shell said that further engineering studies are required before it can estimate the full size of the find, but industry observers believe it to rank among the world's 'giant' finds which contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. The largest oilfield in the UK's sector of the North Sea is the Forties field which is estimated to contain 2.5bn barrels. Oil could come into production at Shell's Mars discovery within five years of starting development, the company said yesterday. British Petroleum has a one-third interest in the Mars field and the company said it was 'potentially the biggest prospect in which the company has participated since the discovery of its major North Sea fields'. Mr John Browne, head of exploration at BP, said the find 'obviously has great significance for the industry because it is the first time an operator has announced a discovery at these depths'. The depth of the water in the Gulf of Mexico - North Sea fields are 600 to 700 feet deep - makes it a more complicated and expensive discovery to develop, requiring the latest oilfield technology. One industry expert estimates that costs could be double those of the North Sea where it costs about Dollars 3.40 to produce a barrel of oil. But tax rates on oil revenue in the US are much lower than those in the UK and the discoveries will be more profitable. The development of deep-sea technology to exploit these oil finds has implications for the so-called 'frontier' area of the North Sea, west of Shetland, where exploration could begin in several years time.

0,FT944-8975 ,"FT944-8975 _AN-EKQEIAE0FT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / British Gas to lift domestic prices: Lower than expected losses in the third quarter please as restructuring speeds up ahead of market competition      By ROBERT CORZINE and DEBORAH HARGREAVES   British Gas is expected to announce its first price increases for domestic customers since 1991 today, in line with the current rate of inflation. The company is also expected to increase standing charges which have not gone up since 1990. The move came after the company yesterday turned in a better than expected third-quarter performance as its corporate restructuring programme gathered pace. The third-quarter after-tax loss of Pounds 164m on an historical cost basis was well below the Pounds 180m-Pounds 240m range predicted by analysts. It was also well below last year's third-quarter loss of Pounds 225m. British Gas usually reports a loss in the third quarter, the period of lowest demand for natural gas in its main UK market. The price rises are likely to provoke some controversy after the government yesterday signalled the introduction of legislation to open up the household market to competition by 1998. British Gas has often warned that the removal of its monopoly of supply to 18m households could lead to higher prices for some customers. The new price package is expected to include a system of discounts for customers who pay by direct debit. These form the most profitable part of British Gas's domestic business. Mr Richard Giordano, British Gas's chairman, recently said he hoped to double the 3m users paying by direct debit. He said the massive corporate restructuring exercise to prepare the company for competition was ahead of schedule. About 7,000 jobs were eliminated in the first nine months this year, he said. A total of 25,000 jobs will be shed over the next few years. He said growing competition in those markets already liberalised and regulatory pressures continued to hamper earnings. But the results so far this year have benefited from colder weather and a drop in interest charges. Operating profits for the nine months were Pounds 897m (Pounds 845m) on turnover of Pounds 7.06bn (Pounds 7.08bn). UK gas supply profits rose to Pounds 594m (Pounds 515m). The sale earlier this year of Bow Valley, the Canadian oil and gas exploration and production company, helped cut the nine-month net interest charge by Pounds 70m to Pounds 197m. The disposal of Bow Valley contributed to the fall of turnover in the exploration and production division from Pounds 771m to Pounds 742m. But operating profits of Pounds 143m (Pounds 146m) were hit only slightly. Analysts said this reflected the relatively high cost of Bow Valley's production. The division's remaining assets in the division were lower cost and therefore more profitable. Attributable profits for the nine months were Pounds 466m (Pounds 409m). Earnings per share were 10.7p (9.5p). Lex, Page 22   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4923 Gas Transmission and Distribution.

The extensive attention being given to the proposal, which primarily would  affect new offshore oil platforms, provides another strong indication that the  task force will urge the government to reaffirm its plans for further drilling  off the Southern California coast.    A decision to tighten pollution-control regulations for such rigs could help  minimize opposition to any offshore drilling recommended by the task force.      Signal a Victory for AQMD    It also would signal a victory for the South Coast Air Quality Management  District and other governmental units, which have sought to wrest control over  offshore emissions from the less-restrictive Interior Department.    If issued in conjunction with an endorsement of new oil exploration, however,  it would fall short of the outright moratorium advocated by anti-drilling  forces.    ""Making offshore rigs subject to local rules would simply indicate that they  got a firm grasp on the obvious,"" said Leslie Gainer, a spokesman for the  environmentalist American Oceans Campaign. ""What they need to do is set aside  areas for permanent protection (from) leasing.""    A task force progress report, a copy of which was obtained by The Times, makes  no formal recommendations and simply describes the pollution-control plan as  one of several options under consideration as ways to reduce the environmental  consequences of any new drilling.    But Administration officials said the proposal is under serious consideration  and indicated that it is likely to be adopted as part of the panel's  recommendations in a final report to President Bush at the end of the year.    Because most existing offshore oil rigs in the Los Angeles area are located in  waters already subject to local control, the plan would be of great  significance only if new drilling were to proceed in additional areas  controlled by the federal government.    In that case, an AQMD official said Thursday, emissions from new drilling  platforms off Southern California could spew more than 16 tons of  smog-producing pollutants into the atmosphere each day by early in the next  century unless the air quality board gains regulatory authority.    The Administration panel, chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was  directed to determine whether the government should proceed with its  controversial drilling plans off Southern California and in other areas off  Northern California and south Florida.      Progress Report    Its progress report, which is to be published in the Federal Register today,  states that the panel is still considering all options presented to it. They  range from imposing a permanent ban on oil exploration in the areas to allowing  the Interior Department to proceed unhindered with its drilling plans.    Most of the document, however, is devoted to discussion of measures that would  allow oil exploration to proceed, albeit with more stringent controls than now  exist. Some of the plans mentioned would prohibit drilling in certain areas,  but most would add new regulations designed to protect the environment.    In discussing the Southern California area, officials said, the task force has  devoted the bulk of its time to options designed to minimize air pollution  caused by new drilling in the region.    ""I don't think there's any question that air quality is the primary issue in  the public mind,"" said Richard Glynn, the panel's deputy executive director.    A task force decision to recommend new drilling in Southern California would  come as little surprise to anti-drilling activists, who have charged that the  panel is predisposed to favor oil exploration. In addition, many have  acknowledged that the proposed Southern California offshore exploration area is  the least environmentally sensitive of those under scrutiny.      Approval Uncertain    Whether the pollution-control plan is ultimately approved could depend largely  on the efforts of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which  currently regulates emissions from oil rigs drilling in the Outer Continental  Shelf.    Seeking to maintain that control, the agency earlier this year proposed  tightening its own regulations. But even that effort has come under fire from  local officials, who contend that the measures remain inadequate.    Another potential stumbling block could arise in late October, when the  National Academy of Sciences provides the panel with an advisory report on oil  exploration. If the scientific body raises strong objections to further  drilling, the task force could be forced to reconsider its recommendations.    A South Coast AQMD official reaffirmed Thursday that the district would like  the authority to control oil rig emissions if Bush proceeds with proposals to  drill off the Southern California coast.    ""We believe that we need to have stringent controls over offshore platforms,""  said spokesman Bill Kelly. ""One of our concerns is how do we get those  stringent controls in place when we don't have authority to do it?""      Small Contributors    The emissions from oil rigs would be only a small fraction of the 7,700 tons of  pollutants spewed into the Los Angeles Basin each day by cars, industries,  airplanes and other sources. But most pollution sources are by themselves  relatively small contributors.    ""It's a small amount, but the problem is that everywhere we look, the amounts  are small with the exception of the car,"" Kelly said. ""It's important that we  get the reductions wherever we can. If we have the technology to reduce  pollution, we need to put it in place, and for offshore oil drilling, there is  the technology.""    Proposed oil drilling lease sales for Southern California call for about 10 to  15 drilling platforms with 30 to 40 wells each, Kelly said.

In that case, an AQMD official said Thursday, emissions from new drilling  platforms off Southern California could spew more than 16 tons of  smog-producing pollutants into the atmosphere each day by early in the next  century unless the air quality board gains regulatory authority.    The Administration panel, chaired by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr., was  directed to determine whether the government should proceed with its  controversial drilling plans off Southern California and in other areas off  Northern California and south Florida.      Progress Report    Its progress report, which is to be published in the Federal Register today,  states that the panel is still considering all options presented to it. They  range from imposing a permanent ban on oil exploration in the areas to allowing  the Interior Department to proceed unhindered with its drilling plans.    Most of the document, however, is devoted to discussion of measures that would  allow oil exploration to proceed, albeit with more stringent controls than now  exist. Some of the plans mentioned would prohibit drilling in certain areas,  but most would add new regulations designed to protect the environment.    In discussing the Southern California area, officials said, the task force has  devoted the bulk of its time to options designed to minimize air pollution  caused by new drilling in the region.    ""I don't think there's any question that air quality is the primary issue in  the public mind,"" said Richard Glynn, the panel's deputy executive director.    A task force decision to recommend new drilling in Southern California would  come as little surprise to anti-drilling activists, who have charged that the  panel is predisposed to favor oil exploration. In addition, many have  acknowledged that the proposed Southern California offshore exploration area is  the least environmentally sensitive of those under scrutiny.      Approval Uncertain    Whether the pollution-control plan is ultimately approved could depend largely  on the efforts of the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, which  currently regulates emissions from oil rigs drilling in the Outer Continental  Shelf.    Seeking to maintain that control, the agency earlier this year proposed  tightening its own regulations. But even that effort has come under fire from  local officials, who contend that the measures remain inadequate.    Another potential stumbling block could arise in late October, when the  National Academy of Sciences provides the panel with an advisory report on oil  exploration. If the scientific body raises strong objections to further  drilling, the task force could be forced to reconsider its recommendations.    A South Coast AQMD official reaffirmed Thursday that the district would like  the authority to control oil rig emissions if Bush proceeds with proposals to  drill off the Southern California coast.    ""We believe that we need to have stringent controls over offshore platforms,""  said spokesman Bill Kelly. ""One of our concerns is how do we get those  stringent controls in place when we don't have authority to do it?""      Small Contributors    The emissions from oil rigs would be only a small fraction of the 7,700 tons of  pollutants spewed into the Los Angeles Basin each day by cars, industries,  airplanes and other sources. But most pollution sources are by themselves  relatively small contributors.    ""It's a small amount, but the problem is that everywhere we look, the amounts  are small with the exception of the car,"" Kelly said. ""It's important that we  get the reductions wherever we can. If we have the technology to reduce  pollution, we need to put it in place, and for offshore oil drilling, there is  the technology.""    Proposed oil drilling lease sales for Southern California call for about 10 to  15 drilling platforms with 30 to 40 wells each, Kelly said.

Hurd said: ""We could possibly  agree on broad cooperation"" on the oil exploration the Kelpers  want to initiate by the end of the year in the waters  surrounding the Malvinas Islands. British sources told CLARIN on  12 March that Hurd made this remark to Di Tella during a meeting  last week in London.    As CLARIN already announced, this definition will be the new  basis for the position the British will champion late this month  or in early April when negotiations attempting to achieve some  form of cooperation on the oil issue will be resumed.  Negotiations have been suspended since late 1992, when the  United Kingdom unilaterally decided to initiate seismic  prospecting work in the sea bed surrounding the Malvinas Islands  despite Argentine protests.    Initially, Hurd talked about cooperation alone, which  ideally  represented exchanging information. British sources announced  that, in diplomatic parlance, however, this new definition means  that London ""is willing to accept the participation of Argentine  companies in the exploration effort and the replenishment and  repair of oil platforms in Argentine ports."" A similar message  was conveyed by the British ambassador in Buenos Aires, Peter  Hall, to Vice Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella during a  meeting they held on 7 March to discuss the crisis in Yugoslavia.    Nevertheless, this is not the final British position. Hurd  will travel on 9 April to the Malvinas Islands for consultations  with the islanders -- who refuse to restore communications with  Argentina -- before initiating negotiations with Buenos Aires.  The Malvinas Islands' residents only are willing to cooperate  with Argentina ""if necessary"" and are moving ahead -- full steam  -- with their preparations: They already have received a Royal  Geological Service report recommending where to drill in order  to determine the existence of oil and establishing the required  legal or tax framework.    Incidentally, this is one of the most difficult points for  negotiations that demonstrates that both oil and fishing are  closely linked to the sovereignty conflict. Argentina wants to  collect part of the taxes that will be charged to the oil  companies, but the United Kingdom rejects this possibility, even  though it is not yet known with complete certainty if there is  oil.    Florencio Acenolaza, the Chamber of Deputies Foreign  Relations Committee chairman and a geologist by profession,  recently noted in a communique that there is no oil in the  Malvinas Islands' submarine shelf.    YPF [Government Oil Deposits] President Jose Estenssoro  quickly went to the Foreign Ministry to make it clear that  Acenolaza based himself ""on outdated information"" and that YPF  is studying one of the two seismic surveys carried out in the  Malvinas Islands last year. Official sources confirmed to  CLARIN that the survey was purchased through a YPF subsidiary.  The report is confidential because it is a commercial secret.    Nevertheless, the existence of hydrocarbons will not be  proven until the sea bed is drilled, despite the positive  seismic reports. The basins may be empty, with more gas than oil  or with little oil, which would make the business unprofitable.     "

0,FT923-15402 ,"FT923-15402 _AN-CGBA7ADFFT 920702   FT  02 JUL 92 / Lowering the oil flag: The Venezuelan search is on for foreign partners in the production of crude      By JOE MANN   VENEZUELA'S decision to allow private companies to produce oil from a series of inactive fields is not only an important break with the past but also the first concrete example of private capital investment in the oil production sector since the country's petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976. Mr Alirio Parra, energy and mines minister, announced on June 19 that Royal Dutch/Shell and smaller companies from Japan, the US and Venezuela would invest Dollars 720m (Pounds 390m) over the next 10 years to produce crude from five groups of inactive fields. The private companies are assuming the entire financial risk - no oil, no return. How much they earn will depend solely on the volume of oil produced because even though they are spending money on production infrastructure, they will not own the crude. All output will be turned over to subsidiaries of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA. Shell's return to Venezuela as an investor in the oil sector is not without irony. When all private oil companies were nationalised 16 years ago, Shell's operation was second only to Exxon's. Both companies had to wait more than a decade for their claims to be settled with the government. It was President Carlos Andres Perez, waving the banner of nationalism, who ordered the state takeover of foreign oil companies during his previous term in office. Now, he is supporting PDVSA efforts to open petroleum sectors such as exploration, production and refining to foreign capital. However, while Venezuela is only encouraging foreign capital in its oil industry, the state company has invested well over Dollars 1bn since 1983 to purchase full or part-ownership in oil refining and distribution systems in Europe and the US. The agreements covering the inactive fields, due for signature this month, are what PDVSA executives hope will be the first in a series of new investments by international oil companies. Private concerns have invested for many years in Venezuelan petrochemicals; large sums are flowing into the sector. But petroleum and natural gas have been out of bounds until now. In late 1990, PDVSA announced a large natural gas liquefaction project in eastern Venezuela, in partnership with Exxon, Mitsubishi and Shell. Studies of the Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn project are continuing, but no large investments have yet been made, and its fate hangs on natural gas prices worldwide. Venezuelans are keen to sell their liquefied natural gas in the US. Since Mr Perez took office for the second time in early 1989, PDVSA has also been encouraging other joint ventures with international oil companies in a variety of areas, including exploration, production and refining. The state company has the world's largest proven reserves of heavy and extra-heavy petroleum, and is stressing what it calls 'strategic associations' with international companies to produce and refine heavy oil. Despite Venezuela's strong interest in heavy oil, foreign companies consider it uneconomical while there are abundant light and medium-grade crudes available from the Middle East. PDVSA is in the midst of a multi-billion dollar capital investment programme which must be funded not only by internal cash flow, but also by export credits, loans and equity from abroad. Mr Perez and many other former proponents of a fully-national industry have understood the need for foreign capital and loans if PDVSA is to grow and remain competitive. The company today remains well managed and profitable. The political instability resulting from an unsuccessful military uprising last February has not affected operations so far. However, its capital investment needs are being squeezed by lower than expected oil prices and a high tax bite (82 per cent of operating profits) by a government addicted to petroleum revenues. Last year, taxes on PDVSA provided the central government with more than 70 per cent of total revenues. To cope with its capital shortage, PDVSA has reduced investment this year and delayed or prolonged some large projects. The company also is seeking funds on international capital markets. A subsidiary, Corpoven, recently gave a mandate to CS First Boston to raise Dollars 300m to finance the expansion of a natural gas plant. This year, two US banks tried to raise money for PDVSA, but company officials said they decided the placements would be too costly and the efforts were dropped. News reports of popular protests, demands for the resignation of Mr Perez and other symptoms of political instability have affected investors' perceptions. PDVSA has external debts of Dollars 2.16bn and loans from Venezuelan banks totalling around Dollars 923m. The company will need borrowed money to finance most of its investment programme this year and next. Capital outlays last year were Dollars 3.7bn. Before the cuts, this year's figure was projected at well over Dollars 4bn.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

As BP, Shell, Lasmo, Clyde, British Gas and other western oil groups yesterday completed staff evacuation from Sanaa in the north and Aden in the south, executives at many company headquarters said that, whatever the outcome of the fighting, there was a growing disillusionment about oil prospects in the country. A large number of foreign countries entered into exploration contracts with Yemen after its unification in 1990. Optimism peaked two years ago, when more than 20 companies rushed to conclude exploration deals. These were mostly in the south, after Canadian Occidental discovered viable fields in the Masila area, the north-west corner of former South Yemen. CanOxy says it is now pumping 150,000 barrels a day from the area, production which the company says will continue despite evacuation of its staff. CanOxy's find followed the discoveries in the mid-1980s by Hunt Oil, the Dallas-based group, in North Yemen. Yemen Hunt Oil produces most of the rest of Yemen's present output, about 320,000 b/d. It has also said production is continuing. Despite heady predictions from the government and some analysts that Yemen might eventually be capable of producing 1m or even 2m b/d, Yemen's rugged south has failed to deliver its apparent promise. 'There's been a very significant spate of drilling,' says the head of one western oil group active there. 'But the results have been singularly disappointing.' Another oil company managing director said the war might prompt many disappointed companies to pull out: 'It's now likely, particularly with this setback, that Yemen will be left only with Hunt and CanOxy.' At least two companies, who declioned to be named, said yesterday they expected to close their operations before the end of this year, given their disappointing results and the country's heightened political instability. CanOxy, which is continuing to explore around Masila, has already scaled down any expectations of further big finds. Shell, which has completed drilling in its concession, would say only that it would 'need to look at where we go from here'. Clyde, the UK-based oil company, said yesterday it had received 'some encouragement' from early drilling in its Masila concession and had no intention of leaving. Nevertheless, diminished prospects for Yemeni oil are a serious blow to whatever political arrangement arises from the fighting in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest and most populous land. It perhaps most seriously undermines the economic hand of Mr Ali Salem al-Beidh, the embattled southern leader, who would have depended heavily on oil to support any form of greater economic independence for the south. Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday sacked Prime Minister Haidar Abu Bakr al-Attas and named a new defence minister in further measures against rival southern members in Yemen's cabinet, Reuter adds from Sanaa. Mr Saleh named Mohammad al-Attar, industry minister, as acting prime minister and Brig Abed Rabu Hadi as defence minister.   Companies:-  Canadian Occidental Petroleum.     Hunt Oil.

0,FT943-16236 ,"FT943-16236 _AN-EGFD2AHKFT 940705   FT  05 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Canada seeks to widen business ties with Cuba      By BERNARD SIMON      TORONTO   Canada's business presence in Cuba has been given a boost by a flurry of commercial and political initiatives in recent weeks. The announcement late last month that Canada was easing a 16-year aid embargo, imposed in protest at Cuba's involvement in the Angolan civil war, is expected to speed the growing involvement of Canadian non-governmental organisations and universities in Cuba. Two Canadian universities for instance, have set up English-language training courses for Cubans. Ottawa has never joined Washington in imposing trade sanctions against Cuba. Air Canada, for example, has maintained a regular service to Havana, and Canadians have been among the largest groups of foreign tourists visiting Cuba. Two-way trade totalled CDollars 311m (Dollars 224m) last year. The Canadian business presence in Cuba is centred on mining, oil and gas exploration and tourism. Joutel Resources of Toronto last year became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Last month, Sherritt, a Canadian nickel and cobalt producer, unveiled plans for a joint venture with Compania General de Niquel which will include mining and ore processing facilities in Cuba, and a refinery in Alberta. In addition, Canadian hotel operators have signed management contracts with more than half a dozen Cuban hotels. Companies will also benefit by being able to draw on funds from the Canadian International Development Agency (Cida) for feasibility studies. Canadian investors and joint-venture partners have generally found a warm welcome in Cuba. Dr Jim Henderson, a member of the Ontario provincial legislature who has taken a close interest in Cuba, says that 'the wheels can turn very quickly, provided it's a kind of business that Cuba has decided it wants.' The recent shift in Ottawa's policy towards Cuba are unlikely to have a profound impact either on Cuba's tottering economy or its relations with the outside world. However, they highlight a clear division between the US and some of its allies on the best way of halting the deterioration in social and economic conditions in the country. The Clinton administration has continued to apply, though without great enthusiasm, the comprehensive embargo imposed 30 years ago. Calls from the US business community, especially hotel operators, to ease the curbs have been offset by pressure from the large Cuban community in the US to maintain them. Ottawa however, has come to the conclusion that continued isolation carries risks of its own. Its new policy is based on a view that industrial countries need to become more involved to alleviate the island's economic and social problems before they lead to an explosion. Ms Christine Stewart, a junior foreign affairs minister, told an Organisation of American States meeting in Brazil earlier this month that 'the isolation of Cuba is unhealthy, and it's within all of our interests to support change in Cuba that is positive and healthy.' The Clinton administration has taken an interest in the recent initiatives by Ottawa, but is said to have neither encouraged nor discouraged them.   Countries:-  CAZ  Canada.

OIL COMPANIES  ALSO WOULD PROVIDE A LINE OF CREDIT TO DEAL WITH SPILLS.      By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SACRAMENTO      Warned that a catastrophic tanker spill off the California coast is an eventual  certainty, the Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to tax oil companies  $150 million to establish a cleanup fund.    In addition, petroleum companies would be required to provide the state with  ""unlimited"" loans to help finance the high costs of containing and mopping up  offshore spills, if necessary.    The bill sailed to the Assembly on a 34-3 vote. The Assembly already has passed  a similar but less stringent bill of its own.    After further negotiations between the oil industry, environmentalists and  others, a final version of the bill likely will be written by a two-house  conference committee and forwarded to Gov.

0,FT932-16884 ,"FT932-16884 _AN-DDDAIAA5FT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / Clinton waters down energy tax      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   THE Clinton administration has altered its plans for a new energy tax, bowing to pressure from influential members of Congress for modifications that would ease the tax's impact on their constituents. The revised tax will still be levied in general at a rate of 25.7 cents per million British thermal units, with a surcharge of 34.2 cents per million BTUs on refined petroleum products. But the Treasury's new proposals for the tax would exempt ethanol and methanol, offering a sop to congressmen from agricultural states who have complained that the Clinton budget would hurt farmers more than other groups. It also exempts home heating oil from the surcharge levied on petroleum products, a concession to senators from the New England region, which is a heavy consumer of heating oil. One other exemption would be bunker and jet fuel used in international transportation, a measure that will save money for US airlines, which complain that they are already on the brink of financial catastrophe without an additional cost. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury Secretary, said the administration's aim was that the tax should be 'borne fairly and equitably across the country and that the tax promote conservation as well as increased reliance on domestic energy, not foreign oil.' To achieve this goal, he said, the administration was exploring ways of making sure that companies would be able to pass the cost of the new tax on to the final consumer. Treasury officials said the changes to the structure of the tax should not greatly affect the revenue it will raise, estimated at Dollars 71bn over five years. While the changes will make the tax more palatable to many members of Congress, some supporters of President Bill Clinton's package worry that they represent yet another fissure in the relatively unified front the Democrats have so far managed to present. President Clinton asked Congress, when he presented the plan, to treat it as a whole, and not pick away at individual elements. While the House of Representatives has largely taken him at his word on this, in the Senate several Democrats have whittled away at components of the plan. This week, the president had to give way on proposals to charge market rates for grazing and mining rights on federal land, after opposition from western senators. Mr Clinton is particularly vulnerable in the Senate, where the Republicans are presenting a solid show of hostility to his proposals. They have enough votes at least to hold up consideration of legislation, and need only a handful of Democratic defectors to inflict a defeat on the president. Although the White House was able to win passage earlier this week for a budget resolution containing the broad outlines of Mr Clinton's taxation and spending proposals, it has been unable to prevail against Republican tactics to block the Dollars 16bn stimulus spending package that the president insists is needed to prevent the economic recovery from stalling. Democratic congressional leaders are now threatening to keep Congress in session through the traditional Easter recess in an effort to make the Republicans back down.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman  said the zone on the Vietnamese continental shelf should be  transferred to the disputed Spratly island chain, adding that an  exploration contract Vietnam has signed with the Mobil oil  company was ""illegal.""    ""The Blue Dragon sea area belongs to the adjacent waters of  the Nansha islands,"" he said, using the Chinese name for the  Spratlys -- claimed in whole or in part by Vietnam, China,  Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and the Philippines. His statement was  the clearest claim of sovereignty over this region yet made by  the Chinese. They have not made any protests over the search  for oil in the Great Bear (Dai Hung) field being carried out by  several companies for the Vietnamese government. The state-run  PetroVietnam oil company is working with Mobil on exploring the  Blue Dragon (Than Long) field, which the Vietnamese government  claims is not part of the Spratlys.    China's latest claim will further complicate the  international bargaining for control of the archipelago. The  hundreds of isles, atolls and sea rocks in the Spratlys are in  one of the busiest sea lanes in the world. All vessels going  from Japan to the Middle East and Europe pass by.    But the enormous riches waiting to be exploited under the  seabed are at the centre of growing diplomatic sabre rattling.  Vietnam, which has a presence on around 20 of the atolls, last  week launched a veiled warning about Beijing's intentions in the  South China Sea. The government called for measures to ease  tensions and ""avoid complicating the situation and without  resorting to force or threats of force."" A diplomat in Beijing  said ""the Chinese have never hidden their ambitions in the  region and now they are pushing even further to keep Vietnam out  of what they consider to be a `Chinese lake.'""    The Chinese have given exploration rights in a  25,000-kilometre (10,000-square mile) zone west of the Spratlys  to a U.S. firm, Crestone Energy Corp. The zone is only 250  kilometres (160 miles) from the Vietnamese coast, but Crestone  say they have been promised Chinese naval protection. Hanoi has  in turn claimed that the Crestone deal is illegal because the  zone is on the Vietnamese continental shelf. ""Beijing seems to  be attempting to set a frontier that Hanoi can only cross at the  risk of a naval clash like in 1988,"" said the diplomat. Three  Vietnamese vessels were sunk and 76 sailors killed during a  brief clash with the Chinese navy in 1988.    Though Sino-Vietnamese relations were normalised in 1991,  their territorial dispute remains outstanding. China has  strengthened its presence in the South China Sea and has  launched a modernisation programme aimed at making its navy one  of the world's most powerful by the next century. The air force  now has Russian Su-27 long-range bombers and are building an air  base on the Paracels islands -- another South China Sea  archipelago claimed by China and Vietnam. Vietnam's navy was not  strong enough to dispute the 1988 conflict and according to  military experts has weakened further since.     "

Its  repetitious mechanical movement and the dull, muffled noise of  the drilling tires the eyes and wearies the ears. The metal  tower that rises 70 meters into the air, the height of an  18-story building, stands solemn and stable despite the  accompanying internal movement. The nearby cane fields waiting  to be cut give the Pina oil deposit, which is located in the  neighborhood of the Ciro Redondo Sugar Mill in Ciego de Avila, a  distinctive appearance.    This deposit is not among the largest, but it is regarded by  the experts as the most productive, and that which yields the  product of the best quality. It belongs to the Majagua Petroleum  Drilling and Extracting Unit (Central Basin) and was discovered  in 1990. As of that year, the national strategy called for  giving priority to exploratory studies at this site. There are  now 42 drilled wells in Pina, and 32 of them are being exploited.    Hope can also be dressed in black.    Three drilling teams and a testing brigade work eight-hour  shifts. They do rotary drilling for 10 days and testing and  extraction for another 12 days, and then they have 240 hours  free. Each crew is equipped with a complete trailer complex  providing a dining room, kitchen, bathroom, three dormitories,  recreation hall, and a family physician's consulting room. In  this way, proper material conditions at the site are guaranteed.    I talked with Pedro Leal Cruz, the official in charge at the  deposit, about why Pina is so important in terms of the nation's  oil expectations. He told me that the quality of the so-called  ""black gold"" depends basically on the API [American Petroleum  Institute] ratings (the international index of density)  determined and the sulfur content. The hydrocarbon produced in  this locality is very light, with an API rating of 32. It  contains very little sulfur. Thus, this is petroleum that is  rich in special oils and of optimal value, comparable to the  best produced elsewhere in the world.    The accompanying gas (70 to 100 cubic meters per cubic meter  of oil) is compressed and sent to various customers for use as  fuel or in the cutting of metals. This kind of petroleum is the  easiest to extract and transport.    ""Now we are using it in basic oils. We have light petroleum  products here that can be used directly even in the engines of  drilling equipment and automotive vehicles (in a mixture of 50  percent crude oil and 50 percent diesel oil),"" Leal says. He has  been in this business for 33 years, working in jobs including  assistant, drilling tower worker, and well chief.    Where the productivity of the deposit is concerned, I was  told that the extraction plan for last year called for 40,300  tons. The total actually extracted was 47,962 tons, representing  plan fulfillment of 119 percent. The plan for the number of  zones to be tested, or oil-bearing sites to be explored, was  also overfulfilled by 100 percent. This year's plans call for  the extraction of 52,750 tons.    Estimates of the Pina reserves for the next five years have  already been completed, and the production forecasts are  excellent. Other work planned includes the construction of a  collection center and a loading facility. Both of these tasks  are now being completed. The collection center will have a tank  with a capacity of 1,000 cubic meters and an oil pipeline  leading to the railroad loading facility. This will make more  efficient and speedy transportation possible. Work is currently  being done in collaboration with foreign firms at some wells in  this deposit.    The Smell of Sulfur    Regisfredo Aguilera Remodid has traveled almost everywhere  in  the country in search of vocational advancement. A native of  Santiago de Cuba, he studied extraction technology in Havana. He  is living now in Guanito because of a love story he did not want  to recount, but which from every indication has the smell of  sulfur.    When we met him, he was working as the head of an extraction  crew--the principal operator--aided by three assistants. While  we were there he told us about the fulfillment of safety norms,  the zero accident record, and the new wage adjustments that  include compensation for the abnormal and hazardous working  conditions. He talked about the housing arrangements, the  remoteness of the site, and the nocturnal nature of the work. He  also indicated his readiness to continue in the oil extraction  business, despite the oil and grime on his overalls and the  shortage of available soap.    ""We need this oil to survive,"" he confessed with the  sincerest of smiles. He introduced me to the other members of  his crew, who, like the rest of the 180 technicians, assistants,  chemists, and engineers at the deposit, are committed to  retaining first place in 1994 in the Black Gold Competition.    Next we talked with Jesus Aguila, the secretary of the  Chemical-Mining-Energy Workers' Union in Ciego de Avila, about  the stability of the work force employed by the Majagua Basic  Unit of the oil enterprise (covering Pina, Cristales,  Jatibonico, and Jarahueca, in order of extractive capacity). He  said that during certain periods, many workers left, but that  situation is now in the past. The work is rather well-paid, and  the majority of the workers feel much more needed in this era of  shortages.    The new structure of the self-financed unit has led to a  certain surplus in the labor force. Because of this, many  workers are being retrained or are going to an employment firm  that relocates them in various tasks in the cycle. This is  possible because our country has several hundred wells under  exploitation, as well as collection centers, batteries of  storage tanks, small processing plants, and other infrastructure  facilities. There are also many kilometers of oil pipeline  dedicated to the task of guaranteeing the extraction and  distribution of the ""miracle"" hydrocarbon. The workers in Avila  plan to extract 67,000 tons of oil this year.     "

The results were  obtained through Roman Oil, a U.S. company stationed in Houston  that was used as a cover by Government Oil Deposits (YPF) to buy  the maps. According to a top source in the Malvinas government,  YPF is the first and only oil company so far to pay $3.2 million  for the seismic maps.    Great Britain approved legislation two years ago allowing  the  Falklands Islands Government to start seismic studies in the  area. Argentina reacted by sending ""letters of discomfort""  [preceding three words in English] to oil companies warning them  that any activities carried out in the waters around the  Malvinas Islands without its consent could lead to a legal  conflict in the future.    Without taking the threat into account, the island's  government granted the license to carry out the studies to Geko  Prakla (U.S. company) and Spectrum (British), which put the  study results up for sale late last year.    This daily was able to learn that it was suspicious to the  island's government that the first oil company interested in  buying the maps was Roman Oil, an oil company never heard of  before by the island's advisers, the British Geological Survey.  This is why the Kelpers did not hesitate to put a good method of  investigation into operation.    Since the islanders believed the seismic studies could be  very valuable to Argentina, they started investigating from that  side. The first thing they learned was that Gaffny Klain, a  British consultant with an office in Houston that advises the  Argentine Government on oil matters, had recommended the  purchase of the survey made by Geko Prakla and Spectrum. But  they were not able to learn much about Roman Oil, which has a  telephone not listed in the Houston directory.    Finally, their links to the companies that carried out the  seismic studies turned suspicion to reality: YPF was the real  name of the mysterious oil company that bought the maps,  according to confirmation made unofficially by Spectrum and Geko  Prakla to the Falklands Islands Government.    The Malvinas government gets a percentage of the survey  result's sale.    There are no secrets on the island. A kelper said: ""It is  the type of community that when one goes to the supermarket and  buys cereal the neighbor does not eat, he would come and ask if  there is something wrong with your stomach."" This is why the  news spreads real fast among its 2,000 inhabitants.    Adviser Wendy Teggart said: ""It is a rumor but it seems that  YPF bought the seismic studies."" But she immediately said it was  true by adding: ""It is better for us because if YPF decides to  buy the license, it would mean a recognition in some way of the  Falklands Islands Government's sovereignty over its waters.""    When Great Britain began the search for oil in the islands  without consulting Argentina, Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella  said it would be impossible for Great Britain to continue the  process on those terms because no oil company would risk  millions of dollars in waters that are under disputed  sovereignty.    The island's government members who were asked by this daily  said that if there is indeed exploitable oil in large  quantities, no international oil companies, and certainly not  those that have no interest in Argentina, will be stopped by a  juridical dispute. They said the first proof that business is  more important than conflicts over sovereignty is the fact that  the first company that bought the seismic studies was  Argentina's YPF. At any rate, they said, this information will  help the Argentine Government in the high-level meeting on  hydrocarbons to be held with the Foreign Office late in March or  early April in Buenos Aires.    The Argentine Foreign Ministry will say in the meeting that  the search for oil will need cooperation between Argentina and  the kelpers. This is what the government has been saying since  the British went ahead with the seismic survey without  consultation, which is the first, and most simple, and less  costly step of the process.    The result of the survey involving a study of the terrain  through probes was ""optimistic."" The survey said there may be  oil in the islands. And the only way to prove it is to go ahead  with the second stage: the exploration that involves drilling  in territory claimed by Argentina and Great Britain.    Meanwhile, David Camp, the island's attorney general, is  going ahead in drawing up legislation for issuing exploration  and exploitation licenses. What happens is that because of the  investment required in drilling exploration wells, the licenses  that will be attractive to the oil companies are those that  guarantee -- if oil is found -- their indisputable rights for 20  or 30 years for the third and last stage: exploitation.    The current subject of conversation among the kelpers is the  possibility of finding oil in the islands. Their main concern is  that the oil companies may damage the islands' ecological  balance and cause massive immigration, changing the life style  of their small community.    To answer this type of question, the islands government has  recently contracted the services of the company Environment  Resources Management (ERM), which within three months will  deliver a report on the impact the discovery of oil would have  on the islands. It also sent a delegation to the North Sea and  began paying the salary of Alex Camp, an internationally known  oil tax expert.    The possibility of discussing the oil issue with Argentina  is  not yet in the kelpers' plans. The only thing they are sure of  is that YPF bought the survey studies, and that they will be  absent in the discussions if the meeting on hydrocarbons between  Argentina and Britain is held in Buenos Aires.

Emissions from cars, trucks and buses account for nearly 80 per cent of the more than 4,300 tonnes of pollutants dumped on Mexico City every year.

About 300 workers will be transferred over the next year to Aberdeen, where the majority of BP's 5,000 Scottish employees are based and which will become an integrated headquarters for exploration and production across Europe. A further 350 people will be made redundant. Mr John Browne, the chief executive, said that the move was prompted by the need to cut costs, and the shift towards smaller and less economic fields in the North Sea. BP Exploration is the largest operator in the UK sector of the North Sea with an output of nearly half a million barrels of oil a day. Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said the action was expected, and was likely to save BP about Pounds 50m a year. The St Vincent Street offices in Glasgow passed to BP when the company acquired Britoil in a Pounds 2.5bn takeover in 1988. Sir Peter Walters, then BP chairman, gave written assurances to Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent secretary at the Treasury, including that Glasgow would become the business headquarters of the combined BP/Britoil upstream business in the UK. The assurances were repeated in the Commons by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday's announcement was a 'flagrant breach' of those guarantees. 'The guarantees were worthless and the deal sold on a false prospectus. This raises major issues of political honour and the way this government deals with multinationals.' He is to press for a meeting with ministers. Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, said BP were 'corporate liars'. The government initially retained a 'golden share' in Britoil, but redeemed that in 1990. Ministers said at the time that they were happy BP had fulfilled its pledges on Britoil. BP said Abbey National Life had agreed to lease two of the Glasgow building's six floors as a life assurance centre and was considering whether to take further space.

The vote went about 60:40 against Mr Conroy, although around 90 per cent of the small shareholders backed the existing board. A new eight-man board under the control of the company's two major shareholders takes over. The shareholders, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a financial offshoot of Canada's Corona International, have a combined holding of 43.35 per cent. The new board announced that it was to begin 'a detailed assessment of the company's operations immediately,' and that Mr Graham Mascall, managing director of Outokumpu, and Mr Paul Carroll, a director of Dundee, would be temporary joint chairmen until 'an independent Irish chairman' was appointed. Hostility to Mr Conroy first surfaced in 1990 when the companies' two nominee directors, one of whom was Mr Mascall, resigned over disagreements on ore marketing arrangements for the chief asset - the 6m ton zinc/lead orebody at Galmoy, 70 miles south-west of Dublin. Mr Conroy objected to an Outokumpu proposal giving it sole and exclusive marketing rights to the ore. The boardroom coup was precipitated though by Conroy's IPounds 7.7m share exchange acquisition last year of Atlantic Resources, an Irish oil/gas exploration company. The two main shareholders argued that this was overpriced, was diverting Conroy's attention from developing Galmoy, and were clearly angered by what they saw as Mr Conroy's effort to dilute their holding in the company. Mr Conroy has remained adamant, though, that the Atlantic deal 'was good value', creating total oil and gas assets which he estimated 'at between IPounds 9m and IPounds 10m'. The new board is likely to sell off Conroy's oil and gas assets and to focus efforts on Galmoy, which would dovetail better with Outokumpu's other zinc mining interests in Ireland. These are the Tara mine at Navan, western Europe's biggest zinc mine, and its 24 per cent stake in the 13.5m ton zinc/lead deposit at Lisheen, close to Galmoy. At the meeting, Mr Mascall said it would be the intention to bring Galmoy into production 'as soon as possible'. Mr Conroy said: 'I am fully supportive of that. That is what I have been trying to do'. Cost of developing Galmoy is put at some IPounds 65m, once planning permission is approved. When in production the mine should be one of the lowest cost producers in the world.  The Financial Times   London Page 16 Photograph Richard Conroy, Atlantic purchase was good value (Omitted).  "

Proposed Amendment        By letter dated September 9, 1994, Utah submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA (administrative record No. UT971). Utah submitted the proposed amendment in response to the required program amendment at 30 CFR 944.16(a). The provision of the Utah Coal Mining Rules that Utah proposes to revise is Utah Administrative Rule (Utah Admin. R.) 645203200, Confidentiality.    Specifically, Utah proposes to revise Utah Admin. R. 645203200 by inserting language to specify that the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (Division) will not make information available for public inspection, if the information ``concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the person intending to conduct coal exploration or that the information is confidential under the standards of the Federal Act.'' Utah also proposes to delete language that limited confidential information to information ``classified as being protected, private, or controlled under the Government Records Access and Management Act (GRAMA) or confidential under other applicable State or federal laws, rules, or regulations.''

Bondarev, B.P. Kondakov, G.S. Makarov,  All-Russia Light Alloys Institute; UDC 69.717]    [Text] Compared to iron, steel, copper, brass, wood, and  glass, aluminum as a structural material is relatively young  since it has been produced for a little over 100 years. Yet  nevertheless, due to the considerable diversity of its  properties, aluminum now substitutes these materials and even  has certain advantages over them. No other material is known  which would be represented in such diverse forms, e.g., sheet  and plate rolled stock, plates (slabs), foil (with a thickness  up to 5æm, sections, forged products, shaped cast products,  wire, and powder.    A unique combination of the most diverse aluminum properties  makes it possible to use it efficiently in various branches of  the national economy, primarily such large sectors as the  automotive engineering industry, construction, container and  packaging production, electrical engineering, agriculture, etc.    Noticeable successes in the development of materials,  practices, and structures and their optimum utilization have  been achieved in these particular applications. Let us consider  several examples.    The most important issue for Russia is to solve the food  problem, primarily the tasks of harvesting, storing, and  transporting grain since its poor organization leads to losses  of up to 30% or more. The solution used widely in world  practices is to develop a system of metallic mechanized grain  storage facilities which can be rapidly erected and positioned  in direct proximity to the food production locations. The  construction cycle of one elevator tower with a 250 t capacity  in the field is 24 h while a ""turnkey"" mechanized complex with a  1,000 t capacity can be completed in 30 days.    A structure has been set up which will make it possible  annually to construct in Russia storage facilities for 2 million  tons of grain. This will require 25,000 t of aluminum rolled  products.    A large number of other efficient aluminum building  structures for agricultural purposes which are characterized by  a high degree of plant finish (chicken coops, greenhouses,  potato storage, irrigation pipes for irrigated farming, etc.) as  well as agricultural transport structures (refrigerators, truck  trays for transporting fertilizer, milk tanks, etc.) has been  developed.    The development of production of canning band as an integral  component of a complex of efforts aimed to set up production of  rolled sheets was a considerable achievement. Scientific  principles and production methods have been developed and a  large volume of design efforts has been carried out; large-scale  production with a capacity of up to 75,000 t/yr of band has been  set up at the SaMZ; together with the Dmitrov pilot plant, it  produces approximately 90,000 t/yr which amounts to 30% of  container production in the country. Yet, e.g., compared to the  United States, per capita consumption of aluminum rolled  products for packaging food is 15 times lower.    Another promising application of aluminum is in light motor  transport (safety beams from aluminum sections with a high  damping ability and even entire bodies including the reinforcing  elements and the skin, pistons for highly stressed sports car  engines from gasostat-treated powder alloys, and reliable  superlight stamped wheel discs manufactured by aviation  engineering methods).    Aluminum consumption in Russia's motor transport may reach  300,000 t/yr. The energy outlays for the production of aluminum  used will be quickly recovered due to fuel savings.    Aluminum has found successful applications in making  railroad  car axle boxes because of its ability to decrease their mass by  twofold and lower the dynamic loads on the rails and car  structures by 10% due to aluminum's damping properties.  Furthermore, aluminum journal boxes require virtually no repairs  during their entire service life. Up to 8,000 t of aluminum have  been used annually for making the axle boxes since 1982.    Today, conversion made it possible to utilize in car  structures large-size panels from aluminum alloys with an up to  800 mm width and a length equal to that of the entire car,  aluminum alloy pipes with inside corrosion-resistant cladding  for water supply and heating systems, and slabs from weldable  alloys for making railroad tank cars for acids.    The development of both today's comfortable high-speed  railroad cars and subway cars would be impossible without  extensive utilization of aluminum.    In recent decades, aluminum has been widely used in  construction both as load carrying and barrier structures in the  building interior and exterior.    Our designers and researchers have developed not only  barrier  structures but also three-dimensional load-carrying structures  of building spans spanning 18, 21, and 84 m.    With respect to the foregoing, we should mention that a  completely abnormal situation has developed in the country in  the field of structural aluminum section production, primarily  for making building structures. The ratio of extruded products  to the total volume of commercial rolled stock from aluminum  alloys has remained virtually unchanged in the past decade and  amounts to close to 12%. Generally, the ratio of aluminum  use  in construction in the most developed countries, such as Japan,  has settled at a 30% level, in Italy, at approximately  20%,  whereas in Russia, no more than 7% of all aluminum rolled  products made is used in construction.    All of the roughly 120,000 t of section production is  concentrated at six large aviation metallurgy plants and five  specialized plants where two-to-five presses are in operation.  Altogether, there are approximately 140 press production lines  and complexes in the country, including 112 in aviation  metallurgy. At the same time, approximately 1 million tons of  sections in the United States is produced at 250 small  specialized plants utilizing 450 press units.    The need to develop in the next 10-15 years a network of  small plants producing aluminum sections at a rate of only  200-250,000 t/yr and putting in operation a minimum of 50-60  modern press production lines is obvious. In order to support  the aforementioned billet production with the requisite metal  quality, it is necessary to set up ingot smelting at primary  aluminum plants, i.e., columns with a 130-250 mm diameter from  alloys 6005, 6060, and 6063 with proper filtering, inoculation,  and diffusion annealing.    Recently, the issue of broader utilization of aluminum in  the  petroleum and gas complex has been raised at an increasing  frequency. We have developed considerable pipe production both  for exploration and commercial drilling. Nineteen thousand tons  of these pipes are being produced.    Due to the high sulfide compound concentration in petroleum  in Orenburg area wells, steel pipes with double thick walls have  been used, yet this does not solve the problem since the pipes  have to be changed anyway as corrosion progresses. At the same  time, aluminum is resistant in a hydrogen sulfide medium and can  compete in resistance with corrosion-resistant steel. The demand  for petroleum and pumping and compressor pipes from aluminum  alloys is estimated as 100,000 t/yr.    One can cite numerous other positive examples of aluminum  applications in various types of equipment, processes,  structures, and devices.    The high technical and economic efficiency of aluminum  applications in various fields of engineering and  investment-financed projects for developing primary metal and  rolled stock production gave the users a reason to plan for a  long- term expansion of its application volumes to up to 4.5  million t/yr (1978 and 1983 forecasts).    A reduction in project financing volumes, the absence of a  noticeable increase in primary aluminum production and,  likewise, aluminum rolled products and its constant shortages,  and allocation of rolled stock for individual applications based  on the residual principle led to a decrease in the user  ""appetite"" and, most importantly, pushed the time of planned  increase in aluminum use to 2005 and 2010. We should also notice  that the forecast was made based on 1989 orders, i.e., prior to  the start of an escalating price increase for metals, energy,  and other types of resources.    In real life, a drop in rolled stock production volume has  been observed in the last three years. The reasons for this  phenomenon are dual in origin. On the one hand, the principal  management difficulties causing unstable plant operation are due  to the lack of raw material supplies and disruption of economic  relations.       On the other hand, the consumers are moving away from using  rolled stock, do not accept products already made to order, and  return to old technologies and structures employing steel, cast  iron, and other less expensive materials due to a sharp rise in  aluminum rolled stock prices (Fig. 1) brought about by a  multiple increase in prices for primary metals, energy, and  other resources. In particular, such automotive enterprises as  the KamAZ, MAZ, and OdAZ have ceased ordering extruded sections  in the last two years while railroad workers are quickly  restarting production of railroad car axle boxes from steel and  pig iron.       If we compare thealuminum rolled product price index to that  of steel, wood, or cement (Fig. 2), i.e., the materials which it  effectively substitutes, one can see its considerable lead. For  this reason, in the past two to three years, aluminum has  catastrophically lost its position gained in previous years.    Process engineers, naturally, possess the reserves whose  utilization will make it possible to decrease to a certain  extent the rate of price increase for aluminum rolled stock;  this is primarily a decrease in the energy outlays for its  production. Enterprises of the former aviation metallurgy are  heavy users of fuel and energy resources. In 1991, they consumed  4 billion kWh of electric power, more than 1 billion  m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas, and 13 million GJ of thermal  energy.    The energy source price rise led to an increase in the ratio  of energy outlays to the cost of production from 2.5 to  10%  while a further rise in the energy source price to the world  level may boost the energy component of production costs to  20%. Under such conditions, the role of energy  conservation in  the economic subenterprises changes radically. The reserves of  energy resource conservation at enterprises are estimated to be  at least 30%. Most of the largest operating energy  consuming  equipment is obsolete and has been greatly neglected while the  energy consumption management level lags behind today's  computerized planning and equipment operation control practices.    It is necessary to develop new combustion melting furnaces  with a modern regenerative burner system and a high-speed flame  and an automatic control system.    Utmost utilization of liquid aluminum from electrolyzers in  smelting ingots in Krasnoyarsk and Kamensk-Uralsk may greatly  lower energy outlays (up to 100 million rubles/yr). The  power-to-output ratio for producing tin can band by using  non-ingot blank rolling can be lowered by 25-30%.    The following should be substituted: obsolete traveling  ovens  for heating slabs--with modern pusher-tube furnaces at the  Kamensk-Uralsk and Belaya Kalitva Metallurgical Production  Associations and the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works;  the uneconomical and environmentally unacceptable saltpeter  quenching baths at the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works  and Kamensk- Uralsk Metallurgical Production Association; and  resistance furnaces--with gas-fired furnaces.    Due to the insufficient present level of investment, the use  of secondary energy resources (VER) does not exceed 4% of  the  total output. Yet an increase in the secondary energy resource  utilization by a mere 10% may lower the energy outlays by  120  million rubles/yr.    Another important reserve which is not adequately used today  and which makes it possible under rising primary metal and  energy resource prices to improve the situation with the use of  aluminum in various industries is maximizing the involvement of  secondary aluminum in production. In contrast to many other  metals, the very nature of aluminum provides broad opportunities  for its multiple use. Moreover, the energy outlays for its  production amount to merely 5% of the primary production  energy  outlays.    Thus far, a lion's share of annually produced aluminum has  been irretrievably lost from circulation and will not be  returned in the form of recycled scrap until the end of the  products' service life. The ratio of secondary aluminum to the  total volume of its production in the country does not exceed  18-20% while the rolled stock produced from secondary  aluminum  alloys amounts to merely 5% of the total volume. At the  same  time, the proportion of secondary aluminum in world practices  reaches close to 25% (close to 38% in the United  States and  30% in Europe) and in individual developed countries, it  exceeds 75% (79.1% in Japan in 1985).    The mining and alumina enterprises and primary aluminum  production plants also have sufficient reserves and are faced  with problems whose realization and solution may have a  beneficial effect on increasing the technical level and lowering  the cost of their production.    Yet when each enterprise individually addresses the  aforementioned issues, both extracting and processing, most of  the efficient large-scale measures cannot be implemented because  they require considerable investment which an individual  enterprise cannot afford.    At the same time, historically the aluminum-containing raw  material mining (bauxites and nephelines) and alumina and  primary aluminum production have been exclusively concentrated  in nonferrous metallurgy while production of structural rolled  stock from aluminum and its alloys (plates, sheets, bands,  sections, panels, buses, rods, pipes, wire, stampings, and  rings)--primarily at machining enterprises of the former USSR  Ministry of Aviation Industry.    Thus, the issue of supplying the needs of the national  economy with aluminum products has been thus far addressed by a  large number of individual uncoordinated enterprises.    The three most important features can be identified among  the  many negative consequences of such lack of coordination.     -  Due to a rather frequent discrepancy between the  departmental interests and natioal interests, the issue of  stably supplying metalworking enterprises with primary metal has  always been solved with great difficulties. As a result, the  degree to which the national economy's need for aluminum rolled  products are met has not exceeded 75-80%.    -  Under the conditions where state subsidies are severely  limited  and, at times, are not available altogether, and it is  impossible to concentrate the financial resources for radically  increasing the technical production level, each individual  enterprise, as we have already indicated, is forced to limit its  retooling plans in accordance with its own realistic  possibilities.    -  Given the existing tax structure, only the added-value tax  collected more than once due to the lack of enterprise  coordination leads to a sharp increase in the aluminum rolled  stock cost, a drop in demand, and a loss of positions already  gained.    -  In our opinion, under today's conditions, these problems can  be  solved radically by deepening the vertical links and setting up  unified commercial structures for manufacturing aluminum  products, the so-called technological aluminum corporations.  They are technological because they must unify enterprises which  have long been connected by a common technological link which  includes mining the ore raw material, processing it, producing  primary metal, and manufacturing ready metallurgical production  (rolled stock).       Prompt resolution of the issue of eliminating the  bottlenecks, bringing the entire technological cycle to a proper  technical level, ensuring stable operation of all links, and  attaining high economic production indicators and total economic  independence is possible only in the framework of sufficiently  strong commercial structures and by concentrating intellectual,  financial, and other sources.

By PAUL AMES, ASSOCIATED PRESS      LISBON, Portugal      After 15 years of an economically devastating civil war, oil-rich Angola may  find itself on the winning end of the conflict in the Persian Gulf.    The southwestern African nation derives 90% of its export earnings from oil  production, and experts say the recent run-up in crude prices on worldwide  markets could bring a windfall in profits.    The light crude from Angola's oil-producing center in Cabinda province already  has risen to as much as $32 a 42-gallon barrel since the Aug. 2 invasion of  Kuwait by neighboring Iraq. That was $17 higher than the April average.    It's a welcome relief for Angola, which, like other oil-producing nations, had  to weather a soft oil market in the mid-1980s, when crude prices neared the  $10-a-barrel level.    ""The government needs oil revenues desperately,"" said Robert Connon, general  manager of Cabinda Gulf Oil Co., a unit of Chevron Corp., which operates rigs  off the Cabinda coast near Zaire.    Oil is what has kept the country going during the civil war between the Marxist  government and U.S.-backed UNITA rebels, who have been fighting for power since  Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.    Although much of Angola's land is fertile, little has been under cultivation  since the war. And exports of the country's large mineral deposits, including  diamonds and iron ore, have been virtually halted.    Angola currently pumps about 550,000 barrels of crude a day, up from a daily  output of 130,000 barrels in 1982, according to government figures. That's only  about one-tenth the oil of Saudi Arabia, but with crude reserves at 2.1 billion  barrels, Angola follows Nigeria as sub-Saharan Africa's second-largest oil  producer.    Oil industry experts estimate that Angola's crude oil exports earned $2.5  billion last year, up from an estimated $1.9 billion in 1985.    The United States is the largest buyer of Angolan oil even though it spends  more than $50 million a year in arming UNITA, which stands for the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola. U.S. imports of Angolan oil totaled  42.7 million barrels from January through May, according to the U.S. Energy  Information Administration.    Angola is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,  but it often follows moves by the cartel to cut or raise production. It's  unlikely, though, that Angola will boost production any time soon to make up  for a shortage of supplies stemming from the Iraqi invasion and subsequent U.S.  troop buildup in the region, representatives of the big foreign oil companies  said. They said Angola oil production already is operating near capacity.    ""Our fields in Angola, and from what we understand, the other fields as well  are producing pretty much flat out,"" said Bill Rapp, Texaco Inc.'s West African  and Latin American area coordinator.    But Cabinda Gulf's Connon said that in the next three years his company expects  to increase its pumping capacity by 50,000 barrels a day.    ""There have been some exploration successes recently, and I see a fair amount  of interest from companies not operating here yet,"" he said.    State-owned Sonangol is the sole concessionaire for oil exploration and  production rights in Angola.

New Georgiyevsk Treaty in Pipeline""]    [Text] To stop Georgia's slide toward economic collapse is  now possible only on condition of restored traditional economic  links with Russia. The first step in this direction was  Georgia's entry into the CIS last fall. In the meeting between  Russian and Georgian Prime Ministers Viktor Chernomyrdin and  Otar Patsatsiya, KOMMERSANT- DAILY reported yesterday, concrete  mechanics for the republic to join the Commonwealth were  discussed, and a number of bilateral agreements including one to  establish a free-trade regime were approved.    Georgia's desire for close economic relations with Russia  stems from the crisis in the national economy, which is on the  brink of collapse. In the estimate of the International  ""Reforma"" fund, Georgia's state budget deficit in 1993 came  close to 100 percent. Its debt to Russia tops 50 billion rubles  [R], and the prospects for paying it are rather nebulous because  Georgian exports to Russia were constantly falling, and in 1993  did not exceed R26 billion. This is in parallel with the  devaluation of the Georgian coupon, whose rate against the ruble  has fallen since last August by a factor of more than 100. The  situation is being made even worse by an appreciable decline of  supplies from Russia, primarily of energy. Deliveries of Russian  natural gas were stopped as early as 1992, and after the  Georgian side had been discovered illegally re-exporting Russian  petroleum products (Russian raw material worth $23.1 million was  shipped to France alone in the second part of 1992), the Russian  side sharply cut back its oil and petroleum products supplies.    Georgia hopes to stabilize the economic situation by signing  bilateral agreements with Russia on trade and economic relations  in 1994, and on a free-trade regime. Under these  understandings, Georgia will be guaranteed supplies of Russian  energy in agreed amounts while Georgian goods for Russia will be  exempt from import duties. The latest meeting of the two  countries' premiers in Moscow finalized 3 and 4 February as the  dates of Boris Yeltsin's visit to Georgia. The above agreements  will be signed during this trip. Besides, Eduard Shevardnadze is  going to bring Georgia back into the ruble zone. The advantages  for the Georgian side are apparent. As for the ruble, it will  further weaken as a result of such an alliance. On the whole,  Georgia is counting on Russia's financial and economic support  in solving its own national problems.    [Saneblidze]Of course.    [Lominadze] It is difficult but absolutely necessary and it  has to be done through systematic and purposeful propaganda and  actions and not, as some leaders imagine, by thinking that,  having entered these places, there is nothing else for us to do  but sit idly by and wait for the results.    This was precisely the mood when we entered Abkhazia. Yes,  we did get from the Inguri River to Sukhumi! However, we did  not advance further. It is well known what the consequences of  this were for us. The same thing could possibly happen here as  well.    There was no hand-to-hand combat in Senaki or Khobi or  Zugdidi or anywhere else. However, although those armed people  have dispersed, they still exist, do they not? Of course they  do. Who can guarantee to us that they will not unite again or  will not use those socioeconomic problems that exist in reality  for their own purposes? No one.    Finally, there is a trend toward an improvement of the  situation. However, we must not relax our efforts for a single  moment. [passage omitted]     "

The Environmental Protection Agency, in announcing the restrictions -- some of  which are proposals and some that take effect immediately -- said that exposure  to benzene ""represents an important long-term health concern,"" particularly for  individuals who live near major industrial sources of the pollutant.    The regulations are directed at a diverse group of manufacturers as well as the  nation's gasoline marketing network, including 390,000 service stations across  the country. Affected industries include steel, petroleum, chemicals,  pharmaceuticals and tire manufacturing. The regulations would also affect  railroad tank cars and benzene storage tanks.    The agency predicted that the controls would reduce industrial emissions of  benzene by 90%.      Petroleum Derivative    Benzene, a derivative of petroleum, is a major industrial chemical associated  with adult leukemia. It is used in the manufacture of plastics, insecticides  and polyurethane foam. Benzene emissions are also found in automobile exhaust  fumes, automobile refueling operations, cigarette smoke and many consumer  products.    EPA officials acknowledged at a press conference, however, that industrial  emissions of benzene account for only about 20% of total airborne benzene, with  the remainder coming from vehicle exhaust and fuel evaporation. They said that  they intend to attack the automobile problem through additional regulations  that would require changes in the composition of gasoline.    The agency said that about half of the American population is exposed to  benzene emissions from industrial sources and that ""virtually all of the  population is exposed to benzene as a constituent of gasoline.""    For most Americans, however, the risk of cancer from benzene exposure is about  one in a million, the agency said, noting that the proposed regulations are  designed to protect an estimated 100 million people who live close to  industrial sites.    The new rules are intended to ensure that those facing the biggest exposure --  an estimated 300,000 people -- have no more than one chance in 10,000 of  getting cancer.    Industry spokesmen were generally positive about the rules.    ""EPA has taken additional steps to protect public health, but has done so in a  manner that recognizes the efforts already taken by the petroleum industry to  reduce its emissions,"" the American Petroleum Institute said in a statement.      Some Proposals Criticized    But the institute criticized the proposals to limit emissions in the gasoline  marketing network. Those provisions would require the addition of seals and  other systems to reduce the estimated 5,300 tons of benzene released through  the filling of underground gasoline storage tanks at service stations.    ""These particular controls would require significant expenditures of  approximately $1 billion but would achieve virtually no public health  benefits,"" the institute said.    The EPA said that the proposed restrictions would reduce the projected  incidence of leukemia from approximately four additional cases per year in the  exposed population to one case every three years.    One set of final regulations that took effect Thursday requires a 97% reduction  in emissions from coke byproduct recovery plants and ""significant"" reductions  in emissions from benzene storage plants.    The agency proposed also a second set of regulations to require a 98% cut in  emissions from railroad tank cars, trucks, boats and other transfer operations,  a 95% reduction from process vents in pharmaceutical manufacturing, a 75%  reduction from rubber tire manufacturing and additional reductions from benzene  waste operations, gasoline terminals, plants and service stations. The proposed  regulations would take effect after a period of public comment.    For the petroleum industry, the EPA proposed that benzene storage facilities  larger than 10,000 gallons meet specific requirements for tank roof seals,  including periodic inspections and repair of broken seals. The agency predicted  that benzene emissions from such tanks will be reduced from a current level of  680 to 1,420 tons a year to an estimated 560 tons a year.    In addition, the agency proposed controls on waste operations at chemical  plants, petroleum refineries and other facilities that would require covers or  enclosures, treatment processes and waste incineration to reduce emissions at  these facilities to 275 tons a year, a 95% reduction.    Most consumers will not be affected by EPA's regulations at the gas pump,  because emissions released when automobiles are refueled already are subject in  many cities to controls that exceed federal ozone smog standards.      20,000-Ton Reduction    The EPA said that the final rules that were adopted Thursday will result in a  reduction of 20,000 tons of benzene emissions from current levels within two  years. The pending proposals would eliminate an additional 14,300 tons when  they take effect.    The agency said that its benzene rules represent its first attempt to satisfy a  landmark 1987 federal court ruling requiring the EPA to go through an elaborate  health risk assessment process in deciding how far industries must go to reduce  toxic air pollution.    The court ordered the EPA to determine what constitutes an ""acceptable"" level  of risk for the public from dangerous air emissions, then impose  pollution-control requirements that provide an ""ample margin of safety.""    The ruling resulted from a lawsuit filed by environmental groups that attacked  the agency for taking industry costs into consideration, in addition to health  factors, in determining its standards for air pollution.    EPA officials have said that the court-ordered process takes too long. It cited  the ruling as a major reason why the agency has regulated only eight out of the  hundreds of toxic air pollutants.    Congress is expected to override the process set up by the courts when it  revises the Clean Air Act. The Bush Administration's clean air bill would  require industry to first install the best available pollution control  technology and then have the EPA evaluate remaining health dangers to decide  whether further regulation is necessary.    In California, no ambient air standard has been set for benzene. But benzene  emissions are regulated indirectly because they fall into a general category of  chemicals known as volatile organic compounds, which are a prime ingredient of  photochemical smog.

The vote set the stage for a Senate showdown on the vast drilling ban, which  has gained powerful momentum from outrage over the flurry of recent oil spills.  It is opposed by the Administration on grounds that it would hinder necessary  oil exploration.    Unprecedented in its scope, the drilling ban would put 84 million acres of the  nation's outer continental shelf -- including the entire California coast --  off limits to oil companies until at least October, 1990.    The plan, approved on a 374-49 vote as part of a measure providing $11.1  billion for the Interior Department, marked a momentous victory for those who  have counseled caution toward oil exploration in the aftermath of the spills.      Jeopardizes Watt Plan    The action puts in jeopardy much of the ambitious offshore drilling plan laid  out by former Interior Secretary James G. Watt nearly nine years ago and  supported by Republican administrations ever since. It also could render almost  powerless a White House task force appointed last February by President Bush in  hopes of restoring a national consensus on the controversial oil exploration  plans.    The ban, drafted by Rep. Leon E. Panetta (D-Monterey), vastly expands a  long-standing prohibition on new drilling off Southern and Northern California.  It adds Central California to the off-limits list for the first time and  imposes new one-year drilling bans off sensitive areas of the coasts of Alaska,  Florida and six Mid-Atlantic states.    In addition, it launches Congress' first attempt to roll back the territory  already claimed by drilling operations, requiring the Interior Department to  consider buying back a substantial tract of sea floor already leased to the oil  companies in Alaska's Bristol Bay for more than $95 million.    Although the drilling moratorium surmounted what had been expected to be a  major hurdle last week when it was easily approved by the House Appropriations  Committee, the Bush Administration had planned to ambush the effort when it  reached the full House.    But Administration officials said that they were forced to abandon that effort  after finding that support from traditional quarters had crumbled under the  weight of public opinion turned increasingly antagonistic to oil exploration. A  final blow was dealt by television images of a crippled Exxon Valdez trailing a  miles-long oil slick in the waters off San Diego Bay on Tuesday night, the  officials said.    As a result, the House debate on the moratorium -- a prolonged and contentious  fight when the issue has been discussed in previous years -- Wednesday bore the  unmistakable aura of a fait accompli as the Republican congressman leading the  opposition to the drilling ban yielded much of his time to colleagues  supportive of the measure.      No Separate Vote    No attempts were made to delete the drilling ban from the legislation, and no  separate vote was taken on the issue.    The easy victory for the drilling moratorium in the House shifted the locus to  the Senate, where Sen. Pete Wilson (R-Calif.) vowed to lead the campaign for a  drilling ban over what Administration officials characterized as a long-shot  effort to halt it.    While the Senate previously has exhibited hostility to anti-oil efforts, an  aide to Wilson said that the senator believes public sentiment has swung  against drilling to such a marked extent that the moratorium should win  decisive approval.    A presidential veto of the drilling ban would be out of the question because of  the importance of the spending bill to which it is attached, White House  officials said.    The specter of oil spills hovered over much of the House discussion Wednesday,  as proponents of the drilling ban warned of the dangers of undertaking new  risks in oil exploration while Administration allies touted the demonstrated  safety of offshore oil.    Panetta, whose bill covers an area 100 times greater than the first moratorium  he authored in 1981, described the sweeping House action as reflective of  ""growing public concern and anger over the failed promises that oil spills can  be contained.""    But his chief adversary on the issue, Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), warned that  the provision would leave the United States ever more dependent on foreign oil  and ""headed down the same road"" that led to the devastating gasoline lines and  energy crises of the 1970s.    And another powerful advocate of oil interests, Rep. Bob Livingston (R-La.)  adopted the rallying cry of earlier contentious energy fights when he said of  oil moratorium advocates: ""Let 'em freeze in the dark!""    If finally enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of the  White House task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling  should proceed in controversial Lease Sale 91 off Northern California and Lease  Sale 95 off Southern California, and in another area off Florida's Gulf Coast.    The task force has been instructed to make recommendations to Bush by the end  of the year. Under the moratorium, however, the department would be unable to  act until October, 1990, leaving Congress time to challenge any  Administration-backed drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.    The moratorium approved by Congress likely would delay any new federal drilling  activity off California well beyond the autumn of 1990 because it includes  added protection barring the government from beginning even prelease activity.    That provision most likely would affect Lease Sale 119, a massive tract off  Central California, where the auction of drilling rights almost certainly would  be stalled until 1992.    The $11.1-billion Interior appropriations bill includes some $220 million more  than the Administration had requested, largely because of additional spending  on national parks approved after a procession of 350 congressmen appeared  before a House committee to request special grants for parks in their areas.

By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER      As President Bush ponders the future of offshore oil drilling in Southern  California, the message from Orange County residents who suffered the effects  of a major spill just two months ago rings loud and clear: no new oil platforms  in our back yard.    The recent Huntington Beach spill, which dumped 394,000 gallons of Alaskan  crude oil into local waters, fouled 20 miles of shoreline, killed hundreds of  marine birds and has left a lasting impression on many county residents, a  Times Orange County Poll on the environment has found. The accident has also  fueled concerns about the safety of oil drilling and shipping in general,  particularly off the Orange County coast.    ""What happened really scared me,"" said Mary MacDonald, 65, a retired  schoolteacher in San Juan Capistrano who participated in the poll. ""I'd rather  be producing our own oil than buying it from foreign countries, but we need to  be careful about what we're doing.""    Eight in 10 residents believe the Feb. 7 tanker spill caused significant  environmental damage and dealt a blow to the beach economy, according to the  poll conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. Despite officials'  pronouncements that the spill caused no lasting harm, one in four in the poll  described the damage as ""major.""    Two out of three Orange County residents are more concerned about oil shipping  and drilling than they were before the Huntington Beach spill, according to the  poll, while eight in 10 worry that history will repeat itself with another  large spill off the Orange County coast.    ""I know the Huntington Beach oil spill had to do with shipping oil and not  drilling, but the thing is, if those platforms are right out there, the chance  of having another spill or something going wrong offshore is a lot higher,""  said Dawna Brady, 18, a receptionist in San Clemente. ""I drive up the coast,  see them (oil platforms) and wonder, 'now what's going to happen with those?'

""It's partly because of the spill off the coast of Huntington Beach,"" he said.  ""But there also appears to be a growing consensus that offshore oil drilling,  at least off the coast of Orange County, may not be worth the environmental  hazards.""    That sentiment is reflected by the 66% of county residents who favor a complete  ban on drilling off the Orange County coast, compared to 25% who support more  drilling and 9% who are undecided. That does not translate into support for a  ban on oil drilling elsewhere in the nation, however. Half say they favor  increasing oil exploration and production elsewhere in the United States, and  only 38% oppose it.    Don Gardner, 41, a hardware store owner in Stanton, called a local ban the  ""first step in being environmentally responsible."" He said he fears that an oil  spill ""10 times the size"" of the Huntington Beach spill could occur if federal  officials allow full-scale oil and gas exploration in local waters.    Not all county residents, however, agree that a permanent ban is the answer.  Todd Mathewson, 29, an industrial equipment salesman from Fullerton, said such  a move would ""seal off"" a crucial option for meeting rising fuel demands.    He said he believes offshore energy development should be a last resort.  However, should the availability of oil become scarce, Mathewson said, he would  support drilling off the county's coast.    ""I would prefer drilling on land first, but you can't be foolish enough to say  'never' to offshore drilling,"" Mathewson said.    Despite the threat of oil spills, some residents such as Roy Ballard, 73, of  Placentia, believe drilling is a necessary evil -- the price society pays for  its addiction to oil.    ""What are we going to do? Give up our cars, our electricity, our microwave  ovens?"" Ballard asked. ""If we need that oil, let's drill for it.""    For the moment, a local ban will remain in effect off the Orange County coast  pending a decision from President Bush about whether to open up more of  Southern California to offshore drilling. Shortly after taking office, Bush  temporarily stopped lease-sale preparations begun during the Reagan  Administration and ordered a task force to assess the environmental and  economic impact of several proposed lease sales in California and Florida.    Lease Sale 95, proposed off the Southern California coast, includes 6.7 million  acres extending from the Mexican border to the northern border of San Luis  Obispo County. The presidential task force has laid out a series of options for  each of the lease sales, ranging from allowing leasing to extending the current  ban. Bush is expected to announce his decision sometime this summer.    For the most part, there is little debate on the matter among Orange County  residents whose memories of the Huntington Beach spill are still fresh. The  President, they say, should allow more drilling -- but elsewhere.    ""I guess that's because I want it out of my back yard,"" said Ann DePriest, 40,  of Garden Grove.

0,FT932-12482 ,"FT932-12482 _AN-DD1B4AD8FT 930428   FT  28 APR 93 / Gas companies break their traditional mould: Rapid growth opportunities in the global energy market      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   BRITISH GAS engineers from Liverpool lay pipes to connect the sleepy town of Kelbra in the foothills of the Harz mountains to the east German gas grid using technology developed in the UK. Enron, the US gas transit company, unveils one of the world's largest gas-fired combined heat and power stations on Teesside in the UK at a total cost of Pounds 895m. Both projects are evidence of the growing trend among gas companies to break out of the traditional confines of their domestic markets and extend their global reach. 'We are moving into a new era of gas and you will see the growth of the gas majors in a similar way to the development of the oil industry in the 1950s,' said Mr Ken Lay, chairman of Enron. Mr Lay has ambitious plans for Enron to be one of the first truly global gas companies, but he faces intense competition from British Gas and other European energy companies such as Spain's Gas Natural and Belgium's Tractebel. But Mr Jonathan Stern, analyst at Gas Strategies, a consulting group, believes that since the gas business is so capital intensive, companies will be financially constrained from developing a worldwide network in the way the oil industry has done. 'It will become a regional business and is already becoming dominated by about 20 companies with strong local bases which are expanding into specific markets overseas,' he said. Gas Natural, for example, is looking to expand into overseas Spanish-speaking markets and focusing on opportunities created by the wave of privatisation in South America. Gas companies' global ambitions rest on the back of a growing trend towards de-regulation and privatisation in the world energy business, accompanied by expectations of huge growth in gas demand over the next 20 years. 'The worldwide gas market is expanding fast and it offers a unique opportunity for huge growth to some of the companies that are getting involved now,' said Mr Simon Blakey, gas analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Gas is becoming more attractive as an alternative to coal and oil because of its environmental advantages - it is much cleaner to burn - and its price is competitive. In a cautious estimate for the growth in global gas demand by 2010, Royal Dutch/Shell group puts consumption at 2,500bn cubic metres from the current level of 2,000bn cubic metres. The rapid growth in gas demand poses a huge challenge for the energy industry. In a recent speech, Mr Roland Williams, gas and coal co-ordinator for the Shell group, estimated that the cost of finding, producing and transporting new gas to the main markets over the next 20 years will be between Dollars 800bn (Pounds 519bn) and Dollars 1,100bn. The oil companies have so far stuck mainly to gas exploration and production, resisting involvement in distribution or power generation, which could prove the more lucrative market sectors. Gas is not a globally-traded commodity in the way oil is, and gas companies will have to develop the expertise to operate differently in different parts of the world. Gas distribution is an area where companies such as British Gas, which has rapidly developed its own domestic markets, can offer technology and know-how with the financial muscle to invest in developing transit networks. 'We have expertise in all parts of the gas chain and we want to grow in all directions, but our real knowledge is in developing gas markets,' said Mr Russell Herbert, director of British Gas's Global Gas business. This has seen British Gas tapping into potentially lucrative markets overseas. The company is active in 45 countries. But competition is intense  -European gas companies fear their market monopolies may be broken up by the EC and many are looking to diversify overseas. These new markets offer great growth potential, but bring with them a bigger risk of regulatory interference than exists in gas exploration and production. Countries privatising their utilities have often looked to the UK for a model and here, British Gas has suffered at the hands of the regulator. However, established gas companies such as British Gas, Gaz de France and Ruhrgas have great marketing expertise they can offer countries developing their gas businesses. Technology usually means they can offer cost savings in running a market and they also have the cash to invest in large scale projects. Gas distribution companies are also moving into oil exploration. British Gas is currently involved in negotiations to develop the giant Karachaganak field in Kazakhstan, which would double its existing gas reserves. Germany's two main gas companies, Ruhrgas and Wintershall, are looking to buy into exploration acreage in the North Sea. British Gas's need to expand is driven by more pressing concerns: its UK market is being actively eroded by regulators and government. The company is under investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which could lead to substantial changes in its UK business. The UK regulator has already warned the company that it will not be able to finance expansion overseas by raising prices in the UK. The next 10 years, however, should see the transformation of the gas business from the current domestically-focused supply chains into a much more global industry.   Companies:-  British Gas.

The Falklands may have become a peripheral issue in Britain, but Argentina remains obsessed with the islands and clearly hopes that Mr Hurd's five-day visit will signify another step on the tortuous road to 'recovering' the islands, this time through diplomatic means. The British have publicly disabused their hosts of any belief that the Falklands is up for negotiation. Mr Hurd told Argentina's La Nacion newspaper at the weekend: 'I do not expect, and neither should you, that my visit will set in motion any great advances.' Instead, he said, his visit would be devoted to further consolidating Britain's improving links with Argentina. Britain and Argentina re-established diplomatic relations in 1990, a year after President Carlos Menem took office. Since then relations have improved steadily to the point where they co-operated militarily during the 1991 Gulf war. Britain is assigning greater importance to its relations with Latin America, and Mr Menem's free market and pro-western policies have made Argentina an increasingly visible reference point in the region. The economy has settled down to rapid growth and its privatisation policies have involved British banks, consultancy firms and industrial companies, the most notable being British Gas's leading position in the consortium which took control of the Buenos Aires gas distribution company last month. Argentina has also opened up its secretive atomic establishment and scrapped its Condor II missile project. Britain and the US viewed both projects with great suspicion as a source of proliferation. At the same time Argentina has sent troops as UN peacekeepers to the Gulf and Yugoslavia, for reasons of prestige and to keep its habitually restive troops busy. That still leaves the awkward question of the Falklands. Buenos Aires continues to press a claim to the islands, despite the humiliating defeat of 1982. Equally, Britain refuses to discuss sovereignty formulas. Both have agreed to disagree over sovereignty, but cannot agree on how to manage shared resources, especially oil and fisheries. There have been some advances. Seismic tests for oil will be carried out in Falklands waters this year by two companies. The two sides have also worked out a fisheries conservation agreement for 1993, and are now working on a more permanent arrangement. UK and Argentine scientists have started joint research on fish conservation. Curiously, the illex squid, prized by gourmets in the Far East, is the centre of a dispute which islanders see as a continuation of the 1982 conflict by other means. The islands have become one of the richest spots on earth by selling licences to Far Eastern squid-fishing fleets. But in December, Argentina announced it would start issuing cut-price licences of its own, breaking the Falklands' monopoly. The move is expected in Port Stanley to deprive the islands of half or more of the Pounds 30m a year in revenues from licence sales. Some two-third of the islands' revenues come from licensing. Provided the Argentine decision has a commercial, rather than predatory, motivation, the British government is virtually powerless to influence the move. However, Mr Hurd has warned that attempts to use squid licences as 'political toys' could threaten wider bilateral relations. Mr Hurd, who travels on to Chile, will be pressed to invite Mr Menem on an official visit to London. Mr Menem himself first asked to be invited to the UK over a year ago. But there is little sign that an invitation will be forthcoming.   Countries:-  ARZ  Argentina, South America.   Industries:-  P9721  International Affairs.   Types:-  GOVT  International affairs.

Bondarev, B.P. Kondakov, G.S. Makarov,  All-Russia Light Alloys Institute; UDC 69.717]    [Text] Compared to iron, steel, copper, brass, wood, and  glass, aluminum as a structural material is relatively young  since it has been produced for a little over 100 years. Yet  nevertheless, due to the considerable diversity of its  properties, aluminum now substitutes these materials and even  has certain advantages over them. No other material is known  which would be represented in such diverse forms, e.g., sheet  and plate rolled stock, plates (slabs), foil (with a thickness  up to 5æm, sections, forged products, shaped cast products,  wire, and powder.    A unique combination of the most diverse aluminum properties  makes it possible to use it efficiently in various branches of  the national economy, primarily such large sectors as the  automotive engineering industry, construction, container and  packaging production, electrical engineering, agriculture, etc.    Noticeable successes in the development of materials,  practices, and structures and their optimum utilization have  been achieved in these particular applications. Let us consider  several examples.    The most important issue for Russia is to solve the food  problem, primarily the tasks of harvesting, storing, and  transporting grain since its poor organization leads to losses  of up to 30% or more. The solution used widely in world  practices is to develop a system of metallic mechanized grain  storage facilities which can be rapidly erected and positioned  in direct proximity to the food production locations. The  construction cycle of one elevator tower with a 250 t capacity  in the field is 24 h while a ""turnkey"" mechanized complex with a  1,000 t capacity can be completed in 30 days.    A structure has been set up which will make it possible  annually to construct in Russia storage facilities for 2 million  tons of grain. This will require 25,000 t of aluminum rolled  products.    A large number of other efficient aluminum building  structures for agricultural purposes which are characterized by  a high degree of plant finish (chicken coops, greenhouses,  potato storage, irrigation pipes for irrigated farming, etc.) as  well as agricultural transport structures (refrigerators, truck  trays for transporting fertilizer, milk tanks, etc.) has been  developed.    The development of production of canning band as an integral  component of a complex of efforts aimed to set up production of  rolled sheets was a considerable achievement. Scientific  principles and production methods have been developed and a  large volume of design efforts has been carried out; large-scale  production with a capacity of up to 75,000 t/yr of band has been  set up at the SaMZ; together with the Dmitrov pilot plant, it  produces approximately 90,000 t/yr which amounts to 30% of  container production in the country. Yet, e.g., compared to the  United States, per capita consumption of aluminum rolled  products for packaging food is 15 times lower.    Another promising application of aluminum is in light motor  transport (safety beams from aluminum sections with a high  damping ability and even entire bodies including the reinforcing  elements and the skin, pistons for highly stressed sports car  engines from gasostat-treated powder alloys, and reliable  superlight stamped wheel discs manufactured by aviation  engineering methods).    Aluminum consumption in Russia's motor transport may reach  300,000 t/yr. The energy outlays for the production of aluminum  used will be quickly recovered due to fuel savings.    Aluminum has found successful applications in making  railroad  car axle boxes because of its ability to decrease their mass by  twofold and lower the dynamic loads on the rails and car  structures by 10% due to aluminum's damping properties.  Furthermore, aluminum journal boxes require virtually no repairs  during their entire service life. Up to 8,000 t of aluminum have  been used annually for making the axle boxes since 1982.    Today, conversion made it possible to utilize in car  structures large-size panels from aluminum alloys with an up to  800 mm width and a length equal to that of the entire car,  aluminum alloy pipes with inside corrosion-resistant cladding  for water supply and heating systems, and slabs from weldable  alloys for making railroad tank cars for acids.    The development of both today's comfortable high-speed  railroad cars and subway cars would be impossible without  extensive utilization of aluminum.    In recent decades, aluminum has been widely used in  construction both as load carrying and barrier structures in the  building interior and exterior.    Our designers and researchers have developed not only  barrier  structures but also three-dimensional load-carrying structures  of building spans spanning 18, 21, and 84 m.    With respect to the foregoing, we should mention that a  completely abnormal situation has developed in the country in  the field of structural aluminum section production, primarily  for making building structures. The ratio of extruded products  to the total volume of commercial rolled stock from aluminum  alloys has remained virtually unchanged in the past decade and  amounts to close to 12%. Generally, the ratio of aluminum  use  in construction in the most developed countries, such as Japan,  has settled at a 30% level, in Italy, at approximately  20%,  whereas in Russia, no more than 7% of all aluminum rolled  products made is used in construction.    All of the roughly 120,000 t of section production is  concentrated at six large aviation metallurgy plants and five  specialized plants where two-to-five presses are in operation.  Altogether, there are approximately 140 press production lines  and complexes in the country, including 112 in aviation  metallurgy. At the same time, approximately 1 million tons of  sections in the United States is produced at 250 small  specialized plants utilizing 450 press units.    The need to develop in the next 10-15 years a network of  small plants producing aluminum sections at a rate of only  200-250,000 t/yr and putting in operation a minimum of 50-60  modern press production lines is obvious. In order to support  the aforementioned billet production with the requisite metal  quality, it is necessary to set up ingot smelting at primary  aluminum plants, i.e., columns with a 130-250 mm diameter from  alloys 6005, 6060, and 6063 with proper filtering, inoculation,  and diffusion annealing.    Recently, the issue of broader utilization of aluminum in  the  petroleum and gas complex has been raised at an increasing  frequency. We have developed considerable pipe production both  for exploration and commercial drilling. Nineteen thousand tons  of these pipes are being produced.    Due to the high sulfide compound concentration in petroleum  in Orenburg area wells, steel pipes with double thick walls have  been used, yet this does not solve the problem since the pipes  have to be changed anyway as corrosion progresses. At the same  time, aluminum is resistant in a hydrogen sulfide medium and can  compete in resistance with corrosion-resistant steel. The demand  for petroleum and pumping and compressor pipes from aluminum  alloys is estimated as 100,000 t/yr.    One can cite numerous other positive examples of aluminum  applications in various types of equipment, processes,  structures, and devices.    The high technical and economic efficiency of aluminum  applications in various fields of engineering and  investment-financed projects for developing primary metal and  rolled stock production gave the users a reason to plan for a  long- term expansion of its application volumes to up to 4.5  million t/yr (1978 and 1983 forecasts).    A reduction in project financing volumes, the absence of a  noticeable increase in primary aluminum production and,  likewise, aluminum rolled products and its constant shortages,  and allocation of rolled stock for individual applications based  on the residual principle led to a decrease in the user  ""appetite"" and, most importantly, pushed the time of planned  increase in aluminum use to 2005 and 2010. We should also notice  that the forecast was made based on 1989 orders, i.e., prior to  the start of an escalating price increase for metals, energy,  and other types of resources.    In real life, a drop in rolled stock production volume has  been observed in the last three years. The reasons for this  phenomenon are dual in origin. On the one hand, the principal  management difficulties causing unstable plant operation are due  to the lack of raw material supplies and disruption of economic  relations.              Fig. 1. Aluminum Rolled Stock Price Trend.        On the other hand, the consumers are moving away from using  rolled stock, do not accept products already made to order, and  return to old technologies and structures employing steel, cast  iron, and other less expensive materials due to a sharp rise in  aluminum rolled stock prices (Fig. 1) brought about by a  multiple increase in prices for primary metals, energy, and  other resources. In particular, such automotive enterprises as  the KamAZ, MAZ, and OdAZ have ceased ordering extruded sections  in the last two years while railroad workers are quickly  restarting production of railroad car axle boxes from steel and  pig iron.              Fig. 2. Price Index of Individual Types of Structural and Building Materials.        If we compare thealuminum rolled product price index to that  of steel, wood, or cement (Fig. 2), i.e., the materials which it  effectively substitutes, one can see its considerable lead. For  this reason, in the past two to three years, aluminum has  catastrophically lost its position gained in previous years.    Process engineers, naturally, possess the reserves whose  utilization will make it possible to decrease to a certain  extent the rate of price increase for aluminum rolled stock;  this is primarily a decrease in the energy outlays for its  production. Enterprises of the former aviation metallurgy are  heavy users of fuel and energy resources. In 1991, they consumed  4 billion kWh of electric power, more than 1 billion  m[.sup]3[/] of natural gas, and 13 million GJ of thermal  energy.    The energy source price rise led to an increase in the ratio  of energy outlays to the cost of production from 2.5 to  10%  while a further rise in the energy source price to the world  level may boost the energy component of production costs to  20%. Under such conditions, the role of energy  conservation in  the economic subenterprises changes radically. The reserves of  energy resource conservation at enterprises are estimated to be  at least 30%. Most of the largest operating energy  consuming  equipment is obsolete and has been greatly neglected while the  energy consumption management level lags behind today's  computerized planning and equipment operation control practices.    It is necessary to develop new combustion melting furnaces  with a modern regenerative burner system and a high-speed flame  and an automatic control system.    Utmost utilization of liquid aluminum from electrolyzers in  smelting ingots in Krasnoyarsk and Kamensk-Uralsk may greatly  lower energy outlays (up to 100 million rubles/yr). The  power-to-output ratio for producing tin can band by using  non-ingot blank rolling can be lowered by 25-30%.    The following should be substituted: obsolete traveling  ovens  for heating slabs--with modern pusher-tube furnaces at the  Kamensk-Uralsk and Belaya Kalitva Metallurgical Production  Associations and the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works;  the uneconomical and environmentally unacceptable saltpeter  quenching baths at the Stupino Integrated Iron and Steel Works  and Kamensk- Uralsk Metallurgical Production Association; and  resistance furnaces--with gas-fired furnaces.    Due to the insufficient present level of investment, the use  of secondary energy resources (VER) does not exceed 4% of  the  total output. Yet an increase in the secondary energy resource  utilization by a mere 10% may lower the energy outlays by  120  million rubles/yr.    Another important reserve which is not adequately used today  and which makes it possible under rising primary metal and  energy resource prices to improve the situation with the use of  aluminum in various industries is maximizing the involvement of  secondary aluminum in production. In contrast to many other  metals, the very nature of aluminum provides broad opportunities  for its multiple use. Moreover, the energy outlays for its  production amount to merely 5% of the primary production  energy  outlays.    Thus far, a lion's share of annually produced aluminum has  been irretrievably lost from circulation and will not be  returned in the form of recycled scrap until the end of the  products' service life. The ratio of secondary aluminum to the  total volume of its production in the country does not exceed  18-20% while the rolled stock produced from secondary  aluminum  alloys amounts to merely 5% of the total volume. At the  same  time, the proportion of secondary aluminum in world practices  reaches close to 25% (close to 38% in the United  States and  30% in Europe) and in individual developed countries, it  exceeds 75% (79.1% in Japan in 1985).    The mining and alumina enterprises and primary aluminum  production plants also have sufficient reserves and are faced  with problems whose realization and solution may have a  beneficial effect on increasing the technical level and lowering  the cost of their production.    Yet when each enterprise individually addresses the  aforementioned issues, both extracting and processing, most of  the efficient large-scale measures cannot be implemented because  they require considerable investment which an individual  enterprise cannot afford.    At the same time, historically the aluminum-containing raw  material mining (bauxites and nephelines) and alumina and  primary aluminum production have been exclusively concentrated  in nonferrous metallurgy while production of structural rolled  stock from aluminum and its alloys (plates, sheets, bands,  sections, panels, buses, rods, pipes, wire, stampings, and  rings)--primarily at machining enterprises of the former USSR  Ministry of Aviation Industry.    Thus, the issue of supplying the needs of the national  economy with aluminum products has been thus far addressed by a  large number of individual uncoordinated enterprises.    The three most important features can be identified among  the  many negative consequences of such lack of coordination.     -  Due to a rather frequent discrepancy between the  departmental interests and natioal interests, the issue of  stably supplying metalworking enterprises with primary metal has  always been solved with great difficulties. As a result, the  degree to which the national economy's need for aluminum rolled  products are met has not exceeded 75-80%.    -  Under the conditions where state subsidies are severely  limited  and, at times, are not available altogether, and it is  impossible to concentrate the financial resources for radically  increasing the technical production level, each individual  enterprise, as we have already indicated, is forced to limit its  retooling plans in accordance with its own realistic  possibilities.    -  Given the existing tax structure, only the added-value tax  collected more than once due to the lack of enterprise  coordination leads to a sharp increase in the aluminum rolled  stock cost, a drop in demand, and a loss of positions already  gained.    -  In our opinion, under today's conditions, these problems can  be  solved radically by deepening the vertical links and setting up  unified commercial structures for manufacturing aluminum  products, the so-called technological aluminum corporations.  They are technological because they must unify enterprises which  have long been connected by a common technological link which  includes mining the ore raw material, processing it, producing  primary metal, and manufacturing ready metallurgical production  (rolled stock).       Prompt resolution of the issue of eliminating the  bottlenecks, bringing the entire technological cycle to a proper  technical level, ensuring stable operation of all links, and  attaining high economic production indicators and total economic  independence is possible only in the framework of sufficiently  strong commercial structures and by concentrating intellectual,  financial, and other sources.

The action, which lifted the ban past its most formidable hurdle, marks a major  victory for those who have urged new caution toward oil exploration in the  aftermath of a series of major oil spills across the United States.    It would effectively give Congress new control over a number of controversial  offshore drilling plans, short-circuiting an aggressive effort by the Bush  Administration to forge a consensus on the issue and unshackle itself from  congressional limits.      Bitter Response    In a bitter response, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. assailed Congress for  ""shooting at the wrong target"" in failing to focus on the oil tankers held  responsible for recent spills. To demonstrate the Administration's outrage, he  announced plans to allow oil companies to begin drilling in a new 28  million-acre, oil-rich swath of the Gulf of Mexico.    The new congressional moratorium, approved on a voice vote by the House  Appropriations Committee as part of a larger package, would go far beyond an  existing drilling ban for Northern and Southern California, which has been  imposed each year since 1981.    The expanded ban would, for the first time, cover a proposed lease sale off  Central California and include vast regions in Alaska's Bristol Bay and off  several mid-Atlantic states. Also included in the ban are areas off southern  Florida and George's Bank, off Massachusetts.    In an unprecedented step, the moratorium would also afford California the added  protection of a ban even on pre-lease drilling activities, such as  environmental studies -- a step certain to cause delays in the Interior  Department's drilling timetable.    ""This is a critical victory at a critical time,"" said California Rep. Leon E.  Panetta (D-Monterey), sponsor of the drilling moratorium.    Another Californian, Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), added, ""We have  effectively brought the entire sale process to a screeching halt.""    Rep. Bill Lowery (R-San Diego), a longtime opponent of offshore drilling, said  Thursday that he was ""ecstatic"" about the vote. ""This is the best victory we've  had in this seven-year fight,"" said Lowery, a member of the committee that  approved the moratorium.    Lowery said the six-vote margin of victory was significant because previous  committee votes regarding offshore drilling usually hinged on one or two votes.  The success was all the sweeter, Lowery said, because it represented the first  time pre-lease activity off the California coast has been restricted.    Lowery warned that Thursday's vote was only ""one more major skirmish in a long  battle."" The bill must still be approved by the full House, then by a  House-Senate conference committee.    Lowery and other opponents of offshore drilling said they believe that  worldwide coverage of recent oil spills may help persuade Congress that a  permanent ban on drilling in sensitive areas is needed. ""I've contended all  along the technology is not there for spills,"" Lowery said. ""Sadly, the Exxon  Valdez and events of recent weeks have proven me correct.""    Others warned, however, that to put vast areas of the U.S. coastline off limits  to offshore drilling represented a decision to cede control over U.S. energy to  foreign oil producers.    ""This says that the energy policy of the United States is to do nothing,""  warned Rep. Ralph Regula (R-Ohio), the principal opponent of the measure.    Before becoming law, the moratorium must first be adopted by both the full  House and Senate. But officials on both sides of the drilling debate said they  expect the measure to be approved in light of the current climate of concern  over oil exploration and its hazards.      Opposes Measure    While the Administration strongly opposes the measure, it is regarded as  virtually veto-proof because it is included as an amendment to a vital  supplemental spending measure that President Bush would be unlikely to block.    If enacted, the moratorium would severely limit the influence of a White House  task force appointed by Bush to advise him on whether drilling should proceed  in controversial areas off Northern and Southern California and Florida's Gulf  Coast.    The task force, which has been seeking to strike a balance between the concerns  of environmentalists and the nation's energy needs, has been instructed to make  recommendations to Bush by the end of the year. Under the moratorium, however,  the department would be unable to act until October, 1990, leaving Congress  time to challenge any drilling plans that it still might find unacceptable.    ""The task force has, for the most part, become irrelevant,"" said Robert Hattoy,  the Sierra Club's Southern California regional director.    Interior Department spokesman Steve Goldstein said the panel will continue its  work.    ""It's quite clear that Congress is trying to usurp the actions of the task  force, and we just don't believe that's correct or proper,"" he said.      Little Controversy    The new area put up for lease Thursday by the Interior Department lies off the  coasts of Texas and Louisiana. The proposed drilling there has generated little  controversy.    The heated debate over the drilling moratorium was made more ferocious by sharp  differences among legislators over the lessons that should be drawn from the  series of recent oil spills, including the damage caused in Alaska's Prince  William Sound by 10 million gallons of crude oil that leaked from the tanker  Exxon Valdez.    Environmentalists and anti-drilling forces have contended that the experience  should make lawmakers more cautious about all forms of oil exploration. While  drilling has resulted in few spills, they noted that much of the oil gathered  offshore must be transported to land by tankers.    But the Administration, the oil industry and their supporters countered that  new regulations ought to aim specifically at oil tankers.      Imports Grow    ""We understand that emotions are running high. . . ,"" the American Petroleum  Institute said in a statement. ""(But) the rash of tanker accidents does not  reflect on offshore drilling safety and does not change the fact that domestic  production of oil continues to fall while imports continue to grow.""    The dispute was focused most directly on the effort to include Alaska's Bristol  Bay in the new moratorium. The oil industry already has paid $95 million for  drilling rights in the region, but Alaskan officials demanded the protection in  the amendment out of concern that another spill could devastate the state's  economy.    Noting that years of environmental studies had deemed Bristol Bay safe for  drilling, Regula warned, ""If we can't drill here, we can't do it anywhere.""    But the committee, on a 29-22 vote, rebuffed his proposal to strip the region  from the package.    The special protection for the California coastline came under a provision  preventing the Interior Department from conducting pre-leasing activity along  the entire coast until October, 1990.      Survived Attack    The provision survived an attack by Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.), who noted that  the Interior Department needs up to 26 months to complete all of the steps  necessary to lease an offshore oil tract. The pre-lease ban thus could extend  the moratorium on drilling for up to two years, Boggs argued.    But a powerful coalition of Californians and others who voiced concern about  the recent oil spills defeated the Boggs amendment by a decisive 28-22 margin.    David Coggin, Washington chief of staff for Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside),  said, ""The majority of the delegation working on this really did a good job,  they really worked on getting those undecided or marginal votes to switch. Of  course, having three oil spills the week before didn't hurt.""    Because Lease Sale 95 -- off Carlsbad, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton -- and  Lease Sale 91 off Northern California have already been subjected to most  pre-lease steps, the additional postponement would most likely affect Lease  Sale 119, a massive portion of the Outer Continental Shelf off Central  California.    The Interior Department currently plans to begin oil exploration there in 1991.  If the pre-lease moratorium is imposed through 1990, however, the auction of  drilling rights for the Central California tract would almost certainly be  stalled until 1992.    That delay ""is very welcome news to Southern Californians,"" Levine said.    ""It says to the oil industries . . . that they would be much better off  dropping this fight,"" he said.    Rep. Barbara Boxer (D-Greenbrae), a fervent anti-drilling advocate whose  district includes sensitive shoreline along Point Reyes and San Francisco, said  she is ""extremely pleased"" with the committee vote on the new moratorium.    Recent oil spills have evoked ""a real sentiment that we have to be  extraordinarily careful in the whole offshore oil drilling process,"" Boxer  said. Now, she said, Congress ""may well be ready"" for legislation that would  put areas permanently off limits to offshore drilling.

The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.    ""We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites,"" he said.    Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.    Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.    The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.      Personnel Arrangements    Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will  remain there after the sale is completed in June.    ""An honest exchange of disagreement,"" Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.    The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.

0,FT911-3706 ,"FT911-3706 _AN-BDWB7AGRFT 910423   FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Occidental reaps tax benefits of restructuring      By BERNARD SIMON      NEW YORK   OCCIDENTAL Petroleum has begun to reap the tax benefits of a Dollars 2.2bn restructuring charge taken after the death last December of Dr Armand Hammer, who presided over the Los Angeles-based energy and chemicals group for more than half a century. Net first-quarter earnings were Dollars 136m or 45 cents a share, up from Dollars 108m (37 cents a share) a year earlier. The latest figure, however, includes a Dollars 53m tax benefit from operating loss carryforwards created by last year's restructuring. These carryforwards, which totalled Dollars 1.7bn last December, can be set against taxes on operating income and capital gains. They are recorded as an extraordinary item. Mr Ray Irani, who took over as chairman when Dr Hammer died, has taken the scalpel to Occidental with the aim of concentrating on the core businesses of oil, gas and chemicals. He has put several of Dr Hammer's pet projects on the block, and laid off 1,000 employees. He signalled a break from the past by moving the annual meeting from Dr Hammer's birthday on May 20 to a date 10 days earlier. Oil and gas earnings in the first quarter rose 22 per cent to Dollars 122m, reflecting higher oil prices and production, higher international natural gas volumes and improved domestic gas liquids prices. On the other hand, earnings from chemicals dipped by 25 per cent to Dollars 139m, as a result, among other things, of higher feedstock prices and lower farm products volumes. Amoco Corp lifted its first-quarter earnings by 6 per cent to Dollars 803m or Dollars 1.60 a share from Dollars 466m, or 91 cents a share a year earlier, due largely to a benefit from a change in accounting for income taxes. Excluding this benefit, earnings of the Chicago-based energy producer rose 6 per cent to Dollars 492m. Refining and marketing income rose to Dollars 214m from Dollars 129m, due to wider refining margins. On the other hand, earnings from exploration and production fell steeply, both in the US and internationally. The drop was due to lower natural gas prices, a fall in domestic crude oil output and higher exploration expenses. Olin, the Connecticut-based chemicals and special metals producer, took an Dollars 80m charge in the first quarter as part of a restructuring. Other measures include a 10 per cent cut in the salaried workforce and the sale of several businesses. These include industrial phosphates, electronic chemical and inter-connect operations, and some small chemical and metal product lines. As a result Olin suffered a first-quarter loss of Dollars 59m (Dollars 2.20 a share), against earnings of Dollars 32m (Dollars 1.60 a share) a year earlier.

But this was partly offset by an increase in earnings from the company's overseas divisions. On 12 months' turnover of Pounds 10.25bn (Pounds 10.49bn) group pre-tax profits came out at Pounds 1.05bn, after exceptional charges of Pounds 320m, compared with Pounds 1.71bn. Mr Philip Rogerson, British Gas's director of finance, pointed to a strong improvement in fourth quarter profits at the exploration and production division, where income doubled from Pounds 60m to Pounds 128m, following the increase in production at its South Morecambe bay field in the North Sea. For the full year, exploration and production, where most revenues come from overseas, increased slightly to Pounds 224m compared with Pounds 221m. The overseas gas supply business saw a rise in profits for the year to Pounds 137m, against Pounds 125m, following an increase in sales volumes abroad and a drop in the purchase price of gas. The rise came mainly in the fourth quarter, which accounted for Pounds 42m (Pounds 33m). Mr Robert Evans, chairman, said the overseas divisions provided a 'welcome contribution,' to profits, accounting for roughly 25 per cent of the total. He hoped the two divisions would provide 60 per cent of profits by the end of the decade. The profits of the UK gas business fell from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 1.2bn last year. Factors behind the decline were the warmer weather, which accounted for Pounds 140m of the drop; the squeeze on prices as a result of the tough new formula imposed by the regulator, leading to a fall of Pounds 50m; and the loss of market share in the industrial market, taking out Pounds 70m. Non-gas costs also increased and pipeline revenues improved. In the final quarter of 1992, the UK gas business showed a roughly stable profit of Pounds 626m, compared with Pounds 636m. Earnings per share were 15.8p for the full year, compared with 27.3p. In the final quarter earnings per share were 5.4p (11.3p). The company declared a final dividend of 7.8p, which made a total for the year of 14.2p - a rise of some 6 per cent from 10.25p for the previous 12 months. Mr Rogerson said: 'The policy of increasing the dividend in real terms and the ability to maintain it depends to a significant degree on the outcome of the MMC inquiry.' British Gas is currently under review by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The company had a net cash outflow of Pounds 1.5bn, slightly higher than analysts had forecast. This was chiefly because of heavier tax and dividend payments during the 12 months after changing the reporting period from the tax year to the calendar year. British Gas's level of gearing rose to 33 per cent from 25 per cent.   Companies:-  British Gas.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4923 Gas Transmission and Distribution.

According to the report:    * Argentina's oil reserves are one-third lower than the country claims, and its  oil output could fall by almost 40% by the end of the century.    * Gas reserves, seen as the key to future energy development in the South  American nation, are also smaller than the Argentine state oil company has  calculated.    * Plans for additional nuclear power plants should be scrapped in favor of more  economical alternatives.    World Bank economists and oil industry analysts see an opportunity for  Argentina to expand its oil exploration and production in the wake of Iraq's  invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, which has led to a doubling in the price of oil.    Rafael Quijano, an analyst with the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd., a  consulting firm in Washington, said in a recent study for the U.S. Department  of Energy that only a small fraction of Argentina's territory, estimated at 10%  to 20%, has been tested for oil.    For Argentina to take advantage of the Middle East crisis, Quijano said, it  needs a coherent oil development policy.    The administration of President Carlos S. Menem, who took power in July, 1989,  is trying to liberalize traditional Argentine energy policies with ""bold""  measures to spur domestic and foreign investment.    But Quijano contended that there now are too many policy conflicts among  Menem's ministers, and turf battles among the federal government and provincial  authorities, to entice foreign capital to participate in oil exploration and  production in Argentina.    Such participation is badly needed if the country is to increase its weak oil  output and expand the size of its reserves, both of which have declined since  1981.    The Argentine state oil company, Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales, includes in  its estimates a significant volume of oil reserves ""classified under the unique  concept termed 'conditional reserves' "" that are not recoverable under existing  economic conditions, the report said.    To obtain reserve volumes in agreement with ""currently acceptable definitions,""  the bank revised the official YPF estimates, excluding those reserves for which  no production technology exists or for which there are no processing and  transportation facilities.    The bank calculated that Argentina's proven oil reserves were 1.41 billion  barrels at the beginning of 1988, with little change during 1989 -- 35% lower  than YPF's estimates.    Projecting into the future, the World Bank estimates that Argentine crude oil  output could drop from about 165 million barrels in 1990 to 101 million in the  year 2000, a 39% loss.    Under the bank's ""minimum supply scenario,"" by the year 2010 crude oil  production would plunge to 30 million barrels a year and to 18 million barrels  by 2014.    Downstream from well production, the Argentine oil sector is hobbled by other  serious problems, the bank said.    YPF, responsible for most of Argentina's oil output and processing, suffered  total losses of $1.7 billion in 1987 and $1.8 billion in 1988, the bank said,  and its refineries are ""grossly inefficient energy consumers"" and suffer high  levels of production losses.    Oil export prospects, in turn, are jeopardized by inadequate port facilities.    While the bank said Argentina has developed the largest nuclear power program  in South America, it advised the country to ""eliminate new nuclear plants from  the (energy) development program"" since they would not be as economical as  other power-generating options.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:           I. Introduction        A sizeable increase in the number of alternatively fueled motor vehicles, including electric vehicles (EVs), in the United States is expected. This expectation stems from initiatives by the President, Congress, State and local governments, and private interests, since these vehicles could help reduce air pollution and conserve petroleum fuel.    The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 include provisions that promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Under these Amendments, fleet vehicles sold in geographic areas with the most serious air pollution problems will be subject to emission standards that will require the use of clean fuels, including methanol and ethanol, reformulated gasoline, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and electric power.    In addition, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT) requires Federal, State, and alternative fuel provider fleets to acquire increasing percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles. The Department of Energy is in the process of initiating a rulemaking, as required by EPACT, to determine if private fleets should also be required to purchase certain percentages of alternatively fueled vehicles as part of their new fleet acquisitions.    Executive branch initiatives will also encourage the increased use of alternatively fueled vehicles. Executive Order 12844, dated April 21, 1993, directs that purchases of alternatively fueled vehicles by the Federal government by substantially increased beyond the levels required by current law. It also established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to accelerate the commercialization and market acceptance of alternatively fueled vehicles throughout the country.    A primary impetus for introduction of large numbers of EVs in the U.S. market is a regulation of the California Air Resources Board. Similar regulations are under consideration by other States. The California regulation requires that not less than two percent of a manufacturer's sales in the State (roughly 40,000 vehicles total) must be zero emission vehicles (ZEVs), beginning in model year 1998. This requirement will increase to 10 percent or roughly 200,000 vehicles beginning in model year 2003. The definition of a ZEV is a vehicle that emits no exhaust or evaporative emission of any kind. Currently, the EV is the only vehicle which meets these requirements.    The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is authorized by law (49 U.S.C. 3010130169) to regulate the safety performance of motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment through the issuance of Federal motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSSs). In addition, NHTSA has the authority to issue guidelines for States to use in state motor vehicle inspection programs.

As a result, local and state growers may lose the use of some pesticides, which  emit ozone-causing hydrocarbons. At the very least, manufacturers will likely  have to reformulate their California-sold products to use bases other than  petroleum products, and their costs will rise.    With Ventura County under federal order to clean up its air, and with  pesticides accounting for up to 28% of reactive organic compounds that  contribute to ozone pollution, something had to be done, said Richard Baldwin,  the county's air pollution control officer.    ""If I can't touch 28% of emissions, I've got an impossible task to attain the  federal ozone standard,"" Baldwin said. ""I probably can't do it."" Baldwin heads  a new statewide panel charged with devising methods to decrease pollution in  agriculture and other businesses that depend on pesticides.    Baldwin's panel, composed of representatives from federal and state agriculture  and environmental agencies, the    chemical and farm industries and air pollution control districts, will  recommend new rules to the state Air Resources Board or the state Department of  Food and Agriculture.    Ventura County, along with the Los Angeles area, meets neither federal nor  state clean air standards for ozone pollution. Ozone, the gas that makes up 95%  of smog, is formed when reactive organic compounds mix with nitrogen oxides in  sunlight.    As in paint and spray deodorants, the petroleum solvents in some pesticides  emit ozone-forming hydrocarbons. Solvents are ingredients in which the  pest-killing chemicals dissolve, so they can be applied.    Baldwin previously had been unwilling to act alone to impose regulations on  county growers because that would have made their prices uncompetitive  statewide. But since the state Air Resources Board recently brought pesticides  under its jurisdiction, growers in all counties would be hit with the same  restrictions.    And that could be catastrophic, said Merlin Fagan, environmental affairs  director for the California Farm Bureau Federation, an association of 90,000  growers statewide.    Fagan estimated that more than 80% of pesticides used in California are  petroleum-based.    If pesticides had to be reformulated or were simply unavailable, the  $16-billion agricultural industry could be strapped with production costs well  above its competitors in other states, Fagan said.    ""We're not afraid do our share for air pollution, but if we're going to shift  the cost curve to make us not competitive, it might become more cost-effective  for growers and ranchers to subdivide and develop,"" he said.    Despite grower opposition, Baldwin sees now as the time to act. Growers  question the accuracy of the 28% figure. They say more accurate reporting of  petroleum-based pesticide use is needed before new regulations are issued. And  they protest the loss of any weapons in their fight against pests. Still, they  realize the economic importance of reducing crop-damaging ozone pollution, said  Rex Laird, director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau, an alliance of growers,  and a member of Baldwin's panel.    ""There is no question in anybody's mind that pollution harms agriculture,"" he  said. ""We have a vested interest in this.""    Studies by the Air Pollution Research Center at the UC Riverside show that  ozone pollution reduces yields and stunts growth in plants and trees. Just as  it attacks the tissue of human lungs, ozone attacks the cell membranes of  plants and trees and thwarts the spreading of tree roots.    The effects are obvious.    ""On Labor Day or Memorial Day when the cars are bumper to bumper, any lettuce  planted near the 101 gets burned because of the smog, and the effects lessen  the farther away from the roadside you get,"" said Phil Phillips, a farm adviser  with the University of California extension office in Ventura.    The benefits of reducing the emissions that cause air pollution are clear, but  the solution may be more elusive. Among the challenges Baldwin's panel faces is  devising rules that will eliminate or reduce the use of oil-based solvents in  pesticides without creating new problems. For instance, one solution being  considered is to require manufacturers to reformulate pesticides, using water  as their base instead of the popular solvent, xylene.    That presents at least three serious problems, said Pradip Mookerjee, a chemist  with Chevron Chemical Co., a major pesticide manufacturer based in Richmond,  Va.    First, only about one-third of the pesticides most widely used will dissolve in  water, and to reformulate is very expensive, he said. But if the pesticides are  soluble in water, they will break down when their particles leach into the  ground water, as well.    ""If the product is water-soluble, there is a high probability that it will  leach through the soil and contaminate water,"" he said.    Mookerjee, who is also on Baldwin's panel, sees a potential problem if the  rules apply to the pure petroleum oil that citrus growers spray directly on  their orchards to fight various pests. The oil, which contains no added  chemical poisons, is applied before the fruit appears on the trees, spreading a  suffocating film over the insects.    ""In the modern ecological sense, this is an ideal pesticide,"" Mookerjee said.  ""But the volume of use is quite high.""    But because the oil vaporizes far more slowly than the solvents used in  standard pesticides, it may well be left out of the new rules, Mookerjee said.    After the panel has done its work and the new regulations are in place, the  real problem may come in enforcement, said John Taylor, manager of Puregro of  Oxnard, which sells and applies pesticides.    ""You've got one or two guys running around the whole county to enforce the laws  that already exist,"" he said, referring to the pesticide enforcement agents  with the county Agricultural Commissioner's office. ""I'm all for cleaning up  the air, but when they are just blowing smoke, it's depressing.""    The big agribusinesses will comply with the rules voluntarily, he said. ""But go  out to the farm and see if they comply now. I know they're not.""    POLLUTION FIGHT -- Computer study finds county must reduce smog by 40%.

III. Procedures for Withdrawal of Request         Registrants who choose to withdraw a request for cancellation must submit such withdrawal in writing to James A. Hollins, at the address given above, postmarked before June 15, 1994. This written withdrawal of the request for cancellation will apply only to the applicable 6(f)(1) request listed in this notice. If the product(s) have been subject to a previous cancellation action, the effective date of cancellation and all other provisions of any earlier cancellation action are controlling. The withdrawal request must also include a commitment to pay any reregistration fees due, and to fulfill any applicable unsatisfied data requirements.         IV. Provisions for Disposition of Existing Stocks         The effective date of cancellation will be the date of the cancellation order. The orders effecting these requested cancellations will generally permit a registrant to sell or distribute existing stocks for 1year after the date the cancellation request was received. This policy is in accordance with the Agency's statement of policy as prescribed in Federal Register     No. 123, Vol. 56, dated June 26, 1991. Exceptions to this general rule will be made if a product poses a risk concern, or is in noncompliance with reregistration requirements, or is subject to a data call-in. In all cases, product-specific disposition dates will be given in the cancellation orders.     Existing stocks are those stocks of registered pesticide products which are currently in the United States and which have been packaged, labeled, and released for shipment prior to the effective date of the cancellation action. Unless the provisions of an earlier order apply, existing stocks already in the hands of dealers or users can be distributed, sold or used legally until they are exhausted, provided that such further sale and use comply with the EPA-approved label and labeling of the affected product(s). Exceptions to these general rules will be made in specific cases when more stringent restrictions on sale, distribution, or use of the products or their ingredients have already been imposed, as in Special Review actions, or where the Agency has identified significant potential risk concerns associated with a particular chemical.

In an interview quoted by Iran's IRNA news agency, Mr Aqazadeh said the oil ministry was drawing up extensive exploration plans to 1999, with priority given to border areas. The minister said seismographic works in an area measuring several thousand square kilometres in the Caspian Sea would be carried out before the end of the year. Mr Aqazadeh said Iran's estimated gas reserves of 20 trillion cubic metres and oil deposits of 92bn barrels would last 400 and 60 years, respectively, at production rates just above the current levels.

Lord Ashburton, the chairman who led the coup against the former chairman and chief executive Mr Robert Horton, is to retire next July 1. He will be succeeded by Mr David Simon, the current chief executive. He in turn will be succeeded by Mr John Browne, head of the company's exploration arm. Lord Ashburton had always intended to step down after three years as chairman, and the changes announced yesterday were 'an example of continuity'. The timing of the announcement, on Budget Day, was dictated by the need to inform staff before a top-level planning session for 1995 which begins tonight. Those involved in the changes stressed that they did not imply any shift in the strategy which BP set itself after the ousting of Mr Horton. This is based on a drive to reduce the company's large debts, tighten the integration of its operations, and achieve 'disciplined growth'. All the executives involved in the reshuffle have been closely involved in managing BP's recovery from the losses which resulted from Mr Horton's expansionist strategies. Mr Simon, who took over as chief executive in 1992, will become a non-executive chairman, spending three or four days a week at BP. He said it was important to separate the role of chairman and chief executive. Mr Browne, who is 47, has held a variety of posts at BP including group treasurer. Most recently he headed a successful expansion of the company's oil and gas reserves. The new head of exploration will be Mr Rodney Chase, the managing director with responsibility for the western hemisphere and corporate affairs. Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, the downstream arm, will take on a new set of responsibilities to oversee the further integration of the group. His position will be taken by Mr Rolf Stomberg who heads BP's European oil operations. The announcement of the changes comes at the end of a year in which BP's finances have staged a solid recovery. In the first quarter, the company paid its first dividend increase since the coup, and by the third quarter it had reduced its debts from Dollars 16bn to around Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6bn). The company has also been boosted by substantial oil discoveries in Colombia and west of Shetlands, as well as a recent gas find in Vietnam. Mr Browne intended to seek further growth for the company by emphasising the role of gas. He also saw opportunities to 'deepen' BP's position in the refining and downstream markets, such as in eastern Europe and Asia. BP's chemicals business had undergone expansion which would enable it to take advantage of the current upswing in chemical markets. Mr Simon said that BP's dividend policy would continue to be reviewed on a a quarterly basis. 'We would like to progressively grow the dividend if we have a sustainable financial performance,' he said.   Companies:-  British Petroleum.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The information provided by Octavio Castilla, vice minister  for foreign investments and economic cooperation, indicated the  Cuban Government has been invited to present its proposals for  foreign investment and trade at this conference, which will be  held at the Nacional Hotel on 20 to 22 June.    The participants include Former Spanish Economics Minister  Carlos Solchaga; Cristine Stewart, Canadian minister of state  for Latin America and Africa; and six executives from the  Canadian Sherrit Company, which is cosponsoring the meeting. The  Canadian company is also an important investor in Cuba's  petroleum sector.    The organizers' original list of approximately 60 people has  doubled. They indicated that the reason for the event is the  dramatic changes in the Cuban economy, especially Cuba's policy  of opening up to foreign investment and its efforts to diversify  its foreign markets.    The introductory program distributed by THE ECONOMIST stated  that Cuba's current severe difficulties present enormous  challenges to the companies interested in the small Caribbean  nation. But far from detracting interest, this situation seems  to add incentives, judging from the participation in the  conference for which THE ECONOMIST set a registration fee of  $1,500.    Great Britain heads the list of participants with 29  businessmen, Canada follows with 28, Spain with 16, Germany with  13, Italy with seven, the Netherlands with five, and the United  States with 10, including two Cuban-Americans. Latin America  will participate with, among others, four delegates from  Colombia, three from Mexico, and three from Venezuela.    The program calls for an analysis of Cuba's current economic  situation and its outlook, international relations and regional  integration, monetary policy and banking system, trade policy,  industrialization strategy, incentives for foreign investment,  and testimony by investors in Cuba.    According to the organizers, the meeting, which is called  ""Second Round Table With the Cuban Government,"" will enable  international investors and corporate executives to familiarize  themselves with and debate the aspects of Cuba that are of most  interest to them. The meeting will also include panels of  businessmen who are experienced in business dealings with Cuba.  These include Bert Denkers, general manager of the ING bank of  the Netherlands, and Michihiro Sindo, president of Daisin  International of Japan. As part of the round table, there will  also be workshops on key sectors of the Cuban economy, such as  the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, tourism, and  energy and mines.    Castilla said the participants include seven mining firms,  five tourism companies, five automobile industry  representatives, five consultants, and a similar number from the  academic sphere -- university researchers on Cuba. The Cuban  vice minister indicated that similar events were held in 1992  and 1993. They were organized by the British Euromoney  publishing house and successfully made known business and  investment opportunities in Cuba.    On this occasion, the meeting is enhanced by the promising  discovery of petroleum on the island -- precisely with the  participation of Sherritt from Canada -- and the profitable  operation of other firms involved in the tourism sector and  nickel mining, as well as the process of economic reforms whose  most recent chapter involved financial reorganization measures.    Official Cuban sources commented that an additional draw for  the participants is the on-site analysis of the limitations and  the cracks in the U.S. blockade against Cuba.     "
0,FT932-9727 ,"FT932-9727 _AN-DELCNAGAFT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chinese bank's gold trade monopoly under threat      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   THE PEOPLE'S Bank, China's gold-purchasing agency, is facing increasing challenges to its gold trade monopoly at a time of rapidly rising demand for the precious metal among Chinese consumers. The establishment of a flourishing gold market in northern Liaoning province near the Soviet border almost certainly poses the most severe threat in years to the People's Bank's domination of the gold trade. 'Some stores trade gold bars, not just gold jewellery. See that's serious. Of course, we're worried there will be more such markets,' said a People's Bank official this week. In an official statement the People's Bank, the country's central bank, has accused those responsible for the Liaoning market of spreading disorder in the gold jewellery market. It charged that gold merchants had 'harassed' the state purchase plan. Under present rules, the bank is empowered to acquire all gold produced in China at about Yuan50 (USDollars 8.70) a gram, two-thirds of the world price. Miners blame the depressed purchase price for lagging production, which reached about 110 tonnes last year, compared with demand of 250 tonnes. The China Daily said this week that the authorities were considering sweeping reforms, including price-reform, in the gold sector to boost production. The paper reported that gold production had declined in the first quarter this year, although it also observed that some miners may be withholding production from the state for sale on the booming local market. Under China's present five-year plan (1991-1995) USDollars 1.3bn of investment in gold mines is proposed with the aim of increasing production by 40 per cent by 1996. At present rates of production growth it seems unlikely China that will reach that target. News of the Liaoning gold market and reports that Beijing is considering seriously the establishment of a Gold Exchange coincide with reports that China has emerged as the world's largest gold consumer. According to Gold Fields Mineral Services in its annual report 'Gold 1993' Chinese passion for gold jewellery, a desire by Chinese to hedge against a depreciating currency and heavy gold purchases by the People's Bank contributed to the gold buying spree. The report said that the Chinese central bank might have purchased a substantial portion of the 400 tonnes of gold sold by the Netherlands central bank last year. China has not published gold reserve figures since 1981. The People's Bank official described the Liaoning market as 'a very sensitive problem'', adding that the State Council, or Cabinet, had not resolved what to do about the unauthorised gold dealing, which appears to have been sanctioned by local officials, but not necessarily by the provincial government. Chinese officials have recently indicated an interest in involving foreign mining companies in the exploration and exploitation of China's gold deposits, but this would require amendments to regulations that expressly forbid such foreign involvement. China has devoted much of its minerals exploration and development budget to the search for gold in the past two decades with limited success. Estimates of in-ground gold reserves stand at about 3,000 tonnes and were being added to at the rate of about 10 per cent annually.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1041 Gold Ores.

By IVANA STEPANKOVA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The United States risks losing an unusual opportunity to assert global  leadership in protecting Antarctica, Sen. Albert Gore (D-Tenn.) said Thursday  on the eve of an international conference on the future of the frozen  continent.    Gore spoke at a news conference sponsored by the Alliance for Antarctica, a  coalition of environmental groups. It is calling on the United States and other  nations participating in the conference, which begins Monday in Chile, to  designate Antarctica as a world science park.    Rep. Bruce Vento (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on  parks and public land, said he fears that recurring degradation has made  Antarctica ""an environmental time bomb ready to explode.""    ""We have no time for half-measures if America is to be the world's leader in  protecting Antarctica,"" Vento said.    Congressional legislation calling for preservation of Antarctica is awaiting  President Bush's signature, but there has been speculation that the Interior  Department might urge Bush to veto the measure. The legislation for the first  time would apply U.S. environmental protection laws to any activity in  Antarctica sponsored by an agency of the U.S. government. It also would  prohibit U.S. exploration or development of minerals in Antarctica.    The United States ""should be leading the way and trying to protect the island  instead of trying to protect the mineral convention,"" said Rep. Wayne Owens  (D-Utah), who introduced the measure in the House. Gore was its Senate sponsor.    The focus of a dispute between Congress and the State Department is the  ratification of the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resources  Activities, on which the State Department has worked for six years.    The convention, signed two years ago but not ratified by 17 of 20 nations,  would regulate mineral exploration but not ban it, as the congressional action  would. The French and Australian governments are now against the accord, saying  that no international agreement that would endorse even strictly regulated  exploitation of Antarctic mineral resources could be acceptable to either  government. If all 20 nations do not ratify the pact, it is dead.    Mining in the Antarctic is not compatible with the protection of the  continent's fragile environment, many environmentalists contend. French  oceanologist Jacques Cousteau, in an interview with the New York Times last  year, declared that an oil spill in the Antarctic could damage the food chain  for decades and affect the entire hemisphere.    But Tucker Scully, director of the office of ocean affairs at the State  Department and the lead U.S. negotiator for Antarctic issues, disagreed with  the hands-off approach to the continent. ""Creating a world park is to stick  one's head in the sand,"" he said.    According to environmentalists, Antarctica is being marred by air pollution and  tourist ships and threatened by mining. They also believe that the continent is  being damaged by scientists who come to unlock its mysteries. They burn their  garbage in pits and dump their junk in a landfill by the sea, they charge.    ""We treated Antarctica like a frontier town,"" said R. N. Andersen, the National  Science Foundation's deputy general counsel. Congress has funded a five-year,  $30-million program to clean up the Antarctic environment. More than 76  scientific projects are now under way on the continent.    During the peak summer months, about 4,000 people inhabit Antarctica, and  tourism is increasing rapidly.

0,FT921-10105 ,"FT921-10105 _AN-CBGA3AFJFT 920207   FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Conroy steams into lead-zinc minefield - The upcoming tussle for power on the board of the Irish natural resources group      By KENNETH GOODING   MR RICHARD Conroy, the man in the middle of an unprecedented Irish corporate saga, has achieved much. He has proved his worth as an academic, politician and entrepreneur. But the odds seem very much against him retaining his chairmanship of Conroy Petroleum  Natural Resources, a company he founded and which is now under siege by its two biggest shareholders. Outraged by what they suggest is his autocratic style and an unnecessary acquisition, Outokumpu, the state-owned Finnish mining and industrial group, and Dundee Bancorp, a company which sprang from the recent reorganisation of Canada's Corona natural resources concern, want to replace the entire Conroy board. A special meeting to vote on their proposals will take place on Saturday in Dublin and such is the passionate interest roused it seems certain that there will be no room for latecomers. All the sound and fury is about something as unsexy as a lead-zinc ore body. This is located at Galmoy in County Kilkenny. Though modest by world standards, it is very significant in the context of Ireland's natural resources. It is also of intense interest to Outokumpu, which already owns Tara, Ireland's biggest lead-zinc mine, and has been scouring the world for more raw material to feed its smelters in Finland. Outokumpu suggests that Conroy is taking far too long to get Galmoy into production - six years after its discovery planning permission is apparently still months away. It also insists that the recent Pounds 7.7m takeover by Conroy of Atlantic Resources, the natural resources vehicle of the ubiquitous Mr Tony O'Reilly, was not was also a diversion from Conroy's primary objective: getting metal out of Galmoy. The irate shareholders say the only apparent reason for the Atlantic deal was to dilute their stakes in Conroy. Mr Conroy counters by producing figures to show that Atlantic's assets were worth every penny paid and he says that a cash injection for Conroy from Mr O'Reilly personally, which came at the time of the deal, was also useful and well-timed. While it might seem extraordinary that Mr Conroy did not discuss the Atlantic deal beforehand with Outokumpu, then a 27.6 per cent shareholder, the fact is that he and the Finns have been at loggerheads for some time. Two Outokumpu representatives on the board quit last year after one of them, Mr Graham Mascall, made some public comments about the Conroy share price which upset Mr Conroy. Mr Conroy, say his detractors, is impossible to work with. However, that is not immediately apparent from his mild and courteous demeanour. His background certainly equips him to deal with practically anything the world can throw at him. After winning first place in examinations at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin in 1956 he started a successful academic career at Manchester University where he lectured for a number of years. While in Manchester he experience the first entrepreneurial stirrings when he saw the need for a medical emergency deputising (locum) service. With his brother, Desmond, also a medical doctor, he set up a service and it still covers nearly 3m people in the Greater Manchester area. In 1970, at the age of 35, he returned to his alma mater when he was appointed professor of Physiology at the Royal College, a post he still holds. He became one of the foremost authorities on circadian rhythms or the 'body clock' and became an expert on 'jet lag'. His meetings with senior executives about this gave him a different perspective on business, he says. So did his more recent work on the physiological aspects of decision-making. He became a Fianna Fail senator in the Irish Parliament, was government spokesman on foreign affairs, and is said to be a good friend of Mr Charles Haughey. After leading a delegation to the Middle East in 1973 after the first oil crisis, he decided with his brother to set up a natural resources company, Trans International Oil, in Ireland to search for oil offshore. In 1980 the brothers formed Conroy, also to develop Ireland's petroleum and mineral resources. It was just another junior exploration company until 1986 when the Galmoy deposit was discovered with its potential to produce perhaps 70,000 tonnes of zinc a year. Outokumpu's arrival on the scene was at first hailed as a coup. As one of the world's leading mining and metals processing groups, Outokumpu gave the Galmoy project increased credibility. It was also widely anticipated that the Finns would eventually take over Conroy. Now Mr Conroy complains that Outokumpu and Dundee hope, by replacing the board, to take over the company without paying other shareholders for the privilege. Emotions are now running high, particularly as it is possible to put different interpretations on the same set of facts. For example, Outokumpu says that since 1987 it has made cumulative profits of about Dollars 50m from the Tara mine. None of this has been repatriated to Finland but has been ploughed back into a range of Irish ventures, including Tara, Conroy and on a 24.5 per cent stake in Ivernia West, another company with a juicy-looking lead-zinc deposit not far from Galmoy. Outokumpu says this is evidence of its commitment to Ireland. Its critics say this is evidence of the nationalisation of Ireland's mining industry, not by the Irish but by the Finnish government. Mr Conroy says he is confident about the outcome of the special meeting. Holding it on a Saturday should ensure that nearly every shareholder who wants to attend will be there. But his board controls less than 15 per cent of Conroy whereas, even after the Atlantic deal, his opponents speak for 43 per cent. And the directors can be dismissed by a straight majority vote.

In reality, their progress is not so smooth. True, the latest dip in the oil price is unlikely to interrupt the companies' long-term exploration and production plans - as long as it proves short-lived. But it will force the oil majors to give a further painful turn of the screw to the extensive cost-cutting they have already undertaken. And it will make more unattainable the goal of achieving a satisfactory return on capital. Most say their investment plans, while based on an oil price somewhat higher than the current level, are tested against prices of Dollars 15 a barrel or less. That makes them able to withstand troughs in the oil market. Nor do the big oil groups believe prices will stay at present levels for a sustained period. 'We don't see any deep fundamental change in our view (as a result of the recent price fall),' says Mr Ken Haley, manager of energy forecasting at Chevron. 'The market is at the lower end of its long-term sustainable level,' which Chevron puts at Dollars 18-Dollars 23 a barrel. Mr Alfred DeCrane, chairman and chief executive of Texaco, also expresses optimism about the price of oil: 'We haven't bet the store on it going up - but I haven't sold my stock.' He adds, though, that in the short term, lower prices mean 'we won't be getting in the front door what we thought we would be getting'. The fall in upstream earnings as a result of lower oil prices will put the energy groups under even greater pressure to husband their cash resources to support the investments necessary for long-term success. For two reasons, those investments are likely to get bigger rather than smaller. First, exploration and development spending is being ploughed into ever-bigger ventures outside the US in pursuit of the sort of massive discoveries which will provide long-term returns. Most mature US fields are no longer worth developing for big companies with large overheads to cover, while potential new large finds in Alaska or beyond the US's continental shelf are put out of reach by environmental concerns. A falling oil price has further reduced the attractions of exploring for oil in the US. Tax rates on oil production in the US are lower than in most overseas areas: this means that, when prices fall, the producer suffers more. In overseas markets, more of that pain is born by the taxpayer (the opposite is true when prices rise.) Not surprisingly, with the exception of a handful of giant fields in deep water areas of the Gulf of Mexico, all the talk in the US now is of the development work in the former Soviet republics, the East China Sea or the North Sea. Investment budgets have followed this change in emphasis. Texaco's capital spending in the US has averaged Dollars 1.77bn a year over the past five years and is projected to continue unchanged at this level for the next five. Investment outside the US, by contrast, is expected to rise from Dollars 1.45bn a year to an average Dollars 2.12bn. Likewise, Chevron says three quarters of its Dollars 2.6bn capital investment on upstream activities this year has been spent outside the US. To support this move overseas, and at the same time cut costs, most US groups have disposed of marginal on-shore US fields. Texaco had 1,000 US oil and gas fields three years ago: by the end of next year, the number will be down to under 500. The second significant need for cash is in the US, where ever-more demanding environmental standards are forcing companies to upgrade their refineries both to produce cleaner fuels and to cut their own emissions. Few companies think they will be able to recover through higher fuel prices much of what they spend on revamping their refineries. Chevron, the largest refiner in the US, has put two refineries up for sale, representing around a quarter of its US refining capacity. 'It may not make sense to invest in all sites,' says Mr Donald Schmude of Texaco, which is also reviewing whether it can afford to upgrade all its US refinery facilities. In part, the refinery sales are part of a broader rationalisation of the US refining and marketing system. A flat gasoline market has forced companies to rethink their marketing strategies, concentrating their service stations into regional groupings close to their own refineries in an effort to cut costs and build market share. Service stations or refineries that do not fit into this pattern have been sold first. So far, refineries have changed hands rather than close down altogether. That could change, though, when the next phase of federal rules on gasoline standards comes into force at the beginning of 1995, says Mr DeCrane of Texaco: 'the need to spend to keep those refineries open will rise, and there will be closures of refineries in the US.' Against a domestic background of shrinking exploration and production and a downstream business facing significant (and probably irrecoverable) investment, it is not surprising that the US energy industry is living in reduced circumstances. By building reserves abroad, though, US oil is laying down the foundation for a more significant international presence well into the 21st century.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

0,FT943-2308 ,"FT943-2308 _AN-EITEUAC6FT 940920   FT  20 SEP 94 / Technology: A new field of exploration - The oil industry could be revolutionised by a software standards project in Houston      By ROBERT CORZINE   The half-a-dozen Texas oil men and computer industry executives sitting round a boardroom table in Houston last week bore little resemblance to die-hard revolutionaries. Sipping soft drinks, their demeanour was more that of correct corporate citizens. But their rhetoric revealed a true believer's commitment to nothing less than the wholesale destruction of the current structure of the world oil industry. Their chosen weapon is a new set of software operating standards being developed by the Houston-based Petrotechnical Open Software Corporation (Posc), a non-profit organisation set up in 1990 by British Petroleum, Chevron, Mobil and Texaco of the US and Elf Aquitaine of France, five of the world's biggest international oil companies. If implemented, the standards should ease the growing problem of data management and incompatible computer communication systems within one of the world's most technologically-intensive industries. And that could lead to early cost reductions in the 'upstream' exploration and production end of the oil and gas business. But the real power of the new standards is that they would enable companies to break down the barriers that have been built up over decades between the various technical and scientific disciplines involved in oil and gas exploration. Posc technology can be 'a destroyer of current organisations', according to Larry Gehagen, a BP executive seconded to the corporation. He believes that adoption of an industry-wide computing standard will be as important to oil companies as the adoption of a common gauge for track was to US railways in the last century. The result, he predicts, will be a radical restructuring of oil companies, with whole layers of bureaucracy being abolished. It could also usher in the era of the 'virtual oil company', in which small teams of specialists located around the world exchange complex geological and scientific data in near real time via information superhighways. That prospect, according to a Posc executive, caused one Alaskan oil man to note recently that: 'If this thing really works, one man and his dog could develop an oil field. And you might not even need the dog.' Several of the large computer groups and software suppliers such as IBM, Digital and Hewlett-Packard, are co-operating with the Posc project, along with government agencies such as the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK and the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The need for a unified data and computer communication model for the exploration and production industry has long been recognised, according to Posc supporters. But attempts by companies, even the largest ones such as Exxon, to integrate the various technical functions failed because of the high costs involved. The scale of the problem has been exacerbated in recent years as exploration and production companies experienced an explosion of data from new seismic and other scientific techniques which have been developed. The current structure of most oil companies has also proved to be a problem. At present, most are divided into functional departments, such as geology, petrophysics and reservoir engineering, a structure which industry executives say tends to reinforce existing cultural differences between the groups. Traditionally, these departments have operated in relative isolation, and over the years they have tended to acquire unique solutions to their technical problems, both in terms of computer hardware and software. The result, according to Posc executives, is that information held by one department is often inaccessible by, or unknown to, another. In addition, the inability of the departments to share information without reformatting it to different standards has reinforced a linear corporate structure. And that has made it difficult to put in place the inter-disciplinary teams that many industry executives believe are the most effective way to organise the industry. Gehagen notes that the poor standard of data management within the industry can have expensive consequences. One company recently mobilised its resources for an urgent seismic survey in a portion of the Gulf of Mexico in advance of a US government auction of oil leases. At the last minute one member of staff remembered that some years before the company had not only conducted a seismic survey of the area, but had also drilled some inconclusive wells before handing it back to the government. 'Eighty per cent of data held by oil companies is historical and static,' according to Gehagen. Only 20 per cent is generally in current use, with an even smaller amount considered as secret, commercially strategic information. Even so, many companies jealously guard it, although a large number 'don't know what they have or can't find it' when they need it. All too often the result is that geologists and other professionals can spend up to 60-70 per cent of their time searching for information rather than using their skills to analyse it. One of Posc's main aims is to create standards that make consistent the way in which the industry stores information so that it can can be used more effectively. Handing over the management of such technical data to an outside company which could put it in a Posc-compatible format would save millions of dollars a year for most oil companies, says Gehagen. The development of such large-scale databases open to the industry would also free the various experts within the oil companies to spend the bulk of their time doing their job rather than tracking down data. The opportunity to transfer data easily between disciplines could also result in large cost savings. A recent pilot project in the US estimated that the time taken to drill a new well in an existing oil field could be halved if all disciplines were working to a common data model. 'Exploration and production companies continuously adopt new computing technology,' says Bill Bartz, Posc's president. 'If they proceed without the benefit of standards, they risk incurring unnecessary costs and experiencing critical delays in implementation.' It is that element of Posc technology that could propel oil companies into a radically different future. Most have launched extensive restructuring programmes to save costs in an era of relatively low oil prices. But they 'have slashed and burned without fundamental changes in their business structures,' says Gehagen. He believes that adoption of Posc standards would enable executives to make the best use of the team structure now being promoted by many companies. 'People around the world could be much more productive if they were working with the same underlying system.' The adoption of Posc would also have a big impact on information technology companies, which advise companies on how to implement such far-reaching changes, and on the software houses that supply the industry. The first software products designed to the new standards will begin appearing next year, although industry experts expect it could take three to five years to fully change over.

Finding costs fell to Dollars 3.51 (Pounds 2.40) per barrel of oil equivalent, compared with Dollars 4.41 in 1992. Anything under Dollars 4 is considered good, according to analysts. Revisions to existing reserves helped to boost the reserve replacement figure. Such revisions are often made after new production fields are brought on stream.

The school's reopening this week also clears the way for school administrators  to begin work on a new junior high school in the area.    Park Avenue's 1,100 students had been bused to three schools, including  Elizabeth Street Elementary, which occupies the future site of the junior high  school.    No sooner had Park Avenue students moved out of their temporary classrooms at  Elizabeth Street school than Los Angeles Unified School District planners and  their supervisors descended on the 80-year-old school to review plans to build  a 20-acre junior high school on the site.    School officials have been itching to begin the conversion, which will give  Region B of the Los Angeles Unified School District a desperately needed junior  high. Junior high students now attend three overcrowded schools in the region  -- one in South Gate and two in Huntington Park. Officials plan to begin busing  students from the schools to help ease overcrowding until the Elizabeth Street  junior high is completed, said Gordon Wohlers, administrator of the district's  priority housing program, which finds housing for students.    The new Elizabeth Street junior high will house about 1,600 students, he said.    ""Our junior high schools are just bursting at the seams,"" Elizabeth Street  Principal John Kershaw said.

The school's reopening this week also clears the way for school administrators  to begin work on a new junior high school in the area.    Park Avenue's 1,100 students had been bused to three schools, including  Elizabeth Street Elementary, which occupies the future site of the junior high  school.    No sooner had Park Avenue students moved out of their temporary classrooms at  Elizabeth Street school than Los Angeles Unified School District planners and  their supervisors descended on the 80-year-old school to review plans to build  a 20-acre junior high school on the site.    School officials have been itching to begin the conversion, which will give  Region B of the Los Angeles Unified School District a desperately needed junior  high. Junior high students now attend three overcrowded schools in the region  -- one in South Gate and two in Huntington Park. Officials plan to begin busing  students from the schools to help ease overcrowding until the Elizabeth Street  junior high is completed, said Gordon Wohlers, administrator of the district's  priority housing program, which finds housing for students.    The new Elizabeth Street junior high will house about 1,600 students, he said.    ""Our junior high schools are just bursting at the seams,"" Elizabeth Street  Principal John Kershaw said.

0,FT932-8571 ,"FT932-8571 _AN-DERDAAF8FT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove barriers against foreign miners      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining sector, including gold prospects. Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly China would replace existing legislation. Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold royalties in draft legislation. While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by international standards, especially compared with those in developing countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese flexibility was regarded as a good sign. Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required to exploit this lucrative area. Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners, he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'. He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia; although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would require the approval of the Chinese parliament. Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus facilitating much greater flexibility. Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development. Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous. Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with particularity and clarity,' he observed. Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese. Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'. Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed unlimited rights to export product.

0,FT934-3822 ,"FT934-3822 _AN-DLGD5AFIFT 931207   FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: South African company removes its veil - Mobil divestment Engen is planning its brave new future      By ROBERT CORZINE   Appeals for foreign investment have replaced demands for divestment in the lexicon of most black politicians in South Africa. But some strategic sectors of the South African economy, such as its sprawling defence industry and oil companies, have stayed shrouded in secrecy even as the political process opened up. That veil is now lifting, with international investors being able to assess the long-term viability of some of South Africa's largest companies. Politics, however, still exert a strong influence over the future strategy of many such companies, including Engen, the country's biggest oil company, which was created by the divestment in 1989 of Mobil Oil's South African subsidiary. Unlike other divestments, in which the foreign parent company retained the right to re-acquire its South African assets, the break with Mobil was a 'clean one', according to Mr Rob Angel, chief executive. That, combined with Engen's unbundling last month from Gencor, the industrial and mining group that bought Mobil's assets, has given Mr Angel a free hand. But the absence of international support means the company is subject to domestic constraints, such as a foreign currency shortage, which act as a brake on its ambitions. Engen, which will get the bulk of its Dollars 2.4bn estimated turnover this year from oil refining and marketing in South Africa and neighbouring countries, is keen to use its new-found freedom to add international upstream production to its domestic downstream business. It is also keen to secure a London listing, although such a move will have wait until after next April's election. Greater access to foreign exchange is crucial if Engen is to realise its goal to source 50 per cent of its crude oil needs from its own reserves within 10 years. Mr Chris Sloan, an analyst at Johannesburg stockbrokers Ferguson Brothers, says the lack of foreign exchange is one reason why Engen has 'not been very successful' in its early exploration efforts. 'It means they can't go for the highest quality exploration opportunities.' Mr Angel concedes that Engen has had to pass up acquisition opportunities because of currency restrictions. Its exploration activities are focused on west Africa, where it shares licences with big multi-national oil companies in Angola, Gabon and Namibia. It has a 2.2 per cent share of the Alba field in the North Sea, as well as a small holding in the Britannia gas field and a 10 per cent share in the Bukha gas condensate development off Oman. The company is looking to buy, although it is likely to remain on a small scale until it has greater access to hard currency. Acquisitions are also likely in the downstream side of the business in Africa, says Mr Angel, who wants Engen to have a 'leadership role' in exporting and distributing refined products to the sub-Saharan market. That goal is probably attainable, according to Mr Sloan, who says one legacy of sanctions is the highly efficient refineries which the government encouraged oil companies to build. Engen's main Durban refinery has been subject to a number of upgrades which will boost its capacity to 105,000 barrels a day. That will allow it to capitalise on growing demand in Africa north of the Limpopo river, which forms the border with Zimbabwe, and to which the company's exports have risen from 1.9m barrels in 1991 to 5.7m barrels this year. Deregulation in South Africa's refining and retail market is likely to pose the biggest challenge to Engen's fortunes. 'There is an increasingly public and political debate over the oil industry,' says one Cape Town-based industry analyst, who believes the issue is likely to be left for a new government. Full deregulation of the market is unlikely, but the formula used by the government to set wholesale and retail prices will probably be replaced by a mechanism 'which more accurately reflects world prices', says Mr Sloan. Mr Angel believes deregulation will allow Engen to close some of the low volume units among its 1,500 petrol stations without undermining its 26 per cent market share. But deregulation is also likely to create a new retail competitor. Sasol, the synthetic oil from coal company that provides 45 per cent of the country's petrol, is keen to enter the retail market with its own service stations. At present Sasol is limited to a single pump at the stations of other companies. The government-set floor price for Sasol is Dollars 23 a barrel, compared with current world oil prices of Dollars 16-Dollars 17 a barrel. A new government will be under financial pressures to reduce the protection that Sasol receives, but it will probably hesitate to remove it altogether because of the drastic effect such a step would have on employment at the vast Sasol plants and the coal mines which supply them. The prospect of much fiercer domestic competition and Engen's heavy exposure to refining and marketing lies behind the drive to secure its own sources of crude oil, according to analysts, as a strong production base would allow it to benefit from any increase in crude oil prices. But Mr Angel concedes that only a return to economic growth in South Africa can underpin the company's longer-term performance.   Companies:-  Engen.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Like many other mining projects in the former Soviet Union, this venture involves a small western company - British  Commonwealth Minerals. It has 49 per cent and operating control of the joint venture that has won the rights to an area in the Central Asian nation's Zeravshan Valley containing two mines, both fully-developed, a treatment plant and proven and probable gold reserves estimated at 16m ounces (497 tonnes). The Tajikistan government, which owns the rest of the joint venture, is contributing the exploration rights and about Dollars 500m worth of infrastructure and mining equipment, much of it new, remaining after the former Soviet Union collapsed three years ago. European and Canadian investors last month provided USDollars 40m towards the venture. This was raised by London broker T. Hoare for Nelson Trade  Finance, a Toronto-quoted company that once financed the controversial Hollywood movie, 9 1/2 Weeks. This financing scheme resulted in Nelson, which previously owned 25 per cent of CBM, taking full control. Mr Richard Northcott, chairman of Nelson, said that after costs and payments to the estate of Mr Cameron Glover, who set up CBM and died recently in an air accident in Argentina, about Dollars 30m was available for the Tajik venture. Mr Northcott said that, when more equity funding was needed, Nelson would consider applying for a London stock exchange quotation. In the meantime, both the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank offshoot, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development had been approached to provide debt capital. The joint venture seems likely to be followed by a spate of other mineral deals involving western companies in Central Asia, whose five republics are estimated to contain well over half the former Soviet Union's minerals wealth. Tajikistan itself not only offers gold but has large deposits of silver, antimony and boron. Mineral specialists ask a number of questions about working in Central Asia, issues faced by a multitude of western energy groups that have established local offices. The main issue will probably be political risk - will cash-poor nations like Tajikistan ultimately allow their mineral wealth to be exported, and, if they don't, will they have the money to develop it themselves? A second question is whether Russia, which has been blocking the region from exporting its natural gas and oil, will allow Central Asia to develop its natural wealth independently. Western officials in Tajikistan's capital, Dushanbe, tend to give the Tajik government the benefit of the doubt, but stress that it is too early to be sure. 'You can cut a deal with this government. Whether they honour it is another question,' said one western analyst. 'They haven't really been put to the test yet.' Russia's reaction to all the new activity hasn't been gauged. Yet the deals are piling up, both in Tajikistan and the rest of the region. Only this week, the UK company Gold  Minerals Excavation signed a gold exploration deal for Tajikistan's southern Darwaz region. Canada's Gulf Minerals is looking into a tailings project in the same area, according to Mr Giorgi Kashlakov, a senior economic adviser to the prime minister. Lonrho, the international mining and trading group, meanwhile, after losing out on the Zeravshan mining project, is considering a large antimony-gold deposit in central Tajikistan near Iskanderkul Lake, Mr Kashlakov said. Outside Tajikistan, CBM itself is negotiating to develop gold deposits in the neighbouring Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan. These are in addition to previous gold deals announced by Canada's Cameco in the Kyrgyz Republic, Newmont of the US in Uzbekistan, and a venture involving London Stock Exchange-listed Bakyrchik Gold in Kazakhstan. CBM's success in Tajikistan so far appears attributable to long-cultivated contacts in Tajikistan's extremely complex political sphere. CBM has had an advantage because Mr Richard Wilkins, commercial director of the joint venture company, Zeravshan Gold, has been developing close relationships with both sides in Tajikistan's civil war since 1991. Mr Wilkins is confident that the political risk for CBM is low, and that the company will be able either to ship its gold to market, or sell it to the Tajikistan government for dollars at world prices. 'My job is to keep up contacts with the government,' Mr Wilkins says. 'Even if they overturned the whole leadership and brought in the opposition, it wouldn't worry me.' CBM expects the joint venture to produce its first gold from the Jilau open pit mine where mining and processing is taking place only ten days a month because of lack of funds. By targetting some high grade ore, Jilau could be producing at an annual rate of 80,000 to 100,000 ounces by the end of 1995, suggests Mr Roger Turner, chairman of the joint venture company. More work would be needed at the Taror underground mining complex before production could begin in earnest in 1998, particularly on how the ore, which contains substantial quantities of arsenic, should be treated. Mr Turner pointed out that environmental clean-up was not a problem as the mines and plant were new. However, the joint venture would have to ensure that the mining town of 2,000 people - with its infrastructure of roads, power plant, water and sewage plants as well as a school and hospital - was kept supplied. At present there were shortages of some essentials, such as fuel for central heating. Meanwhile, Tajik Geology has been contracted by CBM to do Dollars 2m of exploration work a year in the Zeravshan Valley.   Companies:-  British and Commonwealth Minerals.

When the first 100,000  metric ton oceangoing freighter ""Dongfeng"" designed and built by  China was checked and accepted by the government in 1968, this  paper said China has put an end to the historical period in  which China had to buy ships from abroad because of its  inability to building big ships. A few days ago, Wang  Rongsheng, president of the China State Shipbuilding  Corporation, told this reporter that China has become a big  shipbuilding country with its shipbuilding tonnage being among  the highest in the world and its orders received ranking third.    The fact that China grew from a country that could only  build  small ships and had to buy ships from foreign countries to a  country that can build big ships and exports a large number of  ships reflects that China's shipbuilding industry has upgraded  its products, improved product quality, and adapted itself to  the change in external and internal markets.    Before 1965, China's shipbuilding industry's total  shipbuilding capacity [zao chuan neng li 6644 5307 5174 0500]  measured 300,000 metric tons and its annual output [nian chan  liang 1628 3934 6852] was 80,000 metric tons. And the 80,000  metric tons was the total tonnage of 517 [figures as published]  ships so the tonnage of ships was very low. Before reform and  the open policy were introduced, China had a long way to go to  match advanced countries in shipbuilding technology because it  basically built ships behind closed doors though it could build  100,000 metric ton ships.    As China carried out reform and opening to the outside  world,  its shipbuilding industry introduced advanced technologies and  equipment from abroad, and after mastering the technology  introduced, greatly improved their designing ability,  shipbuilding skills, and capability to manufacture the main  engine [zhu ji 0031 2623] for ships, thus lifting China's  shipbuilding industry to a new stage. In 1992, the China State  Shipbuilding Corporation's output stood at 1,100,000 metric  tons, hitting a record high. The output increased to 1,300,000  metric tons in 1993, up 20 percent. In this period, China built  a number of large and new types of ships using high technologies  including container ships, big refrigerated ships, automobile  transport ships, and liquid petroleum gas transport ships [shi  you ye hua qi chuan 4258 3111 3210 0553 3086 5307]. These ships  have reached advanced world level and have been put up for sale  in the international market in turn.    Currently, of the over 70 types of ships exported by China,  two thirds were designed in China and some types have found a  ready market abroad. For instance, the 70,000 metric ton bulk  cargo ship built by the Jiangnan Shipyard, and the 98,000 metric  ton petroleum products cargo ship [cheng pin you lun 2052 0756  3111 6544] built by the Dalian Shipyard are reputed as ""Jiangnan  model"" and ""Dalian model"" respectively by international shipping  circles. These two types of ships have been sold in the  international market in batch quantities. China's  ship-designing technology has also began to enter the  international market. China-made main engines for oceangoing  ships have been exported to Germany, Italy, the United States,  and Japan.    China's shipbuilding industry vows to rank itself among  advanced shipbuilding countries in the world by the end of this  century. To achieve this, it is necessary to make enterprise  reform a success in the ""eighth five-year plan"" to lay a sound  foundation, to improve ship-designing expertise comprehensively,  to better coordinate operations of relevant sectors, and to  improve management to enable the shipbuilding industry to make  new progress.

In East Timor, a Portuguese  territory it invaded, Indonesia admitted eventually and  reluctantly that its troops slaughtered about a hundred students  in the infamous Dili massacre. That was the last official  figure. Now stories are emerging of how other people wounded by  troops had their heads smashed in by soldiers, one by one, as  they lay in their own blood in hospital, or were systematically  poisoned. Still later reports, based on observations by western  journalists who risked their lives to learn what is really  happening in East Timor, suggest a scale of systematic murder of  the population. If the reports are accurate, it spells  genocide. If the scale of what the Indonesians are doing to the  East Timorese people is debatable, it obviously is on a scale  enough to mean death, torture, imprisonment, and terror for a  great number of people who would rather not live under corrupt  and dictatorial Indonesian rule.    And so to Western New Guinea. This is a former Dutch  territory which, we shan't tire of reminding our readers, was  handed shamefully to the Indonesians on a plate thanks to a sham  United Nations vote pressured for by the Americans at a time  when it was Washington's policy to do anything at all to curry  favor with anti- Communist Asian regimes.    The Melanesian people of Western New Guinea were never  allowed a scrap of ""self determination""; their fate was  determined for them. Ever since, they have been the victims of  Indonesian colonialism. Many western New Guineas have been  jailed, tortured, and killed for seeking independence for their  country; many continued to be jailed, tortured, and killed.  Various organizations and people critical of Indonesia quote  various figures. These are suspect. But not suspect enough to  deny the truth of reports that show the Indonesian regime in  occupied western New Guinea to be oppressive.    In western New Guinea, the Indonesians are simply probably  doing a better job hiding their crimes there than they are in  East Timor. Recently, to their credit, the Americans have taken  note of what is happening in East Timor and are now limiting the  supplies of arms to the Indonesians. Not so the British, who  after being so indignant about the Falkland Islands, Kuwait, and  Bosnia have no qualms about selling jet warplanes to the  Indonesians, as they are happily doing so now.    The Indonesians regularly invade Papua New Guinea to kill  indigenous rebels who cross the border from the occupied western  half of the island. There is some evidence, which the Papua New  Guinea government appears to want to ignore, that Indonesian  troops recently killed a dozen or more Papua New Guinea  villagers.    Some of Indonesia's neighbors, and countries like Britain  who  want to sell it arms, make a great effort to whitewash the  Indonesians. Indonesia is a huge market of 200 million. This  is what attracts the British, Americans, French, the  Australians, and other exporting countries. It is a militarily  powerful, dictatorial, corrupt, aggressive, and expansionist  country, which is what frightens Australia and Papua New Guinea.  Indeed Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, at the time hot  on Kuwait too, described Indonesia as ""no country is more  important to Australia"". He heads a government with a policy  which wreaks of appeasement where the Indonesians are concerned.    Alas, there is very little that can be done about Indonesia  except to treat it with caution.

As a result, critical habitat effects were those incremental impacts that would occur solely as a result of the critical habitat proposal above and beyond the effects of these other actions.    The critical habitat covers a broad geographic area in four States and includes Federal, State, private, and Tribal lands. Because the designation affects only Federal agency actions under section 7, it is assumed that any ensuing economic impacts of the designation would occur only on Federal lands or on non-Federal lands where there is Federal involvement. The Service concluded that the impacts on Federal lands would be largely limited to livestock grazing, mining, and recreational activities that may affect tortoise habitat.    As a result of that analysis, the Service concluded that the August 30 proposal would affect 51 Federal grazing permits that provide about 59,500 animal unit months (AUMs). The maximum potential reduction in regional employment was estimated to be 425 jobs (340 direct jobs; 85 indirect jobs). The profitability of ranches in the seven counties is estimated to fall by $4,470,000 due to critical habitat designation. That is the estimated permanent decrease in ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50-year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice     et al.     (1978). Reduced grazing fees in the seven-county region from Federal allotments was estimated to total $170,000 annually. Half of this amount ($85,000) was returned to the grazing programs for range improvements, the U.S. Treasury received a maximum 37.5 percent ($63,750) of the fees, and local governments received a minimum of 12.5 percent ($21,250). The effect of reduced grazing on Federal land is expected to vary among counties. The designation of critical habitat is not expected to have significant economic effects within any of the seven counties.    Designation of critical habitat will not affect ongoing mining operations, as the ground disturbances typical of mineral extraction make mine sites unsuitable for tortoise habitat. Expansion of existing mines or development of new mines will require section 7 consultation with the Service. Most of the CHUs include surface areas on which mining claims have been filed. The economic impact of critical habitat designation cannot be determined at the present time due to the uncertainty of economically feasible mineral extraction.

The all-share bid, worth Pounds 1.2m, is by Kingstream Resources, a small Australian exploration company which wants Plateau's cash to pay for a feasibility study for an integrated iron ore mine and a steel mini-mill project in Western Australia. The offer, of 1 Kingstream ordinary for every 8 Plateau ordinary, values each Plateau share at 2.62p compared with the recent suspension price of 3p. Plateau was floated at 90p a share in January 1990. Guinness Mahon, acting for Plateau, described the Kingstream offer as 'unbelievable' because, not only was it hostile, but it also offered less than the cash in the company.

0,FT941-6760 ,"FT941-6760 _AN-EB1DPAEOFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (8): Earning power has dropped - The mining industry      By CANUTE JAMES   Jamaica's mining industry, traditionally tied to bauxite ore, is contemplating a new and potentially lucrative frontier. There are whispers in the international gold industry that the island may contain commercially exploitable deposits. In the past six months government officials have spoken with more than passing confidence of the impending opening of a mine. Companies involved in exploration in the island are not yet so sure. Orvana Minerals of Vancouver, Canada, reported that an exploration study had confirmed the existence of a 3.3 kilometre-long mineralised zone with between 2m and 6m tonnes of gold bearing ore in Jamaica's central interior region. Orvana bought the concession from BHP Minerals, the Australian-US miner, but later concluded that the mineralised area did not contain a commercially exploitable deposit, and that further exploration is needed. While awaiting conclusion of these studies, the island's mining sector is preoccupied with the impact on the bauxite industry of the soft aluminium market. Flooding of the market by the Russian Republic, which has depressed prices for the metal, has limited growth in mining and refining. As in other countries, the industry also fears an adverse impact from the US decision to reduce its strategic stockpile by selling relatively small quantities at prices about one third of those being asked by the ore producers. The effects on the industry of weak international demand are becoming painfully clear. Bauxite ore production last year was 11.2m tonnes, 0.7 per cent less than 1992, while exports of crude bauxite of 4m tonnes were 1.4 per cent less than in 1992, according to the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. 'The absence of strong growth in local output is a clear indication of the overall weak position of the world aluminium industry which is suffering from a supply demand imbalance and depressed prices,' says Mr Parris Lyew-Ayee, acting managing director of the institute. He adds: 'Jamaica's bauxite and alumina production, and earnings from the industry, reflect also a high level of output of primary aluminium in all the producing countries, especially by the members of the former Soviet Union, and the reluctance of producers to curtail production to correct the oversupply.' The economy is feeling the effects in a decline in the industry's earnings. These fell to Dollars 529m last year, down 8.3 per cent on the 1992 earnings, and about Dollars 200m less than in 1991. Under agreements with miners and refiners operating in the island, earnings from bauxite and alumina are pegged to the international prices for aluminium. Earnings have also been depressed by a steady depreciation of the Jamaican dollar, with mining and refining companies spending less to meet local costs. Conventional wisdom holds that the industry is going through another of its cycles of slump and recovery, and that prices and demand will harden when the market stabilises, but there is increasing concern in the industry that it could suffer longer term if miners and refiners are forced to reconsider a Dollars 500m investment programme planned for the next seven years. As the world's third largest producer of bauxite ore, after Australia and Guinea, Jamaica has proven reserves which will last 200 years at current rates of recovery. Much is to be gained economically by getting out and selling as much of the ore as possible. According to Mr Carlton Davis, chairman of the Bauxite Institute, there is a conscious attempt to export less and refine more, allowing the economy to benefit from the value added in refining. 'The current state of the market might lead some companies to reconsider their capital programmes, but in times like these one prepares to meet an upturn in the market.' The aim of the Jamaican industry is to lift refinery capacity to 5m tonnes per year by the year 2000. The Jamalco refinery in central Jamaica, owned jointly by the island's government and the Aluminum Company of America, is being expanded to a rated capacity of 1m tonnes per year at a cost of about Dollars 60m. The refinery is producing 700,000 tonnes per year, but there are already plans of further expansion which could lift its capacity to 2m tonnes per year. Alumina Partners of Jamaica, owned by Kaiser of the US and Hydro Aluminum of Norway, is spending Dollars 200m to increase the output from the island's largest refinery to 1.5m tonnes per year - and then to 2m tonnes by the turn of the century. Two refineries operated by Alcan of Canada, with a combined capacity of 1.1m tonnes per year, are being refurbished to lift output to 1.5m tonnes. Mr Davis says that the plants could be further expanded to produce 2m tonnes per year, using a grade of ore which was not yet being processed by the company. While there is optimism that the state of the industry will not adversely affect these expansion plans, two ventures have been reconsidered. The governments of Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago had been discussing the construction of an aluminium smelter in Trinidad, using a 'modular' system, starting with a small plant and enlarging in stages to meet market demand. Both governments were considering starting with a 'module' of 55,000 tonnes per year. This project is not now being given priority because of the state of the market, and uncertainty over the cost of the local natural gas which would fuel the plant. The industry's plans also included the construction of a caustic soda plant to reduce the reliance on imports to meet part of the demand for 300,000 tonnes per year for the refineries. The project for a 50,000 tonnes per year plant has been set back, Mr Davis says, because of a significant drop in world prices of caustic soda. But there seems to be sufficient confidence in the industry that the recovery will come, and that when it does, Jamaica should be ready to take advantage of firmer prices and new markets.

Commenters suggested several alternatives to independent sampling and testing. None of these alternatives satisfy the program needs addressed by independent sampling and testing, however.   Many commenters stated that EPA should establish a program of EPA certification of refiner and importer company laboratories, and participation in round-robin analysis programs, as an alternative to independent sampling and testing. Presumably independent sampling and testing only would be required where a company laboratory failed to obtain EPA certification. Commenters cited other federal programs that include the laboratory certification and/or round-robin approach, including the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) and federal requirements for petroleum products produced to meet military specifications.   EPA does not believe that laboratory certification and round-robin programs would provide sufficient verification of refiner or importer testing of reformulated gasoline. Programs of this type generally provide information on the quality of work a given laboratory is capable of performing under optimal conditions; they shed little light on the quality of the laboratory's day-to-day work which is the main focus of the independent sampling and testing requirement.   Certification by EPA or another organization would determine if a laboratory has proper equipment and personnel properly trained as of the date of the certification, but would provide no certainty of the ongoing laboratory operation. The treatment of round-robin samples by laboratories is predictably special. If a laboratory's continued certification is contingent on the quality of its analysis of samples received from EPA, the laboratory would be expected to assign its best personnel to this task, to be particularly careful in the analysis, and probably to repeat the analysis enough times to be certain a correct result is obtained. The treatment received by round-robin samples may bear little resemblance to the treatment normal samples receive. Certainly, neither laboratory certification nor round-robin testing would constitute any deterrent to a willfully cheating refiner or importer.   EPA believes the other federal programs that use laboratory certification and/or round-robins are inappropriate precedents for use of these approaches in the reformulated gasoline program. In the case of petroleum products produced to military specifications, the military presumably receives the products produced and can at that time verify whether the products meet relevant standards and criteria. This type of after-the-fact verification is not possible for reformulated gasoline for the reasons that have been discussed. In the case of facilities regulated under the NPDES program, it is possible to verify whether the levels of pollutants being discharged by the facilities are consistent with facility-specific permits that have been issued through EPA inspections that include water samples collected at the facilities. The reformulated gasoline situation is distinguished from the NPDES program because fungible mixing that often occurs within the refinery or import facility would render EPA inspections ineffective as a reformulated gasoline test verification mechanism.   Commenters offered other alternatives to independent sampling and testing that would rely on random refinery audits by independent parties or by EPA, or of verification-analysis by EPA of a representative portion of the samples analyzed by refiners and importers. EPA rejected these alternatives. The limitations inherent in EPA refinery or import facility inspections that result from fungible mixing, discussed above, also would apply to audits conducted by independent parties. A program that would rely on EPA-conducted verification analysis of certain samples that are sent to EPA by refiners or importers raises the same types of concerns that occur under the round-robin approach. Refiners and importers would be expected to analyze samples that also are sent to EPA for verification-testing with a level of care that may bear little resemblance to normal laboratory practices, and this approach would provide small deterrent to the willful cheater.

Commenters offered other alternatives to independent sampling and testing that would rely on random refinery audits by independent parties or by EPA, or of verification-analysis by EPA of a representative portion of the samples analyzed by refiners and importers. EPA rejected these alternatives. The limitations inherent in EPA refinery or import facility inspections that result from fungible mixing, discussed above, also would apply to audits conducted by independent parties. A program that would rely on EPA-conducted verification analysis of certain samples that are sent to EPA by refiners or importers raises the same types of concerns that occur under the round-robin approach. Refiners and importers would be expected to analyze samples that also are sent to EPA for verification-testing with a level of care that may bear little resemblance to normal laboratory practices, and this approach would provide small deterrent to the willful cheater.

For Dr.  Eberhard von Perfall, as CEO of Ruhrkohl Umwelt GmbH in Essen,  this was the realization of a ""dream of true recycling"": 32,000  metric tons of synthetic oil will now be produced from 40,000  metric tons of mixed plastic waste annually.    Two years ago Wolfram Brueck was happy that the operators of  the Bottrop coal-oil facility (KAB) were able to show him a way  out of the terrible dilemma of waste disposal of mixed plastic  waste. This was because the Managing Director of Dual Systems  Deutschland (DSD) in Cologne did not find in the plastics  industry nearly the recycling capacity urgently needed for  long-term compliance with the recycling quotas set by the  legislature. With the start of using plastic as raw material in  Bottrop, he can now believe in a change. Since the beginning of  the year, the KAB has been changing polymer packaging waste back  into syncrude [synthetic crude oil]--a recycling product which  is scarcely distinguishable from light mineral oil and can be  used again without loss in quality as a high-grade oil refinery  product.    Eight hundred kg of oil are produced from one metric ton of  mixed plastic, according to the estimate of the current  facility's level of efficiency in processing material made by  Dr. Eberhard von Perfall to the guests at the official start of  operations on April 12th. At the same time, the CEO of Ruhrkohle  Umwelt GmbH in Essen, which operates the facility together with  Veba Oil AG, Gelsenkirchen, stressed the great gain in energy.  He claims that only about 10% of the energy content (in  terms  of the energy which would be released if the plastic waste were  incinerated) is lost though hydrogenation.    ""We are not in essence entering new territory here,"" said  Dr.  Hubert Heneka referring to the already tested technique.  According to the President and CEO of Veba Oil AG, a technique  which has been refined over decades is being used to solve a  current waste problem: the reconversion of used packing plastic  back into the original oil components. Using the modified  Bergius Pier process, from 1981 to 1987 the KAB already  converted around 250,000 metric tons of hard coal into liquid  products. After coal hydrogenation could no longer be continued  for economic reasons, the operators modified the facility for  hydrogenation of petroleum residue using the Veba-Combi-Cracking  process(VCC). In 1991 authorization for processing used waste  oil, used solvents, and varnish or paint sludge was broadened to  include the recycling of materials containing PCP.    In April of 1992 the recycling of plastic waste was at last  at hand. The insensitivity of the VCC process toward the content  of the material involved was the technical prerequisite [for  this to work], the pressure for recycling coming from the  government's packing guidelines was the economic prerequisite. A  major trial which was carried out at that time in which for the  first time 60 metric tons of plastic waste was hydrogenated  together with heavy petroleum residue confirmed the basic  suitability of the process. But according to Heneka, it also  made it clear that procedural steps developed for coal  hydrogenation were too expensive for industrial recycling of  plastic waste. Therefore an primary system had to be  conceptualized and made, by means of which the polymers supplied  as granular material are transferred as a fluid permitting them  to be pumped together with the petroleum residue into the  hydrogenation section. Heneka: ""It is only this newly developed  step in the process, the depolymerization, which now satisfies  the requirement of recycling five metric tons per hour on a  continuous basis.""    After 12 months under construction, the expanded facility  with a total annual capacity of around 200,000 metric tons was  ready for operation to recycle 40,000 metric tons of waste  plastic per year. Operators had invested around 20 million  German marks in modifications of the KAB, particularly in the  core of the plastic preparation process, the depolymerization  reactor.    Here, completely cut off from the external world, the large  plastic molecules are thermally split at temperatures of 350 to  400ëC, so that they can be pumped without problem along with  vacuum residue, additives and hydrogen into the actual  hydrogenation system.    In the hydrogenation reactor, syncrude (synthetic crude  oil),  hydrocarbon gas and hydrogenated bitumen are produced at a  processing pressure of 300 bar and [a temperature of] 470ëC.  The hydrochloric acid released from the PVC during  depolimerization is reclaimed as liquid hydrochloric acid in an  auxiliary system and handed over marketing.    A pipeline directly links the KAB with the nearby [oil  refinery of] Ruhroel-Raffinerie in Scholven. In conjunction with  the Kokerei Prosper [coke-oven plant], the delivery of the  product as well as the service of the facility is thus  efficiently assured.    Still, the KAB operators have not yet passed the break-even  point in plastic waste recycling. With an annual throughput of  40,000 metric tons of plastic waste, the syncrude produced in  the Bottrop hydrogenation plant is about three to four times as  expensive as comparable crude oil on the Rotterdam market. Dr.  Hubert Heneka: ""We currently need a turnover of around 800 GM  [German marks] per metric ton. But we want to take the offensive  in this business and ensure for ourselves a large share of the  market in plastic waste recycling."" The speaker from Veba Oil  hopes to be able to cut costs in half if the legal requirements  for expanding the capacity can be managed quickly with the city  of Bottrop. Presuming that a rapid agreement can be reached, an  annual capacity of 120,000 metric tons for recycling of plastic  as a raw material would already be available in 1995.    But Kurt Schmitz, the mayor of the urban district of  Bottrop,  ""has trouble imagining"" at this time an expansion of the  facility. Substantial problems with acceptance already had to be  overcome when the KAB first began [working with] the disposal of  problem waste.    Through the contributions made by DSD in recycling, the  process today is, however, already paying off for the operators:  according to the words of its managing director Wolfram Brueck,  Dual System Deutschland currently pays 757 German marks per  metric ton of plastic delivered for recycling in Bottrop. The  common goal is to make it economically competitive with  incineration.    Environmental Minister Toepfer, who put the incineration  costs at around 500 marks per metric ton at this time in  Germany, was convinced at the official start-up of recycling  plastic as raw material in Bottrop: ""The horrific numbers of the  high utilization costs are gradually becoming a thing of the  past.""

He also called for nominations from oil companies for the 17th licensing round which would 'stretch out to new horizons to the west of the UK'. Preliminary drilling results suggest that the west of Shetland region has the potential to produce up to a third of Britain's present North Sea output of 2.5m barrels a day.

STAMMER, Times Environmental Writer      California's defense against a major oil spill was seriously weakened by an oil  industry decision to rush available cleanup equipment to Alaska to cope with  the Exxon Valdez disaster, the California Coastal Commission charged Friday.    The commission and the U.S. Minerals Management Service, which oversees oil and  gas development in federal waters, said one of three major vessels, Mr. Clean  III, on alert in case of an oil spill in the Santa Barbara area, was dispatched  without permission to Prince William Sound on April 9 by Clean Seas, a  consortium of 17 major oil and pipeline companies.    It wasn't until April 20 that a comparably sized ship was on hand to replace  Mr. Clean III.    The 181-foot vessel is equipped with 3,000 feet of boom to contain oil spills,  two skimmer systems that each pump 750 gallons a minute and a third with a  400-gallons-a-minute pumping capacity, and storage capacity for 1,200 barrels.    So alarmed was the commission by the ship's redeployment to Alaska that it  urged the U.S. Minerals Management Service to immediately forbid any oil and  gas exploration and production in the Point Arguello area until the vessel  returned to California waters.    The Minerals Management Service did not halt exploration; production in that  field is expected to begin in mid-August.    But the MMS did issue an ""incident of noncompliance.""    ""Previously agreed-to notification procedures were ignored. . . . Disregard for  approved procedures is not acceptable and cannot be tolerated in the future,""  Thomas W. Dunaway, regional MMS director, said in an April 20 letter to Texaco,  one of the oil companies involved in the case.    ""Any future incident of this nature will result in more stringent MMS action  such as civil penalty and/or shutdown of production and drilling operations,""  Dunaway wrote.    ""We actually found out through the rumor mill,"" said Susan M. Hansch, manager  of the Coastal Commission's energy and ocean resources unit. She added: ""We  understand why they were sending mutual aid. We just don't want to protect one  area and leave another area without the proper defenses.""    In a letter to the Minerals Management Service, Hansch wrote: ""The oil spill  response vessel was removed from its location in the Point Arguello offshore  area and sent to Alaska without our knowledge or consent. . . .""    Skip Onstad, manager of Clean Seas, denied Friday that the ability to meet an  oil spill emergency was ever in question.    He said Mr. Clean III was replaced initially with the Jolly Roger, a smaller  ship with less oil storage capacity. Onstad said that the Jolly Roger was not  replaced by a larger ship, the Gulf Fleet 69, until the Coastal Commission  intervened on April 20.    ""We feel we have satisfied their concerns concerning the overall response  capability of the (Clean Seas) organization and see no reason why exploration  drilling or any other drilling shouldn't be allowed to continue,"" Onstad said.    Onstad said he attempted to notify the MMS on April 8 of the intention to send  Mr. Clean III to Alaska but was unable to reach authorities. The ship left the  next day, and MMS was notified on April 10. The Coastal Commission did not  learn of the redeployment until April 19.    The Alaskan oil spill occurred March 24 when the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran  aground in Prince William Sound on Bligh Reef, spilling 11 million gallons of  crude oil.    J. Lisle Reed, regional director of the MMS, said Friday that the ship movement  was not as serious as the Coastal Commission believed. ""I don't think you can  say it was a serious situation that seriously impaired things,"" Reed said.

The authority is now known as AEA Technology, and it exploits expertise gained from the nuclear power programme. The commission said AEA was 'significantly inhibited' by constraints which prevent it manufacturing non-nuclear products and forming joint ventures outside the nuclear field. It has investigated AEA as part of its programme to review all public-sector bodies. The commission also said that AEA's businesses, which range from atomic research to petroleum services, 'rest uneasily in the public sector where their entrepreneurial activities are inevitably somewhat constrained'. The MMC concluded that AEA could generate higher net revenue. The report identified weaknesses in financial and project control, investment appraisal and marketing.

Trading was weak across the whole business, Mr Miller said, and the loss was struck after 'provisions totalling Pounds 725,000 covering restructuring and refinancing costs together with a general provision against contracts'. In addition, tax changes announced in the March budget had held back exploration activity in the North Sea, which adversely affected the services division. Losses per share came out at 4.6p (0.97p earnings) and in view of the results the interim dividend is passed, against 1.1p.

Copies of the material to be incorporated by reference are   available at the location indicated in the     ``ADDRESSES''       section of this notice. The Society of Automotive Engineers   Test Procedure J1634 provides standard tests for determining   the energy consumption and range of electric vehicles based   on the same highway and urban cycles used for gasoline-  powered vehicles. The tests address electric vehicles only,   and judge performance on the total vehicle system and the   battery.     The current version of 10 CFR part 474 attempted to   duplicate the Environmental Protection Agency urban driving   cycle. The Environmental Protection Agency urban driving   cycle was based heavily on stop-and-go as opposed to highway   vehicle usage. Roughly 91 percent of this cycle was   dedicated to stop-and-go testing and nine percent to freeway   testing. The Society of Automotive Engineers J227a driving   pattern closely duplicated the Environmental Protection   Agency urban driving cycle and was used for electric vehicle   testing in both the stop-and-go and freeway driving   patterns.     DOE is today proposing that Society of Automotive Engineers   Test Procedure J1634 replace Society of Automotive Engineers   Test Procedure J227a to determine equivalent petroleum-based   fuel economy. The current version of 10 CFR part 474 was   based on the premise that electric vehicles would only be   appropriate for urban use, and therefore excluded use of a   separate highway test cycle when testing the electric   vehicle. The resultant measurements were typical of stop-  and-go driving with minimal freeway vehicle usage. In   addition, the Society of Automotive Engineers Test Procedure   J227a has a shorter, repetitive test cycle compared to the   Society of Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J1634. This   shorter, repetitive test cycle of Test Procedure J227a does   not represent driving conditions for a gasoline-powered   vehicle as well as the test cycle proposed in Society of   Automotive Engineers Test Procedure J1634.

""On the cosmic scale of things, that was a close call,"" said Dr. Henry Holt, an  amateur astronomer from Flagstaff, Ariz., who discovered the asteroid while  working on a NASA project.    Bevan French, a scientist with NASA's solar system exploration division, said  if the asteroid had collided with Earth the impact would have been equivalent  to the explosion of 20,000 hydrogen bombs and would have created a crater at  least 5 miles across -- or ""enough to destroy a good-sized city.""    If it had hit an ocean, it would have caused tidal waves that would have swept  over coastal regions, French said.      Wire      ASTEROIDS; EARTH (PLANET); ASTRONOMY    "

Gansu Province registered 280 million U.S. dollars in  exports  last year and is expected to boost its annual export volume to  330 million U.S. dollars this year.    With over 1000 foreign-funded enterprises, the province has  significantly raised the export volume of finished products in  the petroleum and chemical industries, electronics, textiles and  garments, while sales of raw materials such as grain, edible oil  and Chinese medicine have declined.    In Ningxia, a small Muslim province, exports surpassed 100  million U.S. dollars for the first in 1993 with minerals and  farm and sideline products such as ferrosilicon, coal and  cashmere leading the region's exports.    To further exploit domestic and overseas market, Ningxia has  established trade offices across China and in the United States,  Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.     "

In terms of the  annual inflation index, Venezuela registered the highest price  level and was the only country to maintain such a high index.  Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador experienced a decrease in  inflation.    According to the latest JUNAC figures, which were released  prior to the commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the Andean  Pact, Venezuela showed negative economic indicators last year,  unlike the other four Andean countries. In 1991, the entire  Andean Group registered an average inflation rate of 63 percent,  with Peru and Ecuador showing the highest. At the end of 1993,  the average rate was 33 percent, with Caracas showing the  highest.    In 1993, Venezuela's inflation rate was 45.9 percent,  followed by Lima with 39.5 percent, Quito with 34.8 percent,  Santa Fe de Bogota with 23 percent, and La Paz with 8.5 percent.  This situation represents a complete reversal from previous  years. All the Andean countries except Venezuela showed  decreasing inflation rates in 1992.    Venezuela's inflation rate eliminates one of the country's  positive macroeconomic indices compared with the rest of the  Andean Group, that is, per capita income. Given Venezuela's  status as a petroleum producing country with a medium  population, its per capita yearly income of $3,777 is the  subregion's highest, followed by Colombia with $1,472.  inflation negatively affects this indicator, however.    As for GNP, Venezuela is the only country in the subregion  showing an economic decrease of one point against positive  figures of seven points in Peru, 5.2 in Colombia, 3.2 in  Bolivia, and 1.7 in Ecuador.    Regarding agricultural GNP, Venezuela is the only Andean  country with a negative index of 5.9 percent, while Peru shows a  positive 6.8 percent, Bolivia 5.4 percent, Colombia 2.7 percent,  and Ecuador 1.3 percent.    Until 1993, Venezuela was the indisputable leader in net  international reserves with $8.324 billion, followed by Colombia  with $7.901 billion, Peru with $2.701 billion, Ecuador with  $1.254 billion, and Bolivia with $371 million. That positive  figure, however, will probably radically affect JUNAC's  predictions because the financial crisis the country has been  experiencing since January has greatly decreased international  reserves.    Other aspects favorable to Venezuela are exports and the  commercial balance, with the country registering the highest  surplus in the subregion, $3.582 billion, as a result of its  petroleum producing and exporting status. Only Ecuador, another  oil country, shows a positive index of $439 million. Colombia  shows a deficit in its commercial balance of $2.841 billion,  Peru shows $626 million, and Bolivia $455 million.    According to a preliminary JUNAC economic analysis of the  subregion in general, the Andean Pact member countries have  grown at an average rate of 5.3 percent. This figure is higher  than the Latin American average, which grew by more than 3  percent, and even higher than that of developed countries, which  grew at an average of 2 percent annually.    ""By applying adjustment programs, the Andean Pact member  countries have successfully controlled their inflation rates,  which in the past few months have been close to 1.5 percent  monthly, significantly lower than the 5.3 percent registered in  1991. The member countries have solved foreign debt problems,  restored foreign credit standing, and improved their social  indicators,"" the document states.    The document also emphasizes the internal integration  process. The establishment of a free trade zone in the past few  years increased trade by more than 100 percent from 1989 to  1993. In December 1993, trade amounted to $2.886 billion, a 30  percent increase over the 1992 figure.    In addition, when the negotiations with Mexico conclude in  the framework of the Group of Three, negotiations intended to  include the other Andean countries, the potential market will be  doubled, reaching 200 million consumers. The Andean countries  will coordinate their positions at the Uruguay Round,  particularly regarding the negotiation of goods and agricultural  and institutional issues.     "

Mr John Lander, managing director, said currency gains had contributed Pounds 1.4m, against last year's Pounds 442,000 loss, to pre-tax profits for the six months to December 31. The stronger dollar and weaker pound had also helped to offset a decline in the oil price from Dollars 19.50 to Dollars 18.76 per barrel. Sterling barrel rates averaged at Pounds 10.94, against Pounds 10.99 last year. Mr Lander said the exchange rate was likely to continue to benefit the group in the second half. 'With a stronger pound, if nothing goes wrong, it should be a very good year-end,' he said. Cash balances rose from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 16.9m, helping to boost interest income from Pounds 254,150 to Pounds 627,887. Earnings were 5.66p (2.97p).   Companies:-  Pict Petroleum.

Names of Firms    : Aptos Shell,     et al.       Date of Filing    : July 20, 1993.          Case Numbers    : LEF0092,     et al.       On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration of the Department of Energy (ERA) filed a Petition requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement subpart V special refund proceedings. Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered the ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of monies remitted by Aptos Shell and 4 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order (hereafter, the Order) issued by OHA on December 14, 1981, and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. Each firm's name, case number and amount of money it remitted under the Order has been set out in the appendix immediately following this Decision.         The firms remitted a total of $21,764.57 to the DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred during the period covered by the ERA's audit. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. See Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow Account,'' August 30, 1993. OHA's tentative plan to distribute those funds is set forth in this Decision. Specific application requirements appear in Section III. Because these procedures are set forth in proposed form, refund applications should not be filed at this time. Comments are solicited.           I. Jurisdiction and Authority           The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE 82,508 (1981) and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE 82,597 (1981).           II. Background           The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Aptos and each of the 4 firms identified in the Appendix to this Decision were ``retailers'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and were therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 210 and 10 CFR part 212, subpart F. The Order states that, during the period covered by the ERA's audit, each retailer charged prices higher than those permitted by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make its records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b).       The retailers were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until sufficient volumes of gasoline could be sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations.    1     After decontrol, the Order was modified to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 20 FERC 62,319 at 63,537 (1982). The retailers objected. The Order has since been affirmed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Proposed Order issued on August 13, 1982.     Id.     FERC issued a final Order adopting its Proposed Order on September 29, 1982.                 1     The Order imposed no sanctions upon the firms for failing to provide records pursuant to 10 CFR 210.92(b). See Remedial Order.            III. The Proposed Refined Product Refund Procedures             This section sets forth the considerations that will be used to evaluate refund applications payable from the monies remitted by the retailers. We propose implementing a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of motor gasoline from any one of the gasoline retailers considered in this proceeding will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4501) (PODRA).         Refund applications submitted in this special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of motor gasoline they purchased from one or more of the retailers during the relevant audit period. In order to permit applicants to participate in the refund proceeding without incurring inordinate expense and to facilitate OHA's consideration of refund applications, we plan to adopt certain presumptions regarding the nature and extent of the pricing violations and the requirement that applicants demonstrate injury. Our authority to adopt presumptions in refund cases is set forth at 10 CFR 205.282(e).         With regard to the pricing violations, we propose adopting a rebuttable presumption that such violations were dispersed equally throughout each retailer's sales of motor gasoline during the appropriate audit period and that refunds should therefore be made on a pro rata or volumetric basis. Under this volumetric refund approach, applicants will be eligible to receive refunds that are equal to the gallons of gasoline they purchased multiplied by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric), plus accrued interest.         We propose that a separate volumetric be set for each retailer. The volumetrics for each retailer appear in the Appendix. Each was obtained by dividing the funds the retailer remitted to the DOE by the total gallons of motor gasoline we believe that retailer sold during the period covered by the ERA's audit.    2     A higher volumetric may be used to calculate an applicant's refund provided he satisfactorily demonstrates that he was disproportionately overcharged by one or more of the retailers, during a relevant audit period.               2     In the absence of accurate figures indicating the amount of motor gasoline sold by each firm during the audit period, we have estimated the volume of their sales using the best available data. Our estimate is that each gasoline retailer sold 50,000 gallons of motor gasoline per month for each month of its audit period. This figure was used to calculate each retailer's volumetric. Should the claims submitted pursuant to this Order indicate that our sales volume estimate was inaccurate, it may be necessary to reestimate the volumetric.         The potential applicants in this proceeding are likely to fall into just two categories since each of the Remedial Order firms was a retailer of motor gasoline. We will provide a presumption of injury for both categories of applicants; that is, end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry and were therefore not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751760h, and retailers or resellers.

Names of Firms    : Aptos Shell,     et al.       Date of Filing    : July 20, 1993.          Case Numbers    : LEF0092,     et al.       On July 20, 1993, the Economic Regulatory Administration of the Department of Energy (ERA) filed a Petition requesting that the Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) formulate and implement subpart V special refund proceedings. Under the procedural regulations of the DOE, special refund proceedings may be implemented to refund monies to persons injured by violations of the DOE petroleum price regulations, provided DOE is unable to readily identify such persons or to ascertain the amount of any refund. 10 CFR 205.280. We have considered the ERA's request to formulate refund procedures for the disbursement of monies remitted by Aptos Shell and 4 other firms pursuant to a Remedial Order (hereafter, the Order) issued by OHA on December 14, 1981, and have determined that such procedures are appropriate. Each firm's name, case number and amount of money it remitted under the Order has been set out in the appendix immediately following this Decision.         The firms remitted a total of $21,764.57 to the DOE to remedy pricing violations which occurred during the period covered by the ERA's audit. These funds are being held in an escrow account established with the Treasury pending a determination of their proper distribution. See Memorandum from George B. Breznay, Director OHA, to James T. Campbell, Comptroller, ``Transferring Funds to Escrow Account,'' August 30, 1993. OHA's tentative plan to distribute those funds is set forth in this Decision. Specific application requirements appear in Section III. Because these procedures are set forth in proposed form, refund applications should not be filed at this time. Comments are solicited.           I. Jurisdiction and Authority           The general guidelines that govern OHA's ability to formulate and implement a plan to distribute refunds are set forth at 10 CFR part 205, subpart V. These procedures apply in situations where the DOE cannot readily identify the persons who were injured as a result of actual or alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the refund amount each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of subpart V and OHA's authority to fashion procedures to distribute refunds, see Office of Enforcement, 9 DOE 82,508 (1981) and Office of Enforcement, 8 DOE 82,597 (1981).           II. Background           The facts alleged in the Order were undisputed. Aptos and each of the 4 firms identified in the Appendix to this Decision were ``retailers'' of motor gasoline as that term has been defined at 10 CFR 212.31 and were therefore subject to the provisions of 10 CFR part 210 and 10 CFR part 212, subpart F. The Order states that, during the period covered by the ERA's audit, each retailer charged prices higher than those permitted by 10 CFR 212.93(a)(2); levied a cents-per-gallon fee for services associated with the sale of motor gasoline in violation of 10 CFR 210.62(d)(1) and refused to make its records available for inspection in violation of 10 CFR 210.92(b).       The retailers were ordered to reduce their prices for motor gasoline by specified amounts until sufficient volumes of gasoline could be sold at the reduced prices to remedy the violations.    1     After decontrol, the Order was modified to require direct monetary restitution to the Treasury instead. See Sunset Boulevard Car Wash, 20 FERC 62,319 at 63,537 (1982). The retailers objected. The Order has since been affirmed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in a Proposed Order issued on August 13, 1982.     Id.     FERC issued a final Order adopting its Proposed Order on September 29, 1982.                 1     The Order imposed no sanctions upon the firms for failing to provide records pursuant to 10 CFR 210.92(b). See Remedial Order.            III. The Proposed Refined Product Refund Procedures             This section sets forth the considerations that will be used to evaluate refund applications payable from the monies remitted by the retailers. We propose implementing a two stage refund proceeding. Purchasers of motor gasoline from any one of the gasoline retailers considered in this proceeding will have an opportunity to submit refund applications in the first stage. In the event that money remains after all first stage claims have been disposed of, the remaining funds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986 (15 U.S.C. 4501) (PODRA).         Refund applications submitted in this special refund proceeding will be evaluated in exactly the same manner as applications submitted in other refined product proceedings. Refunds will be granted to applicants who satisfactorily demonstrate they were injured by the pricing violations and who document the volume of motor gasoline they purchased from one or more of the retailers during the relevant audit period. In order to permit applicants to participate in the refund proceeding without incurring inordinate expense and to facilitate OHA's consideration of refund applications, we plan to adopt certain presumptions regarding the nature and extent of the pricing violations and the requirement that applicants demonstrate injury. Our authority to adopt presumptions in refund cases is set forth at 10 CFR 205.282(e).         With regard to the pricing violations, we propose adopting a rebuttable presumption that such violations were dispersed equally throughout each retailer's sales of motor gasoline during the appropriate audit period and that refunds should therefore be made on a pro rata or volumetric basis. Under this volumetric refund approach, applicants will be eligible to receive refunds that are equal to the gallons of gasoline they purchased multiplied by the per gallon refund amount (volumetric), plus accrued interest.         We propose that a separate volumetric be set for each retailer. The volumetrics for each retailer appear in the Appendix. Each was obtained by dividing the funds the retailer remitted to the DOE by the total gallons of motor gasoline we believe that retailer sold during the period covered by the ERA's audit.    2     A higher volumetric may be used to calculate an applicant's refund provided he satisfactorily demonstrates that he was disproportionately overcharged by one or more of the retailers, during a relevant audit period.               2     In the absence of accurate figures indicating the amount of motor gasoline sold by each firm during the audit period, we have estimated the volume of their sales using the best available data. Our estimate is that each gasoline retailer sold 50,000 gallons of motor gasoline per month for each month of its audit period. This figure was used to calculate each retailer's volumetric. Should the claims submitted pursuant to this Order indicate that our sales volume estimate was inaccurate, it may be necessary to reestimate the volumetric.         The potential applicants in this proceeding are likely to fall into just two categories since each of the Remedial Order firms was a retailer of motor gasoline. We will provide a presumption of injury for both categories of applicants; that is, end-users of petroleum products whose businesses were unrelated to the petroleum industry and were therefore not subject to the regulations promulgated under the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973 (EPAA), 15 U.S.C. 751760h, and retailers or resellers.

0,FT944-8345 ,"FT944-8345 _AN-EKUDAAA3FT 941121   FT  21 NOV 94 / International Press Review: Little Prince pays a call - Argentina      By DAVID PILLING   The arrival of the 'Little Prince', as some Argentine papers refer to Britain's Duke of York, was by no means the only news story in town. The official royal visit, the first since the 1982 Falklands war between Argentina and Britain, vied for space with a political brawl over allegedly extortionate telephone tariffs, the hotting-up of presidential elections and, most notably, continued back-biting over government budgetary woes. The last item was slapped across the front pages after President Carlos Menem decreed a freeze on all public spending for the rest of the year. Journalists inevitably produced reams asking if the state machine was about to grind to a halt: would government officials have sufficient supplies of coffee and toilet paper to last them until Christmas? Who was going to pay for the president's forthcoming trip to Syria? But the duke held his own against such feisty competition, even making the front-page following flag-burning demonstrations outside the British embassy. The press was torn between whether to treat the visit as a serious news item or to view it as a somewhat frivolous exercise in bilateral protocol. 'Twelve years after the Malvinas war, Menem received the Little Prince of the British throne in an act of reconciliation: they played golf, they exchanged military uniforms and today they will inaugurate the Canning statue,' the daily Pagina/12 highlighted on its front page. Almost as an afterthought, it added: '27 arrested and 5 wounded in protests.' Not that the symbolism of the royal presence was lost on anyone, particularly after recent controversy over Argentina's alleged proposal to pay Falkland islanders up to Dollars 1.5m (Pounds 915m) each to give up their British citizenship. 'The inhabitants of the Malvinas view the visit with unease,' said Ambito Financiero. 'The apparently growing possibility of a reconciliation between both countries makes them fear for the eventual sovereignty of the islands.' Ample coverage was also given to Argentine disquiet at the return of the prince, who participated in the war as a helicopter pilot. El Cronista aired the opinions of Radical deputy Raul Galvan, who 'exhorted the government not to exaggerate in the honours bestowed upon the prince, because this 'would signify a lack of respect to those who died in the Malvinas''. Newspapers also focused on potential tension over the duke's visit to the former naval base of the General Belgrano cruiser, 'sunk by the British outside the exclusion zone'. La Nacion said: 'A contradictory mood was expected among navy officials, with many hinting that they would refuse to shake hands with the British prince or to comply with the military salute.' It said, though, that most Argentines were less worked up about fraternising with a former enemy. 'While some of those on the left and the right deplore the visit. . . for most people the arrival of the prince does not constitute an important topic of conversation (because) it reminds them of an incident they would prefer to forget.' The Falklands theme was not forgotten, though by the end of the week it had shifted to the reported sacking of Argentina's ambassador to London. Mr Mario Campora was said to have lost his job for criticising the plan to buy back the islands - known locally as 'Menem's bribe' - on the grounds that you should not pay for what was already yours by right. The sovereignty buy-back idea, originally put forward by British prime ministerial adviser Sir Alan Walters, has by and large been ridiculed. In particular, Pagina/12 ran an article shortly before the duke's arrival in which the Falklanders were represented by a photograph of penguins dressed up in top-hats and tails. The paper felt that the 'kelpers' were basically immune to Argentina's charm offensive. 'The foreign minister acts like a man trying to seduce a woman. He will not be disheartened even though he is slapped on the face at each hint.' The article said Falkland-Argentine relations had perhaps been irreversibly ruined by the conflict.

He appeared to backtrack on assurances made early in the campaign by Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, on the relocation of civil servants dealing with oil exploration to Aberdeen.

In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to  carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the  1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon.    For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students  have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest  academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from  20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions  as: ""What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?"" ""What was  George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?"" and ""Who was the fifth Beatle?""    El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed  second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El  Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools.    ""We're excited,"" El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. ""We compete against  some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the  entire school.""    The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban,  Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto  Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt.    The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain  common sense.    ""A lot of it is logic,"" said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the  scholastic category.    According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each  with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B  as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate.    The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide  in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the  Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at  the state decathlon in Riverside next March.    Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects  including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and  history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches. In the  last and by far the most intense phase of the contest, individual students are  bombarded with questions in front of a gymnasium full of students, parents and  teachers. This year's theme was space exploration and the decades of the 1960s  and 1970s.    Preparation at El Rancho began last May, when the team members were drafted.  Some students were selected by their teachers, others volunteered. The crucial  test to determine whether a student had the mettle to compete in the decathlon  came when school let out for the summer. It was then, coach Doug Anderson said,  that team members had to meet at the school at 6:30 every morning for more than  two months to study for the decathlon.    For many students, the idea of giving up the leisurely morning sleep of summer  to study for an extracurricular test is repugnant, but decathlon team members  said it was worth it.    ""I think it helps us become more well-rounded,"" Le said.    The students also said that in studying for the decathlon, they learned to  think under pressure and that the intense preparation sessions helped them more  than regular classes to learn.    There are more practical reasons for their commitment, as well.    ""It looks good on (high school) transcripts,"" Spiropoulos said.    This year, the team's goal was to beat Cerritos High School. Next year, they  said, they hope to become one of the top 10 scorers in the county.

In all, there were 10 El Rancho High School students with enough smarts to  carry on the school's tradition of excellence in the Southeast Region of the  1990 Los Angeles County Academic Decathlon.    For the second time in the last three years, El Rancho High School students  have won the Southeast Region of the county decathlon, the nation's largest  academic contest. The group of 10 students last month beat out competitors from  20 other high schools in the challenging contest that included such questions  as: ""What country made the mechanical arm for the space shuttle?"" ""What was  George Bush doing when Nixon resigned?"" and ""Who was the fifth Beatle?""    El Rancho High School won the Southeast Region in 1988, and last year placed  second to Cerritos High School. In overall county standings this year, the El  Rancho team placed 14th out of 83 schools.    ""We're excited,"" El Rancho Principal David Verdugo said. ""We compete against  some schools with outstanding reputations. . . . The results speak for the  entire school.""    The team members are juniors Joanne Szeto, Matthew Walker, Sheila Panganiban,  Demosthenes Spiropoulos, Mai T. Le and Federico Moran, and seniors Ernesto  Carreon, Marisol Pugliese, Jay Boyette and Michael Weinholt.    The team members attributed their victory to hard work, team spirit and plain  common sense.    ""A lot of it is logic,"" said Weinholt, who was the region's top scorer in the  scholastic category.    According to rules of the decathlon, teams must consist of three students each  with A, B and C grade averages. The A students are known as honor students, B  as scholastic and C as varsity. The 10th team member is an alternate.    The academic decathlon was started in Orange County in 1968. It went statewide  in 1979, and in 1982 became a national competition. This year's winner of the  Los Angeles County competition, West High School of Torrance, will compete at  the state decathlon in Riverside next March.    Decathlon competitors are given written and verbal examinations on subjects  including economics, language, literature, fine arts, mathematics, science and  history. Students also must give prepared and extemporaneous speeches.

The company yesterday announced a 23 per cent fall in net earnings to ADollars 37.2m for the 12 months from ADollars 48.1m a year earlier. This reflected falling world oil prices which cut about USDollars 4 a barrel from receipts. Net profits werehelped by substantially lower tax of ADollars 8m against ADollars 51.3m. Revenue fell by 19 per cent to ADollars 176.4m from ADollars 217.5m, despite steady crude oil sales at 6.2m barrels a day. The directors declared a final dividend of 2.5 cents a share. Exploration spending took ADollars 64m, with a further ADollars 186m spent on development. Mr Peter Power, chief executive, said yesterday he was expecting improved earnings for the current year following the start of oil production from the company's Kutubu project in Papua New Guinea.

We would agree that the most important issue is to ensure that maximum economic benefit is extracted from the North Sea. However, certain points are in danger of becoming 'truths'. First, much has been made of the refund of Pounds 200m of Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) that the government made in 1991-92. This arose from treatment of insurance in connection with a one-off anomaly - the Piper Alpha tragedy. Second, there is no evidence that in North Sea exploration, diminishing returns have set in. Contrary to the falling success rates quoted in your article, the government's own Brown Book statistics show a fairly constant success rate since the early 1970s, albeit as discoveries have become smaller. Finally, the polarisation of companies into winners and losers is not really accurate. Almost any company can become a 'winner' by cutting UK exploration. Turning now to the main issue. The loser will be the UK economy as a whole. The immediate effect will be felt by those companies supplying services to the UK industry whose business will be hard hit as oil companies reduce exploration budgets. It is unrealistic to expect them to find export markets to fill the gap when their domestic business is destroyed at a stroke. The proposed measure will, in the short term, result in job losses among geological and geophysical staff, drilling contractors and others such as helicopter pilots and the crews of support vessels. This is already happening and many jobs will be lost as a result. In the longer term, engineering, fabrication and supplies jobs will suffer. The number of jobs at stake here could run into tens of thousands. There will also be wider consequences in the longer term as drilling fewer wells will inevitably result in less oil being found. The chancellor's proposals quadruple the cost of exploration for oil companies in the UK. This is true even for those companies which have been identified as 'winners' by analysts. We estimate that this could lead to at least 50 per cent fewer wells being drilled over the next five years. At recent average rates of success there will be about 2bn fewer barrels discovered, Pounds 2bn-Pounds 4bn less tax revenues and an adverse effect on the balance of payments of some Pounds 20bn. This is a terrible squandering of a vital national energy resource. The broad thrust of the chancellor's proposals is not in the nation's or the industry's best interests. It is too early to reduce the North Sea to the status of a 'cash cow' for a few investors whose main attentions are turned overseas. The future of the North Sea is characterised by smaller fields which will not now be found or developed. The government must decide whether it wants to see a viable and active oil province. If it does, it should reconsider these changes.

The Omani oil official added, in an interview with  AL-HAYAH, that the tour is intended to urge both OPEC and  non-OPEC producers to reduce their output, absorb the surplus  oil supply, and reduce the international output ceiling by about  1.3 million b/d [barrels per day].    The following is the text of the interview:    ['Abd-al-Ghani] The Omani petroleum and minerals minister  has  begun a tour to implement an initiative supported by the summit  of the GCC countries. Do you believe that the Gulf summit's  declaration of its readiness to lower the GCC countries' oil  output will bolster the chances that the Omani initiative will  succeed in persuading non-OPEC producers to lower their output  to improve collapsing prices?    [Sha'ban] Petroleum and Minerals Minister Sa'id Bin-Ahmad  al-Shanfari is undertaking a tour to several non-OPEC oil  producing countries within the context of the decisions arising  from the GCC summit to salvage and stop the fall of oil prices.    As is known, the GCC countries, like most other oil  producers, depend entirely on oil revenues. Any drop in prices  has an extreme effect on their development plans, revenue, and  earnings.    Therefore, the kings and heads of state of the GCC countries  decided to invigorate the initiative to lower output undertaken  by the sultanate, which had previously announced a five-percent  drop in its output beginning in January 1994, in the hope that  it would be emulated by producers inside and outside OPEC.  Minister al-Shanfari's tour can be viewed primarily in this  context. It is intended to urge the countries he is visiting to  help stop the decline in oil prices and to consequently bring  the OPEC countries themselves to take a similar position.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Is the Omani and Gulf initiative aiming for  a  specific output reduction with respect to a single country or  all producer countries?    [Sha'ban] There is no specific target, although the  sultanate  does have a specific view regarding a maximum drop in output.  The sultanate hopes that the initiative will result in a  reduction in output amounting to 1 million b/d or 1.3 million  b/d.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Some believe that the condition laid down by  the GCC summit for carrying out its initiative is unrealistic or  unfeasible because this has not happened in the past and because  the North Sea oil producers (Britain and Norway) refuse to  reduce their output or cooperate with OPEC. Do you agree with  this view?    [Sha'ban] I do not believe that this condition is  unfeasible.  The GCC summit is aware, as are others, that some producers that  are benefiting from low prices have no interest in prices rising  again and are unwilling to cut their output. The GCC countries  know that, when they stipulated that producer countries reduce  [their output] by specific quotas, the summit did not have in  mind, in its decision, countries which have no interest in  prices not rising. In calling upon all producer countries to  reduce their output, the summit had in mind countries that share  the Gulf countries' interest in joining together to salvage  prices and the market.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Do you believe that the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia and the other GCC countries will join the sultanate in  lowering output if most of the producer countries agree to  reduce their output?    [Sha'ban] First, the non-OPEC producers need to be  consulted.  Minister al-Shanfari's tour is a basic part of this  consultation, inasmuch as it will include Yemen, Egypt, Syria,  Russia, and even Norway and Britain. Contacts are also being  held with a view toward non-OPEC ministers holding contacts with  several non-OPEC oil producer countries to cover the base of  non-OPEC producers. After that, we expect that there will be a  good, positive response. After the results are sorted--and every  event is subject to discussion--a decision will be made on a  reduction in OPEC's output and the rate of the reduction. I  believe that a general, positive tendency exists among all  producer countries to cut output and improve prices.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] You said that the initiative aims to reduce  the international oil supply surplus by about 1.3 million b/d.  Is there a deadline for achieving this target, such as by late  winter or early fall 1994?    [Sha'ban] I believe that if we obtain a positive outcome, we  can leave the setting of a date or the timing of an announcement  to cut output to the relevant parties. They will engineer the  timing, declaration, effective date, and implementation of this  policy.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Were the GCC countries led to support the  Omani initiative by the economic difficulties and hardships they  are experiencing because of the drop in oil prices?    [Sha'ban] Without labelling, the GCC countries no doubt rely  greatly on oil revenues, as do all producer countries,  especially the developing countries among them. All of them  share an interest in improving oil prices, because oil revenues  finance their development plans. All of the GCC countries rely  on oil revenues to finance all of their development programs and  to meet their financial obligations. The drop in prices is  having an adverse effect on these countries' economies. The GCC  countries are not the only ones suffering from this problem and  these hardships. But some of the GCC countries are perhaps more  able and prepared than other oil producing countries inside and  outside OPEC to endure and cope with this oil crisis, regardless  of its intensity.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] Will there be a meeting of the oil ministers  or deputy oil ministers of the GCC countries after Minister  al-Shanfari's current tour?    [Sha'ban] I can say that there will be a meeting. I do not  know at what level it will be. However, coordination and  contacts among the GCC countries are certainly ongoing. And the  GCC countries will be evaluating the results of the tour and the  OPEC countries' position.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] There have been recurring reports that Oman  may call for meetings between OPEC producers and non-OPEC  producers in the IPEC [Independent Petroleum Exporting  Countries] group to study the position of the oil market after  Minister al-Shanfari's tour. Are these reports correct?    [Sha'ban] I cannot rule out such a possibility, but I cannot  confirm it. It will depend greatly on the results of the tour.  Thus, this subject could be studied by Oman together with its  brothers in the GCC.    ['Abd-al-Ghani] When do you expect the initiative to bear  results and oil prices to improve?    [Sha'ban] That depends on the producer countries'  willingness  to lower prices [as published]. No one can predict precisely  when prices will improve, because a multiplicity of intermeshed  factors underlies the current oil situation. Consequently, an  improvement in prices depends on the elimination of all of these  causes, or at least some of them.     "

BUT IF IT  TRIGGERS A RECESSION IN THE UNITED STATES, EXPORTS WILL SUFFER.      By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MEXICO CITY      Mexicans should be dancing on their oil barrels at the prospect of higher  petroleum prices resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but the local stock  exchange index has dropped 3.4% since last week's occupation.    The reaction is a gauge of how much the Mexican economy has changed since 1982,  when oil accounted for three-fourths of exports. Every $1-a-barrel increase in  the price of oil still brings Mexico an extra $1.2 million a day in badly  needed foreign exchange, and that will ease -- but not eliminate -- a trade  deficit projected to top $2.5 billion this year.    However, if oil prices rise enough to cause a recession in the United States,  it could mean trouble for the two-thirds of Mexican exports not related to oil.    In addition, there is the question of whether Mexico has enough production  capacity to increase exports -- taking advantage of higher prices -- without  cutbacks in domestic supplies of oil products.    Mexico has cut exports by one-fifth since 1984. In July, it exported 1.23  million barrels a day. That was 190,000 barrels a day less than the quota  assigned it under voluntary agreements with other producers that -- like Mexico  -- are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Production has slipped nearly 1% a year, while domestic demand has grown at  about the same rate.    As overall exports have dropped, the United States has remained a steady  customer, buying 780,000 barrels a day of Mexico's highest-grade oil. In July,  two-thirds of Mexico's exports were sold to the United States, in violation of  a Mexican policy to restrict any customer's purchases to no more than half of  total exports.    Virtually all Mexican exports are sold through long-term contracts, tied to  spot-market prices. However, under terms of the contracts, the country is  excluded from the kind of quick profits available to those who trade directly  on the spot market.    ""Our first concern is to supply the domestic market,"" said a spokesman for the  Energy, Mining and State Industries Ministry, which sets policy for Mexico's  government-owned oil industry.    ""We are taking a discreet approach,"" he added, a marked contrast to the  euphoria that accompanied the oil price hikes of 14 years ago. Unless prices  remain more than $5 a barrel higher than they were before the invasion,  economists are betting against a repeat of the 1970s. At that time, Mexico  relied on oil exports to earn foreign exchange that sustained a protectionist  economy with high import tariffs and few non-petroleum exports.    Since the oil bust, Mexico has lowered tariffs and cut subsidies on a variety  of products, trimming the government's role in the economy and encouraging  non-oil exports and foreign investment.    Thus, fear of a recession in the United States -- which buys two-thirds of  Mexico's exports and accounts for 63% of its foreign investment -- explains the  plunge in what had been a bull market, said economist Rogelio Ramirez de la O.    The fear behind the fear is that oil prices will rise enough -- say $5 a barrel  -- to persuade the government to change its business-supported policy of  cutting the state's role in the economy to make the country more  internationally competitive.    In an international depression, Ramirez de la O. said, ""it is not popular to  gear economic instruments to exports and increased capital flows. What (the  government) would otherwise be doing to maintain external competitiveness would  not be justified.""    However, Mexican economists and government officials said they do not expect  sustained high price levels.    Mexico expects the Iraq-Kuwait conflict to be resolved as rapidly as it  developed, making its impact on prices questionable, except in the extremely  short term.

BUT IF IT  TRIGGERS A RECESSION IN THE UNITED STATES, EXPORTS WILL SUFFER.      By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MEXICO CITY      Mexicans should be dancing on their oil barrels at the prospect of higher  petroleum prices resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but the local stock  exchange index has dropped 3.4% since last week's occupation.    The reaction is a gauge of how much the Mexican economy has changed since 1982,  when oil accounted for three-fourths of exports. Every $1-a-barrel increase in  the price of oil still brings Mexico an extra $1.2 million a day in badly  needed foreign exchange, and that will ease -- but not eliminate -- a trade  deficit projected to top $2.5 billion this year.    However, if oil prices rise enough to cause a recession in the United States,  it could mean trouble for the two-thirds of Mexican exports not related to oil.    In addition, there is the question of whether Mexico has enough production  capacity to increase exports -- taking advantage of higher prices -- without  cutbacks in domestic supplies of oil products.    Mexico has cut exports by one-fifth since 1984. In July, it exported 1.23  million barrels a day. That was 190,000 barrels a day less than the quota  assigned it under voluntary agreements with other producers that -- like Mexico  -- are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.  Production has slipped nearly 1% a year, while domestic demand has grown at  about the same rate.    As overall exports have dropped, the United States has remained a steady  customer, buying 780,000 barrels a day of Mexico's highest-grade oil.

0,FT934-5187 ,"FT934-5187 _AN-DLACGABVFT 931201   FT  01 DEC 93 / Business and the Environment: Oil groups and troubled waters  -Green issues versus commercial realities      By BRONWEN MADDOX   Imagine you are the chairman of one of the world's largest oil companies. In the middle of October, a letter arrived, demanding, among other things, that you immediately stop all exploration and drilling of oil and gas reserves. The letter's author is Paul Gilding, the Amsterdam-based executive director of Greenpeace International, one of the world's largest environmental pressure groups. Reasons why it might be unwise to dispose of the letter spring to mind. You worry that environmental lobbying may influence planning applications and lead to tighter regulation. You also want to head off any chance of the 'direct action' which has made Greenpeace's reputation; for example recently four inflatable dinghies launched from Greenpeace's boat Solo hung a banner from an exploration rig operated by Shell in the Barents Sea. So how should you respond? 'With interest but with some dismay', British Petroleum told Gilding. 'Unrealistic and not a helpful contribution to the debate', Shell International Petroleum said in a response which stressed the company's care for the environment. However Greenpeace is adamant that its demands, fired off to more than 20 companies and industry groups, are not unreasonable. The threat of global warming, its letter says, 'is too great for any of us to continue the massive burning of fossil fuels'. At last year's Rio Earth Summit, governments pledged to find ways of curbing carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels, following warnings from the United Nations intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC). Greenpeace's international oil campaigner, Paul Horsman, argues the oil companies are 'worse villains' than governments. In his view, 'they have been involved in amazing lobbying against the Rio commitments and proposals such as energy taxes'. He wants them to divert some of their research and development budget to 'renewable' energy sources such as solar, wind and wave power. To oil companies, many of whom conduct research into renewables, these demands ignore commercial realities. Michael Herbert, head of external affairs at Shell International Petroleum, says that 'the cost of renewables is still colossal - rapidly phasing out fossil fuels is not credible if we are to meet the world's rising demand for energy, including that of developing countries'. However nuclear power, one of the available alternatives to fossil fuels, is anathema to Greenpeace. Some oil companies also feel that Greenpeace misrepresents the available scientific evidence on global warming and assumes, in BP's words, 'that scientific consensus is far greater than it actually is'. While the IPCC is scrupulous about not being drawn into this kind of dispute, it does emphasise the uncertainties of its projections. David Bennetts, research co-ordinator of the Hadley Centre in Berkshire, England, which co-ordinates the IPCC's scientific assessments, says: 'It is certainly true (as Greenpeace claims) that you cannot burn the world's proven reserves of oil without the world warming. But what I cannot tell you is whether that rate of warming would be fast enough to be dangerous'. Outside observers might see this as a predictable standoff between natural opponents. But the Greenpeace letter also carries a curiously dated air. Some environmentalists and businessmen feel that as pollution regulation has been tightened over the past decade - much of it due to the efforts of environmental pressure groups - the venom has been taken out of the traditional battle between greenery and smokestacks. It is hard not to have some sympathy with Shell's view that 'Rio spelled out the dilemmas facing the world', particularly the hard choices between the environment and economic development. 'It is these dilemmas we should be worrying about - it is unhelpful to go back to confrontation'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

The issue has been given broad coverage in the Turkish press  as it was linked to the underwater drilling being conducted near  Thasos for the exploration of oil. But in an attempt to defuse  the issue, Turkish President Suleyman Demirel admitted that the  drilling is being conducted in Greek territorial waters.  However, Demirel added that if the explorations extend beyond  Greece's territorial waters there might be complications, since  no agreement has been reached on the question of the Aegean  continental shelf.

He is accompanied by a delegation which includes  the ministers of energy and fuel resources and transport, the  chairman of the Trade and Industry Chamber, the chairman of the  National Bank, and members of parliament.    Speaking upon arrival at Mehrabad Airport, S. Tereshchenko  emphasized that there are very close and friendly relations  between Kazakhstan and Iran. He noted that a number of  fundamental documents governing bilateral cooperation had been  signed in the course of visits of the presidents of the two  states to Tehran and Almaty. The main purpose of the present  visit, therefore, is a stimulation of work on the fulfillment of  agreements that have already been reached and the removal of all  the barriers in the way of an increase in mutually profitable  trade and economic cooperation.    Hasan Habibi, first vice president of the Islamic Republic  of  Iran, who met the Kazakhstani prime minister, confirmed his  words.    Members of the Kazakhstani delegation and the minister of  mines and metals of Iran took part in the first rounds of  negotiations between Hasan Habibi and Sergey Tereshchenko.    S. Tereshchenko expressed the hope that the present visit  would prepare the ground for the utmost expansion of bilateral  cooperation in the economy and trade. He observed that  Kazakhstan was interested in relations with Iran in such spheres  as ground, sea, and air transport, trade in petroleum products,  minerals, metal, and agricultural produce, and banking.    H. Habibi welcomed the strengthening of relations of the two  countries. Touching on cooperation in the sphere of transport,  he announced that direct air traffic between Tehran and Almaty  would be inaugurated by the first flight between the two  capitals on 16 May. The route will be served by airliners of the  Iran Air national airline. The first vice president of the  Islamic Republic of Iran pointed also to the importance for  Kazakhstan of the building of the Mashhad (Iran)-Serakhs  (Turkmenistan) Railroad. Following the commissioning of the main  line and connection with the Bafq--Bandar-e Abbas Railroad, it  will have acquired the shortest outlet to the Persian Gulf.    On Sunday the prime minister of Kazakhstan laid a wreath at  the grave of Ayatollah Khomeyni, the founder of the Islamic  Republic of Iran.    The following day S. Tereshchenko and the members of the  delegation he is heading visited the city of Isfahan and the  islands of Qeshm and Qeys in the Persian Gulf. In Isfahan--the  former capital of Iran--the leader of the Government of  Kazakhstan viewed the sights of the city and visited the  country's biggest foundries, one of which was built with the  assistance of the USSR, which are located in proximity to it.  There were preliminary negotiations on the possibilities of  Iranian-Kazakhstani cooperation in metallurgy, by way of the  exchange of technology and specialists included.    The islands of Qeshm and Qeys are free trade and economic  zones, and this particular feature was taken into consideration  at the time of the guests' negotiations with their authorities.  Specifically, the members of the delegation inquired after the  possibility of capital investments on Qeshm, whose  infrastructure and location could be useful both for  Kazakhstan's foreign trade and for the development of the  republic's industry. Qeys is of interest primarily from the  viewpoint of tourism, and for this reason the parties discussed  on the island the prospects of interaction in this sphere.    The members of the delegation who remained behind in Tehran  conducted intensive negotiations with representatives of Iran's  business circles. On the establishment of bank cooperation,  which would facilitate payments between commercial companies of  the two countries appreciably, included. There had earlier been  a meeting between Kadyr Baykenov, minister of energy and fuel  resources of Kazakhstan, and Qolam Reza Aqazadeh, minister of  petroleum of the Islamic Republic of Iran. They discussed, in  particular, the possibilities of cooperation in the installation  in Kazakhstan of an oil refinery and the construction of an oil  pipeline.     "

In their speeches, comrades, with deep  feelings, extolled Comrade Mao's outstanding contributions,  spoke highly of the party's experiences in inheriting and  developing Chairman Mao's great causes gained since the third  plenary session of the 11th party Central Committee, and looked  forward to the Chinese nation's bright future in the 21st  century. So, I profoundly experienced their deep love and  esteem of Chairman Mao. I think that anyone who is growing up  from old China understands that the motherland turned itself  gradually from a state of being enslaved and devastated to a  rich and powerful country, and recalls the great leader  pioneering the cause of revolution and construction.    There are only seven years remaining until the end of the  20th century. As far as the Chinese nation is concerned, the  20th century was not only a gravely disastrous century, but also  one in which to create brilliance again. In the first half of  the century before 1949, China overthrew the rule of  imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and created  the fighting history of new China. In the latter half of the  century, the Chinese people worked arduously to pioneer  undertakings and explored ways to build, consolidate, and  develop the history of socialism. We cannot divorce ourselves  from the name of Mao Zedong when reviewing these two arduous and  brilliant sections of history.    China was confronted with two historical tasks in modern  times: One was national independence and the liberation of the  people. The other was to make the country powerful. Comrade  Mao Zedong struggled all his lifetime to fulfill these two  tasks. This embodied his historical contributions. We can say  that Comrade Mao Zedong did two great deeds during his lifetime.  The first great deed was that he led the party and the people  to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and  bureaucrat-capitalism and accomplished the tasks of democratic  revolution. Proceeding from Chinese history and the specific  situation of society and on the basis of summing up the  experiences of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, Comrade Mao  Zedong created the theory on new democratic revolution and  discovered the revolutionary road of encircling the cities from  the rural areas. Comrade Mao Zedong, with gigantic theoretical  courage, resolutely proceeded from reality, resolutely resisted  the influence of both domestic and foreign dogmatism, gained  experiences from setbacks and failures, and discovered the  accurate revolutionary roads suitable to the Chinese national  situation. As a result, China won a victory in revolution.  This was the first great matter task by Comrade Mao Zedong  during his lifetime. The second great task was that he made  efforts to explore ways to build China's socialism after  accomplishing the transformation of socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Comrade Mao Zedong was one to make such  explorations. He was the first person to acutely discover the  malpractice and weak points of the socialist pattern of the  Soviet Union and definitely advocated that China should have its  own way of building socialism. To this end, he guided the  Chinese people to arduously explore and took extremely tortuous  roads. He left many brilliant ideas through these exploration  courses, and these ideas are still of important guiding  significance.    We may say that Comrade Mao Zedong left us with an  unaccomplished will of making the country strong and the people  rich. He failed to see with his own eyes the fruitful results  of his undertakings of exploration and creation. The  undertakings left unaccomplished are being realized with the  efforts of CPC members, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their  representative. On the basis of summing up, according to the  principle of seeking truth from facts, both positive and  negative experiences and lessons gained since the founding of  the PRC and in line with the new practical experiences, Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, with gigantic theoretical courage, defined that  our country's socialist system is still in the ""initial stage,""  set forth a series of policies and principles for reform, and  summarized these policies and principles into the theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic  line of ""one center and two basic points,"" and finally found the  road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics that Mao  Zedong failed to find at that time. This is the only way for  developing socialist China and the way for China to seek  prosperity and stand among various nations in the world.  Through the arduous efforts of the people of the whole country  in the past 15 years, our country's gross national product has  doubled and the people are striding toward the target of being  fairly well-off. With full confidence, we can tell Comrade Mao  Zedong that his aspiration of catching up with and surpassing  the developed countries in the world is being realized.    To recall Chairman Mao's fruitful achievements, we should  emulate Mao Zedong; inherit and develop Mao Zedong Thought; use  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics to guide the work in various aspects;  accelerate the progress of reform, opening up, and  modernization; and ensure long-term peace, stability, and  prosperity of the country.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study his  thinking and work style of seeking truth from facts, proceeding  from reality, and linking theory with practice. Comrade Mao  Zedong had a good command of Marxism and the Chinese traditional  culture. Foreign conventions or ancient conventions restricted  him from exploring ways for the Chinese revolution. He always  opposed the practice of studying theories not according to the  Chinese socialism and the reality of the Chinese revolution.  Early in 1930, he opposed book worship and stressed that  without investigations there would be no right to speak. The  greatest reality we are confronted with now is to promote the  large-scale development of socialist productive forces through  the setup of the socialist market economic system. As far as  our province is concerned, we should grasp favorable  opportunities, intensify reform, expand the scale of opening up,  speed up the pace of development, and strive to build the  province into an economically powerful province. As a large  province near Beijing, Hebei will be unworthy of not only its 63  million people, but also Comrade Mao Zedong's cordial concern  with and earnest aspirations for Hebei during his lifetime, if  we are unable to make a faster development or continue to widen  the gaps with advanced provinces and municipalities. So, we  should go deep to the forefront of reform and development, exert  efforts to study the new situation, and use the new ideas and  methods that are suitable to the requirements of the market  economy to solve various kinds of complicated problems relating  to deep-layered reform work. We should thoroughly change the  mental state of sticking to old conventions, remaining undecided  or adopting a wait-and-see attitude when faced with favorable  opportunities, and being blindly self- satisfied in the course  of development. The broad masses of cadres in the province  should actually form a brand-new outlook of seeking truth from  facts and emancipating the mind.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study Mao  Zedong's thinking of sharing woe and weal with the people and  serving the people wholeheartedly. Mao Zedong often exhorted  that the whole party was the vanguard of the proletariat,  existed and fought for the interests of the people, and was  always a small part of the people; and that once the party was  divorced from the people, it would fail to realize its ideals  and its struggles would become meaningless. On the eve of the  victory in democratic revolution, Mao Zedong predicted that  there would be dangers of being divorced from the masses within  the party. We should firmly remember Chairman Mao's exhortation  to the whole party when he was in Xibaipo and continue to  maintain the style of being modest and prudent and guarding  against arrogance and rashness.    We should continue to maintain the style of arduous  struggle,  always take root among the masses, always persist in the purpose  of serving the people wholeheartedly, and make unswerving  efforts to fundamentally improve party style and social practice.    To emulate Mao Zedong, we should conscientiously study the  spirit of bravely exploring and arduously doing pioneering work  as advocated and practiced by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong constantly  regarded the world as an endless development course and took his  own undertakings as a course of continuous exploration and  pursuit. He was never satisfied with existing achievements and  constantly regarded existing achievements as a starting point  for his new explorations and pioneering work. We can say that  Mao Zedong made ceaseless efforts to make explorations and do  pioneering work during his lifetime. Some of his explorations  became brilliant historical contributions; and some became  precious ideological heritage in the form of experiences and  lessons and also guided us to make wider and deeper explorations  and do pioneering work today. The Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping is just the result  and fruit of the explorations in the past 10 years or so. Our  purpose to study the Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping is to make better new explorations and do  new pioneering work. The year 1994 will arrive soon. Next year  will be a key year to comprehensively reform the economic system  and speed up the setup of the socialist market economic system,  as well as to satisfactorily fulfill the Eighth Five-Year Plan  and quadruple the gross national product ahead of schedule. So,  we should grasp the new favorable opportunity of reform and  development and adopt a fighting attitude to devote ourselves to  the great exploration and pioneering undertaking.    Comrades: Let us inherit and develop the undertakings  pioneered by Mao Zedong, persistently take Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics as guidance, ceaselessly keep forging ahead, and  capture a new victory in reform, opening up, and socialist  modernization.

Forty-three responses, mostly from mooring masters and shipping companies, offered strong support for the safety zone expansion. Opposition to the proposal came from CONOCO, MMS, and three oil exploration companies. MMS suggested that if CONOCO or other lessees are denied access to potential oil and gas resources, restitution should be provided by either LOOP or the Coast Guard. Neither the Coast Guard nor the DOT is prepared to provide restitution to CONOCO for loss of potential revenues or costs already incurred in conjunction with oil or gas exploration.    To resolve the conflicting use problems in the excursion zones, LOOP has agreed to purchase from CONOCO the oil and gas leases for Grand Isle Blocks 53, 58, 59, and 65. LOOP would then relinquish these blocks to MMS. LOOP would not seek further expansion of the safety zone or oppose any exploration and production activity outside or adjacent to the expanded safety zone.    On November 2, 1993, in a letter to the Department of Transportation, the MMS stated that it supports the agreement between CONOCO and LOOP. MMS stated that it is prepared to prohibit surface occupancy of offshore oil and gas facilities in the proposed safety zone. However, MMS stated that it may be economically and technically feasible to develop the resources lying beneath the safety zone by directional drilling. MMS would not preclude subseabed access provided that any surface facilities are located outside the safety zone. Such subseabed activity within the safety zone would not interfere with vessel activity in the safety zone.    Under the Deepwater Port Act of 1974, as amended (33 U.S.C. 1509(d)(1)), the Secretary of Transportation is required to consult with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Commerce prior to issuing the safety zone around any deepwater port for the purposes of navigational safety. The Coast Guard has informed the noted Departments of the proposed safety zone.        Discussion of Proposed Amendment        Appendix A, Annex A, section (a) of 33 CFR part 150 is amended to expand the boundaries of the deepwater port safety zone at LOOP. This is being done at the request of LOOP, Inc. to enlarge the approach to the terminal portion and provide more maneuvering area for tank vessels arriving or departing from the deepwater port. It does not amend the Areas to be Avoided or the Anchorage Area listed in sections (b) and (c), respectively, in Annex A to Appendix A of 33 CFR part 150.        Regulatory Assessment        This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under Section 3(F)(1) of Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735; October 4, 1993) and it does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that Order. It is not a significant regulation under the ``Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures'' (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979).    The Coast Guard expects the economic consequences of this rulemaking to be minimal. Potential economic effects include impacts on mineral extraction and the commercial fishing industry. The proposed expansion is relatively insignificant, comprising an approximate 15 percent increase in the size of the safety zone.    When the original safety zone was established, it was not expected that there would be significant interference with mineral extraction or navigation. Due to the relative size of the expansion, no impacts on mineral extraction or navigation are expected in this case either. Access is available via alternative methods such as directional drilling.    The economic consequences of the proposed rulemaking are expected to primarily impact commercial vessels, including commercial fishing vessels. Commercial fishing vessels are permitted restricted use of portions of the safety zone as provided in 33 CFR Table 150.345(a). Therefore, the impact on fishing activities would be negligible due to the small additional area involved. No opposition to the notice of petition for rulemaking was received from the commercial fishing industry.    In addition, this proposed rulemaking will result in permanent safety benefits. Providing additional maneuvering area minimizes the likelihood of a catastrophic pollution incident resulting from a vessel colliding with any portion of the LOOP facility. Therefore, it is expected that expansion of the safety zone will reduce the environmental hazard.

Regulatory Negotiation (Reg Neg)       Shortly after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, EPA entered into a regulatory negotiation with interested parties to develop specific proposals for implementing both the reformulated gasoline and related anti-dumping programs. These parties included representatives of the oil and automobile industries, vehicle owners, state air pollution control officials, oxygenate suppliers, gasoline retailers, environmental organizations, and citizens' groups. (See the 1991 NPRM for the members of the negotiating committee and a discussion of the process for selecting them.)   In August 1991 the committee reached consensus on a program outline and signed an ``Agreement in Principle'' describing that consensus. EPA agreed to propose a two-step approach to reformulated gasoline. The first step would take effect in 1995 and utilize a ``simple model'' to certify that a gasoline meets applicable emission reduction standards. The simple model allows certification based on a fuel's oxygen, benzene, heavy metal and aromatics content and Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP).   Under the second step, according to the regulatory negotiation agreement, EPA would propose a ``complex model'' to supplant the simple model for certifying compliance with these standards. Certification under the complex model would take effect 4 years after it is promulgated. EPA also agreed to propose the more stringent Phase II emission performance standards.       B. July 9, 1991 NPRM (56 FR 31176)       The first NPRM for the reformulated gasoline program was published prior to the conclusion on the regulatory negotiations. Normally, in a negotiated rulemaking, such a reg-neg committee meets to develop a proposed rule which will be acceptable to all parties. If consensus is reached on a proposed rule, it is published as an NPRM. The committee members and the entities they represent agree to support the proposal and not to seek judicial review of the final rule if it has the same substance and effect as the consensus proposal. In this case, EPA published an NPRM while the advisory committee was still conducting negotiations. The Agency believed that although consensus of the members on an acceptable rule was possible, an NPRM was required at that time in order to meet the statutory deadline.   The 1991 NPRM described the provisions of both a program to require the sale of gasoline which reduces emissions of toxics and ozone-forming volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in certain nonattainment areas and a program to prohibit the gasoline sold in the rest of the country from becoming more polluting. The 1991 notice described the outline of the reformulated gasoline program as required by statutory provisions and options that the regulatory negotiation committee members were considering. Topics included in the 1991 proposal consisted of the derivation of the emission standards, fuel certification by modeling, opt-in provisions, credits, anti-dumping requirements, and enforcement provisions for all aspects of the reformulated gasoline program.         C. April 16, 1992 SNPRM (57 FR 13416)       As noted above, the Agency's SNPRM (57 FR 13416) reflected the agreement reached in the regulatory negotiation that had been conducted to develop reformulated gasoline regulations under section 211(k). The Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) described the standards and enforcement scheme for both reformulated and conventional gasoline. It also included specific proposals for the simple emission model to be used in gasoline certification and enforcement.       D. February 26, 1993 NPRM (58 FR 11722)       In their comments on the SNPRM, the ethanol industry expressed concern that the reformulated gasoline rulemaking, as proposed in the SNPRM, effectively excluded ethanol from the reformulated gasoline market. In an attempt to address their concern, the Agency proposed an ethanol incentive program, at the direction of former President Bush, intended to promote the use of ethanol (and other renewable oxygenates) in reformulated gasoline. The objective of the proposed renewable oxygenate program was to enhance the market share for renewable oxygenates while, theoretically, maintaining the overall environmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline simple model. This would be accomplished by offsetting any increase in volatility that may result from the inclusion of ethanol with volatility reductions that occur in the rest of the RFG pool. This volatility balancing, however would not take into account any increase in volatility in-use due to mixing of ethanol and non-ethanol gasoline blends (commingling). The renewable oxygenate program would not be required in class B areas (the South) unless a state requested inclusion in the program. Thus, the NPRM (58 FR 11722) for reformulated gasoline proposed revisions to the simple model, as well as to the associated anti-dumping, and enforcement provisions. Also included in the NPRM were the proposed complex model for certification of reformulated gasoline and the proposed Phase II performance standards. The complex model is now scheduled to take effect January 1, 1998. The complex model will provide a method of certification based on the fuel characteristics such as oxygen, benzene, aromatics, RVP, sulfur, olefins and the percent of fuel evaporated at 200 and 300 degrees Fahrenheit (E200 and E300, respectively). The NPRM also proposed Phase II standards for reformulated gasoline which are to take effect in the year 2000, as prescribed by section 211(k)(3) of the Clean Air Act (CAA). The proposed VOC performance standard was 2032 percent for class B and 2635 percent for class C. EPA proposed to set the toxic standard at 20 or 25 percent reduction since additional toxics control was not found to be cost effective and, in most cases, these greater toxics reductions were expected to occur through fuel reformulation for VOC control. The NPRM also included proposed NO    x     performance standards of 016 percent in classes B and C. The proposed NO    x     standards greater than zero were not required by the CAAA, but were proposed under the authority of section 211(c)(1) in conjunction with the Phase II reformulated gasoline standards of the Act since additional NO    x     control was deemed beneficial and cost effective in reducing ambient ozone levels.       E. Discussion of Major Comments and Issues       EPA received a number of comments on the first NPRM (56 FR 31176), the SNPRM (57 FR 13416), and the latest NPRM (58 FR 11722) for reformulated and conventional gasoline. Comments covered a wide range of topics including regulatory procedure, certification standards, modeling emissions by the simple and complex models, the role of ethanol and other oxygenates in reformulated gasoline, vehicle testing, the anti-dumping program, Phase II standards, cost-effectiveness, and a number of enforcement-related issues. EPA has conducted an analysis of the comments received and duly considered the significant issues. Summaries of these comments and EPA's responses to them are contained in the Final Regulatory Impact Analysis and the Summary and Analysis of Comments which has been placed in the docket for this rulemaking (Public Docket No. A9212).   Since the publication of the NPRM, the Agency has continued to develop the complex model. The first revisions of the complex emissions model since 1993 NPRM publication for reformulated gasoline have been provided to the public at a June 2, 1993 public workshop. EPA developed several complex model options in July which was provided to the public. In October of 1993, a draft version of the final complex model was released for public inspection as well. All the iterations of the complex model since the publication of the 1993 NPRM have been available to the public via a public electronic bulletin board and in submittals to the EPA Air Docket, Docket No. A9212.   All the various components of this rulemaking are being finalized in today's notice. The additional time has allowed adequate public review of the complex model and its implications for the reformulated gasoline Phase II standards.

Treatment of Ethanol       A. Background       The April 16, 1992 proposal of the Simple Model and Phase I standards was designed to be fuel and oxygenate neutral. Ethanol, however, when added to gasoline in the amount needed to satisfy the oxygen content requirement of the Act raises the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of the resulting blend by about 1 psi, making it more difficult for ethanol blends to meet the mass VOC performance standards than blends using other oxygenates. For ethanol to be blended with the RFG, a blendstock gasoline with an RVP low enough to offset the increase resulting from adding ethanol would have to be obtained.   Ethanol industry representatives commented that obtaining such blendstocks would be both difficult and expensive, because ``sub-RVP'' blendstocks would be more costly to refine and because blendstock production would be controlled by petroleum refiners. Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE), an oxygenate which does not boost a fuel's RVP, which is derived from methanol gas and the petroleum product isobutylene and whose blends can readily be put through petroleum pipelines, was thought to be the oxygenate of choice for most refiners. Ethanol's representatives theorized that the oil industry would have a desire to use MTBE over ethanol and, thus, little incentive to make the sub-RVP blendstock necessary for ethanol blending. The ethanol industry contended that a reformulated gasoline program which they argued would effectively preclude ethanol was contrary to Congress' intent that ethanol have a role in the program. They argued that the oxygen content requirement of section 211(k)(2) was motivated in large part by a desire to expand markets for ethanol. They noted the strong support afforded the RFG legislative initiative by members of Congress from agricultural states. They also cited statements in the legislative history indicating some members' expectation that the RFG program would provide an increasing market for ethanol.   Ethanol representatives contended that the benefits of ethanol use justify its inclusion in the RFG program. Specifically, they explained that ethanol is currently made in the United States from domestically-grown grains, primarily corn, and thus represents an important domestic and renewable source of energy. They further explained that to the extent ethanol is used in place of imported petroleum products, it promotes the nation's energy independence and improves its balance of trade, and that ethanol use also strengthens the market for corn, consequently reducing the need for price supports. Moreover, as a biomass-based product, ethanol is potentially a renewable fuel to the extent the energy derived exceeds any fossil fuel energy consumed in producing the ethanol.

Moreover, as a biomass-based product, ethanol is potentially a renewable fuel to the extent the energy derived exceeds any fossil fuel energy consumed in producing the ethanol.                "

It was noted that  the situation in these sectors is critical and is continuing to  get more acute.    The amounts of fuel and energy resources recovered and  produced have been decreasing for a long time. According to the  Russian State Committee on Statistics [Goskomstat], the total  volume of industrial production at enterprises of the fuel and  energy complex in the first half of the year has decreased (in  prices comparable with the very same period last year) by 13.8  percent. In 1992, the decrease amounted to 11.3 percent. The  greatest decreases were in recovery of oil and gas condensate  (13.9 percent), production of gasolines for motor vehicles (14.4  percent), and production of diesel fuel (15.4 percent).    The operation of individual enterprises in the complex and  in  its sectors as a whole has been paralyzed by the acute financial  crisis. Market offerings of fuel and energy resources often  surpass the demand of customers capable of paying for them. As a  result, oil refineries have become overstocked with petroleum  products, especially mazut, and have stopped accepting oil for  refining. This has forced a cutback in oil recovery and the  shutdown of operational wells. The provision of petroleum  products for harvest operations in a number of regions and the  creation of winter fuel reserves and fuel shipments to rayons in  the Far North are danger of being interrupted.    Because of big flaws in price and tax policy, the complex's  enterprises cannot form their own financial sources to develop  production under the conditions of a market economy. Clear-cut  proposals regarding changing the ratio of prices for energy  resources and processing sector's products, reducing the tax  component in fuel and energy prices, and taking measures to  provide tax incentives for priority directions of the activity  of fuel and energy complex enterprises have yet to be formulated.    Industry's investment complex is under the threat of  collapse. In January through June of this year, very important  construction jobs were financed at only 12.5 percent of the  approved annual limit of budgetary allocations. The anticipated  start-up of production facilities and facilities in the social  sphere has been estimated to be 10-30 percent below the last  year's level and will not exceed 50 percent of their 1988 level.  Because of their high interest rate, government-issued loans are  unacceptable for financing new construction or reconstruction  and modernization of very important facilities.    The board approved a plan of action that included a broad  set  of measures: development and consideration by the Russian  Federation government of a draft decision regarding a mechanism  for giving priority to development of the sectors of fuel and  energy complex and its state support partly by budgetary  financing, investments in very important construction projects,  and retention of unappropriated regulation funds for 1994-1995  (obtained by deductions from product production costs).    Also very important are steps such as developing the  conceptual principles of a pricing policy for the fuel and  energy complex's products and accelerating the Russian  Government's consideration of the drafts of the laws  ``Concerning Oil and Gas,'' ``Concerning the Foundations of a  Federal Energy Policy,'' and ``Concerning Energy Conservation''  and the special federal program Fuel and Energy.    According to the approved plan, special emphasis is to be  placed on the need for quick consideration in the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers of proposals to reduce the tax  rate on the sale of fuel and lubricant materials to 10 percent.    In accordance with the board's decision, a rush report  regarding the critical financial situation of the complex's  enterprises will be sent to V.S. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the  Russian Council of Ministers. The report will include an urgent  request for his personal intervention in speeding up resolution  of the fundamental questions regarding stabilizing the situation  in the complex's sector.     "
0," FR940406-0-00187   FR940406-0-00012        Based on its analysis described above and on manufacturers' projections, the agency concludes that the major domestic manufacturers can achieve the light truck fuel   economy levels listed in the following table:                         1Manufacturer    1Approximate   market share   (percent, based   on MY 1993)      1CAFE (mpg)    2MY 1996    2MY 1997              GM   30   20.7   20.7   Ford   31   21.2   21.6   Chrysler   23   20.8   21.0           As indicated above, most light truck manufacturers other than GM, Ford and Chrysler only compete in the small vehicle portion of the light truck market and are therefore expected to achieve CAFE levels well above those companies. Only three light truck manufacturers, Range Rover, PAS and UMC, are expected to have fuel economy levels lower than the major domestic manufacturers. Since these companies have an extremely small market share, NHTSA concludes that setting a standard based on their capabilities would be inconsistent with a determination of maximum feasibility that takes industry-wide considerations into account, as required by statute.   As indicated above, NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales for MYs 199697. NHTSA also concludes that 20.7 mpg is the maximum feasible standard for both MYs 1996 and 1997. For the reasons discussed below, this level balances the potential petroleum savings associated with a higher standard against the difficulties of manufacturers facing a potentially higher standard.   The agency believes that a 20.7 mpg light truck CAFE standard for MYs 199697 will make a positive contribution to petroleum conservation by encouraging GM, which has a large market share, to achieve a higher CAFE level than it currently projects while remaining within its fuel economy capability. The agency notes that a 20.7 mpg standard is 0.2 mpg higher than GM's current MYs 199697 CAFE projection.   A 20.7 mpg standard will not unduly restrict consumer choice or have adverse economic impacts on the large domestic manufacturers. The current product plans of Ford and Chrysler indicate that they expect to achieve MYs 199697 CAFE levels that are above 20.7 mpg. Therefore, they will not have to make any changes in their product plans to achieve the level of the standard.   While GM's current product plan shows expected MYs 199697 CAFEs of 20.5 mpg in each model year, NHTSA's analysis indicates that company can achieve a CAFE of 20.7 mpg in both years. As discussed above, this conclusion is based on the following assumptions: (1) The 4WD share of the market will not significantly increase between now and MYs 199697, (2) GM will make successful efforts to maintain market share of certain vehicles, (3) GM can make minor changes in the performance levels of its vehicles to bring them more in line with its competitors, and (4) GM can make small improvements by increasing the penetration of some engine and transmission technology improvements that are not projected for full implementation. All of these actions are very minor and, the agency believes, within GM's capability.   NHTSA believes that a higher standard than 20.7 mpg for MYs 199697 could result in serious economic difficulties for GM. While GM can achieve 20.7 mpg CAFE without significant product restrictions, such restrictions could be required to achieve a CAFE higher than 20.7 mpg. Given leadtime constraints, NHTSA believes that the first potential fuel-efficiency actions that GM or any other manufacturer would consider in response to a higher standard would consist of marketing actions. For the reasons discussed in other notices, however, the agency does not believe that marketing actions can be relied upon to significantly improve a manufacturer's CAFE. See, e.g., MY 199394 light truck CAFE final rule (56 FR 13775, April 4, 1991). If such marketing actions were unsuccessful in whole or in part, GM would likely have to engage in significant product restrictions to achieve the level of a higher CAFE standard. Such product restrictions could result in adverse economic consequences for GM, its employees and the economy as a whole and limit consumer choice, especially with regard to the load-carrying needs of light truck purchasers.   As indicated above, while NHTSA has concluded that GM is the least capable manufacturer with a substantial share of sales, the agency believes that GM's capability is not significantly below that of Chrysler. GM and Chrysler, combined, sell over 50 percent of all new light trucks each model year. Therefore, even if the agency were to set a standard above GM's capability, the standard could not be much above 20.7 mpg and still remain within the capability of the majority of the industry.

Lac de Gras has become the scene of the biggest land rush in North America for nearly 100 years since diamonds were discovered by Dia Met Minerals and BHP of Australia in November last year. Monopros, De Beers' Canadian exploration company, has already staked about 4m acres of land on its own account.

That's what Tennessee could have been charged with  after Saturday night's 24-6 brutal mugging of UCLA at the Rose Bowl. Our topic  on today's Donahue show, we regret to inform you, is going to be Bruin abuse.    Well, it's only one game. One weak week isn't going to kill anybody. Terry  Donahue will take a look at the films, point out all the missed tackles, point  out all the missed assignments, then throw the film into an incinerator and  threaten to do likewise to the first player who tells anybody what an easy time  UCLA is going to have this Saturday at San Diego State.    ""Tennessee just gave us a beating, "" Donahue said.    At least this should teach UCLA to be more careful in scheduling opponents for  future season openers -- a lesson USC also must learn, by the way. Westwood's  big hunks piled up 59 points in last year's opener and were still averaging 52  a game three weeks into the season. That even included a scrap against mean old  Nebraska.    Somebody might like to call Dial-a-Patsy and reschedule the 1990 opener.    Know who UCLA opens with next season?    Oklahoma, that's who.    Oklahoma scored 73 points in this year's opener, because Oklahoma really knows  how to kick off a college football season -- find some convenient victims and  kick 'em right between the goal posts. (Sadly, Oklahoma's football players also  have been known to do this sort of thing off the field.)    Nebraska knows football, too. Nebraska knows that any say-so you have over your  schedule, say so! Say you'll play Northern Illinois. Say you'll play Utah  State. Place your orders years in advance. Schedule Rhode Island Baptist,  Columbia Broadcasting School, Bunker Hill Military Academy, Jenny Craig Diet  Center, anybody you think you can whip. Nebraska this season has some of the  easiest opponents since Great Britain vs. Argentina for the Falkland Islands.    UCLA and USC should pick on somebody not their size. Stop scheduling Tennessee  or Illinois. Schedule some nerdy, dweeby little school that doesn't mind taking  a licking for a nice slice of the gate. Sure, everybody will make fun of your  schedule -- everybody but your student body. The student body loves being 1-0.    Too bad these arrangements need to be made so far in advance. UCLA already  knows who its season-opening opponent will be in 1991 (Brigham Young), 1992  (Cal State Long Beach), even 1997, for that matter (Texas).    The 1996 opener, you'll be unhappy to know, is against Tennessee.    There's still a ""TBA"" (To Be Announced) listed as the first opponent for 1994.  We suggest either Slippery Rock, Philadelphia Textile or Northern Methodist.  Maybe somebody under the death penalty.    OK, so we're kidding. We applaud UCLA for tangling with a team as fine as  Tennessee's. There is no reason the Bruins can't put this experience to good  use and spring back to have a good season. Let's talk some coach talk here:  Men, you can benefit from this. Anything that doesn't kill you can only make  you stronger.    The fact that both UCLA and USC dropped their season openers should not be all  that amazing. When you start a freshman at quarterback, and toss him right off  the get-go at a quality opponent, you should not expect miracles. You shouldn't  even bet the spread.    UCLA's Bret Johnson didn't disgrace himself at all Saturday, nor did USC's Todd  Marinovich five days before. Both of these guys will distinguish themselves  before much longer. Troy Aikman and Rodney Peete had to start somewhere,  remember. Johnson actually looked pretty smooth out there.    What hurt UCLA, unlike USC in its season opener, was falling so far behind.  Asking a freshman quarterback to preserve a 13-0 lead -- as was the case with  Marinovich vs. Illinois -- was one thing, but asking him to rally you after  spotting the other team 24 points, forget it. The Bruin offense couldn't hack  that.    Johnson and UCLA's backup quarterback -- Bonds . . . Jim Bonds -- still have to  get the feel of big-college football. You can sparkle in all the scrimmages you  want. The game is the real thing. Tennessee's guys came to play, same as UCLA's  guys did. They didn't travel all this way to see Universal Studios.    ""We were glad we already had a game under our belt before playing UCLA,"" said  Volunteer Coach Johnny Majors. ""Good football teams have to improve from week  to week.""

The 1996 opener, you'll be unhappy to know, is against Tennessee.    There's still a ""TBA"" (To Be Announced) listed as the first opponent for 1994.  We suggest either Slippery Rock, Philadelphia Textile or Northern Methodist.  Maybe somebody under the death penalty.    OK, so we're kidding. We applaud UCLA for tangling with a team as fine as  Tennessee's. There is no reason the Bruins can't put this experience to good  use and spring back to have a good season. Let's talk some coach talk here:  Men, you can benefit from this. Anything that doesn't kill you can only make  you stronger.    The fact that both UCLA and USC dropped their season openers should not be all  that amazing. When you start a freshman at quarterback, and toss him right off  the get-go at a quality opponent, you should not expect miracles. You shouldn't  even bet the spread.    UCLA's Bret Johnson didn't disgrace himself at all Saturday, nor did USC's Todd  Marinovich five days before. Both of these guys will distinguish themselves  before much longer. Troy Aikman and Rodney Peete had to start somewhere,  remember. Johnson actually looked pretty smooth out there.    What hurt UCLA, unlike USC in its season opener, was falling so far behind.  Asking a freshman quarterback to preserve a 13-0 lead -- as was the case with  Marinovich vs. Illinois -- was one thing, but asking him to rally you after  spotting the other team 24 points, forget it. The Bruin offense couldn't hack  that.    Johnson and UCLA's backup quarterback -- Bonds . . . Jim Bonds -- still have to  get the feel of big-college football. You can sparkle in all the scrimmages you  want. The game is the real thing. Tennessee's guys came to play, same as UCLA's  guys did. They didn't travel all this way to see Universal Studios.    ""We were glad we already had a game under our belt before playing UCLA,"" said  Volunteer Coach Johnny Majors. ""Good football teams have to improve from week  to week.""    UCLA will, because it must.      Column      UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT LOS ANGELES; UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  FOOTBALL TEAMS; SCHEDULES    "

However, petroleum prices may be constrained by a potential output increase from new capacity and by quota disagreements in OPEC. The United Nations Trade and Development Conference (UNCTAD) said in an annual Trade and Development Report that export prices for primary commodities may rise by about 1 per cent in 1992, after falling about 11 per cent last year, Food prices should prove the firmest, led by higher demand for cereals in central and eastern Europe and in sub-Saharan Africa. Cotton prices are expected to drop sharply because of record output and moderate consumption this year. Although prices of mineral raw materials are declining, and are expected to rise only slightly on average in 1993, non-ferrous metal prices are expected to rise steeply after declines this year. The UNCTAD report said prospects for tin prices appeared 'particularly promising if production cutbacks continue'.  The Financial Times   London Page 30  "

THE U.N. AGREES TO PERMIT  HUMANITARIAN FOOD AID TO IRAQ.      By OSWALD JOHNSTON and JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      The Bush Administration is expecting worldwide oil shortages to hit as early as  next month and is planning to tap the United States' strategic oil reserves for  the first time, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins disclosed Thursday.    Because of the impact of the Persian Gulf crisis, Watkins told senators,  private stocks of petroleum may be insufficient to cover an anticipated  shortage of 2.5 million barrels a day.    His testimony was the first indication that the gulf crisis is about to be felt  in the crucial area of oil supplies, despite increased oil production by Saudi  Arabia.    At the United Nations, the Security Council late Thursday approved arrangements  for the dispatch of food to Iraq and Kuwait, despite the U.N. blockade, in the  case of urgent humanitarian need. The council said that distribution should be  monitored by the United Nations and the Red Cross or similar bodies.    The action cleared the way for an Indian ship to sail with provisions for  thousands of Indians stranded in Kuwait by the Iraqi invasion.    Meanwhile, the White House said that a videotape of a speech by President Bush  to the people of Iraq was on its way to Baghdad, carried by government courier,  after Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat refused to accept it when Deputy  Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger attempted to present it to him at  the State Department.    The ambassador said later that accepting the tape would violate diplomatic  protocol, but he added: ""We are going to broadcast it on prime time.""    The speech has been described at the White House as an effort by Bush to  explain the reasons for the deployment of more than 100,000 U.S. troops in  Saudi Arabia and to tell them that the United States has no quarrel with the  people of Iraq -- only with their leader, President Saddam Hussein.    Watkins, who offered an array of voluntary initiatives to encourage fuel  conservation and promote domestic oil production, told a Senate committee that  a projected oil shortfall this month of nearly 4 million barrels a day could be  covered by the large stocks of oil accumulated by private companies. But he  warned that by next month those supplies might not cover the projected  shortfall of 2.5 million barrels daily.    Asked by Democrats on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to  explain why the Administration had not already tapped the strategic reserve to  hold down oil and gasoline prices, Watkins and his deputy, W. Henson Moore,  said the reserve supply was intended to offset a major disruption in the flow  of oil, rather than to manage prices.    The reserve was established as a result of the energy crises of the 1970s, but  the stockpile was not created until the mid-1980s. It can be tapped on the  orders of the President, but it would take at least 16 days before the oil,  stored in underground salt domes in Louisiana and Texas, could begin flowing to  commercial refineries.    ""If there is a supply shortfall that would require us to go into the strategic  reserve, it will hit in the fourth quarter,"" Moore said.    The nation's two most senior energy officials said any action Bush might take  to begin using the reserves would be coordinated with the 22 nations in the  International Energy Agency.    The U.S. strategic reserve totals 590 million barrels. The House on Thursday  unanimously adopted a measure expanding it to 1 billion barrels. The  Administration had opposed the expansion, but Moore said that Bush is now  almost certain to sign the measure.    The other main reserves are held by West Germany and Japan, Watkins said.    With the United States importing about 40% of its oil needs, the Administration  is preparing programs to promote conservation, expand domestic oil production  and encourage industries and utilities to use coal, natural gas or nuclear  power. The programs are designed to save 1.1 million barrels of oil a day by  the end of the year.    Meanwhile, EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said amendments to the Clean Air  Act that are being considered by Congress would reduce dependence on Mideast  oil -- but not until the year year 2005. The amendments would result in greater  use of fuels produced from natural gas and such agricultural products as corn  to power motor vehicles, Reilly said in an interview.    ""This fuel switching will result in a minimum oil savings of 500,000 barrels a  day,"" he said. ""This compares with 750,000 barrels a day which we had been  getting from Iraq and Kuwait before the invasion.""    Among the conservation and production-enhancing measures Watkins presented was  a renewed request to open up Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil  exploration -- an effort that has been stalled since the Exxon Valdez oil spill  in March, 1989.    The program also calls for:    Speeding up government approval of natural gas pipeline projects and  incinerators that burn garbage to produce energy;    A presidential order directing federal agencies to buy more alternative-fuel  cars and increase energy efficiency in government buildings;    A national advertising campaign to encourage Americans to conserve oil by  reducing electricity use, replacing inefficient furnaces and using lower-octane  gasoline.    Meanwhile, the Administration sought to head off growing sentiment in Congress  to punish Japan, and possibly West Germany, for what some in the House and  Senate see as insufficient support for the U.S. military operation.    On Wednesday, the House approved an amendment to the defense spending bill that  would require the United States to pull 5,000 of troops from Japan each year if  Tokyo fails to pay the costs of stationing U.S. forces there.    Responding to that measure, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ""We  don't see any linkage between the situation with our forces in Japan and the  situation in the Persian Gulf.""    The White House also disputed as ""ludicrous"" the view that the U.S. ambassador  to Iraq, April C. Glaspie, may have given Hussein the impression that Bush  would look aside if Iraq invaded Kuwait, in a meeting she had with the Iraqi  president one week before the invasion on Aug. 2.    The Washington Post reported Thursday that, according to an Iraqi transcript of  the meeting, Glaspie did not object to the Iraqi troop movements, building at  that time toward the Kuwaiti border.    Glaspie, who left Baghdad on vacation one day before the invasion, is now  stationed at the State Department.    Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the airlift of  Americans from Iraq and Kuwait is continuing. One planeload of 258 Americans  arrived late Thursday afternoon in Raleigh, N.C., and he said two more jumbo  jet flights were scheduled for today and Saturday.    A total of 920 Americans have been flown out of the two countries, Boucher  said, but about 1,550 remain trapped there.      BACKGROUND    Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1976 out of concern that a  cutoff in Mideast oil exports might threaten national security. It is designed  to store excess crude oil for use by the armed forces and key industries in  case of a shortage. The reserve, which currently contains 590 million barrels  of oil and has a daily pumping capacity of 3.5 million barrels, is a complex of  six water-filled salt domes on the Texas-Louisiana coast. Crude oil is pumped  into the domes, displacing the water; the salt forms an impermeable layer that  preserves the oil indefinitely. To retrieve the stores, seawater is pumped in,  thus displacing the oil. However, before the reserve can be tapped, the  President must declare a ""severe"" energy emergency. Japan, West Germany and  Sweden maintain similar reserves.    Staff writers Maura Reynolds and Robert L. Jackson contributed to this report.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that, according to an Iraqi transcript of  the meeting, Glaspie did not object to the Iraqi troop movements, building at  that time toward the Kuwaiti border.    Glaspie, who left Baghdad on vacation one day before the invasion, is now  stationed at the State Department.    Meanwhile, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the airlift of  Americans from Iraq and Kuwait is continuing. One planeload of 258 Americans  arrived late Thursday afternoon in Raleigh, N.C., and he said two more jumbo  jet flights were scheduled for today and Saturday.    A total of 920 Americans have been flown out of the two countries, Boucher  said, but about 1,550 remain trapped there.      BACKGROUND    Congress created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1976 out of concern that a  cutoff in Mideast oil exports might threaten national security. It is designed  to store excess crude oil for use by the armed forces and key industries in  case of a shortage. The reserve, which currently contains 590 million barrels  of oil and has a daily pumping capacity of 3.5 million barrels, is a complex of  six water-filled salt domes on the Texas-Louisiana coast. Crude oil is pumped  into the domes, displacing the water; the salt forms an impermeable layer that  preserves the oil indefinitely. To retrieve the stores, seawater is pumped in,  thus displacing the oil. However, before the reserve can be tapped, the  President must declare a ""severe"" energy emergency. Japan, West Germany and  Sweden maintain similar reserves.    Staff writers Maura Reynolds and Robert L. Jackson contributed to this report.

The Japan Foreign Trade Council, which groups major trading  companies, said the export contracts were down 18.0 percent in  value to 656.3 billion yen and import contracts fell 24.0  percent to 906.7 billion yen.    Export contracts posted the sixth consecutive year-on-year  fall and import contracts recorded the seventh such drop.    The council blamed the decreased export contracts on a slump  in auto export contracts, which it said stemmed from the yen's  appreciation and increased production by Japanese-owned assembly  plants overseas.    The lower import contracts were blamed on declines in  purchases of crude oil, as well as purchase of petroleum  products from Southeast Asia.    The council said exports are likely to recover in the coming  months, noting that demand is increasing for automobiles and  steel in the United States and other markets.    Imports may also increase in the months ahead, especially of  machinery from other Asian countries, the council said.     "

The group is also negotiating with Gulf Explorations Consultants, a US shell company in which Minmet has a 23.8 per cent stake, a possible paper bid for Minmet by Gulf. Mr Paul Bristol, chairman of Minmet, said that if a Gulf bid were accepted by Minmet's shareholders, the new entity would seek to revive its listing on Nasdaq, which may be considered a more suitable market than Dublin for raising funds for Russia Money and the group's Russian gold mining operations.

On his return from Qatar yesterday, Petroleum Minister  Aqazadeh announced the project. He said: The Islamic Republic  of Iran and Qatar jointly own a vast gas reserve in the Persian  Gulf and Qatar has started extracting from it.    With the establishment of a committee, which is to meet in  Tehran next month, the two countries will cooperate in  exchanging the technical knowledge, utilization, and sale of gas  from this joint reserve.    Petroleum Minister Aqazadeh, who was speaking to our  correspondent, referred to the upcoming OPEC ministerial session  to be held 15 June in Vienna. He said: The session was  discussed with the Qatari petroleum minister. Since there is a  vast difference between the current oil price and the $21 price  approved by OPEC, Iran and Qatar--in their capacity as  members--have made efforts to develop a common stance on how to  resolve the problems facing OPEC.
