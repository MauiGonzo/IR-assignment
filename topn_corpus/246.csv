While it continues to widen, the chances of the young generation in the developing world being able to help their nations achieve lasting economic progress remain slight. The second report on world education, published at the end of last year by Unesco (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation), provides stark evidence of the gulf in educational provision between richer and poorer nations. While many nations are now making real progress, goaded by the improvements made by the Pacific Rim countries on the back of strong national training systems, other areas - particularly sub-Saharan Africa - are being left further behind. The nine most populous developing nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - last December demonstrated that they thought increased educational provision was the key to economic progress, and stemming population growth, by pledging to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest possible moment'. Within the poorer nations, research reveals another 'gap'. In the developing world, girls are still thought unlikely to contribute economically, and receive far less education than boys. In many cases their families do not think it is worth it, thwarting any attempt by the state to improve girls' chances in life. Unesco's figures on the school life expectancy - how long a child can expect to stay in formal education - in different countries make depressing reading. Africa south of the Sahara and southern Asia suffer the greatest problems. In the Saharan nation of Niger, girls can expect to stay 1.4 years in school, while boys do scarcely better with 2.8. In Guinea, girls can only expect 1.6 years in school, while in populous Bangladesh, boys receive 5.8 years at school, compared with 4.2 for girls. In both Niger and Guinea, textbooks are available for less than 30 per cent of primary school children, and the school year is short. Comparative figures show that Canadian girls can expect 16.5 years of formal education (a year more than their brothers). Both boys and girls devote more than 15 years to formal study in the US. However, some parts of the developing world now provide as much education as member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, South Korea educates its children for an average of 13.3 years  -more than Australia, level with Japan and Sweden, and only slightly behind the UK. Several Latin American nations now have an educational life expectancy of more than a decade. Unsurprisingly, low educational provision has led to illiteracy in later life, and according to Unesco, most adults in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are illiterate. The total number of illiterate adults is still increasing in sub-Saharan Africa, the Arab states, and in southern Asia. However, the overall 'literacy gap' appears to be declining, as better-educated children in other parts of the developing world reach adulthood, and there is some confidence that much of the current disparity - particularly in sub-Saharan Africa - can be explained by the wide range of local languages. In Ethiopia, for example, the education ministry has introduced the use of four nationality languages - Oromigna, Tigrigna, Sidamigna and Wolaitigna - in primary schools, rather than the official language of Amharic. The reform should improve the standards of general education, because children will be instructed in the language they use at home, but it may be that overall literacy statistics will prove harder to compute. While problems with basic literacy and other skills may prevent emerging generations from providing the 'engine room' of increased economic output which developing countries need from them, disparities in higher education may in the short term be even more damaging. Lack of a developed higher education system critically damages competitiveness, as it becomes impossible for a nation's industrial and research and development communities to keep abreast with developments elsewhere. Most Latin American and Asian countries now have university enrolment levels which conform broadly with university entries in the OECD nations - Unesco reports show that sub-Saharan Africa is now alone in suffering from a 'higher education gap' by comparison with the rest of the world. Foreign exchange programmes account for a smaller proportion of students than they did 10 years ago, and most aid for developing countries now comes through direct aid from banks and funds. Nearly half of this goes to the Pacific Rim countries, whose education systems have already been extensively reformed. As this aid is in the form of loans which will have to be repaid by the countries which receive it, and much money has been spent on physical infrastructure and buildings, which create their own recurrent costs, it seems, still, that nobody has a clear grasp of how the 'gap' in higher education can be closed.  -------------------------------------------------------------------              PUBLIC RECURRENT EXPENDITURE PER PUPIL  ------------------------------------------------------------------- In pre-primary, first and second level education 1990  -------------------------------------------------------------------                            dollars  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan Africa            58 E.

THOSE WHO  REJECT TRAINING WILL BE DISCIPLINED OR LOSE BENEFITS.      By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The federal prison system, moving to reduce illiteracy in its swelling  population, is launching an aggressive effort to raise inmates' required  reading ability from eighth to 12th grade.    Prisoners who refuse to take reading classes when they test below the high  school graduate level will lose benefits inside the institutions or face  discipline under the program announced Wednesday by Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh.    But Thornburgh and federal Bureau of Prisons officials stressed positive  aspects of the effort, contending that prison literacy programs have been well  received by both staff and prisoners.    Inmates ""have readily accepted our new approach,"" Thornburgh said in a speech  to an international conference on literacy and corrections in Ottawa, Canada.  ""For most who cannot read, competing in the legitimate work world is  impossible.""    He added, ""We believe there is a straight-line relationship between literacy  levels and an individual's likelihood of involvement in substance abuse."" Basic  literacy ""not only helps the prisoner after release but, equally important,  contributes to a better life while in prison and to a safer environment for  both staff and inmates.""    Raising the literacy standard for the nation's 58,000 federal prisoners drew a  mixed reaction from organizations active in the literacy field.    ""One does not mandate education and literacy for adults,"" said Mike Fox,  director of Push Literacy Action Now, a Washington-based group that works in  literacy training and advocacy.    ""I would hope the program is incentive-based and not punitive,"" said Rene  Woodward, an associate at Southport Institute, a Connecticut-based research  organization that sponsors the Project on Adult Literacy. ""I don't know if you  can force even children to learn.""    About 20% of all federal inmates are illiterate, Thornburgh said, using the  standard of eighth grade as a benchmark.    Although this rate ""mirrors closely the illiteracy level of the general  population in the United States, we in the Justice Department are not content  to allow men and women in our custody to leave prison only meeting the general  norm,"" he said. ""We are committed to giving prisoners the opportunity to better  equip themselves for positive change, if they so desire.""    The attorney general said that professionals in the corrections field no longer  subscribe to the so-called ""medical model,"" under which prison staff members  prescribe programs expected to cure an inmate of criminality.    But this does not remove the need for ""effective motivational components . . .  that induce inmates to participate in what we see are critically interconnected  life-skill programs, such as literacy and work.""    Work assignments and literacy are the only two mandatory programs in the  federal prison system, Thornburgh said.    The literacy program in the Bureau of Prisons began in the early 1980s with a  sixth-grade literacy standard, which was later raised to eighth grade. The  standard will be raised again ""very shortly.""    Failure to work toward attaining literacy could be a negative factor in  deciding a prisoner's eligibility for moving outside prison to a half-way house  during the last six months of his term, Gregory Bogdan, a prison bureau  spokesman, said.    Similarly, it could result in an inmate's drawing the lowest rate of pay -- 44  cents an hour, instead of $1.05, the top hourly rate -- for work inside the  institution, according to Bogdan.    The number of teachers and educational administrators in the nation's 72  federal institutions has increased from 286 in 1986 to 559 in fiscal 1990,  Bogdan said.    Thornburgh noted that last year 10,546 inmates completed eighth-grade literacy  requirements; 3,100 earned high school equivalency diplomas, 7,356 completed  post-secondary education courses and more than 11,000 finished occupational  training programs.

0,FT934-1794 ,"FT934-1794 _AN-DLQC8AA3FT 931217   FT  17 DEC 93 / Populous countries learn education lesson      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   The governments of the nine most populous developing countries yesterday pledged to provide their children with universal education 'by the year 2000 or at the earliest possible moment'. Their promises, delivered in New Delhi at an international education summit sponsored by the United Nations, were in themselves little more than statements of good intent. However, reports presented to the summit showed that in most of the nine states the past few years have seen marked improvements in literacy rates and in the numbers of children going to school. The nine nations - China, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Brazil, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mexico and Egypt - together account for half the global population and 70 per cent of all adult illiterates. If the experience of more developed nations is any guide, the progress made in education will help cut population expansion and boost economic growth. The Education for All Summit was robbed of some of its political impact by last-minute cancellations by leaders who had planned to attend. President Suharto of Indonesia was the only guest government head who signed the summit declaration alongside his host, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the Indian prime minister. China was represented by a vice-premier and other nations by education ministers. Many of the nine countries' problems are similar, especially shortages of money, teachers, schools and materials. All face difficulties reaching children in remote rural districts and in persuading parents to send daughters to school as well as sons, and all have many adult illiterates. In the past three years, in every country education budgets have been increased, though in some the gains have been limited by subsequent cuts or by inflation. Mr James Grant, the executive director of Unicef, says this renewed commitment is due partly to the world-wide Education for All campaign launched by UN organisations in 1990 and partly to the growing realisation that economic growth and population control can best be achieved by promoting education. 'Everyone is learning from east Asia,' he says. However, the differences between individual countries are as important as the similarities. The summit reports describe some glaring gaps in achievement which are likely to get bigger before they get smaller, and may not shrink at all without radical policy changes in the laggard states. As a principal summit document says: 'To present the choice as now or never may over-dramatise it, but not by much.' Statistics are gathered from education ministries which often tend to exaggerate achievements. Nevertheless, the overall trends are clear. Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and China have seen adult literacy rates soar in the past decade to 70 per cent and above. The same countries already have 85 per cent or more of the children of primary school age enrolled. Enrolment rates in Egypt are also creditable, though few experts believe the official figure of 91 per cent and estimate the true figure is nearer 70 per cent. Brazil's high enrolment rate, which indicates how many youngsters start school, needs to be qualified by the fact that only 47 per cent complete three years. Unicef commends India for raising adult literacy above the 50 per cent mark. Despite having one of the world's best-educated elites, India for long neglected mass education, partly out of a lack of concern for promoting the interests of the lowest castes. But the sight of east Asian countries forging ahead in economic development prodded India into action. Unicef is also satisfied that Bangladesh, despite its poor literacy rating and its endemic poverty, has in the last two years under the premiership of Mrs Khaleda Zia shown determination to get children, especially girls, into school. The percentage of girls of primary school age enrolled at school has risen in the past decade from 45 to 64. The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, the largest non-government organisation, has won international renown as a pioneer in out-of-hours education for children who work or cannot attend regular school. The two countries that arouse the greatest concern are Pakistan and Nigeria, where a decade of political turmoil and financial pressures have left schools under-funded and demoralised. In Pakistan only 29 per cent of children are even enrolled in primary schools, and less than 20 per cent of girls. The diversion of funds from social to military spending, political upheaval, and moves to cut so-called 'western' influences in education and promote Islamic ones have all played their part in disrupting Pakistan's schooling. The summit papers show the contrast between Nigeria and another oil-rich country, Indonesia, which invested its revenues more wisely. Even though Indonesia lacked deep-rooted educational traditions, its post-colonial rulers have made mass education a priority and 'transformed education from the privilege of a tiny minority into a right enjoyed by nearly all', says the report. Ms Fay Chung, Unicef's chief education officer and a former education minister of Zimbabwe, says the most important determinant of success is not money but 'long-term political commitment'. The great enemy is political instability.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                        THE EDUCATION CHALLENGE  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                         Net enrolment  Children                GNP Dollars    Literacy  for primary    reaching                per capita         %     schooling %    4th year %  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Brazil           2,680           81         88            47 Mexico           2,490           87         98            81 Egypt              600           48         91            99 Indonesia          560           77         97            89 Pakistan           380           35         29            59 China              370           73         99            86 India              350           52         66            61 Nigeria            270           51         59            67 Bangladesh         200           35         63            52  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Unesco and Unicef, based on national reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  BRZ  Brazil, South America.

0, FR940920-2-00155   FR940920-2-00089        As demands on adults' time continue to escalate," FR940920-2-00155   FR940920-2-00089        As demands on adults' time continue to escalate_with more people working longer hours, commuting greater distances, and coping with day care and elder care issues_the traditional, tutorial/classroom-based approach to adult education may not be the best mechanism, in many cases, for attracting and retaining adult education students. Incorporating new technologies into adult literacy programs may be one way to address the time constraints of the adult education student. The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) found in a 1993 study that technology could help transform the field of adult literacy by, for example, allowing students to proceed at their own pace, customize their studies, and establish a schedule that is compatible with their daily lives. However, OTA also suggested that technology does not play a central role in most adult literacy programs.   Should the Federal Government encourage the use of more technology in adult literacy programs? If so, how can technology of proven effectiveness in enhancing learning be incorporated in cost-effective ways that learners will find beneficial?   Linking Adult Education to Other Domestic Initiatives.   In recent years, policymakers have begun to turn to adult education services as a means of addressing other societal problems, for example, requiring participation in literacy programs for prison parole, continuation of welfare benefits, or, through Even Start, making adult literacy instruction a component of elementary and secondary education improvement. Should the Adult Education Act continue to address very general purposes, or should it be tied explicitly to national efforts to redevelop poor neighborhoods, end welfare dependency, fight crime, or ensure a smooth integration of new immigrants into American society? If the Adult Education Act is linked to other domestic initiatives, should the Act be revised to reflect the impact that mandatory participation requirements of certain programs, such as JOBS, have on adult education programs?       2. State Literacy Resource Centers      The National Literacy Act created the State Literacy Resource Centers program to stimulate the coordination of literacy services, enhance the capacity of State and local organizations to provide literacy services, and serve as a link between the National Institute for Literacy and service providers to share information and expertise.   Are State Literacy Resource Centers effective at meeting the goals of the Act? What steps, if any, should be taken at the Federal level to improve the effectiveness of the Centers? Should the funds allotted under this program continue to be channeled through State Governors?       3. Discretionary Programs      Current law authorizes several discretionary grant programs. Most of these programs are small and fund a limited number of recipients. Although the purpose of the programs is generally the demonstration of effective strategies for addressing particular issues or problems, funds often support local projects that, while beneficial to the recipients, are not designed in a way to yield lessons for broader use.   What role should Adult Education discretionary programs play in helping the Nation achieve its education goals? Would these resources be more effectively utilized under broader authorities, such as the Adult Education State formula grant program? Do the current programs encourage a piecemeal, rather than comprehensive, approach to adult education reform (with service providers devoting too much attention to applying for and administering separate competitive grants), or do they focus attention where it is needed? If there is a need for Federal demonstration programs, what changes are needed to ensure that they are designed as true demonstrations and serve their purposes effectively? What types of evaluation and reporting ought to be required?       4. Workplace Literacy Partnerships      At current funding levels, the National Workplace Literacy program makes discretionary grants for demonstrations that provide literacy training to meet workplace needs. Since its inception in 1988, this demonstration program has generated important information about effective workplace literacy practices. The program has produced curricula transferable for use by specific types of industries, and a national evaluation, currently underway, will generate additional information about program effectiveness. However, after eight years and 261 grants the continuation of the National Workplace Literacy program, in its current form, may not appreciably add to our base of knowledge in this area.          "

In Asia and Latin America the fertility rate has nearly halved from 5.9 to about 3 children per woman in that period, although Africa (including northern African states) has showed a smaller decline from 6.6 to 5.8. Even in developed countries, rates have fallen from 2.8 to 1.7 over that period. These patterns have forced demographers to modify the old assumption of a link between low birth rates and economic wealth in favour of a more complex picture. Some countries, such as Bangladesh, have achieved steep falls in fertility rates despite relative lack of economic growth. Others, notably Pakistan and Middle Eastern countries, continue to have large average family sizes despite relatively high levels of economic prosperity. The UNFPA draws a close connection between low fertility rates and the availability of contraception, even where gross domestic product per head has not risen greatly. It attributes roughly half of the fall in worldwide fertility rates to improved distribution of contraceptives. The other half, it says, is due simply to the determination of parents to have fewer children, even when contraception is not available. Even the poorest families, UNFPA officials say, work out that they can spend more on each child if they have fewer children. Demographers have long agreed that improving women's education plays an important part in reducing family sizes. But the UN report suggests that newer pressures are also providing powerful motivation. When workers move to towns from the countryside they tend to delay having children and to have fewer. Anecdotal evidence from west African countries also suggests that looming land shortages are curbing the size of rural families. These new factors may be helping to push down fertility rates even in Africa and central America, the regions which have persistently had the highest rates, Mr Alex Marshall of UNFPA suggests. Since the first half of the 1980s, Tanzania has seen fertility rates drop from 6.7 to 5.9 children per woman, Namibia from 5.8 to 5.3 and South Africa from 4.8 to 4.1.   Countries:-  XOZ  Asia.

TUTORS ARE FELLOW SUBSTANCE ABUSERS.      By STEVE PADILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER      He spent four years at the University of Houston, playing wide receiver,  majoring in psychology. But when Gary Sapp left the university to join the  Houston Oilers in 1979, he could not even read a menu or write a check.    What he could do was play football with abandon, especially if he was high on  cocaine, which he often was. Who needed to read or write when there were drugs  and money and fame?    Today, as Sapp looks back on a helter-skelter past and a pro career that was  clipped short by liquor and drugs, he realizes that his addiction was tied  intrinsically to his illiteracy.    And so, to kick his habit and rebuild his life, he is learning, at the age of  36, to read.    Sapp is one of about 100 recovering drug addicts and alcoholics at the Acton  Rehabilitation Center participating in an innovative year-old program, perhaps  the only one of its kind in the country, which uses the simple act of reading  as part of the treatment of chemical dependency.    Illiterate addicts are taught to read by fellow substance abusers who have been  trained as tutors. The result: The self-esteem of both rises and their chances  of completing the rehabilitation center's 90-day recovery program increase  dramatically.    Illiteracy alone probably will not drive someone to drugs, experts say, but the  inability to read can, to some extent, be a cause and an effect of substance  abuse. Low self-worth, a loss of hope and slim chances of landing a good job --  all byproducts of illiteracy -- contribute to the desire to turn to drugs as an  escape, experts say.    ""Being illiterate played a big part in my addiction,"" Sapp said. He was so  ashamed of himself, for example, that Sapp once wore an eye patch, feigning  injury, to have others read for him.    After two months of treatment in Acton, Sapp reads at a seventh-grade level. ""I  like myself now,"" he said. ""I'm tired of living in shadows.""    Before entering the reading program, 55% of the center's clients completed the  90-day residency program, said Richard Rioux, director of special projects at  the center. But for the program's students and tutors, he said, the completion  rate is 80%.    The surge in completion rates has surprised counselors at the center,  especially because the literacy program is so simple, both in philosophy and  execution. Almost sheepishly, Rioux said, ""Why didn't we think of it sooner?""    The need for literacy training was discovered by accident about two years ago  after the center, which is run by the Los Angeles County Department of Health  Services, tried to launch a job training program in Acton and at a sister  facility in Warm Springs in the Antelope Valley.    Counselors soon realized that about a third of the residents could not fill out  a job application or read classified ads, Rioux said. About half read at the  seventh-grade level or below.    With a $60,000 federal grant, the center launched the literacy program in  January, 1989, at the two centers. Tutors were trained in techniques used by  Literacy Volunteers of America and now each person admitted to the residence  center is tested in reading and math. Participation in the program, however, is  voluntary.    The tutors and students work one-on-one in their rooms, in the library or even  on the athletic fields at the rehabilitation center, a secluded village-like  compound of cabins and bungalows located about 47 miles north of downtown Los  Angeles. Built as a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the 1930s, the 130-acre  center is quiet and peaceful, surrounded by gently sloping hills.    So far, 265 students and 135 tutors have completed the literacy program, Rioux  said. A third of the Acton center's 300 residents currently participate;  another 200 do so in Warm Springs.    Residents are referred to the center by private and public social agencies, the  courts, hospitals and halfway houses. Some, such as Sapp, admit themselves.    Experts in literacy said the program is unusual.    Reading programs are becoming increasingly common in prisons -- where 76% of  the inmates nationwide read below the sixth-grade level -- and in shelters for  the homeless, said Jody Koloski, executive director of the American Assn. for  Adult and Continuing Education in Washington. Researchers have long recognized  that illiteracy and the low self-esteem it engenders contributes to, but does  not necessarily cause, a host of social ills, she said.    But combining reading with drug and alcohol rehabilitation is rare, if not  unheard of.    ""This is the only place I know where that's being done,"" said Juanita Stanley,  executive director of California Literacy Inc.    ""It is quite new,"" said Beverly Miller, a spokeswoman for Literacy Volunteers  of America, based in Syracuse, N.Y.    It's too early to say how Acton residents will fare when they leave the  program. Recovering addicts often slide back into abuse before they finally  come clean, Rioux said. ""We've had people in here with 17 or 18 programs behind  them,"" he said.    Sapp, for example, tried to rehabilitate himself once before. He enrolled at  the Acton center in 1984 and briefly stayed off drugs and alcohol before he  resumed the high-flying lifestyle he adopted at the University of Houston,  where overzealous alumni slipped him envelopes stuffed with $500 for each  touchdown he scored.    Sapp left Houston nine units shy of a degree -- ""entered a dummy and left a  dummy"" -- and started a brief professional career that included seasons with  the Oilers, Raiders and Jets. Tumultuous years of using and selling drugs  followed, Sapp said.    Today, Sapp reads the sports page and books by Alcoholics Anonymous. He's  getting back in shape and looks like the pro athlete he once was and runs every  morning and afternoon in the hills of Acton. Only his face, with its sad eyes,  give hints of his addiction.    ""I can read just about anything now,"" he said.    Once a week, about 20 to 30 tutors and students gather at the center library  for the ""tutor rap,"" an informal time to discuss their program and share tips  on teaching. Like Sapp, many had tried unsuccessfully to rehabilitate  themselves in the past.    The intimate work of tutor and student creates bonds of friendship and love  that give both the strength to succeed, said Bill O'Connor at the tutor rap  last week. O'Connor, who teaches math to Christine Schuster from Palmdale, is a  58-year-old recovering alcoholic who, ironically, was formerly the director of  a substance abuse recovery program in Los Angeles.    Schuster, who never completed junior high, said O'Connor is unlike the other  teachers she had in school. He cared, she said. ""He was the best tutor I ever  had.""    Some stories end in failure, but even the failures contain lessons.    Jean Phillippe de Ruise, known to everyone as Frenchy, said he could not  understand why one of his students spurned him and refused to study. De Ruise  blamed himself for his student's failure until he realized that the desire to  read, like the desire to quit drugs, must come from within.    So the tutor finally gave up. ""I had to let him go,"" he said. ""He didn't want  it."" The former student still can't read.    Finally, Tony Frongello of Redondo Beach raised his hand to speak. A salesman  for a cable TV company, Frongello had been skeptical when he enrolled in the  literacy program.     They're going to have a drug addict like me teaching me to read? he thought.  It couldn't work.    But last week, Frongello told how his tutor, Ralph Robertson, changed his life.  ""I didn't think I could read at all,"" he began. ""I was ashamed to read in front  of people.""    His voice thick with emotion, Frongello paused, struggling for the words,  fighting back tears. The meeting room was uncomfortably quiet until tutor  Annetta Daniel broke the tension. She threw out her arms and hugged him. The  room erupted with applause and shouts.    ""Now this is what it is!"" someone said, exuberantly.    ""I can read,"" Frongello said when noise died down. ""I never really knew I could  read that well. Now I can read whole books.""

By LUZ VILLARREAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER      As his young daughters cuddled next to him one recent evening, Geno Godinet  read them bedtime stories in a slow, deliberate tone. A year ago, Godinet used  to recite the same fairy tales by memory because he couldn't read.    Then, the 40-year-old elevator repairman decided to do something about his  reading problem.    After nearly one year of weekly tutoring sessions, Godinet not only can read  stories to his daughters but can also perform the everyday reading and writing  tasks that he needs on his job.    ""More and more reading is required,"" Godinet said.    There are an estimated 23 million adults in the United States who are  illiterate -- and several hundred thousand of them in Orange County. Studies  have found that 15% of the nation's work force is functionally illiterate.    For businesses, the cost of re-educating illiterate workers is staggering. In  1988, private corporations nationally spent $25 billion on programs to teach  basic reading and writing skills to their employees, according to the National  Alliance of Business in Los Angeles.    And, according to a report from the Literacy Volunteers of America, 99% of all  workers perform some reading-related work each day. To keep pace with the job,  they need to read an average of 113 minutes each day.    Thus, Orange County companies have been taking steps to address the literacy  problem.    Fourteen local companies, for example, contributed money to the Newport Beach  Public Library literacy program and took part in the first Business Spelling  Bee for Literacy in Newport Beach last Friday. The spelling bee, sponsored by  the library, is intended to boost awareness about illiteracy in the county.  Organizers hope to make this an annual event.    Lucinda Zirkelbach, assistant account executive for InterCommunications Inc. in  Newport Beach, says the spelling bee ""is one excellent way of getting the word  out to companies that there is a (literacy) problem.""    Some businesses are striving to improve their employees' reading and writing  skills by setting up in-house literacy programs.    Ricoh Electronics, a Tustin-based electronics manufacturer, started a  English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) program in late 1988. More than 80% of  Ricoh's 1,300 employees are minority workers, most of whom are Latino. A  company official estimated that more than 20% of the firm's employees are  illiterate.    The ESL program is free to Ricoh and its employees, with the cost of the  program paid by the state Department of Education. It is offered as an extended  course at Rancho Santiago Community College.    About 100 Ricoh employees already have completed the literacy program. And the  Japanese-owned firm is so pleased with the results that it plans to continue  the program, said Rino Zaccuri, a company spokesman.    ""The classes are free to employees, and the students learn skills in chart  reading and inventory. The classes also are geared toward survival skills:  banking, reading traffic signs and everyday things (such as in) grocery  stores,"" Zaccuri said.    Jo Caines, director of community relations for KOCE-TV in Huntington Beach and  coordinator of the county chapter of Project Literacy U.S., a national literacy  program, said that businesses are becoming more aware of the problem.    ""They are realizing that if their employees are illiterate, it definitely  affects the economy,"" she said.    Besides the company-run programs, there are more than 70 other literacy  services throughout the county, sponsored by libraries, churches, schools,  nursing homes and other organizations, according to Keri Gee Barnett,  chairperson of the Literacy Communications Coalition, a literacy project  coordinated by the Public Relations Society of America.    ""There are many (people) falling through the cracks who don't read. We hope  that anybody who is not an effective reader will know there are literacy  providers in the county. All they have to do is call for help,"" Barnett  advised.    Another project is the Literacy Is for Everyone (LIFE) lab at Orange Coast  College in Costa Mesa. The lab, designed to teach people to read and write, is  scheduled to open in March. Funded by contributions from businesses, the lab  has received $72,000 in cash and $14,000 in computer equipment from 12  companies. About $12,000 more is needed to get the program under way, said  Douglas C. Bennett, executive director of the Orange Coast College Foundation.    Godinet, the elevator repairman, turned to the Newport Beach Public Library's  literacy program because he wanted to improve his career options. He realized  that, without the ability to read, he would be unable to complete even a simple  task, such as filling out an employment application.    For most of his career, Godinet, who works for Montgomery Elevator Co. in  Irvine, managed to get along by learning his skills through  on-the-job-training. But he says it is getting harder and harder for people  like him to find jobs.    Godinet, who now reads at about a sixth-grade level, said he is no longer  embarrassed about his reading problem. But he remembers how, in the past, he  used to fear that his co-workers would discover his illiteracy.    ""At work, there were many instances when I would be humiliated,"" he recalled.  ""When I would make the lunch run, the other workers would tell me to write down  the order list, but I couldn't write. People caught on and started making fun  of me. They would ask, 'You don't know how to read?' It got to be a joke.    ""I don't feel all that bad now because I am doing something about it,"" he said.

The region has opened 5,453 evening literacy schools and  more  than 120,000 people have passed literacy tests.    According to a survey conducted by the regional government  recently, the number of illiterates has dropped to 44.43 percent  from 95 percent before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1951.    In Shannan Prefecture, about 9,000 illiterates have attended  evening literacy schools over the past five years and 85 percent  of the young people have learned how to read and write.    Despite the efforts, the illiteracy rate in Tibet is still  on  the high side as compared with other parts of the country.    Greater efforts are needed to raise the general educational  level of the farmers and herdsmen, who account for 80 percent of  the total population of the region, an official from the  regional government said.

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania      The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the  1980s.    Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of  Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two  abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new  locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming  rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right  of way and to train railroad staff.    Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines  remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been  destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line.    Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway --  enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of  wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes  recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments.    Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of  inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in  the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running  downhill to disaster.    After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s  as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and  economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so  sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that  most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the  dawn of the continent's era of independence.    ""There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators,  widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the  social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation,""  says a U.N. report. ""The unending crisis did not affect only the current  well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development  prospects of the region as a whole.""    The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years  swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and  cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets.    One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its  thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing  eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down  faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost  every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than  50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war  with Eritrean rebels.    Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is  losing interest in a place that never seems to get better.    ""The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the  1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance,"" says Salim  Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news.  ""How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic  and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?""    Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when  Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by  switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter  of cut flowers.    African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the  former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily  dividing some tribes and combining others.    Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the  wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too  small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four  have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is  uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable  land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is  crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all.    African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their  European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a  pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that  these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries'  problems.    One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed  their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against  not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they  saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania created something called ""African socialism,"" based on what  they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help.    Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's  catch-phrase, articulated in the ""Arusha Declaration"" of 1967, was ""socialism  and self-reliance."" But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita  foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least  self-reliant countries.    Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of  nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure  of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most  promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial  base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the  mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of  unbridled corruption.    ""Everyone knows that to run a socialist enterprise you need good management to  make up for the lack of individual incentives like the profit motive,"" one  Scandinavian development official said in discussing the disastrous record of  state-owned farms in nominally Marxist Ethiopia. ""Of course, management skills  are the one thing most lacking in Africa.""    Wherever the blame lies, the toll of Africa's marginalization is enormous. The  U.N. Development Program recently noted that ""between 1979 and 1985 the number  of African people below the poverty line increased by almost two-thirds,  compared with an average increase of one-fifth in the entire developing world.""    The urgency embodied in this figure has, oddly enough, led development  officials to contemplate how the ""quick fixes"" of the 1970s and 1980s went  awry: The manipulations of currency rates and the rapid infusions of aid money  and project ideas that frequently canceled each other out or duplicated effort  -- all without helping Africans build and sustain their own institutions.    Some development experts say what Africa needs may be something approaching  benign neglect. If the developed world does begin to withdraw attention and  resources from the embattled continent, one notes, it may finally wean itself  from the diet of aid.    ""There is a positive side,"" he says. ""It may actually encourage governments to  adopt policies that will be much more self-reliant and not as dependent on  outside resources.""    Africa and Third World: Region Falls Behind    Not only do the nearly 40 countries of black Afric live in a different economic  world than the industrialized countries; they are slipping behind the rest of  the THird World by many key measures of development.

By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      DAR-ES-SALAAM, Tanzania      The Tanzania-Zambia Railway could well be a metaphor for Africa's path in the  1980s.    Known as Tazara, the 1,100-mile, Chinese-built line linking the copper belt of  Zambia to this Tanzanian port was turned over to the governments of the two  abutting countries just before the decade began. Included were 128 new  locomotives and hundreds of passenger and freight cars to run on the gleaming  rails. Western countries contributed millions of dollars to maintain the right  of way and to train railroad staff.    Today, little more than a decade after its opening, only 39 of the engines  remain in working order. Another 39 are awaiting repair, and 50 have been  destroyed by collisions and derailings on the deteriorating line.    Last year, a Swedish development agency donated 350 new cars to the railway --  enough, it has been estimated, to last only seven years at the current rate of  wreckage. Some of the cars derailed on their maiden journey, the Swedes  recently complained in a blistering letter to the two governments.    Like Tazara, whose fate is the result of chronic African maladies of  inattention, lack of maintenance, and penury, so went most of the continent in  the 1980s. Development experts describe sub-Saharan Africa as a train running  downhill to disaster.    After a period of genuine hope in the 1970s, these experts describe the 1980s  as the region's lost decade. By almost every measure of human welfare and  economic health, the area retrogressed during that period, in some cases so  sharply that Barber Conable, head of the World Bank, remarked recently that  most Africans today are every bit as poor as they were 30 years ago, at the  dawn of the continent's era of independence.    ""There was general deterioration in the main macroeconomic indicators,  widespread disintegration of productive facilities, a rapid worsening in the  social scene, repeated droughts and accelerating environmental degradation,""  says a U.N. report. ""The unending crisis did not affect only the current  well-being of the average African; it threatened the long-term development  prospects of the region as a whole.""    The 1980s saw many of Africa's modest gains of the previous 10 or 15 years  swept off in a windstorm of deteriorating roads, disappearing forest and  cropland, collapsing schoolhouses, and mushrooming military budgets.    One can debate which African capital has the biggest potholes on its  thoroughfares. Efforts to stem deforestation by planting fast-growing  eucalyptus trees fail because Africans who need wood for fuel cut them down  faster than they can grow. Ethiopia, which ranks close to rock-bottom in almost  every measure of welfare and development known to humankind, spends more than  50% of its budget on weapons to fight a largely stalemated 30-year civil war  with Eritrean rebels.    Many fear that the 1990s will be worse. For one thing, the rest of the world is  losing interest in a place that never seems to get better.    ""The broad international support for helping a continent in distress in the  1980s has been dissipated now by repeated calls for assistance,"" says Salim  Lone, a Kenyan who edits Africa Recovery, a U.N. journal of development news.  ""How long can people accept that Africa is a special place, when the economic  and political returns from Eastern Europe are infinitely greater?""    Africa no longer has a geopolitical card to play. Gone are the days when  Ethiopia and Somalia could play the East and West off against each other by  switching allegiance between the United States and the Soviet Union. Zaire can  no longer earn millions in U.S. aid as a staging base for anti-Marxist rebels  in neighboring Angola, where Cuban troops have been on the other side.    ""In the past, certain places in Africa could compete for attention by turning  to the East or West,"" Lone says. ""But now East-West amity has stripped the  continent of whatever strategic value it had before.""    The nearly 40 countries of black Africa south of the Sahara Desert are  increasingly detached from the rest of the world in economic terms, too. Their  export crops, such as coffee and tea, are not rare or highly valued. Their  appetites for foreign industrial goods remain high, but the scarcity of foreign  currency to buy them means that hospitals and shoe factories alike crumble for  want of spare parts.    At the end of the 1970s, the continent had a healthy trade surplus of $29  billion with the rest of the world. Today, with reduced export income and  higher import prices, it has a trade deficit of $7.7 billion. Sub-Saharan  Africa's share of world trade is 1.7%.    The gross domestic product of the entire region, which has twice the population  of the United States, is roughly equivalent to that of Belgium.    There is no question as to who bears the burden of this economic estrangement:  the poor. Africa has a near-monopoly on the bottom rankings of countries in  terms of social welfare. Nine of the 10 countries with the lowest life  expectancies in the world are African. Sierra Leone and Ethiopia have life  expectancies of 42 years, tied for lowest with Afghanistan. The others are  Guinea (43); Mali, Angola and Niger (45), and Somalia, Central African Republic  and Chad (46).    Nine of the 10 countries with the highest infant mortality rates are also  African: Mozambique and Angola, both the scenes of civil wars, are tied for the  worst (172 per 1,000 live births), followed by Mali (168), Sierra Leone and  Ethiopia (153), Malawi (149), Guinea (146), Burkina Faso (137) and Niger (134).    Six of the 10 countries with the lowest literacy rates and eight of the 10  countries with the lowest rate of access to safe water are also in sub-Saharan  Africa.    There is little doubt that such unrelieved misery is straining the social  fabric. The street protests and riots spreading across Africa this year in a  demand for new political systems are rooted in the poverty afflicting every  country.    More than 20 people were killed in five days of street clashes last week in  Kenya, where the unrest, starting with an informal rally against the country's  one-party system, was fed by legions of the unemployed and underemployed who  fill Nairobi and every other African metropolis.    The geographic characteristics of many of these nations mean they will never be  rich, or perhaps even self-sufficient. In the roll of dishonor above, it should  be noted that Mali, Niger, Chad and Somalia are desert countries with  significant populations of nomadic herders. Burkina Faso, once known as Upper  Volta, is on the edge of the encroaching desert. Central African Republic and  Malawi are landlocked.    A great belt of the continent lies within the so-called intertropical zone, or  ITZ, the swath of Earth between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn where  weather patterns are the most unpredictable and crop failures frequent.    But the record is not much better in the comparatively richly endowed states of  this region. Zambia, which has vast stretches of arable land, recently had to  issue ration cards to its huge population of city dwellers because bread and  wheat were in such short supply. When the government tried to raise prices of  these staples last month, food riots erupted, taking 23 lives. In Kenya,  perhaps the biggest success story among African economies, foreign aid amounts  to 30% of the government budget, which obviously cannot be balanced without it.    When Ghana gained its independence in 1957 to usher in the continent's  post-colonial period, it was rich from an annual crop of the world's  highest-quality cocoa beans and from the gold mines that accounted for its  colonial-era name of Gold Coast. Two coups and a series of inept economic  policies followed. Today, foreign investors are trying to resurrect mines that  have lain unused for 10 years, and the cocoa crop is insignificant.    Ghana boasts the lowest minimum wage in Africa, and even upper-level civil  servants can feed their families only once a day. At one point in the 1980s, a  two-income household in which both workers received minimum wage could afford  less than 10% of the lowest-cost diet needed to meet minimum nutritional needs.    Africa's lost decade could not have come at a worse time. The 1990s will see a  surge in regional trade alliances like the European market, while sub-Saharan  Africa's 40 countries are still waging border skirmishes and erecting new  customs barriers that inhibit competitiveness. Regional trade compacts such as  the East African Community, involving Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, have either  collapsed or, like the ambitious Economic Community of West African States,  proven totally ineffective.    The world technological revolution will pick up its pace as computers and fax  machines become increasingly indispensable tools of economic growth. These  machines depend on adequate telephone service, but in Africa fewer than one  person in 300 has access to a telephone -- half the level of service as Asia's  and one-sixteenth that in Latin America.    ""These factors can only lead to the further marginalization of Africa in the  1990s and beyond,"" warns Adebayo Adedegi, head of the U.N. Economic Commission  for Africa.    Africa's inability to emerge from its long decline has provoked a raging debate  among development experts about the reasons -- and particularly about the  extent to which Western aid policies themselves should be blamed. Some argue  that the nature of the aid bureaucracy -- tens of thousands of technocrats and  administrators paid at Western, not African, wage scales -- overstates the  amount of actual aid that has flowed into Africa.    ""You talk about billions of dollars going to Africa -- but how much of that  actually benefits Africans?"" remarks one U.N. Development Program official in  West Africa. ""Every European official here costs $100,000 to $150,000 a year to  support, plus equipment, cars and so on. By the time you're finished, half the  money in any program is spent.""    Much of what is left has gone into project financing -- the construction of  demonstration farms, model factories and so on. Africa is littered with the  rusted and gutted hulks of these well-intentioned but poorly planned edifices.    In Tanzania, for example, foreign donors in the early 1980s eagerly studied  statistics on fish landings from rich Lake Victoria and paid for a  multimillion-dollar fish processing plant on the lake shore in the district of  Mwanza. The plant had an immense appetite for fish, and Mwanza's fishermen  obligingly supplied it -- overfishing their portion of the vast lake so  severely that it became a dead body of water. Today the plant is shuttered and  crumbling, its lifeblood exploited into extinction.    African leaders themselves have done little to respond to external challenges,  30 years after independence and more than a decade after commodity prices  collapsed. Instead of diversifying, the vast majority of these countries still  depend on their top three commodity exports for 75% or more of their foreign  earnings. Generally these are commodities, such as coffee and tea, in which the  countries compete with each other in already glutted foreign markets.    The search for new markets is uneven, but often rewarding: Kenya responded to  the collapse in the prices of coffee and tea by encouraging its small  horticulture industry. Today the country is the world's fourth-biggest exporter  of cut flowers.    African leaders talk incessantly about how the national borders drawn up by the  former colonial powers institutionalized political tensions by arbitrarily  dividing some tribes and combining others.    Thirty years of economic history suggests the problem is not necessarily the  wrong borders, but too many of them. Many sub-Saharan countries are simply too  small or too deprived to be self-sufficient. Eleven are landlocked. Thirty-four  have fewer than 10 million people. The distribution of natural resources is  uneven: Zambia, with 7.5 million people, has copper and broad swaths of arable  land -- largely unused -- while in neighboring Malawi, a similar population is  crowded on one-seventh as much territory and with no mineral deposits at all.    African leaders complain, quite fairly, that in granting independence their  European colonial masters left them with inadequate roads and railroads and a  pitifully small cadre of university-educated leaders. But it is clear now that  these leaders themselves must shoulder much of the blame for their countries'  problems.    One key is the persistence of failed policies. Many African statesmen formed  their economic ideas in the crucible of anti-colonialism: They reacted against  not only European politics, but also European free-market economics, which they  saw as exploitative. Great leaders like Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius K.  Nyerere of Tanzania created something called ""African socialism,"" based on what  they contended was Africans' unique sense of community and self-help.    Today Zambia and Tanzania are among Africa's most dismal failures. Nyerere's  catch-phrase, articulated in the ""Arusha Declaration"" of 1967, was ""socialism  and self-reliance."" But after decades of receiving the highest per-capita  foreign aid in all sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania is one of the world's least  self-reliant countries.    Kaunda, whose frequent emotional, even tearful, public speeches on the evils of  nuclear proliferation and other scarcely relevant issues have made him a figure  of worldwide respect, has presided over the collapse of one of Africa's most  promising lands. Zambia became independent blessed with the best industrial  base in southern Africa; it has been left a rotting skeleton through the  mismanagement of state-owned enterprises operating in an environment of  unbridled corruption.

The Montebello Public Library, a usually quiet haven for students and assorted  book seekers, was abuzz with Secret Service agents, news media crews and  members of the White House entourage as Mrs. Bush arrived for a one-hour visit.    ""I'm here to cheer these people,"" she said, referring to several adults who  have learned to read through the Los Angeles County library program. ""I'm  thrilled with what California has done.""    The County Public Library system provides adult literacy programs as part of  the 5-year-old California Literacy Campaign. In 1986, a toll-free, multilingual  literacy hot line began at the Montebello library, making it a headquarters  linking those wanting to learn to read with those willing to teach them. The  regional program has had more than 8,000 students, many of whom found tutors by  dialing the hot line number -- 1-800-372-6641.    After her arrival at 10:30 a.m., Mrs. Bush, honorary chairwoman of the National  Advisory Council of Literacy Volunteers of America, watched briefly as the  coordinator of the Community Access Library Line fielded two hot line calls  about the literacy program.    The First Lady chatted with 12 of the program's tutors and students, among them  a 52-year-old man who sought help so he could read his Bible, and a 45-year-old  mother of nine who last week wrote a letter for the first time in her life.    After meeting the First Lady, student William Heeney, 27, explained why he  entered the program in July, 1988.    ""I thought 'how could I look after my kids if anything happened to my wife?'    ""I never thought it would get this big,"" said the father of two, who owns a  construction business. ""I never thought I'd meet the President's wife.""    It could inflate a man's ego, meeting Barbara Bush, said student Chris Norton,  26, a landscaper. He said it would be a nice story to rub in the face of those  kids, now grown, who called him ""retarded"" because he had to take special  education classes when he was a little boy. But he won't.    ""I feel special (to have met her). . . . But deep down inside, I'm no better  than they are,"" said Norton, whose reading skills have jumped from a second- to  a sixth-grade level. ""I wish they could have felt that way (in school); that  they were no better than anybody else.""    Norton said low self-esteem because he could not read kept him from  participating in sports and other activities as a child.    ""It's just a lonely world not knowing how to read,"" he said. ""I just wish I  could've done this when I was 10 years old and not 26.""    Mrs. Bush praised the regional program and the statewide literacy campaign, but  added that there is still much work to be done to combat the problem of  illiteracy.    ""When I hear you have a million people who need help, then you have to get a  bigger campaign going,"" she said, referring to the estimated number of  functionally illiterate adults living in the county. ""I'm not knocking Los  Angeles. It's all over the country.""    Mrs. Bush left with a bouquet of red roses, and at least one new fan.

The article was an extract from the collected works of the Mahatma Gandhi, India's founder. Top city officials in Delhi were spending part of their weekend being photographed following Gandhi's precept. It was a token gesture, and enduring answers to India's public health problems remain elusive. After significant progress to improve the social framework since independence in 1947, concerns are growing that sanitation, nutrition and literacy for its 900m people are slipping down the government's list of priorities even as liberalisation offers the prospect of rapid economic growth. Health care provision from all public sources is estimated to account for only 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product, half its peak level. Some states spend less than a dollar per head a year, and three quarters of rural clinics are privately run. Achievements on some fronts are diluted by a failure to provide matching facilities in others. Some 78 per cent of rural dwellers have access to safe water (although this may require a 2km return trip to collect) but, according to Unicef, only 11 per cent have access to a latrine. While the plague toll which alarmed the world reached only 55, someone in India dies every minute of tuberculosis - the country has 40 per cent of the world's cases - and up to 10,000 under-fives perish each day, largely of pneumonia or of dehydration brought on by simple diarrhoea. This is in spite of the halving of infant mortality rates since independence. A mass immunisation programme launched in the 1980s achieved 80 per cent coverage. A few states such as Kerala and Tamil Nadu in the south have demographic profiles approaching those of developed countries, and aid agencies working in India argue that this shows large-scale programmes can have a durable effect. But as well as old problems such as the plague, new ones surface. Some 1.6m Indians are estimated to be HIV positive, and research presented at the international conference on Aids in Yokohama, Japan this August showed that from an initial detection in 1986 the prevalence of the virus had spread across the country and beyond high-risk groups such as prostitutes and their clients. With heterosexual sex the main means of transmission, about half those infected are women. Incidence of the virus is 'strongly linked with other problems resulting from overpopulation, poverty, disease, illiteracy and gender bias,' says Dr Sengupta Sushma of the All India Women's Conference. Many Aids-associated illnesses go unidentified, let alone treated, and Indian pharmaceutical companies are just starting to develop diagnostic kits suitable for the country. The Bombay-based Lupin Laboratories expects to have one in production by the end of the year which will not be affected by heat, a common problem when such materials have to be distributed by road to rural centres. According to health workers, Aids education in schools is bedevilled by social taboos, while getting this and other messages across to adults is made harder by the fact that 48 per cent of the population remains illiterate. India's target of universal literacy by 2000 is looking increasingly unattainable. Unicef's Ms Gillian Wilcox describes 1995 as the 'make-or-break year' where those starting school need to be retained for the five years of primary education which will provide their reading and writing skills. Dropout rates can commonly reach 40 or 50 per cent in the first year. Government curricula are being re-examined in an attempt to make what is being taught seem less alien particularly to rural children, and experimental projects in various parts of the country show what could be achieved more widely if the public education system is freed from some of its rigidities. At Turki, just north of the Ganges in poverty-stricken rural Bihar, 560 children attend what has become known as India's first 'school for shepherds.' Its 25 acres provides grazing for their families' livestock while, in addition to Hindi and arithmetic, they learn animal husbandry, basket weaving and sandal making. Mr Sita Ram Rai, the head teacher, says: 'Our basic aim is to make them literate, then give them training.' Unusually, they get a midday meal and they get paid to attend - one rupee a day for the lowest-caste children, less for those who are more privileged. In the central state of Madhya Pradesh a local non-governmental organisation called Eklavya has been granted rare permission to use workbooks of its own devising in government schools to foster activity-based learning. The European Union is backing a Rs7bn programme to improve primary education in deprived districts there. First-year classes can have up to 80 students, and although facilities are poor, donors are reluctant to put much money into bricks and mortar. In Turki, some learn their lessons under a banyan tree. Apart from a lack of resources, two main problems hamper education in India as nowhere else: child labour (embracing perhaps 40m who should be in school) and the caste system. The two are related. When a lower-caste family withdraws a child from school in order to work alongside its parents in the fields, it may be for economic reasons. But the parents may also take the decision conscious that their offspring has been made to sit at the back, or outside, or given menial tasks like lavatory cleaning seen as befitting its status. The belief that such work should be done only by those castes, who are then reviled for doing it, goes to the root of India's health and literacy difficulties, as Gandhi recognised. 'Primary education of its children must be undoubtedly an important item in the work of a municipality. But I have not a shadow of doubt that sanitation occupies the foremost place in its programme ... I hold it to be impossible to give a healthy education to unhealthy children,' he wrote, arguing that 'Untouchability has a great deal to answer for the insanitation of our streets and our latrines.' In half a century, not much has changed.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence. The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000 (Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two year imprisonment, or both. In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between N45 and N50 earlier this year. The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to more than 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

0,FT943-6050 ,"FT943-6050 _AN-EIAD1AAVFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Birth-rate successes moderate Iran's stance: A look at attempts to rein in alarming fertility rates as population hits 60m      By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU   The Iranian government's opposition to next week's United Nations population conference is not so great that it will join Saudi Arabia and Sudan in boycotting it. Iran is sending a delegation which it hopes will 'adapt the final document to incorporate religious ethics'. Criticism of the Cairo conference centres on the pragmatic approach taken towards issues such as extramarital and adolescent sex. Mr Ali Reza Marandi, Iran's health minister, said earlier this week, that the draft document 'seemed to have disregarded the religious views of the Islamic world and formulated the text with a sense of sexual liberty'. Iran's own religious ethics underwent revision toward population control in 1988, when the government recognised the severity of the country's high population growth rate. The average population growth rate of 3.9 per cent a year in the early 1980s was among the highest in the world. The Islamic government, which took over after the 1979 revolution, laid greater emphasis than before on early marriage and the woman's role as wife and mother and saw no reason to encourage birth control. It welcomed the growth in population, seeing it in terms of increased resources to build the country into an Islamic model. By the mid-80s, however, concerns about the economy led to fears that the high population growth was a threat rather than an aid to economic development. Iran's population grew from just over 37m at the beginning of the revolution in 1979 to 57m by 1986, an increase attributed to the lack of a family planning programme combined with improved health care since the 1960s. Today, Iran's population is believed to stand at more than 60m. Implementation of a family planning programme in 1988 has witnessed a drop in the annual average growth rate from the 3.9 per cent peak to 2.3 per cent last year and down further to 1.8 per cent in July, according to government figures. Demographic experts, while acknowledging that Iran has been successful in controlling its population growth, are sceptical of these figures. They argue that such a rapid population decrease is impossible in such a short period of time and cite the need for strengthened data collection and statistical analysis. The most reliable figures are those of the country's census, taken every five years. This showed an annual average growth rate of 2.9 per cent in 1991, well above the current 2 per cent growth rate for developing countries. Subsequent figures have been based on less reliable samples. Mr Shu Yun Xu, Iran country director at the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), says that despite the controversial figures, Iran's family planning programme has been 'a great achievement', partly because of the strength of the government's commitment. 'It has been supportive of all contraceptive methods, including male sterilisation. Only abortion is not allowed.' In June, the UNFPA approved a Dollars 10m five-year country programme for Iran and part of the funds are allocated to improving Iran's demographic data collection. The main thrust of the government's population control programme has been based on an increased supply of contraceptives, the training of rural midwives and counselling in family planning techniques. The Ministry of Health, which established a Fertility Regulation Council in 1988 to implement the programme, reports a decline in total fertility from 6.4 children per woman in 1988 to 4.25 in 1993. Increase use of contraceptives has been partly fuelled by the lack of family planning services for almost a decade. An active family planning programme was launched under the Shah's regime, so the implementation of the current programme has been relatively easy given the public's existing awareness. Another reason for the success of the family planning programme has been a relatively good health infrastructure which, according to UNFPA reaches 60 per cent of those living in the countryside and 90 per cent of the majority urban population. Mr Xu said: 'The primary healthcare network is very good especially in rural areas and the infrastructure is much better than for many Asian countries.' A women's health volunteer programme in the poor suburbs of southern Tehran has so far produced good results and is to be extended. Under the programme, women volunteers act as family planning counsellors in areas which are not served by the primary healthcare network. Iran has a relatively high literacy rate of 74 per cent and girls' enrolment in primary school is nearly as high as that of boys. The spread of education and literacy has increased a widespread desire for smaller families. Despite the success of the programme to date, the UNFPA says the tasks ahead are still 'formidable'. A relatively large number of Iranians, born in the baby-boom of 1976-1986 will be of child-bearing age from 1996 onwards, so fertility rates will increase. Since 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25, there is a need for even more emphasis to be placed on education.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- POPULATION IN IRAN  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Population:                           1994                     63.2m                                       2025                    144.6m Average growth 1990-95                                          2.7% Urban population 1992                                            58% Fertility rate/woman   1990-95                                   6.0 Adult literacy 1990:                  male                       65%                                       female                     43% Family planning users   1975-93                                  65% GNP per capita 1991                                    Dollars 2,170 Share of central govt spending 1991 on:          education                                             20.9%             health                                              7.9%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNFPA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.

0,FT922-770 ,"FT922-770 _AN-CFZBBAAQFT 920626   FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (18): Neglect of schools could hold back growth - Half the population cannot read, but the government is resisting pressure to introduce compulsory primary education      By DAVID HOUSEGO   AS INDIA pursues east and south-east Asia down the trail of higher economic growth, it could run into a major road block - it has one of the highest rates of illiteracy of any country in the world and one of the worst records for neglecting primary education. While east and south-east Asia made universal schooling the focus of their drive for higher economic growth, India has lagged badly behind in developing primary schools. Almost half the population aged seven and over cannot read or write. Less than 50 per cent of children between the ages of 6-14 are in school - leaving a staggering 82m who are put out to work by their parents in so-called cottage industries, in the fields, or as bonded labour. Two-thirds of those who attend primary school drop out before the final year. The World Bank and donor nations are now putting pressure on India to face up to the seriousness of the situation and to make universal primary education a priority. Mr Oktay Yenel, head of the World Bank office in Delhi, says: 'There is no country (other than the oil-rich countries of the Gulf) which has achieved high levels of per capita incomes and reduced poverty with a predominantly illiterate population.' The Bank sees low levels of literacy - worst among the poor and among women  -as putting a brake on other programmes to alleviate poverty, including health education and family planning. Both aid agencies and diplomats in Delhi were dismayed that the February budget seemed to have dropped the emphasis on basic education that had formed a key element of the budget presented by Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, last July. The multilateral institutions are convinced that raising funds both domestically and abroad for a mass primary education programme would be no problem. 'If India had a major primary education expansion programme, I know that the World Bank would come in in a big way and I guess that many other countries would find it worthwhile,' says Mr Yenel. The aid agencies believe that there are now well- established and polit- ically neutral technologies for accelerating primary school expansion. They do not believe the arguments of senior officials in Delhi who oppose compulsory education on the grounds that the rural poor prefer to send their children to work rather than to school. 'If there is good quality primary education, I am convinced that the great majority of parents would want to send their children to school,' says Ms E. Watanabe, head of the United Nations Children Fund (Unicef) in Delhi. But in North India in particular, primary schools are bad. On average there is one teacher for every 58 pupils. Appointed from outside through influence of friends or family, he often has no contact with the village and turns up irregularly at the school. 'I asked parents whether they knew the teacher,' Ms Watanabe says of villages she visited in Bihar where Unicef has a project. 'None of them knew him,' she says. Books, blackboards, and mats for pupils to sit on are all in short supply. India wrote the goal of achieving universal primary education into its constitution after independence. But it has remained a dream as the number of illiterates grew each year by 5m to 437m. One of the paradoxes of the country is why its educated elite, committed to the goals of development, socialism and democracy, should have allowed primary education so low a priority. India spends less than 1 per cent of GDP on primary education - or well below that of most countries in Asia and in sharp contrast to the large resources it devotes to secondary and higher education. The blunt response of Professor Myron Weiner, an American academic who has recently published a book on child labour in India, is that the fault lies with the caste system. Prof Weinder sees the neglect of primary education as based on the fear by the higher castes that 'excessive' and 'inappropriate' education for the poor 'would disrupt existing social arrangements'. He explains: 'Rhetoric notwithstanding, India's policy makers have not regarded mass education as essential to India's modernisation. They have instead put resources into elite government schools, state-aided private schools and higher education.' Though universal primary education and the abolition of child labour have been official policy since independence, the government under Rajiv Gandhi shifted the focus about seven years ago. The emphasis was put instead on improving the conditions of child labour while providing non-formal education for those who had dropped out of the school system and crash literacy courses for adults. This shift in policy was justified as reflecting the 'socio-economic realities' of the country. Mr Anil Bordia, the education secretary, who has presided over the change in policies, says that the best results have been achieved in the south where 25-30 districts (including the state of Kerala) have been declared literate. Two-thirds of the country will be literate by 1997-98, he claims. He rejects Prof Weiner's analysis of India's educational problems. 'He does not understand India. I think he does not know what he is talking about,' says Mr Bordia. The education secretary himself does not believe compulsory primary education is the right approach to universal schooling in India. He recalls how 'painful' it was for him as a young judge in Rajasthan - where education in one district was compulsory - to fine parents who begged not to send their children to school. Mr Bordia is also suspicious of foreign interference in primary education and is opposed to the World Bank sending specialist personnel to support a large proposed primary education project in Uttar Pradesh, the northern state with one of the highest rates of illiteracy. He says that he has seen in Pakistan and Bangladesh 'the harm which big investments in primary education can do to a country whose culture and milieu are not particularly different from our own. Neither in planning (primary education and literacy) nor implementation, do we need help from abroad,' he adds. The multilateral institutions believe that literacy campaigns and non-formal education (where children attend classes after a day's work) are no substitute for mass primary education. They fear as well that the these programmes will divert resources from the more urgent task of primary education. 'My concern', says Ms Watanabe, 'is that the focus on literacy is diverting attention from primary education.' The multilateral agencies need to maintain their campaign since primary education lacks a lobby within India. 'Primary education is one of the subjects that does not have a strong national lobby,' says Ms Watanabe. Mr A. B. Vajpayee, the BJP leader and a veteran parliamentarian, says he has never had a question from a constituent over primary schooling.  The Financial Times   London Page X  "
0," FR940110-0-00051   FR940110-0-00014            Comments:     Several commenters opposed the criterion that encouraged applicants to state how partners plan to establish a program of workplace literacy services that can continue after Federal funding ends. Many of these commenters believed this criterion would adversely affect small businesses since they might not have the resources needed to continue a workplace literacy project. Other commenters pointed out that some businesses, especially small businesses, have short-term training needs that can be met during the course of the project and, therefore, would not need to continue the project. Still other commenters thought that because small businesses would not be able to continue a project, this criterion would nullify the five-point preference given for partnerships that include a small business.   Some commenters supported the inclusion of the criterion on commitment and indicated past success with this concept, but suggested that small businesses be exempted. Other commenters believed that expecting business partners to make a commitment to continue a project that is unproven is unreasonable and could scare away potential business partners. These commenters thought that commitment is best sought and obtained during a successful project.   Some commenters suggested such alternative methods of demonstrating commitment as release time for assessment and training, strategic planning for capacity-building, training business partners to provide workplace literacy, active participation of all partners, or gradual assumption of costs.       Discussion:     The Secretary acknowledges the many helpful comments on this topic. Although proposed 472.22(h)(2) did not involve a commitment to any unforeseeable or unnecessary post-project activities, the Secretary wishes to avoid any implication that this is the case. The Secretary also desires to preserve the competitive preference for partnerships involving small businesses. Accordingly, the selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed 472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in 472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in 472.22(i). Moreover, 472.22(i) makes it clear that plans for continuing workplace literacy after Federal funding ends should be based on realistic forecasts of the literacy needs of partners and should take into consideration a partner's capacity to continue services. To emphasize this point, the criterion now provides a range of examples of practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy, many of which can be carried out by small businesses. The criterion also recognizes the importance of an applicant's commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace specifically during the project itself. These changes are intended to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the commenters while preserving the overall purpose of a selection criterion on commitment. The recently published study Adult Literacy in America points out that some 90 million adults demonstrate low levels of literacy and depicts a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not have the skills needed to earn a living in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace. The Secretary believes that a commitment to institutionalize learning will naturally lead to continuing efforts to promote workplace literacy after Federal funding ends and will assist in transforming American workplaces to meet the challenges of a world market.       Changes:     The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed 472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in 472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in 472.22(i). The criterion on ``Commitment'' clarifies that applicants are to develop practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy that are based on realistic forecasts of literacy needs and the capacity of partners. The criterion also encourages applicants to demonstrate a commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace during the project.       Reporting (472.30(b))           Comments:     Numerous commenters expressed the view that a two-page semi-annual performance and financial report would not be overly burdensome. These commenters felt that the data would be a good planning tool, would help projects monitor their progress, and would contribute to the standardization of the workplace literacy program nationwide. Other commenters suggested that the reports be made available at the time of award so that data bases could be designed to facilitate collection. Some commenters strongly advocated quarterly reports that include, in addition to the information the Secretary proposed collecting, a brief update on the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Two commenters recommended annual reporting, one because of the project's cycle for collecting evaluative data and the other because of the possibility that the Department might not have adequate staff resources to use the performance and financial data as intended.       Discussion:     The Secretary considered requiring quarterly reports for the National Workplace Literacy Program, but determined that they would be burdensome for grantees. However, the Secretary believes that annual reports would not provide sufficient information to ensure program accountability and ready access to information that is comparable across projects. Grantees will be required to submit brief continuation applications annually in order to receive funding for the second and third year of their projects.   The Secretary believes that the continuation application and a two-page semi-annual report on progress and total spending for the reporting period will be adequate. The reports will be made available to grantees at the start of their projects to enable them to set up appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and the Department will work with grantees to ensure that reports are used appropriately both to monitor and to improve projects.       Changes:     None.       Evaluation (472.31)           Comments:     Several commenters thought that the requirement for projects to have a third-party evaluator would be expensive, burdensome, or too costly. Several other commenters supported the evaluation requirement because a rigorous evaluation design is essential to demonstrating impact and replicable results and would strengthen projects. One commenter was concerned that tying student learning gains to higher job productivity and performance would not result in reliable or valid measures of the effectiveness of projects because learning gains are not the only conditions affecting these factors.       Discussion:     Program experience over the life of the National Workplace Literacy Program indicates that a third-party evaluation enhances the quality of a project without being expensive, burdensome, or too costly. The Secretary agrees with the comment that multiple conditions, including learning gains, may contribute to measured improvements in job productivity and performance. This comment supports the need for a rigorous evaluation design that includes, insofar as possible, controls for other variables that may also contribute to the improvements measured. Evaluations of this rigor require highly trained research and evaluation personnel who cannot always be found among staff persons employed within funded projects.       Changes:     None.       Start-up Period (472.32(b))           Comments:     Numerous commenters supported lengthening the grant period to three years and extending the start-up period. However, one commenter questioned the necessity of a six-month start-up period.       Discussion:     The heightened emphasis on demonstration and dissemination activities requires lengthening the grant period to three years, and, as necessary, lengthening the time needed to establish a project before services are provided to adult workers. Although 472.32(b)(1) permits applicants to take up to a six-month start-up period, 472.32(b)(2) requires applicants to ``minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for their projects.''       Changes:     None.       Continuation of a Project After a Partner Withdraws (472.34)           Comments:     One commenter suggested that the regulations specifically apply to business partners. Another commenter thought the regulations favored projects with more than two partners, and requested greater flexibility in the renegotiation of the scope of work of a grant. A commenter suggested that a project be allowed to continue despite the withdrawal of a partner, even if the conditions of 472.34 are not satisfied. One commenter inquired whether all, or only one, of the conditions outlined in 472.34 must be met by withdrawing partners.       Discussion:     Although each partnership is required to designate one partner as its applicant and grantee, an award is made on the basis of the partnership agreement that is signed by all members of the partnership and that binds the partners to every statement and assurance made in the application, in addition to carrying out their respective roles. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the approved scope of work will continue to be carried out if a partner withdraws, regardless of the type of partner withdrawing or the number of partners in the original partnership. The regulations do not favor projects with more than two partners. Section 472.34(b)(1) allows for the full substitution of a partner even in the case of a two-party partnership so long as the partnership continues to meet the requirement in 472.2(b) that there be at least one education partner and one business or labor partner. The Secretary wishes to point out that the conditions in 472.34 are to be met by the remaining partners. They are not conditions to be met by the withdrawing partners as suggested by the commenter. Moreover, all of the conditions described in 472.34 must be met before the Secretary will allow a project to continue.          "," FR940110-0-00051   FR940110-0-00014            Comments:     Several commenters opposed the criterion that encouraged applicants to state how partners plan to establish a program of workplace literacy services that can continue after Federal funding ends. Many of these commenters believed this criterion would adversely affect small businesses since they might not have the resources needed to continue a workplace literacy project. Other commenters pointed out that some businesses, especially small businesses, have short-term training needs that can be met during the course of the project and, therefore, would not need to continue the project. Still other commenters thought that because small businesses would not be able to continue a project, this criterion would nullify the five-point preference given for partnerships that include a small business.   Some commenters supported the inclusion of the criterion on commitment and indicated past success with this concept, but suggested that small businesses be exempted. Other commenters believed that expecting business partners to make a commitment to continue a project that is unproven is unreasonable and could scare away potential business partners. These commenters thought that commitment is best sought and obtained during a successful project.   Some commenters suggested such alternative methods of demonstrating commitment as release time for assessment and training, strategic planning for capacity-building, training business partners to provide workplace literacy, active participation of all partners, or gradual assumption of costs.       Discussion:     The Secretary acknowledges the many helpful comments on this topic. Although proposed 472.22(h)(2) did not involve a commitment to any unforeseeable or unnecessary post-project activities, the Secretary wishes to avoid any implication that this is the case. The Secretary also desires to preserve the competitive preference for partnerships involving small businesses. Accordingly, the selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed 472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in 472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in 472.22(i). Moreover, 472.22(i) makes it clear that plans for continuing workplace literacy after Federal funding ends should be based on realistic forecasts of the literacy needs of partners and should take into consideration a partner's capacity to continue services. To emphasize this point, the criterion now provides a range of examples of practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy, many of which can be carried out by small businesses. The criterion also recognizes the importance of an applicant's commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace specifically during the project itself. These changes are intended to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the commenters while preserving the overall purpose of a selection criterion on commitment. The recently published study Adult Literacy in America points out that some 90 million adults demonstrate low levels of literacy and depicts a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not have the skills needed to earn a living in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace. The Secretary believes that a commitment to institutionalize learning will naturally lead to continuing efforts to promote workplace literacy after Federal funding ends and will assist in transforming American workplaces to meet the challenges of a world market.       Changes:     The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed 472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in 472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in 472.22(i). The criterion on ``Commitment'' clarifies that applicants are to develop practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy that are based on realistic forecasts of literacy needs and the capacity of partners. The criterion also encourages applicants to demonstrate a commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace during the project.       Reporting (472.30(b))           Comments:     Numerous commenters expressed the view that a two-page semi-annual performance and financial report would not be overly burdensome. These commenters felt that the data would be a good planning tool, would help projects monitor their progress, and would contribute to the standardization of the workplace literacy program nationwide. Other commenters suggested that the reports be made available at the time of award so that data bases could be designed to facilitate collection. Some commenters strongly advocated quarterly reports that include, in addition to the information the Secretary proposed collecting, a brief update on the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Two commenters recommended annual reporting, one because of the project's cycle for collecting evaluative data and the other because of the possibility that the Department might not have adequate staff resources to use the performance and financial data as intended.       Discussion:     The Secretary considered requiring quarterly reports for the National Workplace Literacy Program, but determined that they would be burdensome for grantees. However, the Secretary believes that annual reports would not provide sufficient information to ensure program accountability and ready access to information that is comparable across projects. Grantees will be required to submit brief continuation applications annually in order to receive funding for the second and third year of their projects.   The Secretary believes that the continuation application and a two-page semi-annual report on progress and total spending for the reporting period will be adequate. The reports will be made available to grantees at the start of their projects to enable them to set up appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and the Department will work with grantees to ensure that reports are used appropriately both to monitor and to improve projects.

HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer      BLANTYRE, Malawi      Arriving in Malawi, whose economic self-sufficiency has been all but destroyed  by a heavy influx of refugees from Mozambique, Pope John Paul II paid tribute  Thursday to the remarkable selflessness of the people of this African country.    ""The international community applauds your generosity,"" the Pope said on the  final stop of a nine-day visit to southern Africa. He will leave Saturday for  Rome, having visited -- in addition to Malawi -- Madagascar, the French island  of Reunion and Zambia since beginning the tour April 28.    The pontiff was greeted at Blantyre airport by perhaps the most distinctive  head of state he has encountered on this trip, H. Kamuzu Banda, the  nonagenarian ""president for life"" of Malawi.    Banda wasted no time in lecturing the Pope about his own accomplishments in  leading this landlocked, resource-poor nation of 7.6 million.    ""I know you've heard and read in the newspapers that Malawi has a very good  name, especially in Europe, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, the United  States. . . ."" He reeled off the name of virtually every major nation in his  surprisingly firm baritone.    ""You've heard and read that Malawi is one of the best-governed countries in  Africa,"" he added, in what might apply more to the impeccable tidiness of  Malawi's streets, the orderliness of its crowds and the precise orchestration  of its presidential rallies than to its rock-bottom per capita spending on  education and health, its declining literacy rate and its level of political  repression.    Banda has also lent his people something of his own religious background -- a  Calvinist Presbyterianism that places them among Africa's most abstemious  people. Although the country is a major exporter of tobacco, cigarette smokers  are rare here. ""Why consume what we can export for money?"" a businessman  remarked.      Catholics and Protestants    About 25% of the population is Catholic and a third is Protestant, including  members of some Presbyterian splinter sects found nowhere but in Scotland and  Malawi.    The welcoming ceremony was more notable for what went unsaid than for what was  said. Absent from the pontiff's and president's remarks was any reference to  apartheid, the racist policy of South Africa that was the subtext at almost  every gathering on the Pope's previous stop, in Zambia.    This was not surprising, for two African leaders could scarcely differ more in  their approach to South Africa than do Banda and Zambia's President Kenneth D.  Kaunda.    Kaunda, perhaps Africa's most obdurate foe of South Africa, maintains full  diplomatic relations with the anti-apartheid African National Congress, and  Banda's Malawi is the only sub-Saharan country that maintains full diplomatic  relations with Pretoria.    Banda has long held that normal relations are necessary because of the economic  dependence of most southern African countries on South Africa.    For all that, the Pope's focus on Malawi's service to the Mozambicans was  entirely appropriate. Malawi had been producing enough corn and other staples  to feed itself before the vicious Mozambican guerrilla war began forcing  refugees across the border three years ago. Today there are more than 600,000  Mozambicans in Malawi, many of them occupying otherwise cultivable land.    Now Malawi is an importer of food. The huge refugee population has denuded its  forests in quest of firewood, leading to severe flooding in districts that had  not been so inundated in more than 30 years. In the south, where the greatest  concentrations of Mozambicans are found, roads crucial to the transport of farm  goods have been shattered by the passage of heavy trucks carrying relief  supplies.

0,FT944-2598 ,"FT944-2598 _AN-ELPB8AA3FT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria's government attempt to thwart illegal currency dealings      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy, Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street value of the naira, Michael Holman, Africa Editor, writes. In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence. The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000 (Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two year imprisonment, or both. In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between N45 and N50 earlier this year. The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to more than 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

0,FT933-1184 ,"FT933-1184 _AN-DIXCIAHZFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (38): Enfeebled giant burdened by debt - Africa / Only the return of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give the economy the boost it needs      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   AFRICA AND its allies are in danger of losing the battle for the recovery of a continent, now so weakened by years of adversity and mismanagement that it cannot take full advantage of a stronger world economy. More than a decade after the World Bank first sounded the alarm about Sub-Saharan Africa's crisis, and despite some Dollars 170bn in net development assistance that has followed, the region's problems remain acute. Economic reforms that got under way in the 1980s are not measuring up to expectations, whether due to weak implementation by African governments, inadequate incentives from western governments and agencies, or flaws in the structural adjustment policy itself. And on the political front, the democratisation process that raised hopes in the 1990s is proving divisive rather than constructive, as ethnicity, rather than policies, determine voters' allegiances. Today, Africa is an enfeebled giant, poorer in per capita terms than it was in 1960, and burdened by an external debt that has soared from Dollars 3bn to more than Dollars 145bn, and which costs a quarter of export earnings to service. Wars in Angola, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere continue to scar the continent, foreign investment (outside the oil sector) is negligible, management is weak, corruption widespread, and Aids is on the increase. 'It is the only region in the world likely to experience an increase in absolute poverty over the next decade,' Kim Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, told his executive board last February. Admittedly, Africa will do better in the 1990s than in the 1980s, if the forecasters are correct. In its World Economic Outlook, published last May, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted real GDP growth at 3.3 per cent in 1993-94, rising to 4.4 per cent a year between 1995 and 1998. But the Fund was quick to hedge its bets: 'These projections are subject to a wider margin of uncertainty than for other regions,' it warned, noting that 'despite considerable progress in some countries, many obstacles to stronger growth remain to be tackled, including inadequate infrastructure, weak administrative capacity . . . and social and political instability.' Given that Sub-Saharan Africa's four leading economies are all in difficulties, the caveat is understandable. Nigeria is in the grips of a political crisis, and its economic reform programme has effectively lapsed; Kenya is faltering in its promise to root out corruption; the Ivory Coast cannot implement an effective reform programme as long as the CFA franc remains overvalued by as much as 30 per cent; and South Africa remains plagued by political violence, likely to get worse not better as party rivalries intensify in the run up to next April's general election. Nevertheless, the IMF forecast may seem encouraging, compared with the 1980s, when growth over the decade averaged less than 2 per cent and per capita income fell by more than 1 per cent. The reality, however, is that this rate of growth will only stem, possibly halt, the rate of Africa's overall decline, for it must be set against a current population increase of 3.1 per cent annually - which, if sustained, will double the region's population every 22 years. Even the most successful example of reform provides a salutary warning of the long battle ahead if Africa is to make up ground lost during the disastrous post-independence era. Structural adjustment in Ghana has worked  -but only up to a modest point. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. But at current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population), it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. One important lesson from Ghana is that aid is not enough. Only the return - on a substantial scale - of foreign investment, in partnership with a thriving private sector, will give Africa's economy the boost it needs. As Kim Jaycox points out: 'Even if aid succeeded in generating annual growth rates of 6 per cent on average, most African countries would still require 25 years to reach acceptable unemployment levels and Dollars 1,000 GDP per capita. Only the private sector has any chance of achieving higher rates of growth with greater speed.' There is little evidence that foreign investors, who saw their rate of return drop from some 30 per cent in the 1960s to just 2.5 per cent in the 1980s, are about to come back. Net foreign direct investment in Africa has averaged around Dollars 500m a year over the past few years (mostly into the oil and mining sectors), less than 1 per cent of the global total according to the UN's World Investment Report. Obstacles range from the poor state of the infrastructure in most countries to the tough competition from other countries in the developing world, such as Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. Above all, Africa has yet to convince the outside world that it means business. 'Too many African countries have embraced economic reform too hesitantly,' Sir William Ryrie, outgoing head of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector arm of the World Bank, told a conference in Nairobi in March this year. Whether Africa and its allies are prepared to admit that defeat looms in the battle for recovery remains to be seen. Since the Bank first sounded the alarm, in its 1981 report, further warnings have come at regular intervals. Africa 'faces acute economic difficulties', said the Bank's next appraisal, published in 1984. Five years later the picture remained bleak. The Bank looked back on 'a decade of falling per capita income' and concluded: 'Overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago.' The Bank has been taking stock once again and, in a report due to be published shortly, is expected to conclude that economic reforms have stemmed the pace of decline. But at current rates of per capita GDP growth it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 1970s. Given better implementation of reforms and an improved international economic environment, and a renewed effort by the international community to tackle Africa's crisis, prospects could change. But the critical question remains whether African governments have the political will to adopt painful economic reforms, or the managerial capacity with which to implement them. But Africa's allies will also have to take fresh stock of their performance. No development agency likes to admit failure, for it fears losing its raison d'etre. No non-government organisation likes to acknowledge defeat, for fear of funds drying up. No western government wants to add to its problems by acknowledging that its aid policy is ineffectual. But only a frank appraisal of the crisis can provide the basis of the fresh initiative the continent desperately needs.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: EXTERNAL DEBT (DOLLARS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              1985  1986  1987  1988  1989  1990  1991  1992  1993  1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total debt   63.5  75.1  89.8  95.6  99.1 112.3 120.6 124.8 132.4 140.5 By maturity Short-term    6.5   7.5  10.0  10.8  11.7  13.7  14.7  16.7  15.8  17.3 Long-term    57.0  67.6  79.7  84.8  87.4  98.6 105.8 108.0 116.6 123.3 By type of creditor Official     44.4  56.1  68.6  73.9  74.7  86.6  94.1  96.8 104.0 110.4 Commercial  banks       13.2  13.0  14.7  14.1  14.4  16.0  16.5  16.3  16.7  17.5 Other  private      5.9   6.0   6.5   7.6  10.0   9.6   9.9  11.6  11.7  12.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Debt-service payments (% of exports of goods and services)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*      27.5  28.0  23.7  24.7  24.1  23.3  25.2  26.6  33.4  25.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sub-Saharan  Africa       3.4   2.9   2.2   3.0   2.9   1.3   1.1   0.4   4.5   4.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Real per capita GDP (annual percentage change)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa*       0.3  -0.9  -1.6   1.1   0.8  -1.0  -1.1  -1.7   0.0   1.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Figures are for all of Africa  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Economic Outlook (May 1993), IMF  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

If you are not sure whether or not you meet the definition of a small business, you may want to contact your local district office or regional office of the Small Business Administration (SBA) for advice. If you are unable to locate those offices you may call the SBA's Office of Size Standards at (202) 2056618.         Q. May an application including a business partner that is a small local affiliate of a larger corporation receive the small business priority points?         A. The overall size of the business partner and its affiliates will determine the answer. Size determinations must include the business partner and all its domestic and foreign affiliates regardless of whether the affiliates are organized for profit. 13 CFR 121.401 describes affiliating circumstances for size determination purposes and establishes exceptions thereto.         Q. May an application including a business partner that operates as the small local franchisee or licensee of a larger corporation receive the small business priority points?         A. Small business priority points may be awarded when a business partner meets the following three conditions: It (1) is a local franchisee or licensee within the size determination standards, (2) has the right to profit from its efforts and (3) bears the risk of loss commensurate with ownership. Exceptions to this general interpretation may arise where affiliation results from other means than the franchise or license agreement such as common ownership, common management or excessive restrictions on the sale of the franchise interest. See 121.401(m) of 13 CFR.         Q. Must a small business participant be a partner for   the application to qualify for the small business priority points?         A. Yes. The small business participant must be a partner who has signed the Partnership Agreement for the application to qualify for the extra points.         Q. Must an applicant provide the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code for the small business partner in order to receive the small business priority points?         A. Yes. The SIC code must be entered on the line provided on the Partnership Agreement form.         Q. What is meant by a required percent of non-Federal cost-sharing or matching funds?         A. In this program, the recipient of Federal funds is required to ``match'' the Federal grant by paying at least a minimum percentage of total program costs. Total program costs include both the Federal funds received and the non-Federal contribution. For example, a partnership that is required to pay 30 percent of total program costs of $100,000 would have to contribute $30,000 to match a Federal award of $70,000 ($30,000 = 30 percent of $100,000 ($30,000 plus $70,000)). All partnerships must contribute at least 30 percent of total program costs, except that partnerships may receive full reimbursement for their necessary and reasonable administrative costs incurred in establishing a project during the project start-up period. That period should be minimized and may not exceed six months, at which time the project is expected to provide services to adult workers.         Q. What costs may be included in the 30 percent match (cash or in-kind)?     A. Any cost that can be paid with Federal funds from this program is allowable as match (see Education Department General Administrative Regulations, 34 CFR 74.5074.57 and 34 CFR 80.24).         Q. What costs are not allowed using project funds (Federal or non-Federal match)?         A. The following items are not allowable costs in the National Workplace Literacy Program:         Life skills such as balancing a checkbook, learning to read to children, writing personal correspondence, etc.         Personal counseling such as counseling for alcoholism, mental health, health, domestic problems, or housing issues.          Job skills or vocational training such as direct training in statistical process control (SPC) rather than literacy skills needed for SPC.         Computer literacy, defined as any training above the level of computer competence needed to operate a computer-assisted program of instruction used in a workplace literacy project. Non-allowable costs include teaching of word processing, WordPerfect, Lotus, dBase, etc.         Stipends or tuition payments.         Training of supervisors, other than those one step up from targeted workers such as maintenance crew supervisors.         Construction costs.         Institutional allowance.         Any unreasonable or unnecessary cost.         Q. May a project provide vocational or job training activities?         A. No. Projects must provide adult education programs that teach literacy skills needed in the workplace. Workplace literacy activities include only the adult education activities listed in the Description of Program section of the Notice Inviting Applications. This list does not include vocational or job training activities such as auto mechanics, dye casting, tailoring, and statistical process control. Workplace literacy instruction, however, may enable individuals to benefit subsequently or simultaneously from advanced vocational skills training provided from other funds. If you are not sure whether a particular activity is eligible under this program, please call one of the program officers listed as information contacts in the application notice.         Q. May a project provide training in operating a computer?         A. Training to operate a computer that is part of the performance of a job is a form of vocational or job training and is not an eligible activity under this program. However, computers could be used as a means of instruction if this were necessary and reasonable under the circumstances of a particular project. In such a context, it would be permissible to ensure that students possessed those rudimentary skills that are necessary to interact with computer-assisted literacy instruction.

0,FT933-16707 ,"FT933-16707 _AN-DGBCVACPFT 930702   FT  02 JUL 93 / Project to tackle poor literacy      By JOHN AUTHERS and NEIL BUCKLEY   A CAMPAIGN against poor literacy among school-leavers was launched yesterday. It came after complaints about school-leavers from the Dixons and John Lewis Partnership retail chains. John Lewis complained in a letter to the Industry in Education group which was copied to Mr John Patten, the education secretary, that some school-leavers were 'poorly prepared and not creating a good impression'. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, endorsed the contents of the letter, but said his store did not discriminate against 16-year-olds in recruitment. 'But a lot of them do not have the skills for applying for a job, and have not been shown by their careers officers how to fill out a CV,' he added. He said an analysis of staff productivity had encouraged the company to concentrate more on recruiting older people with more of the skills and experience needed in dealing with the public. The aim of the National Literacy Association campaign, which has cross-party and union support, is to adopt the target that by 1999 99 per cent of children should leave school with adequate literacy for living and working. The campaign will concentrate on six points: Adopting the 99 per cent figure as a fixed national target. Providing volunteers in playgroups, libraries and nurseries to help parents who cannot read to their children. Increasing promotion of the use of children's libraries and wider distribution of books to homes and schools. Aiding parents who are illiterate with a national programme of meeting parents outside schools. Introducing a national programme for teachers of initial and in-service training in reading, writing and literacy. Expanding reading recovery programmes, in which young children with difficulties are identified in the classroom and given intensive tutoring.   Countries:-  GBZ   United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT923-2141 ,"FT923-2141 _AN-CIRBKAHCFT 920918   FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (6): Ever more mouths to feed - Pakistan has chronically failed to grow enough wheat for all its people      By FARHAN BOKHARI   AGRICULTURE remains the backbone of Pakistan's economy. But attempts to make the country self-sufficient in food grains continue to fall behind national needs, creating new requirements for wheat imports. This year alone Pakistan will import 2m tonnes of wheat, adding to the burden on budgetary resources. Agriculture employs 51 per cent of the workforce, only 9 per cent down from 60 per cent in 1964. Agriculture-related products earn up to 70 per cent of export revenues. In spite of difficulties in raising food grain production, agricultural output last year grew by 6.4 per cent and made a 26 per cent contribution to GDP. Growth was up from 3 per cent during the 1989-90 fiscal year and 5.1 per cent in 1990-91. Cotton, wheat and rice account for almost 70 per cent of overall crop output value. The remainder is sugar-cane, fruits, vegetables and other products. Cotton output grew by 35 per cent last year largely due to incentives for farmers, while wheat and rice production were virtually unchanged. Last month, the government announced new incentives for cotton growers by removing export duty. The government also plans to increase productivity in crops such as rice and wheat, by raising government-controlled grain prices for farmers as well as making arrangements to provide better quality seeds and efficient technology. Mr Majeed Malik, agriculture minister, says: 'The price of wheat as compared to the inputs is such that it is becoming less and less a profitable crop and therefore people are shifting to other areas.' Mr Malik says the government plans to set up a new framework which would allow technology to be taken to the doorsteps of the farmer, as one way to encourage the use of better techniques for improving output. Agricultural experts have argued that an important obstacle to making farmers use better techniques is that many of them are located in inaccessible areas. Mr Malik disagrees with critics who argue that low literacy rates would make it impossible to introduce high-tech methods. 'Although the rate of literacy is low, even the most uneducated farmer is very keen to absorb technology. He doesn't have to read a book, he has to be told on radio by experts,' he says. The government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif claims to have broken fresh ground in resolving important long term problems. Last year, the country's four provinces and the federal government resolved a 70 year long dispute over the distribution of water from the Indus river, one of Pakistan's main sources of water supply for agriculture. Eventually, the provinces expect to save between 10 to 13 MAF (million acre feet) of water, which was earlier flowing out to the sea in the absence of a sharing formula. In December last year, the government also announced a new package of incentives to improve crop yields. However, improving the performance of agriculture remains difficult. A continuing problem is a high population growth rate of almost 3.1 per cent. In addition, the country is still faced with the difficult issue of taxation for farm-lands. Agricultural incomes are exempt from direct taxation, partly due to resistance from a strong lobby of politically influential landlords. The resistance has received additional momentum from the argument that taxation would be unfair unless the prices for crops are set according to international market rates rather than remaining under government control. Mr Malik says the farmers have a point because of low profitability in the sector. But he also leaves the door open for generating more resources, and says that by the end of this decade new revenues may have to be generated from agriculture which may 'not necessarily be income tax in the same sense'. Privately, some senior officials concede that this is among the most difficult issues for agricultural policy makers. While the land-owners' lobby is influential, the government is also under increased pressure from local industrialists and businessmen who have demanded taxation for agriculture to give the same treatment to this sector as other areas of the economy. Eventually, a decision on this may determine the profitability in the agricultural sector. Finally, problems related to the pattern of agriculture have also constrained growth potential. According to estimates by Western development experts, Pakistan's agriculture sector has been operating close to its limits as far as quality of land and water resources are concerned. But the alternative of intensive farming to increase agricultural output requires resources which are not readily available.  The Financial Times   London Page IV  "

JONES , Clipboard researched by Kathie Bozanich and Janice L.  Jones / Los Angeles Times, Graphics by Doris Shields / Los Angeles Times      Shortly after he saw a television special on adult illiteracy, Hans Clements  happened to pick up a flyer that told about a volunteer tutor program at the  Newhope Library in Santa Ana. Tutors were needed to work on a one-to-one basis  with adults who wanted to improve their reading and writing skills.    ""I'd never tried to teach anything before,"" Clements said. ""But after seeing  the television program, I began to wonder what life would be like if I couldn't  read. So I decided tutoring would be a worthwhile thing to try.""    Clements completed a 15-hour training session and in February was assigned to  work with Jim, a warehouse supervisor who had never learned to read. ""He was    very eager to make progress,"" Clements said. ""So we decided to meet at the  library for two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night.""    At first, Jim could barely struggle through a book written at the third-grade  level. But after three months of steady improvement, he is taking on more  difficult tasks, like reading newspapers and instruction manuals.    ""It's fun to see how much difference it has made in his life,"" Clements said.  ""Tutoring takes a lot of time and patience, but I've gotten back 100% of    what I've put into it.""    The need for volunteer tutors increases every year, according to Marian Mosher  of the South Coast Literacy Council. ""Adult illiteracy has received a lot of  media attention recently, and people are less afraid to come forward for help,""  she said.    The literacy problem is compounded in Orange County by the increasing number of  immigrants arriving every year who need help learning English. According to the  Immigration and Naturalization Service, Orange County now ranks fourth    in the nation in the number of immigrants received every year. And the INS  estimate does not include those who live here illegally.    ""We have a mixture of ability levels among the recent immigrants. Many of them  have highly developed skills in their native language, and when they come here  it's frustrating not to be able to communicate. They are very motivated to  learn English and qualify for a better job,"" Mosher said. ""Others have weak  skills in their own language, and that's why individual tutoring works so well.  The instruction is centered around the student's rate of learning.""    Mosher has taught people from 17 different countries since becoming a tutor  five years ago. ""I've made some lifetime friends. It's very rewarding,"" she  said.    Tutor training sessions are sponsored by the Orange County Public Library and  Orange County's four volunteer literacy councils.

JONES , Clipboard researched by Kathie Bozanich and Janice L.  Jones / Los Angeles Times, Graphics by Doris Shields / Los Angeles Times      Shortly after he saw a television special on adult illiteracy, Hans Clements  happened to pick up a flyer that told about a volunteer tutor program at the  Newhope Library in Santa Ana. Tutors were needed to work on a one-to-one basis  with adults who wanted to improve their reading and writing skills.    ""I'd never tried to teach anything before,"" Clements said. ""But after seeing  the television program, I began to wonder what life would be like if I couldn't  read. So I decided tutoring would be a worthwhile thing to try.""    Clements completed a 15-hour training session and in February was assigned to  work with Jim, a warehouse supervisor who had never learned to read. ""He was    very eager to make progress,"" Clements said. ""So we decided to meet at the  library for two hours every Tuesday and Thursday night.""    At first, Jim could barely struggle through a book written at the third-grade  level. But after three months of steady improvement, he is taking on more  difficult tasks, like reading newspapers and instruction manuals.    ""It's fun to see how much difference it has made in his life,"" Clements said.  ""Tutoring takes a lot of time and patience, but I've gotten back 100% of    what I've put into it.""    The need for volunteer tutors increases every year, according to Marian Mosher  of the South Coast Literacy Council. ""Adult illiteracy has received a lot of  media attention recently, and people are less afraid to come forward for help,""  she said.    The literacy problem is compounded in Orange County by the increasing number of  immigrants arriving every year who need help learning English. According to the  Immigration and Naturalization Service, Orange County now ranks fourth    in the nation in the number of immigrants received every year. And the INS  estimate does not include those who live here illegally.    ""We have a mixture of ability levels among the recent immigrants. Many of them  have highly developed skills in their native language, and when they come here  it's frustrating not to be able to communicate. They are very motivated to  learn English and qualify for a better job,"" Mosher said. ""Others have weak  skills in their own language, and that's why individual tutoring works so well.  The instruction is centered around the student's rate of learning.""    Mosher has taught people from 17 different countries since becoming a tutor  five years ago. ""I've made some lifetime friends. It's very rewarding,"" she  said.    Tutor training sessions are sponsored by the Orange County Public Library and  Orange County's four volunteer literacy councils.

The decision has been criticised by several prominent businessmen who claim that the bank has acted prematurely and may damage the current economic upturn. The South African Chamber of Business has also warned that the move could damage the government's reconstruction and development programme. However Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank governor, who has been warning for several weeks that a rise in rates was imminent, said the move was necessary to stave off rising inflation.

They will be implemented once a non-racial transitional government is in place, Mr Edward Jaycox, the World Bank's vice-president for Africa, said yesterday. Mr Jaycox, who was on a brief stopover in London en route to the World Economic Forum in Cape Town, said the projects aimed to improve health, housing and education for South Africa's poor blacks. The World Bank stopped lending to South Africa when international sanctions were imposed against Pretoria's apartheid regime. But after two years of talks with both the government and the African National Congress, Mr Jaycox said prospects for renewing relations with South Africa were 'excellent'. Mr Jaycox stressed that World Bank loans to South Africa would not be on concessional terms, because of the country's relative wealth. The Bank's pledge follows similar promises of economic support for a democratic South Africa by Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state. The World Bank official was also keen to dispel the widespread image of the continent as a region of 'victims and losers'. For the first time in a generation, many countries were enjoying growth rates higher than the expansion of their populations. He was confident that tough structural adjustment programmes were beginning to bear fruit, despite an adverse international economic climate and the lukewarm commitment of many African governments to reform.

0,FT941-4190 ,"FT941-4190 _AN-ECMANAA4FT 940312   FT  12 MAR 94 / In 40 years' time, black Africa might reach the level of wealth it had 20 years ago: IMF reforms are paying off, but the continent is way behind the rest of the world, says the World Bank      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   Unless sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, warns a World Bank report on the region published tomorrow. Even Ghana, rated the best of Africa's reforming countries which has achieved real growth of about 5 per cent a year, is still among the world's poorest countries: 'At this growth rate, the average Ghanaian will not cross the poverty line for another 50 years,' says the report. The report is the most sombre in a series that go back to the early stages of Africa's economic crisis. Past studies have combined tough appraisals with upbeat expectations of reform. The latest study warns that success will not come easy, but cautions against 'undue pessimism', pointing to the fact that Asian countries which had almost no growth between 1930 and 1960 now enjoy 'stunning' growth. Structural adjustment is essential but not sufficient if sub-Saharan Africa is to achieve sustained growth, says the World Bank in a 280-page appraisal of economic reform. But while it stresses the need for 'good governance' in Africa, the report does not elaborate on either the measures required, or assess its impact on economic performance in the years under review. Of the 29 countries studied in the report, the six with the most improvement in macroeconomic policies between 1981-86 and 1987-91 enjoyed the strongest resurgence in economic performance, with an average annual growth of 2 per cent in GDP. By contrast, says the report, countries that did not improve their policies saw their GDP decline by 2 per cent a year, in all likelihood increasing the number of poor. Although the outcomes are 'encouraging' they are not as positive as they might be. Current growth rates among the best African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades. 'So far the rebounds have merely bought countries back to their historical trend of low growth, and it is not yet clear whether they are shifting onto a higher growth path. 'Without further substantial increases in agricultural, investment, export and GDP growth, sub-Saharan Africa will continue to lag behind other developing nations.' The report examines the relationship between economic policy and growth in sub Saharan Africa, by comparing the performances of 29 countries during two periods: 1981-86, when the region was in economic crisis but few countries were implementing economic reforms, and in 1987-91 when most African governments had adopted World Bank supported structural adjustment programmes. The six leading reformers reduced budget deficits, curbed inflation, introduced competitive exchange rates, tariff reforms and agricultural incentives. Countries that have liberalised their pricing and marketing of agriculture have seen a resurgence in domestic production of both food and export crops, says the Bank. The study 'also shows that it is not always true that devaluation necessarily results in higher rates of inflation provided there were complementing policies of wage, fiscal and monetary restraint . . . and indeed reaped the benefits in terms of competitiveness on the world market.' Export volumes increased significantly, despite declining terms of trade, if the exchange rate, agricultural pricing and marketing liberalisation polies were implemented, says the report. Comparing Africa and other developing regions, the Bank says: 'It is worrisome that even the best performers in Africa do not come close to matching the good macroeconomic policies typified by Chile, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, where inflation is close to 10 per cent a year, budget balances range from deficits of 2 per cent of GDP to small surpluses and currencies are fully convertible, at least for current account transactions.' African governments are criticised for slow progress in privatisation. 'The value of privatisations in Nigeria between 1988 and 1992,' says the Bank, 'was less than 1 per cent of that in Argentina, Malaysia or Mexico, even after adjusting for Nigeria's smaller GDP.' Africa's financial sector is still 'heavily burdened' by public sector demands for credits, says the Bank. Central governments alone (excluding public enterprises) absorb more than 30 per cent of domestic credit. 'There is substantially more room for improving policies,' said Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank vice president for Africa, at a press conference in Washington to launch the study. 'Macroeconomic policies deteriorated in a third of the countries, and no country has achieved a first rate macroeconomic policy stance - low inflation, very low budget deficit and a competitive exchange rate,' he said. Africa performs particularly poorly in comparison with other developing countries. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. The report notes Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. The high rate of population growth - more than 3 per cent a year - strains the limited resources available. Adjustment programmes can establish a framework for sound investment and efficient resource use, but are no substitute for long-term development efforts to build the capabilities of Africa's people by putting adequate resources into education and strengthening weak management capacity. 'Emphasis on universal primary education is the key to achieving rapid growth in the best performing Asian economies,' says the bank. Other central policy measures which are vital include the need to accelerate divestiture programmes and develop financial sectors. Reducing Africa's external debt burden and maintaining aid flows 'is essential', says the Bank 'but debt relief and aid only make sense if sound economic reform programmes are in place.

Already there are over 5m unemployed, nearly two in five workers, the ILO estimates. While blacks bear the overwhelming burden of joblessness, the ILO says unemployment and poverty have surfaced among whites for the first time since the 1930s. South Africa's labour force is expected to rise from 13.4m in 1990 to 20.2m in 2025, with up to 500,000 workers entering the labour market each year. Only 31,000 new jobs a year were created in the 1980s and fewer since then, mostly in the public sector, the ILO notes.

These people were classified 'functionally' innumerate or illiterate after a 30-minute assessment of their skills, not because they could not read or add up at all, but because the requirements of industry have risen. Mr Peter Davis, chairman of the unit, said: 'Even very simple jobs are becoming more complex. Skills need to rise and the needs of employers are rising generally faster than the people's skills.' The unit suggested that an extra 25 per cent needed help with literacy, while an extra 33 per cent needed help with mathematics. The survey, the most detailed of its kind yet in the UK, broadly confirmed previous estimates that about 6m adults in the UK have difficulties with their basic skills, and that 40 per cent of teenagers entering further education needed help with basic skills. The survey showed that 21-year-olds with poor basic skills were much more likely to be jobless - 35 per cent of men with low literacy, and 25 per cent with low numeracy, were unemployed, in spite of 13 per cent unemployment for the whole sample. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, addressing the unit's annual conference in London, announced that he was granting an extra Pounds 250,000 for pilot schemes in family literacy. These mirror schemes to improve literacy in the US. He pointed to the unit's finding that poor literacy and numeracy correlate strongly with poor basic skills in parents. Of those whose parents were in the lowest attainment group, without educational qualifications, 61 per cent had low literacy scores and 52 per cent had low numeracy scores. If parents' skills were improved, they would be more likely to pass them on to their children, Mr Patten argued. He also said the adult illiteracy problem 'shows why it is essential to press ahead with testing' in schools. He said: 'We cannot afford to wait until our pupils become adults before we identify and tackle their needs.' Ms Ann Taylor, Labour's education spokesman, said: 'After 14 years of Conservative government the situation is clearly worsening. Government policy reinforces disadvantage.' The survey was conducted in 1991 by City University, which interviewed a representative sample of 1,650 people born between April 5 and April 11 1970. The study excluded dyslexics, people for whom English was not a first language, and all those with mental disabilities.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

However, Standard and Poor's, the other big US agency, awarded a lower rating. Mr Chris Liebenberg, South Africa's minister of finance, last night welcomed Moody's Baa3 rating, saying it demonstrated 'confidence in the coherence of the economic policies and political stability brought to the country by the government of national unity'. He noted that Standard and Poor's, which awarded a BB or sub-investment grade rating, had also said it saw a 'positive outlook' for the country. South Africa had been seeking an international credit rating since April's elections brought President Nelson Mandela's government to power. However, its first formal rating, from the European agency IBCA, was a disappointing BB, putting it on a par with countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Officials said they were pleased with Moody's higher rating, which rates South Africa ahead of both Mexico and India. Moody's said the rating was based on the country's low external debt, and on the commitment by the new government to redirect spending to a comprehensive development programme while reducing the public sector deficit. Mr Carlos Cordeiro, a partner with Goldman Sachs, the investment bank which is advising the government, said he was 'delighted' with the rating. It would allow South Africa to 'access a wider range of capital around the world', he said. South Africa has borrowed money in European markets without an official rating, but yesterday's news will permit it to re-enter the US market. In its June budget, the government said it would raise R1.8bn (Dollars 504.8m) from the international capital markets in the current financial year. External debt has been paid down in net terms since 1985, when international banks refused to roll over loans to the republic, in response to political unrest. South Africa's return to the international bond markets could be in the form of a global bond of around Dollars 500m, said Mr Liebenberg, Reuter adds from Madrid. However, Mr Liebenberg, in Madrid for the IMF/World Bank meeting, said that no firm decisions had been made and it was up to the markets to set the parameters for the issue. He said that apart from the global format, South Africa was considering a plain eurobond and even a yankee bond.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     ESZ  Spain, EC.

0,FT942-15273 ,"FT942-15273 _AN-EDOC4AGOFT 940415   FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (5): Education - must try harder / Industry's needs are not being met      By ANNE COUNSELL   Academics and educationists award Turkey's state education system good marks for effort, but lower grades for an inconsistent approach, lack of qualified teaching staff and patchy provision of facilities. Mirroring the political swings and roundabouts, there have been 63 ministers of education in 70 years, each making a mark by overhauling, reversing, amending or merely tweaking the system. Nevertheless, there have been strides in improving the literacy rate from only 10 per cent 50 years ago to 80.7 per cent in 1990. There are, however, marked differences between the literacy rates of men and women, the young and the elderly as well as in urban and rural areas. The development of educational facilities has been constrained by population growth, migration and urbanisation. Widespread birth control slowed the birth rate from 2.49 per cent in the late 1980s to 2.0 per cent in 1990, which is still high in European terms. Thirty-five per cent of the population is under 15 years of age. The age distribution pattern has led to high unemployment rates among young people with nearly 65 per cent of the jobless aged between 22 and 29 years old. Family size is declining in higher income families, but rural families are still large. The south-east has the highest population growth in the country, which is politically significant as most people in these areas are Kurdish. School building programmes have sometimes lagged behind the rapid urbanisation, leading to double shifts at some urban schools while those in the villages have been emptied of pupils. In the cities population is growing by 4.5 to 6 per cent a year, amounting in 1990 to 61.3 per cent of the country's total. Spending on education devoured 19.2 per cent of the budget in 1990, second only to general public services at 25.2 per cent, and more than defence at 11.7 per cent. The cost of compulsory education between the ages of six and 14 is borne by the state, but parents are expected to contribute towards the cost of books or additional facilities - so that the poorer areas, which are in the most need, fall further behind. Turkey's educational system of primary, middle, general and vocational high schools and universities, has a declining enrolment rate from one stage to the next. Efforts are being made to provide easy transfer between vocational, technical and general secondary programmes and to tailor education to developments in industry. 'We have a big hole in the middle,' says Professor Mehmet Saglam, president of Yok, the Higher Education Council. 'There are more than enough good engineers, but far too few able technicians.' The ministry of national education concedes that 'it has not been possible to reach the planned targets to train the needed manpower'. Repeated calls for more technical and vocational schools at the secondary level have been heeded by Mr Nevzat Ayaz, the minister of education, who has been promoting the recognition of 'skills' through apprenticeships, industrial placements and adult education. The chasm between education and the needs of commerce and industry has become acute in many sectors. Last year, the Turkish Maritime Educational Foundation (TDEV) campaigned to raise Dollars 8m to improve officer training. Citing a disparity between growth in the merchant fleet and education, the foundation said the training bottleneck hampered efforts to increase tonnage and Turkey's share in the shipping market. The TDEV succeeded in securing private and government funds for classrooms and facilities while the Merchant Marine Academy, run by the Istanbul Technical University, replaced its four-year course with a 2 1/2 -year sandwich course, leading to an expected 200 deck and engine-room officers graduating from the college every year, double the present number. In higher education, there is stiff competition for university places. Out of 1m applicants, only a third secured a place last year, despite annual intake increases and the creation of new universities. From only 19 universities in 1982, there has been a threefold increase to 57, of which four are private, while student capacity has risen from 49,000 to 173,000. As a result, there is a lack of qualified lecturers and academic staff and the student to lecturer ratio has grown rapidly. In stark contrast to the austere, Dickensian state universities, the recently established private universities are bright and dynamic. Bilkent University, modelled on private research universities in the US, is epitomised by its energetic rector, Mr Ali Dogramaci. Its rapidly expanding campus, where all the teaching is in English, is funded through a foundation comprising an array of companies from printing plants to furniture producers, which also act as suppliers to the campus. Yok was established in 1982 as a co-ordinating and policy making body to develop Turkey's higher education system. Under its umbrella, the Inter-University Committee is responsible for improving standards and supervising research, higher degrees and other academic matters. Members of the council and the committee are predominantly drawn from academia, with one third of the 21 seats appointed by the government. There remains a deep-seated suspicion over the role of Yok among those who believe it is a hangover from the military coup of 1980 when right and leftwing activism was rampant at the universities. But this is countered by Prof Saglam who stresses the education council's academic credentials and its metamorphosis since its formation. The universities are conscientiously apolitical; neither faculty members nor students are permitted to be active members of political parties. As Seyfi, a student at the technical university in Istanbul says: 'We are here to be technical, not political.' The universities, however, cannot isolate themselves from the current debate over Kemalist doctrines, democracy and the secular nature of the republic. Although out of the headlines, the issue of whether women should wear headscarves on campus remains.

Selection Criteria_Program Factors (472.22(a)(5))           Comment:     Section 472.22(a)(5) proposed adding language to a selection criterion encouraging applicants to focus ``on improving performance in jobs or job functions that have a broad representation within the Nation's workforce so that the products can be adapted for use by similar workplaces across the Nation.'' Several commenters interpreted this language as a statement of the scope of services that are allowable under the National Workplace Literacy Program, believed that this scope had been defined too narrowly, and urged that it be expanded to include a variety of activities. It was also suggested that a project be permitted to provide any services identified in a needs assessment. One commenter asked whether use of the term ``jobs or job functions'' was intended to shift focus away from job-specific competencies of current job titles to broader competencies that are identified in the report issued by the Department of Labor Secretary's Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS). The commenter asked that the Department clarify or define which jobs or job functions have ``broad representation within the Nation's workforce.'' Other commenters stated that a broader scope of services is needed to meet the National Education Goals.       Discussion:     Section 472.22(a)(5) is a selection criterion used to evaluate applications and is not a statement of the scope of allowable program services. That scope is stated in 472.3, which reflects sections 371(a)(1) and (3) of the Adult Education Act, and lists allowable activities. Many activities mentioned by the commenters, such as speaking, listening, reasoning, problem-solving, team building, GED preparation, and meeting the literacy needs of adults with limited English proficiency, are allowable under 472.3. Further guidance on the scope of allowable activities is included in the notice inviting applications published elsewhere in this issue of the     Federal Register    . Generally, workplace literacy projects teach literacy skills needed in the workplace that improve the productivity of the workforce. The program is not a program of general adult education and cannot serve needs that are not directly related to the workplace. At the same time, projects serving needs that are directly related to the workplace are encouraged to use creative approaches to stimulate workers' interests and to develop individualized education plans that reflect workers' goals. See 472.22(c)(2).   The purpose of the language encouraging a focus on nationally representative jobs or job functions is to enhance the capability of a project to demonstrate results that can be adapted by similar employers and industries. Section 472.22(a)(5) was not proposed specifically to respond to the recommendations of the SCANS report, nor was the report intended to modify the scope of services under the workplace literacy program. The Secretary believes that it is unnecessary to define by regulation what jobs or job functions are broadly representative. Applicants are encouraged to make their own evaluation of current and future labor market conditions, and design a project that can help similar workplaces in the future. This should assist in meeting National Education Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.       Changes:     None.       Selection Criteria_Demonstration (472.22(h)) (Proposed 472.22(h)(1))           Comments:     Several commenters agreed that the Department should emphasize dissemination activities, and recommended the inclusion of various other dissemination strategies. Two commenters were concerned that dissemination activities could be hampered because the instructional materials produced by a project might contain protected information.   One commenter suggested that, because carrying out both the demonstration and commitment activities described in proposed 472.22(h)(1) and (2) would be overwhelming, applicants should be asked to address only one of these criteria.       Discussion:     The dissemination strategies listed in proposed 472.22(h)(1) are among the regulatory changes designed to transform the National Workplace Literacy Program into a true demonstration program. See the previous discussion of the background of these regulations and note also 472.31(c), which requires that a project be independently evaluated for ``spread'' and ``transportability'' to other sites. Proposed 472.22(h)(1) encouraged applicants to use certain dissemination strategies but was not intended to preclude the use of additional strategies when they are appropriate for a particular project.   The Secretary does not expect or anticipate that partnerships will disseminate trade secrets or other protected information. However, a project's dissemination activities should clearly benefit businesses and workplaces outside of the partnership.   While, ideally, all partners will be involved in demonstration and commitment activities, these activities may be accomplished through the efforts of particular partners. The Secretary desires that the factors listed in the criteria on ``Demonstration'' and ``Commitment'' be reflected in an applicant's program design, management plan, and budget. However, the Secretary does not anticipate that addressing both criteria will be burdensome if partners adequately plan and budget for them.       Changes:     The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed 472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in 472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in 472.22(i).

In a strongly-worded attack on the World Bank's latest report on the region, Oxfam said that bank-supported structural adjustment programmes had failed to 'generate sustainable growth and significantly reduce poverty'. The charity, which is heavily involved in Africa, declared that adjustment programmes 'were preoccupied with lowering inflation through interest rates and unrealistic money supply targets. 'Poorly planned and sequenced import liberalisation measures' had 'exposed potentially competitive local industries to ruinous competition from imports' Oxfam said in its statement. The British charity accused the bank of 'complacency' in the face of what it called Africa's 'deepening development crisis'. The charity also attacked the bank's classification in its report of Zimbabwe as a successful adjusting country as 'bordering on outright deception'. Zimbabwe's adjustment programme did not come until operation until 1991, says Oxfam: 'Since when there has been no sign of recovery in investment or export growth'.

0,FT941-12410 ,"FT941-12410 _AN-EA4DIAAQFT 940131   FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (4): The picture still looks grim - Money spent on children's health is not going where it is most needed      By RACHEL JOHNSON   The world spends Dollars 2,000bn on health care a year; the rate at which health has improved since 1950 is unmatched in history. So says the World Bank's recent report, Investing in Health, published last summer. But the Bank also points out that the impressive sums are deceptive. For the money is 'either spent on the wrong things, or wasted.' There should be more 'barefoot medicine' and a wider campaign against poverty: for example, better education for girls and young women, which would result in better child health and smaller families. Nevertheless, the report is at pains to say that big spending on health  - and it argues that more is needed - does not simply result in more babies and all the dire consequences of over-population. It results in lower child mortality rates and fertility rates (after a lag of a couple of decades), as population growth rates in Asia, Latin America and Africa have shown. Furthermore, it saves money. The potential savings add up to billions of dollars, because premature death or disability lost the world (on the Bank's estimates) 1.4bn years of healthy (in many cases, productive) life in 1990 alone. But the money is still not going where it is most needed. According to Unicef's annual report on the state of the world's children - a sometimes harrowing document - 8m children still die every year from five preventable diseases: measles, whooping cough, diarrhoea, tetanus and pneumonia. Even more grim: 1m children have been killed, 4m seriously injured, and 5m have become refugees or orphaned as a result of wars in the past decade. A child born in 1991 in Romania or even in Turkey, on the borders of the European Union, is five times more likely to die in the first year of life than a child born in Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden, France or the Netherlands. In Turkey there are more than 56 deaths during the first year of life per 1000 live births, compared with six in Sweden. Mortality rates in the third world are considerably worse. In the Irish Republic only 10 children per 1,000 live births die before the age of five - Ireland comes near the top of the Unicef tables. In South America the average equivalent figure is 54, in East Asia 57, in South Asia 131 and in sub Saharan Africa 183. In some African countries almost one third of all children die before they are five. Looking at maternal mortality, the European average is 13 deaths in childbirth per 100,000 births. In South America the comparable figure is 210, in South Asia it is 490, and in sub Saharan Africa almost 600 mothers die in childbirth per 100,000 live births. But even wholescale redistribution of all the money spent on health could never achieve an equal chance of survival. Mortality rates arise from several different factors, such as what social and economic group a child is born into, general standards of living, housing and diet. Access to vaccination is also crucial: there have been big leaps forward in the global immunisation programme. The proportion of children immunised against tuberculosis, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus and polio rose from 5 per cent in 1977 to 20-30 per cent in 1983. By 1990, immunisation programmes against of polio, diphtheria and measles had reached 80 per cent of all children, with 35 per cent of pregnant women receiving tetanus shots. The lowest rate of vaccine coverage was in sub-Saharan Africa. Lurking behind the call to redirect (and slightly increase) the Dollars 2000bn spent world-wide are wide disparities in health care resources, and the resulting mortality and illness rates. The Bank says that if more money was spent on preventing or curing the most common killers, such as measles, whooping cough, complications of pregnancy and water-born diseases, in parts of the world, millions of lives could be saved relatively cheaply. In the developing world, where the amount spent per head on health care is a only a fraction of that spent in the developed world, a little more money would go a long way. By contrast, the Americans spend 14 per cent of the US' gross domestic product on health care, compared with 6.1 per cent in the UK, and 8 per cent in Germany, France and Sweden. Improvements in the developing world's health and child mortality rates will to a large extent depend on the commitments undertaken by countries of the developed world, and improving the health of the world's children will take a greater international effort. At the World Summit for Children, held in New York in 1990, 71 heads of states signed a plan of action, seeking 'measurable, attainable goals' for countries to incorporate into national planning: eradication of polio by the year 2000; 90 per cent immunisation by the same date; a halving of child deaths caused by diarrhoea; and virtual elimination of vitamin A deficiency. While developing countries - Tunisia and Zimbabwe among them - have shown themselves capable of reforming their health sectors, only 2.5 per cent of all health spending (about Dollars 4.8bn) in developing countries comes from donors. Meanwhile, the share of total development aid for health fell during the 1980s from 7 per cent to 6 per cent. In the UK much remains to be done. The Child Poverty Action Group, the Health Visitors' Association and the Save the Children fund argued in their submission to the health white paper in 1992: 'There are clear links between poverty, environment and children's health. What hope is there for the future health of the nation if the government fails to act to improve the health of the nation's children?'   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

Vida      Lorrie Giles, 25, a first-grade bilingual education teacher at Las Lomas  Elementary School in La Habra, was honored as one of 100 American teachers to  receive the Sallie Mae First Year Teacher Award.    ""She is the type of teacher a child will never forget,"" Principal Mary Jo  Anderson said of Giles. ""The award to her was wonderfully deserved.""    Giles received a $1,000 prize from the Student Loan Marketing Assn., a New York  financial group that funds educational opportunities. She plans to use the  money toward her master's degree at Pepperdine University.    She is a Whittier resident and a graduate of Cal State Long Beach.    Boy Scout Gregory T. Garten, 14, of Garden Grove, who helped clean, scrape and  paint 105 fire hydrants in the city, was awarded his Eagle Scout rank at a  Court of Honor.    The hydrant work, a safety and beautification effort that involved 10 other  scouts and five fathers, was his Eagle service project.    Gregory, a devotee of sound reproduction, particularly on stereo systems he  designs, added to his service record by working weekends at a camp for Cub  Scouts.    Joyce Lowder, a teacher at the Taft School for the hearing-impaired in Santa  Ana, has been named 1989-90 president of the California Teachers of the Hearing  Impaired.

Baldwin was named the eighth recipient of the  Orange County Council of Boy Scouts' ""Good Scout Award"" and will be honored  Oct. 13 at a luncheon at the Anaheim Marriott.    Baldwin, vice president of the Baldwin Co. in Newport Beach, was selected on  the basis of his interest and participation in the Boy Scouts.    Mike Chitjian, a 17-year resident of Costa Mesa, has been elected chairman of  the Costa Mesa Cultural Arts Committee, which advises the city on the state of  the arts in Costa Mesa and its educational system.    Chitjian said the 12-member committee has awarded more than $550,000 to groups  in the Costa Mesa area since its inception in 1984.    He is president of a Costa Mesa executive search firm.

Vida      Lorrie Giles, 25, a first-grade bilingual education teacher at Las Lomas  Elementary School in La Habra, was honored as one of 100 American teachers to  receive the Sallie Mae First Year Teacher Award.    ""She is the type of teacher a child will never forget,"" Principal Mary Jo  Anderson said of Giles. ""The award to her was wonderfully deserved.""    Giles received a $1,000 prize from the Student Loan Marketing Assn., a New York  financial group that funds educational opportunities. She plans to use the  money toward her master's degree at Pepperdine University.    She is a Whittier resident and a graduate of Cal State Long Beach.    Boy Scout Gregory T. Garten, 14, of Garden Grove, who helped clean, scrape and  paint 105 fire hydrants in the city, was awarded his Eagle Scout rank at a  Court of Honor.    The hydrant work, a safety and beautification effort that involved 10 other  scouts and five fathers, was his Eagle service project.    Gregory, a devotee of sound reproduction, particularly on stereo systems he  designs, added to his service record by working weekends at a camp for Cub  Scouts.    Joyce Lowder, a teacher at the Taft School for the hearing-impaired in Santa  Ana, has been named 1989-90 president of the California Teachers of the Hearing  Impaired.    Orange County developer James P. Baldwin was named the eighth recipient of the  Orange County Council of Boy Scouts' ""Good Scout Award"" and will be honored  Oct. 13 at a luncheon at the Anaheim Marriott.    Baldwin, vice president of the Baldwin Co. in Newport Beach, was selected on  the basis of his interest and participation in the Boy Scouts.    Mike Chitjian, a 17-year resident of Costa Mesa, has been elected chairman of  the Costa Mesa Cultural Arts Committee, which advises the city on the state of  the arts in Costa Mesa and its educational system.

According to the  GCA's African Population Advisory Committee (APAC) report  presented in Harare, nine million adults in Africa were infected  with the HIV virus.    The report was presented by prof H Okoth-Ogendo on behalf of  Kenyan Vice-President George Saitoti, the current APAC chairman,  the ZIANA news agency reported.    The session was also attended by Zimbabwean President Robert  Mugabe, Botswana's President Kethumile Masire and other  dignitaries.    The report said many African countries, including Zimbabwe,  had the highest HIV prevalance among adults worldwide.    AIDS was also increasing health care costs while orphaning  large numbers of children and leaving many elderly people  without protection.    The report said advances made in health and welfare were  being eroded by AIDS and it quoted United Nations Children's  Emergency Fund estimates as showing that under-five mortality  rates were likely to be pushed back to the 1960s level.    ""In summary, the epidemic will likely increase the number of  people in poverty and thwart efforts to develop sectors that  rely on skilled or scarce manpower.""    The report noted African efforts to contain the virus had  had  mixed results. Zimbabwe, along with six other African countries,  had been successful in changing behaviour through use of condoms.    APAC recommended focusing prevention programmes on the  youth,  making condoms easily available and improving management  programmes to control the AIDS epidemic.     "

Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, made the announcement at the launch of Grand Metropolitan Trust's training centre in east London. The trust is one of the largest providers of training to young people and the adult unemployed, and many of its clients have special needs. Government funding through Tecs of training for people with special needs has been criticised, particularly by voluntary groups which have provided most of such training. Provision for people with special needs has suffered disproportionately from cuts in training budgets, it is claimed, because Tecs have favoured candidates who can get qualifications most quickly. Part of Tecs' funding is related to the qualifications trainees achieve. Mr Howard said: 'From next month achievement by those with severe literacy or numeracy needs will be recognised.' This will be because the acquisition of new qualifications which certify numeracy and literacy will count towards the output-related part of funding. Astra Training Services, created in a management buy-out of government skillcentres, has raised nearly Pounds 20m from new investors including Schroder Ventures, the venture capital group, which is investing Pounds 5m in return for an equity stake.

By CARLOS BREZINA, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL      WASHINGTON      Most of the world is winning the war against poverty, ignorance and illness,  and the number of people can be further reduced by the end of the century with  adequate economic policies, the World Bank says.    It said only one major region -- Sub-Saharan Africa -- risks a degradation of  its economic and social conditions in the 1990s.    Despite ""tremendous"" progress the past three decades, 1.1 billion people in  developing countries -- one out of four -- still live on less than $370 a year,  World Bank President Barber B. Conable said.    The bank's annual report, ""World Development 1990 -- Poverty,"" said per-capita  consumption in developing countries rose by 67% between 1965 and 1985, life  expectancy lengthened to 62 years from 51 and primary school enrollment rose to  84% from 73.    Progress was uneven, with the greatest gains in East Asia. Yet even in  Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where consumption per capita stagnated  during the period, life expectancy and primary enrollment rates improved.    Moreover, the 1980s -- often called a ""lost decade for the poor"" -- did not  reverse the overall trend of progress.    ""The incomes of most of the world's poor went on rising, and under-5 (years of  age) mortality, primary school enrollment ratios and other social indicators  also continued to improve,"" the study said.    The setbacks of the 1980s occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America,  where poverty increased. In Latin America, however, overall social conditions  did not deteriorate as much as the fall in income would have suggested, the  bank noted.    Conable contended that, with adequate economic policies, the number of poor  could be slashed by 300 million by the end of the century.    ""This is no pipe dream,"" he said, adding that over the past few decades there  were spectacular victories in the war against poverty in countries as diverse  as Colombia, Indonesia, Chile and Botswana.    In Indonesia, the proportion of poor was reduced to 20% from 60% in the past 25  years.    Conable warned, nevertheless, that although the number of poor could be reduced  by 400 million in Asia, their numbers could swell by 100 million in Sub-Saharan  Africa because of slow growth in income and high population growth.    He said countries that reduced poverty did so with a two-part strategy. The  first promoted using the poor's most abundant asset, labor, through policies  that harness market incentives, social and political institutions,  infrastructure and technology. The second aimed at providing basic social  services to the poor -- health care, family planning, nutrition and education.    The World Bank voiced optimism on prospects for the global economy for the  1990s, except for Sub-Saharan Africa.    It projected that industrial economies will achieve a 3% annual growth,  commodity prices will dip in the short term but gain an average 0.2% per year,  and real interest rates will fall to between 3% and 4% from almost 5.5% in the  1980s.    The number of poor in Latin America is expected to remain the same as the  region's economy advances by 4.2% per year through the end of the century, with  a 2.3% per-capita output gain. If the region achieved better income  distribution, the number of poor could fall by 20%.    For Sub-Saharan countries, the projected annual economic growth rate is 3.7%,  but high population growth may reduce the per-capita gain to 0.5%.    In contrast, South Asian nations will increase output at a 5.1% annual rate, a  per-capita hike of 3.2%. India's economy will expand at a 5.2% annual clip, a  3.4% per-capita advance.    East Asian countries will all but wipe out poverty, with an economic growth  rate of 6.6% per year and a per-capita advance of 5.1%. China's economy will  expand by 6.8% a year in the 1990s, down from 10.1% in the 1980s, with a  per-capita gain of 5.4%.    For Eastern Europe, the bank cautioned, the outlook is cloudy. Economic reforms  and anti-inflationary measures will depress growth for a while, even with  generous external assistance. Annual output expansion in the 1990s could  average 1.9%, for a 1.5% per-capita gain.    In the Middle East, North Africa and developing countries of Europe, economic  expansion is projected at a 4.3% annual clip, for a 2.1% per-capita gain.

The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the 21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday, before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent. Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks, fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists say the recent rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Dollars 280m-Dollars 420m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17 per cent of the budget. Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary officials are committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency, a move almost certain to send short-term interest rates rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. Thus, the currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second-guess the financial authorities. In recent days, fears over the state of President Mandela's health and worries that South Africa's international credit rating, soon to be announced by the major agencies, will be lower than the anticipated BBB have also contributed to the run. An estimated 25,000 workers in the car-making industry, taking part in the longest and costliest stoppage since President Mandela came to power in May, rejected the employers' revised pay offer of 10.5 per cent, their union leader announced yesterday. By the end of last week, the strike by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa had cost the industry more than R2.2bn in turnover, an official of the Automobile Manufacturers Employers' Organisation said.

Notices concerning those programs will be published at a later date.        Background on National Workplace Literacy Program        The National Workplace Literacy Program is ideally suited to play a key role in the Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community program because it links economic development and education and training efforts. The program, which makes discretionary grants of up to three years in length, supports demonstration projects that teach literacy skills needed in the workplace through exemplary education partnerships. The partnerships are established between a business, industry, or labor organization or a private industry council and an educational organization to support work-related basic skills training. The National Workplace Literacy Program funds may be used, among other things, to update or upgrade the skills of workers in line with changes in production processes or technology. For example, basic skill levels that formerly were adequate for assembly line production are inadequate for employees faced with sophisticated quality control systems, flexible production, team-based work, and participatory management practices.    National Workplace Literacy projects can improve the human resources of Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, increase the productivity of businesses located in Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, and help attract new businesses to these needy areas. Further, an amendment to the program, contained in the National Literacy Act of 1991, establishes a statutory priority for serving small businesses. This is the type of business most likely to be found in the zones.    In addition, the National Workplace Literacy Program is an important vehicle for achieving the National Education Goal that by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. The program helps further this goal by improving approaches and methods used in meeting the literacy needs of adults in the workplace, including those with limited English proficiency. The National Workplace Literacy Program will also benefit by establishing an absolute priority related to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. Communities receiving these designations will already have demonstrated a capacity for the type of cooperative planning that is critical to a successful workplace literacy partnership.

0,FT934-7906 ,"FT934-7906 _AN-DKRC7AB2FT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Anti-tax lobby offers history lesson      By RAYMOND SNODDY   LORD BULLOCK, the historian, yesterday offered a little historical perspective to the debate over the possible imposition of value added tax on books and publications. Lord Bullock, who is chairman of The Hands Off Reading Campaign, appealed to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to respect 132 years of 'educational and political wisdom and keep reading free of tax'. It was in 1861, Lord Bullock, told a press conference, that Mr Gladstone, when chancellor, removed the UK's last tax on learning and literacy, the stamp duty on newspapers. Lord Bullock said that the argument against VAT on publications was 'primarily an argument about literacy'. Current levels of literacy in the UK were little short of scandalous, with about 6.5m people over the age of 16 suffering serious reading difficulties, he said. The government, Lord Bullock said, had made improving levels of literacy its main target in education. It therefore made no sense to 'make it more difficult to obtain books and other reading materials'. Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, highlighted a NOP survey suggesting that marketing's C2, D and E social groups read nothing other than daily or Sunday newspapers. They were the key targets for the government's illiteracy campaign. He said that if VAT were introduced for newspapers it would be the first time that there had been a simultaneous price rise and the effect on circulations could be serious. Mr Ian Locks of the Periodical Publishers Association warned that as many as 1,000 magazines could move to continental Europe to avoid VAT by posting copies to subscribers.

0,FT933-5770 ,"FT933-5770 _AN-DIAB3AGAFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (2): Wanted: bigger carrot, more stick - Structural adjustment / Economic recovery can be secured only when donors and aid agencies offer greater rewards to committed reformers and are prepared to be tougher on defaulters      By EDWARD BALLS and TONY HAWKINS   Some are inclined to write Africa off as hopeless. Others see Africa as a special case to which the principles of economics do not apply. I reject such views. It is our approach that has failed. Africa has not . . . We need to bear in mind that Afro-pessimism is widespread in the world outside. We face a challenge. We must overcome the pessimists. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, December 1992 FOR THOSE who seek culprits to blame for Africa's deepening economic crisis, there are many candidates: the lingering legacy of the colonial era, the harsh dictates of World Bank structural adjustment programmes, the miserly aid and restrictive trade policies of developed country governments and the kleptocratic tendencies of Africa's own governing elite. So-called 'Afro-pessimists' and their gloomy appraisals make an easier target for those who are reluctant to confront the true dimensions of Africa's crisis. Yet the facts tell their own story. After a dozen years of structural adjustment and more than Dollars 170bn in net development assistance, the sub-Saharan economy is still falling behind. Incomes per head fell by an average 1.1 per cent a year between 1982 and 1992 compared to an average rise of 0.8 per cent a year in all developing countries and 6.4 per cent in the east Asia developing countries. The outlook is far from encouraging, as the accompanying articles demonstrate throughout this survey. Institutional and infrastructural decline is accelerating, the number of countries facing political disintegration is growing and the Aids crisis is deepening. The aid keeps flowing, although sub-Saharan Africa cannot be sure that its share of global aid - up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970 - will continue to rise. But Africa is increasingly cut off from the rest of the world economy - there is little evidence to suggest that either returning flight capital or foreign investment can fill the gap between Africa's capital needs and its ability to generate domestic savings. The combination of half-hearted policy reform, some debt relief, and substantial aid is expected to continue to slow the pace, rather than reverse the direction, of this relative and absolute decline. The World Bank expects African real incomes per head to rise by 0.6 per cent a year over the next decade compared to 2.9 per cent for all developing countries and 5.9 per cent in east Asia. Still, as the World Bank rightly says, the gloom can be overdone. Across the continent, human development indicators have improved over the past two decades. Infant mortality has fallen from 137 per 1,000 live births in 1973 to 107 in 1991, while life expectancy has risen from 45 years to 51 years over the same period. Progress on these social measures of quality of life was made in the 1980s despite adverse shifts in Africa's terms of trade, volatile commodity prices, persisting protectionism in OECD countries, and the doubling over 10 years in the the share of Africa's export earnings which go to service debts. Moreover, the World Bank can correctly claim that the nature of the obstacles to economic progress in Africa is now better understood. Ten years ago, African governments defended to the death fixed exchange rates, administered prices, state ownership of industry, subsidies to parastatals, cheap food for urban workers and negative real interest rates while the private sector was regarded with suspicion. Now most governments accept, at least in principle, that establishing macro-economic stability through structural adjustment policies - cutting budget deficits, slowing inflation and monetary growth, establishing a competitive exchange rate and eliminating obstacles to exports - is necessary if their economies are to achieve self-sustaining economic growth. The World Bank can point to signs of success in the handful of countries which has taken the structural adjustment advice to heart - most notably Ghana but also Uganda, Burkina Faso and until recently, Malawi - as evidence that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for progress. Since Ghana's adjustment programme began, its gross domestic product has grown by an average of 4.9 per cent a year, over twice the sub-Saharan average of 2.1 per cent. Equally powerfully, the Bank can point to the deepening recessions in the member countries of the French African Community (CFA) zone to demonstrate that governments cannot pick and mix items from the adjustment agenda. Between 1986 and 1991, cumulative losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. GDP in the other 16 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period, compared to a fall of 0.2 per cent annually in the first half of the decade. WHY DO the economies of sub-Saharan Africa continue to perform so poorly? There are two broad explanations. First, most African governments have not been willing to pay more than lip-service to the need for structural adjustment. Second, the experience of those countries which have tried to keep to the spirit, as well as the letter, of World Bank programmes suggests that structural adjustment is far from sufficient to deliver sustainable economic growth. In country after country the political commitment to economic reform has not been maintained. Of 26 adjusting countries, in 1990-91 only one  - Ghana - was judged by the World Bank research department to have an adequate macro-economic policy stance. In another 14 the stance was found to be fair, while in the remaining 11 it was rated either poor or very poor. One reason that adjustment is hard to sustain is that it takes many years to deliver results, much longer than the World Bank and the IMF were originally prepared to admit. But the deeper problem is that economic reform invariably runs counter to the interests of the urban elites who dominate government in Africa. Many African rulers are politically dependent on the patronage and corruption which regulations and secrecy conceal and which reforms are designed to root out. Kenya and Nigeria are prime examples of countries whose governments, in spite of the glaring need for adjustment, have never been able to maintain the reform momentum for long - too many powerful Nigerians benefit from the rewards that a distorted foreign exchange market deliver to those with a banking licence. Ghana, by contrast, has sustained adjustment, in part because its military government consistently aligned its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite which probably stands to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. The rural vote secured the election of Flight Lt Jerry Rawlings as president last December. The donors have, rightly, come under fire for their willingness to conceal what they know of the activities of African governments. For all its talk of 'good governance', the World Bank has never been willing to require that its client governments observe minimum levels of transparency, accountability and access to information, or apply these tests to its own dealings with African governments. The Bank often finds itself standing between unsuccessful governments and their electorates and withholding vital information on the state of the economy, and presenting overly optimistic progress reports that do no service to the reform cause. In Nigeria, the World Bank remains willing to conceal the extent to which the government siphons off an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day for its own off-budget purposes. In Zimbabwe, Bank officials recently submitted wildly optimistic export and growth numbers to their executive board to support a loan application. But the shortcomings of African governments, and the unwillingness of Bank officials to disclose unpalatable facts, are only part of the story. The absence of political instability and corruption, and the adoption of the full adjustment agenda is not, it seems, enough to deliver a significant growth take-off. In a handful of cases, there has been an impressive supply-side response. The Mauritian miracle is the most convincing, but the response of farmers and textile manufacturers in Nigeria, of clothing exporters in Zimbabwe and tourist operators in Kenya and Tanzania, all reflect only partial success. One reason is that the non-farm private sector is too small to exploit the new opportunities. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990 compared to 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in rapidly growing Thailand. Across Africa, the private sector is dominated by a handful of multinationals and hundreds of small-scale enterprises. Those medium-sized companies which do exist are primarily service-orientated and often dependent on the regulations and tariff walls that adjustment policies dismantle. Meanwhile, global companies have been slow to return. The post-1970 deterioration in commodity prices, the increasing need for skilled rather than merely plentiful and cheap labour, and the increased emphasis on short lead times and quality over cost, all make it harder for Africa to sell itself as a location for foreign direct investment. Even successful adjusters have not shed the reputation of being high-risk, low-return locations. Africa does not have the social and physical infrastructure requirements that multinationals increasingly demand. Standards of literacy lag behind those of the east Asian developing economies, while the public infrastructure, education and health systems have deteriorated across the continent. Even when governments are getting macroeconomic policies right, implementation on the ground - in the central bank, at the tax office, at the customs desk - is proving much more difficult. The reason acknowledged in a recent speech by the Bank's vice-president for Africa, Mr Kim Jaycox, is the region's deteriorating institutional capacity. The Bank group lends Dollars 4bn a year to sub-Saharan Africa but has Dollars 14bn waiting to be dispersed. The World Bank now concedes that some of its performance yardsticks - a reduction in the number of public servants on the payroll - are not meaningful indicators of policy reform. Laying off road-workers makes little impact on the wage bill, has no impact at all on administrative efficiency and invariably means increased road maintenance charges later. Reducing the role of the state has left a vacuum - filled in many instances by the donors and non-governmental organisations. In reality, the shift of control in Africa is not from the state to the private sector or to the market but to the donors. Aid dependence has become aid addiction. Mr Jaycox argues that by substituting expatriate management for domestic skills, donors are 'systematically destroying capacity that does exist'. This is much worse than it sounds given the long lead time necessary to rebuild that capacity. The result is a disturbing contradiction between the desire for private sector and market-oriented development and the intrusive role the agencies frequently play in project decision-making. An alarmingly high proportion of the region's investment decisions are made by aid workers rather than the private sector. AFRICA can move from crisis to recovery. Given a healthier global environment, a more robust OECD growth performance, adoption of the Uruguay Round proposals, firmer commodity prices, fewer droughts and an end to war and civil unrest, an acceleration in the sub-Saharan growth towards 5 per cent a year, from 2 per cent over the past decade, is within reach. Whether the majority of African countries can achieve even this modest growth rate will depend on the willingness of African governments to pursue the right policies, and on the incentives that the developed country donors can offer to persuade governments to put long-term development before political short-termism. The failures of the 1980s suggest that the west, in seeking ways to speed, rather than impede, development, must make a much clearer and public distinction between those governments which truly embrace reform and those which merely pay lip-service. That means offering greater rewards to those countries - such as Ghana, Uganda and Zambia - which are demonstrating a sustained commitment to reform, while taking a tougher stance towards those countries - such as Kenya and Nigeria - which continue to evade responsibility for their failures. Lessons must be learned from Somalia: humanitarian intervention without a political and economic framework for recovery is, at best, short-term relief and, at worst, compounds the disaster. Trade, aid and debt relief are the best ways to encourage success. Ghana's ability to sustain reform over the past decade is due, in large part, to the fact that annual gross aid flows, averaging 8 per cent of GDP, were available almost from the moment that reform began. But it is absurd that Ghana should, at the same time, be paying a third of its annual export earnings in debt service to bilateral and multilateral donors. The Ghanaian government will not request debt relief, even though it clearly qualifies for debt reduction, for fear that these aid flows will dry up. But the donors should be offering, to Ghana, and other successful adjusters, much more generous packages of aid and debt relief. The international aid community must also think hard about the ways their activities help and hinder development in successful adjusters. The slow pace of indigenous capacity-building means that the need for external institutional support will remain for decades. There is a strong case for more burden-sharing between the donors and agencies, starting with a greater and more formalised role for non-government organisations (NGOs), working with local communities in areas such as primary health and education which are so important if sustainable growth is to be achieved. But the World Bank and the donors need, radically, to re-assess their approach to the numerous African governments who merely flirt with economic reform. The 1980s evidence suggests that trying to force adjustment measures on unwilling and corrupt regimes is counter-productive. First, the World Bank resident representative and visiting firemen tend to become the regime's apologist, increasingly willing to answer local critics and justify and defend ill-designed adjustment policies on the government's behalf. Then the Bank and the IMF become useful scapegoats when flawed and partially implemented policies do not deliver results, a tactic that President Moi of Kenya and ex-Presidents Kaunda of Zambia and Nyerere of Tanzania have all exploited. To avoid this trap, the Bank must insist that reform programmes are home-grown rather than imposed from outside, something which Ghana's achievements show is difficult but possible. The donors must, meanwhile, be prepared to put political reform at the top of the agenda. What is needed is not necessarily a change in government but rather a change in the style of government towards more open and accountable policy formulation and debate. Enforcing good governance requirements is much more demanding, and arguably far more important, than requiring multi-party elections as a pre-condition for aid. Sometimes elections help: without the defeat of Kenneth Kaunda in the 1991 elections, Zambia would probably not have become the country with one of the best macro-economic records in the region. But Ghana's successful transition to civilian rule occurred, in part, because the military government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10-year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But there is nothing democratic or economically progressive about multi-party elections unless minimum standards of good governance are already achieved. Last year's elections did not persuade President arap Moi of Kenya to put past patronage policies aside and embrace accountability and transparency. Nigeria's disastrous and flawed transition to civilian rule shows how multi-party elections can become an excuse for not taking tough economic decisions. Africa's debt burden further complicates the strategy, as the Nigerian experience again illustrates. Without debt relief, Africa's most populous country has little hope of progress, a point that World Bank officials make with great force. But the Paris Club creditors remain unwilling to offer further relief to a government which consistently misuses the resources it does control. Across Africa, the carrot of debt relief has not been enough to persuade half-hearted adjusters to accelerate reform - the World Bank is right to argue that a substantial write-off of Africa's remaining debts, on more generous terms than are currently envisaged, and taking account of differing debt structures, is now inevitable and should occur across the board. But debt relief should be combined with a public statement from the Bank and the donors that, for Africa, the rules of the aid game have changed. The Bank, and the donors, should refuse to engage in policy-based lending with any government which does not meet minimum standards of transparency and public access to information, including the Bank's own reports. They must be much tougher about policing and enforcing the conditions upon which future lending is based, including much more rigorous and rapid internal auditing of Bank and IMF lending. If governments are not willing to embrace the full structural adjustment agenda and good governance requirements, then the donors should only finance humanitarian projects. The World Bank, and the donor community, must speak out about the true state of Africa. Telling things as they are means being more realistic about what adjustment programmes can achieve. It means acknowledging that deregulation and liberalisation are only a beginning, that five-year programmes are implausibly short and that it will take many years of investment in human and physical infrastructure before the region's institutional base is rehabilitated. Afro-realism means resisting the temptation to declare victory in Ghana or Uganda or to make excuses for the shortcomings of governments in Nigeria and Kenya. For those countries which take the structural adjustment medicine, recovery will be long and hard. For those that do not, the chances of progress are slim and the future looks bleak.  -------------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC GROWTH  --------------------------------------------------------------                        1965-89    1982-92    1992-02  -------------------------------------------------------------- GDP All LDCs                 4.7        2.7        4.7  East Asia               7.2        8.0        7.3  Latin America           4.3        1.9        3.9  Sub-Saharan Africa      3.2        2.0        3.7 GDP per head All LDCs                 2.5        0.8        2.9  East Asia               5.2        6.4        5.9  Latin America           1.8       -0.2        2.1  Sub-Saharan Africa      0.4       -1.1        0.6  -------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank, Global Economic Prospects 1991 and 1993  --------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Human numbers are growing at record rates, with an annual increase of about 97m projected for the next 10 years, says the organisation's State of the World Population 1992 report. That would mean 6bn people in 1998, and 10bn in 2050, compared with 5.48bn this summer. Without 'immediate and determined action' to reduce future family sizes, world population could reach 12.5bn in 2050, it warns. UNFPA found that, since 1975, population growth rates have been linked to per capita income in developing countries - before then, no such connection had been established. Countries with slower population growth rates saw annual incomes rise by an average 1.23 per cent a year in the 1980s compared with a fall of 1.25 per cent in countries where population grew faster. Lower birth rates also meant higher savings and investment ratios. Eliminating extreme poverty, improving health and education, and raising the status of women are seen as essential steps to encouraging reduced family sizes. Such policies should give special attention to Africa and south Asia, which are responsible for more than half the population increases and which contain most of the world's very poor, says UNFPA. The issue of sustainable development is also tackled in the report, which says record population growth rates are being accompanied by record human consumption of resources.

0,FT933-858 ,"FT933-858 _AN-DI0BZAC3FT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Personal View: Private sector key to Africa's future      By LEWIS T PRESTON   The Financial Times's recent supplement on sub-Saharan Africa ('Africa; A continent at stake', September 1) performed a service for everyone concerned with development. At a time when the world's attention is diverted to the dramatic changes taking place in other areas, it is vital that the magnitude of the development challenges in sub-Saharan Africa is not forgotten. Half the region's 600m people live in absolute poverty. It is the only region where the number of poor people would - if current trends are not reversed - increase by the year 2000, where population is doubling every 20 years, and external debt exceeds gross domestic product. Indeed, the future of the continent is 'at stake'. However, Africa is also changing. We are all familiar with the evolving political transformation in South Africa. Not so well known is the fundamental change in economic policies which has been taking place across much of sub-Saharan Africa. This has been a 'quiet revolution', with more than 30 countries undertaking adjustment programmes aimed at increasing productivity and growth. The intensity and success of their reforms have varied, and more time will be required before definitive results emerge. However, there are signs of progress. Benin, Burundi, the Gambia, Ghana, Mali, Tanzania and Uganda are among a group of countries - supported under a special programme of assistance co-ordinated by the World Bank - that has achieved growth rates double the region's average, tripled output in the critical agricultural sector, and reversed the decline in exports. There remains a long way to go. But these results indicate that in Africa - as in East Asia or Latin America - adjustment to economic realities produces economic results. Now is not the time for Africa to slow down its reform efforts. On the contrary, they must be accelerated. Many countries have taken the first macroeconomic steps. Africa now needs to underpin them with a 'second generation' of reforms - to encourage the private sector, and to build its human and institutional capacities. About 350m new jobs will be needed in sub-Saharan Africa within a generation. Only the private sector - free to allocate resources and respond to market signals - can create employment and incomes on this scale. And only the private sector can provide Africa with the access it needs to investment, know-how and technology. The message is clear: the movement toward a 'market-friendly' approach must be broadened and deepened. It is Africa's only hope of competing in the global economy of the 21st century. Educated and healthy people - and competent institutions - are also essential. In this regard providers of aid to Africa have a major responsibility. The international community needs to re-examine the quality of its assistance effort - and its overall development effectiveness. Donors cannot be satisfied that external technical assistance to sub-Saharan Africa has increased over the last decade and now stands at about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) a year. Nor can they be satisfied that an estimated 100,000 expatriate 'advisers' are at work in Africa today, a larger number than at independence. At the same time - and as the FT pointed out - Africa knows that the 'rules of the aid game' have changed in the post-cold war era. The competition for resources has never been greater. Aid budgets are being scrutinised and, in some cases, cut. Countries that cannot show they are using aid effectively - and that means good governance as well as good economic policy - will lose it. The World Bank is one of Africa's strongest supporters in its development efforts. Evidence of this is the wide range of initiatives we have undertaken as well as the volume of our lending. But we don't have all the resources required. And we don't have all the answers. Our partners in the donor community have a crucial role to play. Non-government organisations are vital at the grass roots. And the private sector holds the key to providing the bulk of future investment. However, the principal responsibility for Africa's development rests with Africa and its leaders. They must adopt the right policies, inspire confidence in investors, and motivate their peoples. Many African nations have started to change in the right direction. The international community must support them. The author is president of the World Bank   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT942-13401 ,"FT942-13401 _AN-EDYDRAE4FT 940425   FT  25 APR 94 / World Bond Markets: Banking on the new South Africa - Capital  Credit      By MARK SUZMAN and SARA WEBB   During the dark days of apartheid, South Africa was shunned in the international capital markets. But with an all-race, democratically-elected government expected after this week's election, investment bankers are falling over each other to win business from South African borrowers. South Africans - including the Republic of South Africa, the Electricity Supply Commission, and the Department of Posts and Telecommunications - tapped the international capital markets with bonds issues in the first half of the 1980s. However, thoughts of new international borrowing disappeared as the country was forced to institute a debt standstill in 1985, after international institutions refused to roll over outstanding short-term loans. A final rescheduling agreement on all affected debt was negotiated last year. Competition is fierce among international investment banks to be appointed adviser to the new government. A report by Salomon Brothers concluded that on economic terms, the country 'should be placed squarely in the mid-investment grade category', although it cautions that the political risk factor might lower the rating. After the release of Mr Nelson Mandela in 1990, a handful of South African names successfully returned to the market, launching D-Mark-denominated international bond issues. The Republic of South Africa's DM400m five-year issue - launched by Deutsche Bank in September 1991 with a coupon of 10.5 per cent - yielded 175 basis points over the German government bond. Swiss Bank Corporation says the yield spread over German bunds has widened, from 243 basis points in mid-March to 321 basis points on April 21 1994. The moves reflect international investor concern over the political risk. The question now is whether the Republic of South Africa will tap the international bond market after the election. As yet, there is little indication of a desire to increase international borrowing significantly. The hesitancy is due to the continuing depreciation of the rand, which makes foreign currency commitments expensive, and the desire of the National Party and the African National Congress, the two parties likely to dominate the new government, to limit total debt burden. 'It would be foolish for South Africa to borrow for the sake of borrowing,' warns Mr Edward Osborne, chief economist at Nedbank. This sentiment is shared by ANC economics head Mr Trevor Manuel, who says South Africa should be 'extremely cautious' before trying to borrow more money abroad - although a portion of the ANC's proposed reconstruction bonds to fund black development projects will probably be floated abroad. Caution is also likely to be the watchword for non-government bond issuers. Escom, the state electricity company, may try a new Eurobond issue, but other companies are unlikely to follow close behind. For the moment, therefore, most analysts expect the focus to remain on the domestic market. Big bond issuers are the government and parastatals, such as Escom and Transnet, the transport, rail and ports authority. Some local companies have also dipped into the market, most notably blue-chip industrial South African Breweries. The bond market is capitalised at around R200bn and has an average monthly turnover of R63bn. There is substantial foreign ownership, and non-residents hold an estimated R40bn in South African capital market stock. These non-resident investors have tended to be Swiss or German, but bankers say some started to take profits last year. The new wave of foreign investment has largely come from the US. The most actively-traded bonds are government stock and Escom, with the two benchmarks being the R150 and the E168. The latter, in particular, is popular with foreigners, particularly continental Europeans, who hold almost half the outstanding Escom bonds. However, the markets are volatile and sensitive to domestic political factors. After heavy buying for much of last year, fears about election prospects meant that between February and mid-April foreigners were net sellers of gilts, helping push long bond rates from a low of 11.62 per cent to a high of 13.39 per cent. Over the past two weeks, however, they have returned, and yields have dipped below 13 per cent. The attractions for foreigners are twofold. First, interest rates are high. Second, the country's two-tier currency means the rate of return for foreign investors is significantly higher than for locals. Non-residents are allowed to buy bonds at the financial rand exchange rate but get returns paid at the commercial rand exchange rate. With the current discount between the two currencies around 25 per cent, this means a significantly higher yield for foreigners.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT944-2484 ,"FT944-2484 _AN-ELSBNABEFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria under pressure to scrap economic controls      By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor      LAGOS   A team from the International Monetary Fund has completed talks this week in Abuja with Nigeria's finance ministry less than three weeks before the military regime is due to review economic policy in the 1995 budget. General Sani Abacha, head of state, is under pressure from investors and official creditors to scrap the economic controls imposed in January and deal with the Dollars 8bn arrears in debt service to the Paris Club. Since early 1992 Nigeria has not serviced its debt to the Paris Club, which accounts for more than half its Dollars 28bn external debt. Nigeria needs some form of agreement with the IMF and a few months' good track record to gain external debt relief and unlock international finance for planned gas export projects. The fund is looking for significant steps to deregulate foreign exchange and interest rate policy, cut the budget deficit and account for all oil revenue. There is also continued concern about the estimated 150,000 barrels a day of oil revenue that goes into offshore dedication accounts under the supervision of the presidency and which never enters the government's books. The Nigerian government is being urged to curb uneconomic capital projects and recurrent spending and to find more revenue. Although the government forecast a balanced budget in 1994, economists believe the budget deficit this year will be more than Dollars 4bn, which is nearly 100 per cent of forecast expenditure and about 14 per cent of gross domestic product, despite the failure to meet commitments to supply foreign exchange to industry and the underfunding of joint ventures in oil production. There have been conflicting signals about the government's intentions, particularly over the most contentious issue - foreign exchange policy. Some finance ministry officials and the Central Bank of Nigeria argue for deregulation. But Mr Aminu Saleh, a leading figure in the government, recently ruled out deregulation. Michael Holman, Africa Editor, adds: In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy, Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street value of the naira. In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence. The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000 (Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two years' imprisonment, or both. In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between N45 and N50 earlier this year. The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to over 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

0,FT933-5762 ,"FT933-5762 _AN-DIAB3AGIFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (9): Thrown into the deep end - Industry      By TONY HAWKINS   FEW yardsticks measure Africa's marginalisation better than its share of global manufacturing activity. In 1980, manufacturing value added (MVA) in sub-Saharan Africa totalled Dollars 12bn - 0.4 per cent of the global total if South Africa is excluded, or Dollars 30.5bn (1.1 per cent) including South Africa. Ten years later, in 1990, the region's share had slipped to 0.9 per cent; though if South Africa is left out, it remained at 0.4 per cent. By 1980, it had become clear that misguided, if well-intentioned, attempts to promote industrialisation had saddled the continent with a battery of inefficient, internationally uncompetitive manufacturing firms, many owned by governments. Since then, structural adjustment measures - especially trade liberalisation, tariff reform, exchange rate devaluation, deregulation, positive real interest rates and privatisation - have changed the rules of the game. Industries that grew up behind tariff walls and import controls - many of which should never have been established - were thrown into the deep end of global competition. Macroeconomic stability aside, the most important single factor in industrial adjustment has been establishing - and sustaining - competitive exchange rates. Given the size of the domestic market and high inflation, substantial devaluation has been necessary to re-establish competitiveness in both domestic and export markets. Also crucial is the simplification of import regimes to ensure that manufacturers importing raw materials or parts do not face bureaucratic hurdles and heavy import taxes. Critics of structural adjustment claim that the reform package implies de-industrialisation, destroying domestic capacity and favouring imports. World Bank researchers insist that there is no evidence for this, pointing out that in nine countries where macropolicies improved, manufacturing output grew substantially faster than before adjustment. Ultimately, though, there is only so much policymakers can achieve. Thereafter, it is up to private initiative and investment, which is where the problem arises. Abundant raw materials and low-cost labour are no longer enough. Technical and managerial skills, scientific and marketing know-how, prompt deliveries and high-quality products are essential, achieved primarily by foreign investment by global companies. In 1990, for instance, Singapore's manufacturing output was almost half that of the entire African continent, due in large part to the presence of some 3,000 affiliates and subsidiaries of multinationals. Unido figures show African productivity levels at about one tenth of those of north American manufacturers - the comparative figure for Asia is 18 per cent. But because average wages in Africa are less than 9 per cent of the north American level, as against 16 per cent in Asia, sub-Saharan producers still have a competitive edge on cost grounds. However, this is not enough; the key role of human capital cannot be exaggerated. In the 20 years to 1990, Africa's productivity rate - relative to north America - fell from 16 per cent to 10.5 per cent, while Asia raised productivity to 18 per cent from 12 per cent. But the most important factor in productivity is the region's low levels of investment in physical plant and in human capital. Government policy will help but the turnround in African industry will depend on the return of the foreign investors. So long as they remain scarce, so too will Africa's industrial capacity.

The effectiveness of the English criminal justice system has been seriously weakened by miscarriages of justice perpetrated at times of public outrage after horrible terrorist bombings. A series of vicious attacks by dogs two years ago produced the Dangerous Dogs Act which has failed to rid Britain of killer dogs but provided lawyers with work defining breeds. There is a similar peril in the present moral panic over the killing on Merseyside of a two-year-old boy, apparently by older children. The intense media coverage has led many to suppose that the UK has become engulfed in a tide of violent crime. Several recent news stories have been cheaply and misleadingly linked to suggest that children are at the forefront of the crimewave. Recorded crime rates have certainly risen, as in almost every other advanced economy. But fear of crime has risen much faster. And there is, sadly, nothing new about children killing other children - as those with memories long enough to remember the case of Mary Bell will know. Such considerations count for little, however, when politicians scent an issue of popular concern. The parties vie to demonstrate their commitment to ever-stronger measures, with little consideration of their efficacy. The prime minister is right to call for greater condemnation of violent crime. But his corollary of less effort to understand the criminal is exactly what is not needed. Much more work is required to examine the many factors which lie behind increased crime rates. These include unemployment, which has left pockets of deprivation in many large cities where crime is seen as the only way of acquiring material wealth. There is the failure of schools which send 40 per cent of students to further education colleges with inadequate numeracy and literacy skills, along with vocational training system still very much in the throes of uncertain reform. There is the erosion of the nuclear family, which provided two adults to share the burden of parenthood. And there is the question of violence in the media, which may create an impression that violence is the norm. There is also the easy availability of drugs, trafficking in which offers financial rewards way beyond those possible through hard work. Those attractions are enhanced at a time of few job opportunities for young people with no qualifications. There will be disagreements over the weight to be assigned to each of these and to many other relevant factors. But anyone who hopes to contribute to solutions must recognise that dealing with this complex issue needs multifaceted policies managed with skill and determination over long periods. That is the note the government needs to strike in the coming days.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P9229 Public Order and Safety, NEC.   Types:-  GOVT  Legal issues.

She had always wanted to learn to  read, but it was not until she was 40 years old that she got the courage to do  something about it.    While watching the movie ""Bluffing It,"" she was reminded of herself. She had  been bluffing it for 30 years. It was a handicap in everything she did. It  stopped her from going places, ordering in restaurants, reading her Bible,  personal letters, everything.    She tried public adult education, but because of the large class sizes, it  didn't work for her. Then she began attending volunteer classes offered by the  Central Orange County Literacy Council and, for the first time in her life, was  learning to read and write. She is now a nurse's aide.    The story of this Orange County woman has a happy ending, but not all Orange  County's illiterates are so fortunate. It is conservatively estimated that of  the more than 2.2 million people in Orange County, more than 100,000 adults are  functionally illiterate.    There are many different definitions of illiteracy. Is it a total inability to  read or write anything? Is it less than a fifth-grade reading level? Is it less  than an eighth-grade reading level?    When an individual's reading and writing abilities are inadequate for him to  function competently in today's print-oriented world, that individual is, for  all practical purposes, functionally illiterate.    The literacy requirements for today's high-tech civilization are well above  those of even a few decades ago. Many people with formerly adequate skills are  in a precarious position.    The problem remains hidden for most. Would you willingly admit to your best  friend -- never mind your boss -- that you can't do a particular job of paper  work because you can't read well enough? The stigma is too great.    Most illiterates' ways of hiding their problems serve them fairly well up to a  point. But what if they are offered a promotion involving more reading and  writing than they can handle? They are likely to find an excuse not to take it  or quit rather than reveal their ""terrible secret.""    Why can't these people read and write? Why didn't they learn as children as the  rest of us did?    Some children have trouble learning by the methods used in many schools. They  don't qualify for special help, and many classrooms are overcrowded. Some  children have undiagnosed hearing and vision problems. Because of difficulty at  home, some children do not learn. Some families move a great deal, and an  elementary school child can lose six months with each school change. Children  of migrant workers are especially hard hit. Some had illiterate parents who  passed on their indifference to the value of learning to their children.    Illiterate people come from a variety of social and educational backgrounds.  Some are economically secure and often have high school diplomas. Some are  regularly employed without diplomas and with low basic skills. Others are  irregularly employed with almost no marketable skills. As many as 80% of all  juveniles who appear in court are functionally illiterate, as are more than 65%  of incarcerated adults.    How can you recognize people who are low-level or non-readers? Their methods of  hiding their problem can be ingenious. They become very adept at memorizing.  Some excuses they use are: ""I'll have my wife look at the form."" ""I left my  glasses at home."" ""I don't have time to help my children with homework."" ""I  don't have time to read this form now."" ""My handwriting is bad.""    When referring a friend or acquaintance to a literacy class, focus on the  opportunity to improve his reading and writing, not to learn to read or write.  I would suggest you call the Central Orange County Literacy Center first to  verify hours, days and location before approaching the subject.    Be sensitive to the feelings of these low-level or non-reading individuals.  Treat the situation matter-of-factly and openly with a positive and supportive  attitude.

The story of this Orange County woman has a happy ending, but not all Orange  County's illiterates are so fortunate. It is conservatively estimated that of  the more than 2.2 million people in Orange County, more than 100,000 adults are  functionally illiterate.    There are many different definitions of illiteracy. Is it a total inability to  read or write anything? Is it less than a fifth-grade reading level? Is it less  than an eighth-grade reading level?    When an individual's reading and writing abilities are inadequate for him to  function competently in today's print-oriented world, that individual is, for  all practical purposes, functionally illiterate.    The literacy requirements for today's high-tech civilization are well above  those of even a few decades ago. Many people with formerly adequate skills are  in a precarious position.    The problem remains hidden for most. Would you willingly admit to your best  friend -- never mind your boss -- that you can't do a particular job of paper  work because you can't read well enough? The stigma is too great.    Most illiterates' ways of hiding their problems serve them fairly well up to a  point. But what if they are offered a promotion involving more reading and  writing than they can handle? They are likely to find an excuse not to take it  or quit rather than reveal their ""terrible secret.""    Why can't these people read and write? Why didn't they learn as children as the  rest of us did?    Some children have trouble learning by the methods used in many schools. They  don't qualify for special help, and many classrooms are overcrowded. Some  children have undiagnosed hearing and vision problems. Because of difficulty at  home, some children do not learn. Some families move a great deal, and an  elementary school child can lose six months with each school change. Children  of migrant workers are especially hard hit. Some had illiterate parents who  passed on their indifference to the value of learning to their children.    Illiterate people come from a variety of social and educational backgrounds.  Some are economically secure and often have high school diplomas. Some are  regularly employed without diplomas and with low basic skills. Others are  irregularly employed with almost no marketable skills. As many as 80% of all  juveniles who appear in court are functionally illiterate, as are more than 65%  of incarcerated adults.    How can you recognize people who are low-level or non-readers? Their methods of  hiding their problem can be ingenious. They become very adept at memorizing.  Some excuses they use are: ""I'll have my wife look at the form."" ""I left my  glasses at home."" ""I don't have time to help my children with homework."" ""I  don't have time to read this form now."" ""My handwriting is bad.""    When referring a friend or acquaintance to a literacy class, focus on the  opportunity to improve his reading and writing, not to learn to read or write.  I would suggest you call the Central Orange County Literacy Center first to  verify hours, days and location before approaching the subject.    Be sensitive to the feelings of these low-level or non-reading individuals.  Treat the situation matter-of-factly and openly with a positive and supportive  attitude.

The improvement was helped by a NKr258m gain from the disposal of assets, a stronger dollar, improved markets for tankers and dry bulk carriers, and lower interest payments. Mr Olav Geir Foss, director, forecast full-year pre-tax profits of about NKr400m, up from NKr278m in 1992. Earlier, the shipowner forecast operating profit in 1993 would rise to about NKr350m from NKr309m in 1992. Mr Foss said the value of the group's share and bond portfolios had also increased. Group freight revenue in the period rose to NKr1.21bn from NKr1.08bn as operating profit increased to NKr176m from NKr161m. Bona Shipholding, the group's tanker and dry bulk carrier operation, boosted first half operating profit to NKr67m from NKr21m. The advance was attributed to stable freight rates for oil products from North Africa to Europe and the US, and to higher rates for dry bulk cargoes such as grain, coal and phosphates. The group's car-carrier operation saw operating profit decline to NKr115m from NKr128m, mostly because of the disposal of two vessels and a weaker trend in the market.   Companies:-  Leif Hoegh.

0,FT944-2587 ,"FT944-2587 _AN-ELPB8ABEFT 941216   FT  16 DEC 94 / Nigeria under pressure to scrap economic controls      By PAUL ADAMS and MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor      LAGOS   A team from the International Monetary Fund has completed talks this week in Abuja with Nigeria's finance ministry less than three weeks before the military regime is due to review economic policy in the 1995 budget. General Sani Abacha, head of state, is under pressure from investors and official creditors to scrap the economic controls imposed in January and deal with the Dollars 8bn arrears in debt service to the Paris Club. Since early 1992 Nigeria has not serviced its debt to the Paris Club, which accounts for more than half its Dollars 28bn external debt. Nigeria needs some form of agreement with the IMF and a few months' good track record to gain external debt relief and unlock international finance for planned gas export projects. The fund is looking for significant steps to deregulate foreign exchange and interest rate policy, cut the budget deficit and account for all oil revenue. There is also continued concern about the estimated 150,000 barrels a day of oil revenue that goes into offshore dedication accounts under the supervision of the presidency and which never enters the government's books. The Nigerian government is being urged to curb uneconomic capital projects and recurrent spending and to find more revenue. Although the government forecast a balanced budget in 1994, economists believe the budget deficit this year will be more than Dollars 4bn, which is nearly 100 per cent of forecast expenditure and about 14 per cent of gross domestic product, despite the failure to meet commitments to supply foreign exchange to industry and the underfunding of joint ventures in oil production. There have been conflicting signals about the government's intentions, particularly over the most contentious issue - foreign exchange policy. Some finance ministry officials and the Central Bank of Nigeria argue for deregulation. But Mr Aminu Saleh, a leading figure in the government, recently ruled out deregulation. Michael Holman, Africa Editor, adds: In an unprecedented attempt to crack down on the country's black market in foreign currency and reinforce its controversial exchange rate policy, Nigeria's military government has made it an offence to disclose the street value of the naira. In a decree issued last week, the authorities warned that to 'publish or cause to be published exchange rates and interest rates other than that approved by the Central Bank' would be an offence. The penalty for individuals breaching the decree is a fine of N100,000 (Pounds 2,900 or Dollars 4,500) or two years' imprisonment, or both. In January the government pegged the foreign exchange rate at N22 to the dollar and closed the secondary or parallel market which allowed investors to bring in and change dollars at the open market rate, which was between N45 and N50 earlier this year. The government also capped bank lending rates at 21 per cent. Privately the government admits the measures have failed, with inflation rising to over 100 per cent on an annual basis, and the market rate of the Naira plunging from N50 to N100 between June and November this year as receipts from the country's exports failed to keep up with the demand for foreign currency.

Delivering his annual report in Pretoria, Mr Stals said it was clear the existing system would have to be scrapped to ensure sustainable, long-term growth for the country. 'In the long run and in the interest of future economic growth, South Africa must liberalise its foreign exchange market and revert to a system of unitary floating exchange rates,' he said. However, Mr Stals noted that in other countries exchange controls were abolished only as part of a macro-economic restructuring programme, often with the help of international institutions, and that at the very least South Africa must wait until it had full access to international capital markets. South Africa's two-tier currency comprises the commercial rand, used for all regular balance of payments transactions, and the financial rand, used by foreigners as a discounted investment currency. Exchange restrictions have been in place since the 1960s. 'The abolition of exchange controls in isolation without any supportive measures may cause serious disruptions in the initial phase of the transition and force the reintroduction of old controls, or even the application of other new direct controls over markets, all of which may be more damaging to the economy,' he said. South Africa has appointed Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, to help it get an international credit rating from the main agencies, a process expected to be completed by October. In addition, Mr Stals reiterated his previously stated preconditions for the scrapping of the financial rand, including a narrowing of the differential between the two exchange rates and a rise in foreign reserves, currently able to cover only five weeks' imports. In recent months, continued speculation over demise of the investment currency has led to severe gyrations in its exchange rate, while fears over the inflationary pressures such a move might unleash have contributed to soaring government bond rates. Responding to the recent upturn in the inflation rate, which rose in June to 7.5 per cent from a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, Mr Stals signalled that the Reserve Bank would probably have to tighten monetary policy to help lower inflationary expectations and cautioned the new government against trying to increase spending. 'Many of us have a desire to force-feed the economy beyond its actual potential and to exert pressure on the monetary system to accommodate these desires by simply creating more money,' he warned. Mr Stals also said that while he was confident the country's capital account would continue to improve, it would be 'naive' to believe that huge amounts of capital would flow into the country even if exchange controls were lifted. Social and political stability, economic viability, sound fiscal and monetary policies and productivity improvements were of even greater importance for most foreign investors.

0,FT921-4091 ,"FT921-4091 _AN-CCKB6AEEFT 920311   FT  11 MAR 92 / South African business swings behind a 'yes' vote      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICANS are wild about cricket, and ecstatic about their team's recent triumphs in the World Cup. But instead of hailing victory, yesterday's South African newspapers carried an advert picturing an overgrown cricket field with broken wickets and a torn ball. The message: a 'no' vote in next week's referendum will mean that South Africa will again be shut out of international sport. 'Without reform, South Africa hasn't got a sporting chance.' The full-page advert was funded, not by the ruling National party, but by South African business which is spending R3.4m (Pounds 680,000) to campaign for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on political reform next Tuesday. Some two thirds of the 'yes' camp's total advertising budget is coming from businessmen who fear that their chance of returning to world markets will be sabotaged, yet again, by politics. The political liberalisation of the past two years has already made a huge difference to the lives of most white businessmen. They have been welcomed abroad, where before they were shunned; they have glimpsed a light at the end of the 40-year tunnel of apartheid isolation. Now they are terrified that a vote in favour of reintroducing apartheid will provoke unprecedented international retribution. 'A 'no' vote would be a guarantee for disaster,' says Mr P F Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, one of the largest mining houses. He has written to white employees to urge a 'yes' vote. 'If we cannot sell our production because of re-imposed sanctions, both your job and my job will be threatened. If money flees the country, interest rates will be raised even higher and the recession will deepen. Unemployment will rise further with all its consequences ..like the crime and violence we are already experiencing and this will certainly worsen,' he argues in his letter. Mr Peter Mackenzie, director of the Private Sector Referendum Fund, insists the campaign is 'non party-political'. It was launched by one of the country's largest media groups, Times Media, and has had contributions from across the white bus-iness spectrum, not to mention offers of help from black business as well. Residual suspicion of white South Africa has hampered the fund's international campaign - the Toronto Globe and Mail refused to print an advert urging expatriate South Africans in Canada to vote 'yes'. The fund also bought billboards at the World Cup cricket grounds - matches are widely televised in South Africa - and distributed pro-reform T-shirts to fans. But the billboards were withdrawn when a rival group tried to purchase advertising for the 'no' camp. Mr Mackenzie says the campaign's adverts are about to become 'more dramatic and blunt'. The toughest advert so far had an ironic twist to it, though: it showed an operating table littered with used gauze and broken needles, and the message 'without reform, South Africa won't get better'. For many whites, those are the images associated with health care in independent African countries. Many believe they can avoid such a fate by reaffirming apartheid - not by voting 'yes' for reform.

0,FT931-663 ,"FT931-663 _AN-DC2BZACUFT 930329   FT  29 MAR 93 / US lectures on economic co-operation ring hollow      By EDWARD BALLS   US President Bill Clinton, nearly two thirds of the way through the first hundred days of his administration, has good reason to feel pleased. The budget package is making good progress through Congress, relations with the Federal Reserve appear cordial, long-term interest rates have fallen and the US economy is conveniently accelerating. In short, the domestic economic agenda looks under control. His only disappointment is the tardy pace at which the rest of the world is falling into line. Russian president Boris Yeltsin can hardly be blamed for his current plight, and the US, like the rest of the world, has little option but to mouth support and wait with crossed fingers. But other countries that do control their domestic policy agendas, notably Germany and Japan, appear less willing to follow the world leader's example. Undeterred, the Clinton administration has quickly adopted the standard US presidential practice of lecturing other countries on how to manage their affairs, with the US Treasury taking the lead on the lecture circuit. Germany, the G7 finance ministers were told, should cut its interest rates more rapidly in order to kick-start European demand (for US exports). Japan, senior Treasury officials publicly imply, should be using fiscal policy in a more aggressively expansionary way to stimulate Japanese demand (for US exports). Would-be recipients of aid and debt relief should liberalise their economies and open their markets (to US exports). Yet, while it is easy to see why the world's only superpower speaks its mind, it is less obvious that it has the moral right to do so. While lecturing other countries about their responsibilities, the world's richest nation continues to benefit from a huge net resource flow from the developed and developing world alike. At its peak in 1987, the net resource transfer to the US was Dollars 151.4bn (Pounds 106.6bn), of which over Dollars 70bn came from developing countries, equivalent to 2 per cent of developing country GDP. The cumulative flow since 1980 is a little over Dollars 980bn. The US might bridle at these statistics. The net resource flow (equivalent to the US current account deficit minus net interest, profits and dividends) is, after all, the product of millions of individual, private and voluntary decisions. Yet the US, by virtue of its size and economic power, can alter the incentives that private individuals face. Hence, the rise of the US fiscal deficit in the 1980s was, in part, responsible for the rise in world interest rates and the flood of capital into the US. This sharp rise in real interest rates encouraged US commercial banks to liquidate their third world lending to take advantage of the higher domestic returns, thus bringing on the debt crisis. Not that the US can take all the blame. While profligate US fiscal policy sucked resources in, mistaken domestic policies in many developing countries also drove resources towards the US. This was particularly true of Latin America and Africa for whom the stock of flight capital is estimated at a third to two thirds of annual GDP. For all its good intentions, the Clinton administration will continue to suck scarce resources towards the world's richest country. Its budget plans envisage a budget deficit of over 3 per cent of GDP by 1998 while the combination of a nascent recovery and persistently low US national savings will expand the current account deficit over the next year. It is the regional profile of America's capital donors, not the demand placed on them, that appears to be altering. Budget deficit-burdened Europe is now importing capital from the US, while eastern Europe is drawing on US savings. Meanwhile, economic reform and debt relief in Latin America has made the region a magnet for portfolio investment, capturing almost all of the 135 per cent (Dollars 4.7bn) increase in annual equity flows to developing counties over the past three years. This leaves an extraordinary alliance of Japan, east Asia and debt-burdened Africa to finance the world's largest, and least progressive, economic assistance programme.

0,FT933-27 ,"FT933-27 _AN-DI3C1AG1FT 930930   FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (18): Poverty in a class of its own - Development is hampered by the world's worst illiteracy level      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   AFTER years of neglect, India is beginning to take education seriously. But it will take many years to right the damage done to India's people, particularly the poor, by the long decades in which the ruling elites failed to make a priority of educating children. India has the doubtful distinction of having more illiterates than any other nation - almost half its population aged seven and over cannot read or write. About 20 per cent of all children never even enroll at school; 60 per cent of those who do drop out long before the end of basic education. Uneducated people have little chance of participating fully in the economic modernisation which Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, and his colleagues are pursuing. Worse, the lack of literacy could itself become a serious block to further progress. With the exception of the oil-rich Gulf countries, no state has achieved industrial take-off with literacy levels below 60 per cent. The economic success of China and other east Asian nations, which all made a priority of primary education, has finally persuaded many Indians that they cannot go on as before. Mr Arjun Singh, the minister for human resource development, whose brief includes education, says that in the past education did not get the attention which it should have done because India faced other pressing problems such as building its industrial base. 'Now that other needs have been satisfied, the highest priority has been given to getting over the backlog in education.' India's target is to achieve 100 per cent literacy by the year 2000. However, this target seems unrealistic because India does not seem ready to commit to primary education the resources necessary to teach reading and writing even to all its children - never mind to illiterate adults. India spends about 3.8 per cent of its gross national product on education, about the same as other low-income developing countries, including China. However, India directs a disproportionate amount of its education budget on universities and colleges for the children of its tiny upper and middle classes. Indian education officials often argue that the reason so few children attend school is that their parents prefer to send them to work. The families need the money the children can earn. Eimi Watanabe, the former head of the Unicef office in Delhi, rejects this argument. She says parents would send their children to school if only the education on offer was better and more relevant to their needs. 'The problem in education is poor supply not poor demand.' Particularly in northern India, where illiteracy is especially high, teachers are poorly trained, have inadequate materials, and face classes of up to 80 pupils. Ms Watanabe says it is little surprise that the parents take their children out of school. Even in the poorest regions, such as the eastern state of Bihar, there are dedicated officials and teachers, some of them volunteers. But generally, in northern India, the commitment to teaching the poor is weak. Take the example of one state-level education official who explained to the representative of an international aid agency how he was able to manage his budget in spite of increasing enrollments. He said: 'Because of literacy campaigns we have high initial enrollment but fortunately we have a high drop-out rate.' The underlying reasons for India's neglect of primary education are much in dispute. Professor Myron Wiener, a US academic and author of a study of Indian education, pins the blame on the caste system. He says that the upper castes have little interest in educating the lower castes because their own position at the top of the hierarchy might eventually come under threat. Mr Wiener's Indian critics say this is nonsense. Some of them retort by blaming the British Raj for limiting high-quality education to a small elite of middle-class Indians who were trained to serve their rulers. This established a tradition of limiting access to schooling which independent India followed. Literacy levels vary widely but are generally low in the north and high in the south. In the coastal state of Kerala they come close to 100 per cent. In Bihar in the north it is less than 40 per cent. Coastal regions generally do better than in-land districts probably because they have long been exposed through trade to different influences instead of being bound by traditional caste and other ties. Also the south is more literate than the north because Christian missionaries were particularly active there at an early date teaching reading and writing as a way of spreading their faith. Hindu and Moslem teachers responded in kind - channelling competition among the religions into education. In the north, where Christianity had much less impact, competition between Hindus and Moslems was primarily military. So schooling was less well developed. But the blame cannot entirely be pushed back into previous centuries. Mr Singh, the minister, admits that for well-intentioned reasons post-independence governments put a higher priority on industrialisation than on education. Unlike other socialist-inclined countries, including the Soviet Union and China, India neglected basic schooling and basic healthcare. Also, India deliberately excluded the World Bank and most other aid donors from education arguing that foreign money was better spent on concrete projects like dams. Only in the late 1980s, did Indian officials begin to see that they were cutting themselves off from important developments in education. Only this year is the World Bank finally funding its first educational project in India - a Dollars 300m teacher training programme in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. The picture is not altogether gloomy: as well as Kerala, which has long been seen as an exception in achieving early widespread literacy, other states are making progress, notably the relatively large southern state of Tamil Nadu, which this year pledged to build enough schools to make sure that one is within reach of every family. The state claims that 100 per cent of its six-year-olds are now enrolled. The literacy rate is 64 per cent. Unfortunately, India may still be moving too slowly towards widespread literacy. Without better education, particularly for women, it will be difficult to spread better health and hygiene standards and better knowledge of family planning. Without these, the population will carry on growing at 2 per cent a year. Eventually, millions of poor illiterates would swamp the economy, bringing growth to a grinding halt with a grave risk of widespread unrest. As Ms Watanabe says Indians are just beginning to realise the dangers. 'People are beginning to understand that education is a critical issue for population growth and economic development. They see that if they don't act they face a bleak future in the 21st century.'   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9441 Administration of Social and Manpower Programs.

Economists said yesterday that the country's four-year recession had probably ended in the middle of the year with the third-quarter GDP figures following growth rates of 1.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively in the previous two quarters. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, South Africa's largest life office, joked: 'We're combining Asian growth rates with G-7 inflation]' The GDP figures were better than expected, though recent figures on retail sales, manufacturing production and car sales had hinted at an upturn. Most companies that have reported recently say they expect little meaningful growth before the second half of next year. As with the previous two quarters, most growth sprang from an improvement in agricultural production which grew at an annualised rate of 196 per cent. One feature was the 2 per cent annualised increase in non-farm GDP. Mr Mohr said it was the first time since 1988 that the economy had gone for three quarters without substantial negative growth on the non-farm side. Manufacturing growth was 5.5 per cent. The recovery remains fragile, with the Central Statistical Service (CSS) pointing out yesterday that the average level of the total seasonally adjusted real GDP for the first nine months of 1993 was 0.4 per cent below the equivalent figure a year ago, an indication of the low base from which these quarterly growth rates were achieved. Mr Mohr said the inflation figure confirmed inflation was probably lower than originally thought and economists were revising their forecasts downward. Consumer inflation was likely to average about 9.5 per cent in 1993 and would be lower in 1994.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

By Barbara Neder, Neder is administrator of the Los Angeles Times Reading Lab,  an employee and community literacy project. She tutored Steve at the Downey  City Library for three years.      Steve was in his early 50s. He had come to the library seeking help with  reading. His 4-year-old son asked him to read stories and he couldn't. Steve  said he had ""screwed up"" with his children from his first marriage -- children  all grown now -- and he couldn't bluff his way along with this little boy.    After a few years with a tutor, a variety of ""fill-in-the-blank"" workbooks,  phonics drills and a string of ""high-low"" books with juvenile covers, Steve  grew frustrated. One evening in the library, he said in disgust, ""I want to  read a real book!"" Steve's strong determination to improve his skills was  hampered by a scarcity of appropriate literature.    To help fill this void for the thousands of new adult readers like Steve,  editors Catherine Lipkin and Virginia Solotaroff have developed a new literary  series, ""The Words on the Page, the World in Your Hands."" The series is three  volumes of fiction, poetry and memoirs by an impressive list of 76 contemporary  writers, including Shirley Kaufman, Alice Walker, A. R. Ammons, Peter Meinke,  Karl Shapiro, Thomas Disch and Joyce Carol Oates.    Lipkin and Solotaroff, both actively involved in adult literacy programs in New  York, solicited and received overwhelming support of hundreds of published  writers. The contributions are not ""written down"" to readers, but rather  ""written to them."" Some are selected excerpts from published works, others are  original, and some are carefully adapted by their authors, ""without sacrificing  flavor, point or power.""    The series, however, isn't exclusively for adults learning to read. It also is  an invitation to another segment of the population whose numbers are countless  -- the aliterates: those who know how to read, are well-educated, and whose  priorities have become other than reading for pleasure.

By Barbara Neder, Neder is administrator of the Los Angeles Times Reading Lab,  an employee and community literacy project. She tutored Steve at the Downey  City Library for three years.      Steve was in his early 50s. He had come to the library seeking help with  reading. His 4-year-old son asked him to read stories and he couldn't. Steve  said he had ""screwed up"" with his children from his first marriage -- children  all grown now -- and he couldn't bluff his way along with this little boy.    After a few years with a tutor, a variety of ""fill-in-the-blank"" workbooks,  phonics drills and a string of ""high-low"" books with juvenile covers, Steve  grew frustrated. One evening in the library, he said in disgust, ""I want to  read a real book!"" Steve's strong determination to improve his skills was  hampered by a scarcity of appropriate literature.    To help fill this void for the thousands of new adult readers like Steve,  editors Catherine Lipkin and Virginia Solotaroff have developed a new literary  series, ""The Words on the Page, the World in Your Hands."" The series is three  volumes of fiction, poetry and memoirs by an impressive list of 76 contemporary  writers, including Shirley Kaufman, Alice Walker, A. R. Ammons, Peter Meinke,  Karl Shapiro, Thomas Disch and Joyce Carol Oates.    Lipkin and Solotaroff, both actively involved in adult literacy programs in New  York, solicited and received overwhelming support of hundreds of published  writers. The contributions are not ""written down"" to readers, but rather  ""written to them."" Some are selected excerpts from published works, others are  original, and some are carefully adapted by their authors, ""without sacrificing  flavor, point or power.""    The series, however, isn't exclusively for adults learning to read. It also is  an invitation to another segment of the population whose numbers are countless  -- the aliterates: those who know how to read, are well-educated, and whose  priorities have become other than reading for pleasure.

0,FT944-6725 ,"FT944-6725 _AN-EK1C5AFOFT 941128   FT  28 NOV 94 / Survey of Pakistan (16): Labour force of 10m children - Need for social progress      By TIM BURT   Pakistan's record on social welfare is visible on almost every street corner. Malnourished children wait at traffic-lights to beg from motorists or sell newspapers which they will never read. In rural areas, many work the land or provide labour in rice mills and brick kilns, writes Tim Burt. In Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province, children as young as six work in the kilns, mixing mud and filling brick casts. Impoverished families - most earning less than Rs2,000 a month - cannot spare their children for school and send them to work as patheras, 'the brick makers.' A survey of 20 kilns by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) found almost 400 school-age children at work. In a damning indictment of a country where the labour force includes 10m children under the age of 15, Unicef says it was startled by the 'high rate of illiteracy, lack of family planning, exposure to health hazards, inadequate or total lack of medical facilities, deplorable sanitation and a general impression of being bonded to this way of life.' Those problems are not confined to child labour. They are endemic in poorer parts of Pakistan. The 1994 Human Development Index, compiled by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), ranks Pakistan behind neighbouring countries in many of the key measures of social progress. Its annual population growth exceeds that of India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. Its performance, moreover, in school enrolment, adult literacy and the percentage of people in work also lags behind, while access to health and sanitation facilities are among the worst in the region. Addressing the international conference on population and development earlier this year, Ms Benazir Bhutto admitted: 'Pakistan cannot progress if it cannot check its rapid population growth.' That is a tall order for a country where the population has grown from 50m in 1960 to 128m today, and is set to double by the year 2017. Anxious to improve Pakistan's standing on human development, the Bhutto government has embraced and extended an ambitious Social Action Programme (SAP), launched last year by the government of Nawaz Sharif following mounting pressure from international donors and aid agencies. Over five years, the programme envisages Dollars 7.7bn being spent on initiatives to curb population growth, improve primary education, health care, rural water supplies and sanitation. In the first three years, the government plans to build more than 32,000 schools, improve teacher training and ensure that teachers stay in rural areas where demand is greatest. It also aims to revamp health education and train female paramedics. A village-level initiative on family planning is also under way to encourage contraception. Only a small number of villagers have access to safe sanitation and clean water. Public bodies have a poor record in maintaining water services, so control of new schemes will be transfered to local communities. Hailing the programme as a step forward, Ms Bhutto says it will 'educate and motivate our people to a higher standard of living.' Some international aid agencies are not so sure. They claim the programme is too narrow and the government will have few resources to fund its commitment while military expenditure remains at 6 per cent of gross national product - the highest figure in the sub-continent - and debt servicing continues to drains its reserves. 'I haven't seen any evidence of political groups being interested in far-reaching social change,' says a senior aid agency official in Islamabad. 'Pakistan is not addressing land reform, women's rights or defence spending.' Such officials want the SAP to become a community-based reform programme focused particularly on educating women, who take primary responsibility for family health care and education. Female literacy in Pakistan is among the lowest in the world at 20 per cent, and fewer than one-in-five girls complete even primary education - 'building more schools is irrelevant. The problems are more basic than that,' says Dr Tariq Banuri, head of the Sustainable Development Policy Institute. 'We need to develop a cohesive village-based education system. It can't be done through centralised management.' His view is echoed by Mr Jim Mayrides, head of the Unicef mission in Islamabad, who says female literacy is the key to improvements in basic healthcare and hygiene. 'If they could read and write, it would help spread the message of how to treat diarrhoea and respiratory infection.' Eradicating those two ailments alone would cut infant morality by more than 60 per cent. 'The political will is there to improve things, but there is a paralysis in the bureaucracy and the changes are very slow,' says Mr Mayrides. Failure to address these issues could prompt widespread social discontent - 'if the rural people were to become aware of the resistance in Malakand and Karachi it could prompt disorder elsewhere,' says Dr Banuri. 'The risk is complete breakdown in the community.' The government, however, claims the SAP - partly funded by a Dollars 200m World Bank loan - deserves praise for at least promising to upgrade basic services in rural areas, where some 24m people are living in absolute poverty. This poses a dilemma for the aid agencies. They have no wish to derail the programme but they want to broaden its scope to a 10-year horizon, with day-to-day management of the initiatives transferred from local politicians to new community groups. 'These issues are not susceptible to a quick fix,' says Mr Philip Regan, deputy resident representative of the UNDP in Islamabad. 'More people can be trained, more buildings put up. But they won't have an impact until the long-term problems are addressed.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 COMPARATIVE PROFILES OF HUMAN DEVELOPMENT  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Pakistan     India    Bangladesh   Sri Lanka  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Life expectancy          58.3 yrs   59.7 yrs    52.2 yrs    71.2 yrs Annual GDP per capita    Dollars     Dollars    Dollars     Dollars                           400         330         220         500 Annual population growth  2.9%        2.2%        2.7%        1.8% Health expenditure*       3.4%        6.0%        3.2%        3.7% Education enrolment**      24%         50%         32%         68% Adult literacy             36%         50%         37%         89% Labour force***            28%         38%         47%         41%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *As percentage of GDP. **Aged 6-23. ***As percentage of total population  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: UNDP Human Dev.

But at  least, at long last, literacy is getting national attention, in part through  the efforts of First Lady Barbara Bush.    The clinic was established five years ago and since has worked one-on-one with  about 130 children and adults. Anecdotes abound: the boy who was thought not to  be educable who, after attending the clinic, enrolled in a college prep  program; the now-bookish 8-year-old girl whose parents thought she would be  illiterate, and many more.    But individual success stories are not all UCI had in mind when the clinic was  established, as it turns out. UCI saw the clinic's mission as conducting  research in literacy and helping to train would-be teachers and medical  professionals. It also was thought initially that the clinic would reach out  into the community to serve thousands of reading-impaired students. After  review, UCI decided there were other programs that, on balance, were a higher  priority.    In its first few years, founder and coordinator Ann Kaganoff tackled the job of  getting the clinic on its feet, including finding a place off-campus, at Rancho  San Joaquin Intermediate School in Irvine, for it to operate. She also worked  with others around the state who either operated clinics or wanted to establish  them.    In hindsight, Kaganoff, who also is on UCI's teacher education faculty,  probably should have concentrated more on developing teacher training programs.  And there should have been more emphasis on researching and writing articles on  the clinic's findings regarding literacy, to put the clinic more in step with  the university's primary missions.    Kaganoff says she should have sought more grants. Most of the clinic's $100,000  budget has come from client fees and fund-raisers. But UCI's contribution --  $25,000 a year for Kaganoff's half-time position plus some other expenses -- is  essential to the clinic.    These are tough budgetary times in which UCI, like many institutions, must set  priorities. Some programs, even important ones, may have to yield to other  needs.

He pledged that China will continue its efforts at  population  control by sticking to its family planing policy; those efforts  help develop the economy and improve people's daily lives.    And other Asian nations should formulate their own  strategies. But their plans need to be developed according to  individual characteristics, he said in a written statement to an  Asian Pacific population seminar.    The question of population is a question of development in  essence, the Premier added, and can only be tackled at its root  according to each country's natural conditions, tradition and  economic level.    The 10th Asian Parliamentarians Meeting on Population and  Development is seeking solutions to Asian population problems.    More than 50 parliamentarians and scholars from 17 nations  were drawn to the two-day seminar, organized by the Asian  Population and Development Association (APDA) based in Japan and  the Education, Science, Culture and Public Health Committee  (ESCPH) of the National People's Congress of China. At the  opening of the meeting, APDA Chairman Fukusaburo Maeda said  controlling Asia's population is a decisive global issue. Its  populace is expected to top 3.34 billion people this year.    It has six of the 10 most populated countries in the world:  China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Japan and Bangladesh.    Maeda praised China's efforts to contain its birth rate, an  ""unmatched success in population policy while proceeding with  rapid economic growth.""    The population by the end of last year was 1.18 billion,  according to the newly published statistics.    The birth rate fell from 33.43 per thousand in 1970 --  before  family planning -- to 18.09 in 1993. And natural population  growth has continued its fall, from 14.55 per thousand in 1981  down to last years 11.45.    Without the policy 15 million more babies would have been  born over the past five years.    Maeda said quick solutions to overpopulation in Asia would  help ensure domestic stability.    Analysts recommended controlling the birth rate eradicating  poverty, creating sufficient food and job opportunities,  improving education standards, literacy rates and living  conditions.    Chinese ESCPH Chairman Zhao Dongwan said that the nation's  ultimate goal is to educate and explain to the people why family  planning is so important. That way, he said, future generations  will carry on the practice on their own.    He admitted that obstacles to China's development and  population quality still exist, including economic and social  development, resource utilization and environmental protection.    China, by sharing problems of unbalanced population problems  and socio-economic development with other developing Asian  countries, needs to strengthen cooperations with them to further  contain its expansion of population.    Also yesterday, NPC Standing Committee Chairman Qiao Shi,  parliamentary leader, met with the Asia-Pacific parliamentarians  and scholars at the Great Hall of the People.     "

She is also a volunteer literacy tutor  and serves on several literacy task forces.      Unlike those who rebuke without offering solutions, Mike Rose produces a  statement of hope in ""Lives on the Boundary."" Rose weaves a tapestry, gleaning  from his own learning experiences and those of other's whose lives have  intersected his.    Rose, associate director of the UCLA writing program, describes his book as  ""vignette and commentary, reflection and analysis."" It is an ""engagement with  language,"" an examination of people who have been labeled failures, an  exploration of the process becoming literate, and a rite of passage for Rose  himself into the academic world.    Rose immediately confronts the ""back to basics"" cry for a return to drills on  parts of speech, grammar rules, spelling and diagraming sentences.

0,FT933-217 ,"FT933-217 _AN-DI3C1ABRFT 930930   FT  30 SEP 93 / Clarke faces chorus of opposition to tax rises      By NEIL BUCKLEY and DAVID OWEN   BUSINESS leaders, retailers, and MPs united yesterday to warn that extending indirect taxes could be disastrous for consumers, industry and the government. Their comments followed remarks by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on Monday in which he clearly hinted that any tax increases in the Budget would be on spending rather than incomes. But Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said that, while the British economy was growing, 'recovery is patchy and still fragile. We need a Budget for investment.' The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of UK retailers, has written to Mr Clarke and says it is 'completely opposed to any extension of the VAT base'. Many retailers, including Argos and Sears, have warned that increases could damage consumer spending. They also fear that the move of the Budget to November could devastate Christmas trading. Extending VAT onto exempt products such as children's clothing, basic foods, and books was seen as highly emotive. 'VAT on children's clothes is nothing less than a tax on the growth of our children, and that is immoral,' said Mr Bryan Green, executive director of the National Childrenswear Association, representing manufacturers and retailers. Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director of Asda, said: 'I can't believe Mr Clarke would want to be remembered as the man who put tax on a bottle of milk.' Mr Tim Godfrey of the Booksellers Association warned that imposing VAT on books would be a tax on reading. 'Economists predict consumer sales of books would fall by at least 15 per cent. That would mean there would be fewer books around, fewer books in the home, and standards of literacy would deteriorate.' Booksellers and publishers have launched the Books Add Value campaign to lobby MPs in the next few weeks . Increases in excise duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol were also strongly opposed. Mr John Cryne, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, called for members to write to MPs demanding a cut in beer duty. He says duty has risen 37 per cent since 1979, while consumption has fallen 15 per cent. 'Britain's beer drinkers are being hammered into the ground by tax rates that threaten the future of breweries and pubs,' he said. The chancellor's comments sparked an immediate reaction from rightwing Conservative MPs. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said higher taxation would be absolutely devastating for the Conservative party. 'The way to deal with this problem is not by more taxation but by the government cutting public spending in Whitehall and the town halls.' Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said increasing taxes would be 'a breach of faith with the British public.' Lord Howe, the former Conservative chancellor who raised VAT to 15 per cent in his first Budget, said it was 'right in principle to prefer taxes on expenditure to taxes on income'. But he added: 'When you begin putting it into practice, it becomes a great deal less popular and a great deal more difficult.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT942-15465 ,"FT942-15465 _AN-EDOC4AA7FT 940415   FT  15 APR 94 / Brighter outlook for third world: World Bank projection      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The World Bank is projecting a much brighter economic outlook for developing countries over the next decade, despite prospects of slower growth in the industrialised nations. 'The international economic environment is likely to be more favourable for developing countries as a whole during the 1990s than it has been in the last 20 years,' said Mr Michael Bruno, chief economist at the Washington-based development institution. 'Developing countries are projected to grow at a rate of 4.8 per cent per annum during the coming decade, considerably higher than the 3 per cent per annum recorded during the 1980s,' Mr Bruno said. Although growth in the industrialised countries has in the past had a large spillover effect on the rest of the world, the World Bank says in its annual assessment of global economic prospects, published yesterday, that the modest growth rates of 2.5 to 3 per cent likely in Europe, North America and Japan over the next decade need not hold back the developing nations. Mr Bruno said lower real interest rates, higher flows of private capital into the developing countries, fast growing world trade and a stabilisation of real commodity prices should create a more favourable environment for the developing countries. He warned, however, that generally strong growth could disguise severe disparities between regions and countries: while east Asia would probably continue to fare well, even modest improvements in growth rates were still likely to leave more people in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa. East Asia's growth over the next decade is likely to be less spectacular than in the past, because the region will encounter infrastructural bottlenecks and environmental constraints. Nevertheless, growth rates in the region are likely to average more than 7 per cent a year. South Asia already improved its economic performance in the 1980s, and steady growth rates of around 5.3 per cent a year are projected for the next 10 years, while growth in Latin America and the Caribbean could accelerate to 3.4 per cent a year. Sub-Saharan Africa has an opportunity for modest acceleration of growth rates to 3.9 per cent a year, especially if the continent's civil wars abate. Nevertheless, the World Bank concludes, 'limited stock of capital equipment, infrastructure and human capital preclude any sharp improvement in living standards'. Mr Bruno said that much of the downside risk for the developing countries came from the possibility that the industrialised countries would falter in their efforts to tackle their budget deficits and to undertake supply side reforms, causing higher interest rates, lower growth and protectionist pressures.

IT TEACHES THEM TO READ, WRITE AND USE COMPUTERS TOO.      By JULIA RUBIN, ASSOCIATED PRESS      DENVER      The Denver Rescue Mission, the oldest relief agency in the city, isn't  interested in just feeding, clothing and saving the souls of the down and out.  It wants them to read, write and understand computers too.    Inside the red-brick building with the blue ""Jesus Saves"" sign over the door,  director Del Maxfield is trying to redefine the goals of a shelter for the  homeless as well as the needs of the men who seek help there.    The latest innovation is a computer-based program for functionally illiterate  adults. It is part of ""a new sophistication of the old urban missions"" in  response to changes in the makeup of the growing homeless population in  America, Maxfield said.    In the past, he said, shelters were thought to be doing their job by providing  a roof, a prayer and a meal for hobos and alcoholics.    The new homeless are ""people who are economically distressed, abused, people  from broken families"" who need more, he said. ""It's a very complex world of  homelessness out there.""    In appearance, the Denver Rescue Mission, founded in 1893, reveals little of  its new-wave approach. It sits on a run-down corner a few blocks east of  Denver's skyscrapers. Weeds poke out of the sidewalk and curbs. At mealtimes,  lines of ragged men wait at the front door, as always.    Inside, though, a clinic provides free medical, dental and eye care. It gave  away more than 1,000 pairs of glasses last year. And not only does it teach  literacy, but computer literacy as well.    Its computer room, in the basement, contains three terminals and file cabinets  and bookshelves crammed with computer-course materials. The materials include  science, math, Bible studies and geography as well as basic reading, writing  and spelling.    On a recent day at the mission, two men sat in the computer room, one studying  computers and the other Spanish, specialized skills for, they hope, specialized  jobs.    One of the men, Mike, 27, had come to the shelter a month earlier from Dallas  after losing his job as a truck driver because of ""personal problems."" He has a  high school equivalency diploma and is studying computer programming in hopes  of applying for college soon. Some others who study at the shelter have only an  elementary-school education.    Mike said he came to Denver to find ""a new beginning, a fresh start,"" and  showed up at the mission for a meal. He now spends about five hours a week with  the computers and works in various jobs at the mission about 42 hours a week.    He wants to become a counselor or perhaps a pastor, he said. ""It's been a dream  for a few years,"" he said. ""I guess I didn't have enough confidence to make an  effort at it.""    The mission provides 140 beds for homeless people for up to 10 nights and feeds  about 450 people a day, but Mike is one of 28 ""program men."" These are men who  live at the mission and are enrolled in its rehabilitation program. They must  spend at least two hours a week at the computers and show a commitment to  staying free of drugs and alcohol.    One shelter resident, who had some knowledge of computers before he came to the  shelter, landed a job with a pharmaceutical company after less than a month in  the program, said Aaron Mossman, coordinator of the new literacy program.    Working at computers can be a positive experience for people who lead  ""negative"" lives, Mossman said.    ""It's simple, but it's positive. They sit, push a button and something happens.  They've just succeeded three times. They begin to build positive mental  attitudes that 'I can,' "" he said.    The word ""homeless"" doesn't begin to describe the people who need help from the  mission, Maxfield said. There are those who are literally without homes, he  said, and then there are those he calls ""the poor and needy,"" who may have a  home but no food, or are in imminent danger of becoming homeless.    ""One of the things that we have lacked is knowing what these people want to do  in life,"" Maxfield said. ""We're trying to find a way to test these people, see  how they're wired, so we can send them down a road of success instead of more  failure.""    Maxfield, who worked for 24 years in the aerospace industry before leaving to  get a master's degree in divinity, came to the Denver Rescue Mission from the  Fuller Seminary in California. He has, he said, an ingrown awareness of the  value of education. ""I'm a high school dropout myself. I had to learn that a  formal education was important. I've had some tough times of my own.    ""When I got here, I noticed that people would fake reading the Bible and the  hymnals. I discovered that a lot of these people couldn't read.""    So he, along with the chairman of the shelter's board, Roy O. Howell, a retired  schoolteacher, and other volunteer educators began a tutoring program to help  the shelter's wards earn high school equivalency diplomas.    Then, a year ago, Maxfield visited Accelerated Christian Education Inc. in  Dallas to take a look at its computer-oriented education courses for schools.  He worked with ACE to develop similar programs for adults, from the illiterate  to those in need of refresher courses. The resulting program began at the  mission a few months ago.    The literacy program and other courses are financed entirely by donations,  Maxfield said. In 1988, the Denver Rescue Mission reported revenues of  $717,000, all of it from donations and interest. The shelter probably has  invested at least $6,000 so far in the literacy program, Maxfield said.    Maxfield believes in taking the mission to the streets as well. He said many  cannot leave their camps in railroad yards or under viaducts because they are  afraid of being robbed. This doesn't faze Maxfield. He said he developed street  smarts during a previous job as a chaplain in the Los Angeles County jail  system.    The mission also has a truck that collects unused food from Denver-area  supermarkets and drops it off in poor neighborhoods. And it has a farm in  northern Colorado where interested shelter residents can get away from city  pressures and help grow food for the shelter.    Now Maxfield is expanding the mission to include a shelter and  vocational-training center for women in a building being renovated nearby. It  is scheduled to open in January.    Maxfield hopes that the computers ultimately will be used not only for  educational and vocational training, but for personal development.    Such as?    ""How to balance a checkbook,"" he said.

0,FT941-10643 ,"FT941-10643 _AN-EBHC6AG0FT 940208   FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets: Signals point in opposite directions      By MICHAEL MORGAN   Friday's announcement from Mr Alan Greenspan that the Federal Reserve was tightening US monetary policy came at the end of a week which had seen sharp rises in world equity markets. South Africa led the way as the political outlook improved and foreign investors began to return. In Asia, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Japan put in impressive performances, as did Finland and Italy in Europe. Developments in Washington during last week had left strategists in little doubt that US rates were about to rise. But there were striking differences in their views on the likely consequences and on the game plans that investors should adopt. On Thursday, Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson wrote: 'In the US, Alan Greenspan could not have been clearer. He regards 3 per cent as an excessively low interest rate which has served its purpose to eliminate the banking crisis and alleviate the credit crunch. The Fed does not care what headline inflation is, rates are heading higher soon.' Mr Edwards' response was to repeat the message he has been sending since November 4: 'Hold cash.' But at Goldman Sachs, Mr Sushil Wadhwani thought it unlikely that the global bull run would end when US rates began to rise: 'Evidence suggests that individual investors are slow to react to changes in interest rates. Looking at the last three troughs in rates, individual ownership of equities continued to rise even after interest rates had started to rise . . . Historically, individuals typically will only have made 10 per cent of the total eventual adjustment to a given change in interest rates after six months.' Mr Wadhwani argued that individual investors had still not fully adjusted their portfolios to the decline in interest rates that had already occurred. Consequently, even if rates began to rise, it was likely that ownership of equities would continue to increase over the next year. He added that even if individual investors did not sell equities when interest rates began to rise, share prices might, nevertheless, fall because other investors mistakenly believed that individuals were about to sell. 'We would view such price weakness as a buying opportunity,' he wrote, a view he was reiterating yesterday.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    % change   % change              % change in local currency*          sterling* in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week   4 Weeks    1 Year  Start of  Start of   Start of                                              1993      1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.12     +3.15    +43.64    +46.90    +38.45     +36.42 Belgium       +0.39     +0.77    +26.27    +35.74    +28.05     +26.17 Denmark       +0.70     +5.81    +37.82    +56.28    +47.67     +45.50 Finland       +5.21    +14.25   +126.95   +137.91   +128.47    +125.14 France        +0.73     +1.92    +31.66    +32.99    +26.56     +24.70 Germany       +0.40     -2.69    +32.04    +37.75    +30.44     +28.52 Ireland       +0.09     +0.08    +53.53    +68.59    +51.32     +49.09 Italy         +4.11    +14.12    +39.67    +58.89    +41.28     +39.20 Netherlands   +1.03     +1.63    +39.93    +45.66    +38.32     +36.29 Norway        +1.74     +7.70    +56.01    +59.98    +50.67     +48.46 Spain         +1.05     +8.52    +44.56    +62.92    +34.73     +32.76 Sweden        +1.43     +5.53    +58.51    +54.14    +41.01     +38.93 Switzerland   +0.78     +4.13    +50.69    +54.12    +58.57     +56.23 UK            +0.85     +1.24    +22.79    +24.84    +24.84     +23.01 EUROPE        +0.98     +2.23    +32.35    +36.62    +32.11     +30.17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +3.61     +6.58    +47.72    +44.89    +52.88     +50.64 Hong Kong     +5.58     +8.16   +113.65   +122.01   +125.83    +122.52 Japan         +5.51     +8.38    +23.92    +23.43    +44.70     +42.58 Malaysia      +6.74     -3.66   +105.23   +111.22   +102.66     +99.69 New Zealand   +3.77     +8.50    +61.75    +60.44    +81.00     +78.34 Singapore     +3.93     -1.04    +56.08    +62.96    +70.84     +68.34  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        -0.90     +0.01    +25.60    +25.40    +21.77     +19.98 USA           -1.86     -0.02     +4.02     +7.31     +8.91      +7.31 Mexico        +4.48     +5.73    +70.57    +56.95    +60.05     +57.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  +7.05     -1.67    +53.35    +63.76    +83.48     +80.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.43     +3.11    +20.07    +22.62    +28.26     +26.39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on February 4th 1994.

Mr Ryrie, speaking at a conference chaired by Mr Babacar Ndiaye, president of the African Development Bank, said achieving the target figure of 15 per cent of GDP was 'doubtful at best'. 'In most countries, even with the best will and the best policies, it will probably be the first decade of the 21st century before we begin to see real results - that is to say steadily rising private investment, sustained higher rates of growth and job creation', he added. Mr Ryrie said the IFC, the private sector arm of the World Bank, was investing approximately Dollars 200m a year in about 35 companies in sub-Saharan Africa. He estimated that projects in which the IFC had recently participated accounted for around 10 per cent of total private investment, domestic and foreign, in the region. Much of the IFC finance has gone into a few large investments, he acknowledged. 'What is lacking is a flow of medium-sized investments in manufacturing businesses,' Mr Ryrie said. He said private investment in sub-Saharan Africa has been running at about Dollars 8bn a year, with foreign private investment contributing less than Dollars 1bn a year. Net official development assistance to the region between 1980-89 had been Dollars 105bn, or about Dollars 30 per capita each year. He said the flow of aid had 'no parallel in history' but standards of living had continued to fall.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Figures released by the Central Statistical Service (CSS) show that the rate of inflation, measured by the consumer price index, declined to 9.6 per cent in December from 11 per cent in November. This is the lowest rate of inflation since June 1978. The CPI declined by five percentage points in the second half of 1992, having stood at 16.2 at the end of 1991. Economists have long been predicting a further drop in interest rates, and the most recent inflation figures have bolstered their case. Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said yesterday that the bank was re-examining its monetary policy - often a signal for a cut in rates. The prime lending rate currently stands at 17.25 per cent. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual group, said the decline in the inflation rate, which was sharper than predicted, was partly a function of large increases in the CPI in the second half of 1991, and partly the result of very small increases in the corresponding period in 1992. He cited lower meat and vegetable prices, and falling mortgage rates as important contributory factors. Other factors include a fairly strong exchange rate, and firm monetary policy with real interest rates now running at about 7.5 per cent. Mr Mohr said inflation, which is a lagging indicator, reflected the weak state of the economy for most of 1992.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the 21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday morning before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent. Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks, fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists estimate that the recent rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Pounds 181m-Pounds 272m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17 per cent of the total budget. Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary officials are publicly committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency, a move that will almost certainly send short term interest rates rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. As a result, the currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second guess the financial authorities.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT934-7735 ,"FT934-7735 _AN-DKRC7AGTFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (19): In search of recognition - Philip Gawith discusses foreign investment      By PHILIP GAWITH   AFTER the isolation years, South Africa's business community is enjoying being back in the fold, hoping the world will want to lend to the country, trade with it and, above all, invest in it. First prize would be a headline investment of the 'IBM to build Dollars 1bn plant' variety. Clearly the optimists are going to be disappointed, for the time being. First, the world has changed. Before isolation, the eastern bloc and China were no-go zones and the Pacific Dragons had barely entered the business lexicon. Nor had South America embarked upon widespread financial liberalisation. Change in all of these areas has opened a host of markets competing for the multinational investment dollar. Second, save for special cases - such as investment flowing from the recent issue of cellular telephone licences - it is unlikely any significant investments will be made until it is clear South Africa has achieved a stable transition. This is not, however, to say that nothing is happening. On the contrary, there is a ferment of activity. Examples include: Alfa Romeo is again selling cars in South Africa and Volvo will soon be doing so: IBM is probably going to return through an investment in a local distributor; Hoechst has expanded its operation by paying R70m for a polyester fibre plant; Foodcorp has signed a deal with Pillsbury; Lufthansa has added an extra flight and is flying on a daily basis; ferrochrome producers Samancor and Nippon Denko have formed a joint venture, while Mitsui will distribute some of Sasol's chemicals in Japan and Korea. The list goes on. So, while the headline investment may be absent, the incremental internationalisation of the corporate scene is proceeding apace. The main trend to be observed is as obvious as it is understandable: companies want to establish a presence, but without any significant equity commitment. As Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented recently in Washington: 'They're offering us their services, not their money.' The deals one is hearing about are thus in distribution, licensing and franchising. At issue here is not only the question of who will come, but how they will do it. Any future government is sure to have a very strong commitment to black economic advancement, a process that many US investors, in particular, are likely to want to support. Given the underdeveloped state of black business in South Africa, franchising (sectors with strong potential include hair care salons and fast food outlets) and joint ventures are the most logical routes of assisting this process. There are, for example, many small black business contractors, but often they will lack access to credit to buy materials and have non-existent financial or administative systems. The process of finding partners, however, will not be easy. Despite years of activity in this field, the US embassy is still not in a position to offer a list of potential partners. According to the Reserve Bank, at the end of 1992 total investment in South Africa by foreign residents amounted to approximately Dollars 30bn. This included repayable debt of about Dollars 18bn and about Dollars 12bn of South African corporate equities and bonds issued by government and other public and private sector borrowers. About half of the latter sum is 'direct' investment - in South African subsidiaries and branches of foreign companies - with the other half being invested by non-residents in rand denominated paper ('portfolio' investment). During the sanctions years, South Africa experienced a net outflow of foreign investment from the country as many companies, especially US ones, disinvested. The stock of US fixed investment in South Africa shrunk as a result by a third, to roughly Dollars 1bn and 110 companies. Although some UK and European companies also left, most stayed and already have a presence in South Africa. From an investment perspective, the Japanese and Asian presence is negligible. Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, speculates that the order in which foreign countries will 'carry the baton' when they return might be: US, Japan, UK and other Europeans. How will they be received by a future government? The key policy document in this regard is the 'Agreed framework in relation to foreign direct investment', a product of the National Economic Forum, and endorsed by the ANC. This is largely a motherhood-and-apple pie affair, but points worth stressing are: Realisation of the importance of stability and 'consistent, credible economic policies'; The view that South Africa should not introduce special tax incentives to attract FDI, the object rather being 'the equal application of reasonably low corporate tax rates which remain stable'; During the transition assurances will be provided on security of investment, foreign exchange policy, and minimisation of bureaucratic obstacles; Industrial incentives will be equally available to foreigners and locals.

0,FT943-8324 ,"FT943-8324 _AN-EHRD3AAWFT 940818   FT  18 AUG 94 / UN warns of world's creaking cradle: Annual population report points to huge strains on resources      By BRONWEN MADDOX   The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday. The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday, says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades (see accompanying story). If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn. The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people, as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do so at all. Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman - they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years to 61 years, according to the UNFPA. Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025. The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and clean air. It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'. But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local shortages'. Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow. Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns. The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia, Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century. For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year  -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to its numbers'.

0,FT921-16160 ,"FT921-16160 _AN-CAFBMABFFT 920106   FT  06 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Project that posed a real banking challenge  -The complexities of financing the Lesotho Highlands water scheme      By DAVID DODWELL   THE Maastricht summit was a picnic in comparison with getting this project financed said Mr Perry Farmar, lighting his seventh cigarette in less than an hour. One had to wonder whether he was a smoker until his bank, Chartered WestLB, took on the task almost four years ago of finance adviser to the Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.37bn) Lesotho Highlands Water Project. It is not the size of the project that makes it unique. Nor even that the country paying for it is not the country responsible for the project. But mix these complexities with the fact that the two countries - Lesotho and South Africa - involved had to count among the world's worst investment risks when the project was mooted five years ago, and you have a unique financing challenge. When financing was finally sealed late last year, the offshore funding alone involved 25 different facilities co-ordinated by seven lead banks in six currencies, five multilateral agencies and five government aid programmes. At least five South African banks are providing the bulk of R4.4bn (Pounds 870m) of commercial loans and export credits. 'The complexity of the loans, by their terms, characteristics and inter-relationships, has been a real banking challenge,' says Mr Farmar, the director at Chartered WestLB who has been most closely involved in its role as project finance adviser. And this is just Phase 1A of the project. By the late 1970s South Africa was anxious at the prospect of running short of water by the mid-1990s. The best long-term new source lay in the gushing streams and rivers of Lesotho's Maluti highlands. That was when the World Bank first began looking at the project, at the request of the Lesotho government. More than a decade later, the first stage of a project is taking shape which will enable Lesotho to meet its own water needs, to become self sufficient in electricity and to sell South Africa all the water it needs. South Africa is footing most of the bill. In resource-poor Lesotho, the water is called 'white gold'. Phase 1A of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project involves two consortia comprising 12 international companies. The consortium led by Impreglio of Italy will build a 180-metre-high dam at Katse, to be the highest dam in sub-Saharan Africa. The second consortium, led by Spie Batignolles of France, will construct 70km of tunnels. Long term plans, stretching to the year 2020, involve four dams. The first task in mounting the project was to ensure Lesotho rather than South Africa was responsible for the project. As one of the world's poorer countries, its status in attracting concessional aid and financing terms was essential. But Lesotho had none of the collateral needed to guarantee loans. The problem for Chartered WestLB, then called Standard Chartered Merchant Bank, was to persuade potential lenders to cough up long-term funds for a project whose sole customer was to be South Africa, which not only had acute debt problems of its own, but was also shunned for political reasons by the international financial community. The result: what is probably a unique arrangement where providers of funds will be repaid not by the South African government, but by a London-based trust. Despite early headaches with the trust approach - not least among them that trusts are almost wholly unknown among German and French banks - it offered several advantages: it provided a safe buffer for banks uncomfortable about a direct relationship with South Africa. it put all lenders on an identical footing in terms of rights to repayment. it meant that if South Africa were to default on debt service payments, it would automatically fall foul of all lenders - including the World Bank and national export credit agencies. A second original aspect of Chartered WestLB's approach was to require contractors bidding for the work to come to the table with organised financing, while at the same time holding a separate 'beauty contest' of banks interested and able to lead the funding of the project. These banks were then introduced, without commitment, to the bidding consortia. This saved time, and gave appropriate emphasis to the importance of the financing package in selecting the preferred bid. It is probably no accident that the five banks who 'won' the beauty contest became the lead banks for the project - Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais of France, Dresdner Bank and Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau from Germany, and Hill Samuel from the UK. Alongside them were the multilateral agencies - principally the World Bank, which lent Pounds 110m, and Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation, which has loaned Pounds 20.7m. In the hope of attracting the best possible financing package, Chartered WestLB won agreement for a 'more the merrier' approach to initial bids. This 'post-qualification' of bidders, contrasting with the normal World Bank requirement for pre-qualification, meant that 35 bidding groups initially threw a bid into the ring. This was filtered to 12 groups, and finally to five serious bidding consortia. This process added to the time taken to appoint the winning contractors, but created competitive pressures that probably succeeded in securing better financing terms. A full percentage point was pared from rates by use of 'competitive pressures'. Commercial loan periods stretched to six years. Another two months, and the whole project would have been in jeopardy. Long-term OECD consensus interest rates of 8.3 per cent, agreed at the outset because of Lesotho's status as one of the world's poorest countries, would have had to have been revised upwards in line with prevailing consensus lending rates if funding had not been agreed by December. Even now, long-term rand financing has to be finalised. The small local financing market was first wooed for R135m, with this bridging loan then being replaced by a larger facility of R750m. The final facilities, in which South African banks take the lead, should be signed this month. A total of R4.4bn has been raised. 'It has been a huge undertaking, and taken longer than anything else we have done,' recalls Mr Farmar. 'Our original contract was for 18 months, but even after three weeks I knew it would take at least two and a half years. In the end, it has taken three and a half.' The reward was clearly a handsome fee. But on that Mr Farmar remains coy.  The Financial Times   London Page 14 Map (Omitted).  "

0,FT933-5771 ,"FT933-5771 _AN-DIAB3AF9FT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (1): Africa is striving for a fresh start - Four years after the World Bank's seminal 1989 report, the continent's crisis is deepening and more children are dying      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   NOT SINCE the end of colonial rule, some three decades ago, has Africa been gripped by such a fundamental struggle. At stake is the fate of a continent battling for economic recovery against mounting odds. Over the past handful of years, the old order has collapsed, or is on its last legs. Apartheid has crumbled. Dictators have been overthrown, democracy sought, and state-controlled economies have succumbed to the market. As the world itself changed, African presidents lost the patronage of Moscow and Washington, and donors demanded 'good governance' from previously tolerated corrupt or mismanaged regimes. From Lagos to Lusaka, the mood of the continent has altered dramatically as Africa has entered a new era. Africans have fewer inhibitions about criticising their governments, and they speak out more confidently for human rights and against corruption. Above all, they debate what is critical to their future: structural adjustment - as powerful in its impact as any ideology the countries of sub-Saharan Africa have adopted. Drawn up by the World Bank, endorsed by other official donors and the IMF, criticised by many non-government organisations, and often bitterly attacked within the region itself, it shapes the lives of more than 600m Africans. Yet some 10 years after its inception, the results are modest. As articles elsewhere in this survey suggest, the business environment in Africa has changed for the better. But in its crucial forthcoming review of adjustment in Africa, provisionally entitled Progress, Payoffs and Challenges, the Bank is expected to warn that progress falls short of expectations. Implementation by governments has been weak, the obstacles formidable, the time required longer than expected, the results modest, and elements of the programme flawed. The report is guarded in its conclusions. But the insights it provides, together with the experiences of FT writers on the ground, point to a sombre conclusion: structural adjustment, while essential to Africa's recovery, is not sufficient. The African crisis is outpacing efforts to resolve it. For millions in the region, the new era is associated with pain. Factories have been closed, food subsidies eliminated, social services cut, as governments seek to live within their means. The poor are the first to suffer. 'Structural maladjustment is even more painful than adjustment,' observes Dr Kwesi Botchwey, Ghana's long-serving finance minister. He is sympathetic to their plight, but that is scant comfort. Even in the most successful of the 30 or so countries in various stages of structural adjustment, relief is modest and the road ahead long and arduous. At present growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The less successful have longer to wait: 'With today's poor policies it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid 70s', says a Bank official. In the meantime, Africa is being left far behind by countries which have made better use of their resources and compete more vigorously for capital. In 1965, Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. Today, it is three times higher. Thailand's income per head in 1965 was lower than Ghana's; now it is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Equally striking is Africa's declining share of developing-country exports of food and agricultural products. It halved between 1970 and 1990 (from 17 to 8 per cent) with Asia increasing its market share. 'Can Africa's decline be reversed?' asked the Bank in its last important study of the continent's plight: 'The simple answer is yes. It can be and it must be. The alternative is too ghastly to contemplate.' Four years later, the region remains racked by disease, disaster and debt: the question becomes more compelling, the alternative creeps closer. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Today, more people in Africa are poorer, and more children are dying. Other signs of stress are apparent, beginning with the distressing list of countries that have effectively ceased to function as modern nation states: Zaire, Somalia, Liberia, Sudan, Angola. Hopes raised by the end of the war in Ethiopia, the peace agreement in Mozambique, and a fragile peace pact in Liberia, are offset by renewed civil war in Angola and Nigeria's steady decline, and strife in Sierra Leone and Rwanda. Former 'success' stories and 'role models' in the 1970s have since become cautionary tales. Kenya struggles to implement economic reforms which erode the patronage on which the ruling Kanu party has been so dependent. Cote d'Ivoire moves deeper into difficulties that cannot be addressed until the CFA franc is devalued, an obstacle that holds up effective economic reform in the 13-member CFA bloc. The collapse of the settlement in Angola and continuing violence in South Africa raise doubts about whether, in the short term at least, southern Africa can be the engine-room for regional growth. Most disturbing of all, perhaps, is the concern that Africa no longer has the adequate institutional capacity to help itself. The technological gap between Africa and the world has widened, and the continent's management is weak. Many schools and universities are without teaching materials. Civil services have been neglected or politicised. The integrity of the judiciary has been eroded. Meanwhile, Aids takes its terrible toll. More than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans. An estimated 14m will be infected by 2000; many are from the skilled urban class on which the implementation of reform greatly depends. Hopes that the emergence of multi-party politics would prove a simple stepping stone to good governance have proved premature. Opposition parties have turned out to be weak, fractious and susceptible to patronage, owing more to ethnicity than policy for their support. For the industrialised world, the will to help may emerge only when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat to self-interest, in the form of immigration to southern Europe, or a rise in Moslem extremism, growth in drug-trafficking or health risks posed by a continent that cannot be ring-fenced; or when it is stimulated by the loss of flora and fauna with medicinal value, or environmental concerns. Self-interest or humanitarian imperative, Unicef's poignant warning is timely: 'The abandonment of hopes for the continent would mean the writing off of the talents, aspirations and potential of one eighth of mankind, both now and far into the next century.' From Africa must come a new generation of leaders, committed to reform, and tapping the same spirit that brought freedom 30 years ago. Angered by the failures of corrupt and autocratic leaders, frustrated by economic policies that did not deliver, impatient to recover their lost civil rights, and worn out by wars, Africa's people are striving for a fresh start.

0,FT941-2906 ,"FT941-2906 _AN-ECRDQADZFT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Africa's gloom   Sub-Saharan Africa's economic decline may have been arrested, and in some countries modestly reversed. But the long-awaited World Bank report on structural adjustment in the region is deeply worrying, nevertheless. Current growth rates among the best performers are 'still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades'. With today's poor policies, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its income per head of the mid-1970s, says the report. The sheer misery of countries not covered in the report can only be guessed at: Sudan, Africa's largest state, Zaire, potentially one of its wealthiest, Angola, Somalia and Liberia. Meanwhile, Burundi, which was doing rather well, has had a coup and Nigeria has slid backwards, after having been a leading performer between 1987 and 1991. Last weekend it was given a justified ticking off by Mr Kim Jaycox, the bank's vice-president for Africa. The fundamental questions are why Africa has been left trailing by the rest of the developing world and what can be done to remedy the calamity. Some of the answers may emerge in Tokyo this week, where the Japanese finance ministry has brought together World Bank and IMF officials, other donors and African governments, to discuss lessons from east Asia's success. Mr Lee Kuan Yew of economically successful Singapore made a start last November, when he offered Africa his own sensible checklist: clean government; an effective and adequately paid civil service; family planning; 'pragmatism, not dogma, in economics'; letting foreigners and local entrepreneurs 'get on with their business'; universal education; and going 'for results not political correctness'. Mr Lee had another piece of advice, one that goes to the heart of Africa's development disaster: maintain national solidarity and social cohesion. Africa faces many formidable obstacles in its efforts to recover. The infrastructure is desperately poor, privatisation painfully slow, the external debt burden heavy, management weak and education inadequate. In all of these areas outsiders can offer some assistance. But the continent's most formidable hurdles, those of social fragmentation and brutal political exploitation, are not susceptible to outside intervention. Too often governments fail to act on behalf of their countries. Obligations extend, instead, in concentric circles, beginning with family, village and clan, and embracing tribe, but not country. It is not Africa's fault that boundaries are arbitrary, that former nation states were divided, or several nations encompassed within newly created territories. The Organisation of African Unity's decision to retain those colonial boundaries was right. But after independence, African leaders failed to build either the machinery or, more important, the attitudes required by functioning modern states. Building such a social compact may require a new generation of leaders. Make no mistake, structural adjustment is necessary, even though it is bound to work slowly. But it may not work at all if those with power do not feel obliged to serve the interests of the people.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

It is particularly  significant for us that this summit should take place in South  Africa, and Cape Town in particular, so soon after the  epoch-making changes that have taken place.    That we can meet at this level, at the southern tip of the  continent, is tribute to a mission fulfilled. We once more  express our profound gratitude to your excellencies, the  business leaders and the world at large for the generous  solidarity you extended to us during the dark days of apartheid.    The rebirth that we celebrate in South Africa is indeed a  rebirth of the region and the continent. This is our collective  achievement which has opened up new opportunities for us to  exploit our great potential and, indeed, to boldly cross the  threshold to a new and great era. At last, Africa in general and  southern Africa in particular, can build a new all-inclusive  partnership based on freedom, democracy and social justice.    For us in South Africa, this is a time of great joy. Joy at  the rediscovery, as a united people, of our common humanity, our  common interests and our common destiny.    Ours is a delicate transition. But we are confident that we  have entered it with a new national spirit. The first democratic  elections which we have just conducted and the atmosphere of  peace that has prevailed in this period inspires us with  confidence that we shall succeed in our endeavours.    Lest we forget: the transformation we are living through is  the result of years of intensive and protracted struggle. It is  a result of difficult and sometimes harrowing negotiations. A  process that ultimately resulted in the meeting of minds among  the major political players.    We are heartened by the progress already made by the  government of national unity in reaching consensus on the most  important challenges facing the nation.    Differences do remain. But they manifest themselves within  the context of non-racial democracy. There is a spirit abroad to  ensure that we achieve the common objectives that we have set  ourselves, primarily to build a better life for all our people  and ensure peace, stability and economic growth. The  constitutional assembly will soon sit to draft a new  constitution for the country. And we are confident that the  spirit of consensus-seeking which characterised the multi-party  negotiations will display itself fully in this regard.    Quite certainly, transitions everywhere do breed  uncertainty.  And South Africa is no exception. In particular, we experienced  significant outflows of capital, and we still experience caution  among domestic and foreign investors. But the tide is turning,  occasioned by the manifest display of a national togetherness  that South Africa has hitherto never experienced.    We face a long and hard road to address the havoc wrought by  decades of apartheid. The challenge to ensure social justice and  stability is as urgent as it is crucial.    Put in brief, this means building a people-centred and  caring society. It requires that we use all our resources and  skills to broaden the base of the economy and ensure that it  serves all the people.    It demands that we enlarge the pool of skills and unleash  the  energies of the people, as a whole, to contribute to the twin  processes of nation-building and economic development.    It also entails addressing the disparities in residential  infrastructure, income distribution, provision of health  facilities and educational opportunities.    The government of national unity is of the unanimous view  that all this needs to be done and done urgently. But also that  the reconstruction and development targets that we set ourselves  should not upset macro-economic balances and undermine fiscal  discipline.    All of us recognise that peace and stability are crucial for  economic growth and development. We are determined to ensure  that all South Africans, including those who fear democracy, can  rest assured in the knowledge that change is in their interest  too.    This challenge is as much a South African one as it applies  to the region as a whole. Now that we have redeemed our pledge  with destiny, the people of southern Africa can start in earnest  to build a peaceful and developing sub-continent. We have to  urgently resolve the problems of conflict in parts of the  region, whilst we undo the effects of apartheid destabilisation.    Now we can together address the legacy of colonial under-  development and imbalances within and among countries of the  region. We can together galvanise the human and material  resources that the region commands, to serve the people. We can  together develop the physical infrastructure necessary for  development across all countries.    For these goals to be achieved, we need to start setting out  the integrated strategies required. This also means urgently  addressing the merging patterns that would, in the long run, not  benefit the region.    The lop-sided development bequeathed us by our colonial past  has resulted in the relative under-development of many countries  of the region. Related to this is the danger of unhealthy  migration of capital as well as skilled personnel to areas with  developed infrastructure. It is to the overall advantage of the  region that this trend is arrested and reversed. More  accurately, it needs to be obviated through strategies for  regional economic integration.    In the more distant future, our common objective is the  realisation of the Treaty of Abudja, the creation of an African  common market. In the near future, we are faced with the task of  ensuring that the programmes of both the SADC [Southern African  Development Community] and Comesa [Common Market for Eastern and  Southern Africa] are realised in the new political and social  context. With regional integration will emerge a mutually  beneficial arrangement regarding movement of goods, capital and  labour.    Such regional integration will need to address the broad  task  of reconstruction and development in the entire region.    We will venture to say, that modern economic planning  dictates that inter-national co-operation requires more that  just agreements on macro-economic imperatives and broad  development projects. For, impacting on these factors is the  basic question on how the partners jointly and severally create  an economic environment which attracts investments and benefits  ordinary people.    This means jointly grappling with issues such as:    Delivery of employment, shelter, nutrition, health,  education  and training for some 100-million people on a sustainable basis;  prioritising the areas, within our own countries, most in  need, and doing it in such a way that we stimulate sustainable  growth and development; seeking and finding the balance  between our noble goals and the resource opportunities and  constraints; avoiding economic and financial arrangements,  including the debt-trap, which can only have the effect of  eroding our countries' sovereignty.    We who are only starting to take the first steps out of the  mire of racial subjugation, are well aware that the experience  countries of the region have gathered will stand us in good  stead. We can only benefit from the new relationship that is  emerging.    As we take our rightful place among nations of Africa, South  Africa commits itself to join our neighbours in rising to the  mammoth challenge presented by a growing affliction in many  parts of the world known as ""Afro-pessimism"" -- loss of  confidence in our continent's capacity to overcome  under-development and declining standards.    It is a task which we are called upon to undertake with a  singleness of purpose and with confidence, remembering that the  thriving countries of Asia, the socalled Asian Tigers were only  20 years ago written off as hopeless basket cases. This can only  be achieved if there is purposeful interaction among our  countries.    Democratic South Africa enters this new partnership as one  player amongst many. We harbour no desire to be the dominant  partner, for the region and South Africa itself would lose in  the long run. We entertain no illusion of becoming the regional  benefactor because such capacity we do not possess.    Rather, we seek to join governments of the region in taking  up the cudgels on behalf of all the peoples. We seek to join  them in attracting significant investment flows and in reaching  beneficial trade agreements. Along with countries of the region  we are determined to ensure that the goods mined, harvested and  manufactured in the region become internationally competitive.  We are committed to strengthen regional institutions such as the  SADC and Comesa and at the same time strengthen bilateral  relations with each of our neighbours.    This we resolved to do both as a government and in  partnership with various institutions of civil society such as  business houses, trade unions, as well as educational, health  and other bodies.    We are confident that South Africa will soon achieve the  rates of growth necessary for us to meet our objectives. The  last two quarters have demonstrated that GDP [gross domestic  product] growth is on the upswing. This will be of benefit not  only to South Africa's people but will help the movement towards  greater southern African prosperity.    The path that South Africa has traversed might be unique in  many respects. But, to the extent that we have based ourselves  on the experiences of southern Africa and Africa as a whole, it  is a common achievement and common heritage.

The move will be regarded by many of Britain's leading exporters as a significant climbdown in a long-standing row over the cost of export credit cover. Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister of state for trade, revealed in a parliamentary answer yesterday that the first annual review of insurance premiums based on the controversial Portfolio Management System (PMS) has made it clear 'that current premium rates need adjusting to reflect changes both in trading patterns and in the creditworthiness of various markets'. Under PMS, which is a Treasury model for measuring risk, the cost of premiums ranges from an effective rate of as little as 2 per cent of the value of a contract, up to almost 17 per cent for a country such as India. For Malaysia, where premiums have been over 5 per cent, the cut will reduce rates to around 3 per cent, while for South Africa rates will fall from almost 8 1/2 per cent to around 7 per cent. It is understood that rates for Singapore and Venezuela are to be cut by almost a half, while rates for Thailand, Malaysia, Hungary, Colombia, Mexico, Iran and Oman will fall by about 40 per cent. The premium rate for Hong Kong will be cut by around 20 per cent. Mr Sainsbury said that in the 20 main markets of exporters who most need long term credit cover, cuts will average about 20 per cent. Mr Sainsbury said the cuts, due to come into effect on April 5, were the result of a normal annual procedure under which PMS is reviewed. He pointed to four factors which have made the cuts possible: economies had performed better than expected; economies in the Third World were being managed better; the balance of business being done by exporters in low-risk markets was greater than expected; export credit agencies in other countries had moved more slowly than hoped in raising premium rates to bring them into line with the UK. The PMS system was imposed by the Treasury on the Export Credits Guarantee Department in May last year. The government-controlled ECGD provides medium and long-term insurance cover for exporters against the risk of non-payment. PMS was aimed at imposing an even stricter discipline in linking the cost of export credit cover with the level of risk involved in a contract. It resulted in steep increases in the cost of export insurance, and led to a deluge of protests from contract exporters who insisted it gave overseas competitors an unfair price advantage. Most affected were companies such as GEC, Rolls-Royce, Trafalgar House, Balfour Beatty, Babcock and Foster Wheeler, which are involved in large, long-term overseas contracts.

0,FT941-3811 ,"FT941-3811 _AN-ECODSABAFT 940315   FT  15 MAR 94 / Long snakes and short ladders in Africa: A formula for development failure      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Unseen hands play Snakes and Ladders across sub-Saharan Africa. Democracy fitfully emerges in South Africa, is denied in Nigeria. Civil war revives in Angola, Zaire slides towards anarchy, a fragile peace pact holds in Mozambique. News is as unpredictable as the throw of the dice. Snakes marked Drought, Corruption or Civil War writhe across the board; ladders appear as Debt Rescheduled or World Bank Loan. Short ladders, long snakes. . . and loaded dice. As the latest World Bank Sub-Saharan Africa report published at the weekend makes clear, the destination labelled Recovery remains out of reach. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn (Pounds 113bn), has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warns the Bank. Whoever is to blame, the policy at the heart of relations between Africa and the west is failing. 'Good governance', the concept which links aid to Africa with economic reform, human rights and democracy has not got to the heart of the continent's predicament. Admirable in principle, complex in practice, today the policy appears confused. Increasingly the west is placing responsibility for Africa on the World Bank, but providing neither adequate mandate nor clear guidance. Once enslaved, later colonised, and marginalised in the 1980s, the continent faces a continuing crisis in the 1990s - but with a new dimension. Africa is not only in danger of losing the battle; the world is losing interest. The countries that led the scramble for Africa's resources some 100 years ago are now disengaging. 'If only the west cared enough to want to recolonise us,' an African diplomat ruefully observes. 'But we're hardly an attractive proposition.' At one level, the west continues to respond positively. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. But the critical link between economic and political reform is being neglected, and aid is ineffective. Under the auspices of the World Bank's economic recovery programme, Africa's governments were expected to cut budget deficits, curb inflation and monetary growth, introduce competitive exchange rates, reform tariffs and revive agriculture. The good news, says Mr Kim Jaycox, the Bank's vice-president for Africa, is that the formula works: 'The six countries that improved their policies the most (over the period 1987-91) saw their GDP growth per capita jump about 2 percentage points per annum between 1981-86 and 1987-91.' The bad news is that this is not nearly enough. The Bank's claim in a 1989 report that African economies could grow at a rate of 4-5 per cent has proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Part of the reason for Africa's failure is made clear in the report. Implementation of the World Bank structural adjustment reforms has been poor, political will lacking, and management resources scarce. But essential to the success of economic reforms, donors have argued, is a matching programme of political reform. Transparency, accountability and democracy are vital to sustain development, they maintain. The World Bank report agrees, but it does not address how it can be achieved in practice, or assess the part political problems have played in Africa's failure to reach economic targets. The only reference is to 'a strong social consensus on the need to improve governance'. Corruption is not mentioned, nor military spending, nor is there any discussion of a central issue: how to reward reformers, punish laggards. Yet the experience of Bank representatives across Africa is that this is precisely the area which needs attention. 'Structural adjustment means reducing state patronage,' explains a Bank official in west Africa. 'Reducing patronage undermines the ruling party. Unless the president is prepared to risk political suicide, there is not enough I can do to force him down a path of reform, whether it's the big stick or the big carrot.' The reason for the report's reticence on 'good governance' issues is not hard to find. The Bank, officials privately point out, is constrained by a mandate which precludes it from a political role; and its mandate is determined by the directors - 'none of whom wants to rock the boat'. The board's third world appointees tend to reflect the views of their leaders, who would be the last to support tougher measures, say their domestic critics. Developed country directors, may be reluctant to jeopardise commercial or security interests. But the misgivings of directors representing the biggest donors about applying tougher pressure on reluctant African reformers stem from a further, more understandable concern: the generally poor performance of Africa's opposition parties. After the high hopes of the 'new wind of change', the wave of democratisation that swept through Africa in the late 1980s, opposition parties have turned out to have most of the weaknesses of the regimes they oppose: ethnically based, few carefully worked out policy alternatives and likely to be as corrupt if ever they won office. 'Who can blame us for our reluctance to follow through a policy that could destabilise Nigeria, with its 80m people and huge problems, and where the opposition seems as incompetent as the army?' asks an irritated European diplomat. The report leaves further questions unanswered. If democracy is essential to sustained growth - the assumption that underpins the concept of good governance - how can the position of Ghana, under military government until 1992 but the leading reformer, be explained? As long ago as 1981 the Bank called for 'a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'. World Bank officials and aid workers argue that Africa's need for such a compact is overwhelming. But until the west renews its interest in Africa, resolves the anomalies in its policies, and gives the Bank and other donors a clearer mandate, the compact will remain a pipe dream.

It's time to go back to school.    The latest report by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee says 23  million Americans are illiterate.

Sawyer made the statement standing behind a low wall of books representing the  465,000 pages of technical data that an automobile mechanic must be able to  read to diagnose and repair cars. ""This wall between good people and good jobs  must come down,"" Sawyer said.    A worker who lacks basic skills to keep up with change in the increasingly  complex work environment -- who can't read basic instruction manuals or safety  instructions -- drops farther and farther behind. And low-level opportunities  are disappearing.    ""American jobs are placing greater demands on employees,"" said the Senate Labor  Committee report. ""The average American worker today must have skills at the  ninth-grade through the 12th-grade levels, not the fourth-grade level typical  after World War II. And the standards keep rising. The growth occupations have  increasingly shifted to the service and retail sectors, which require  high-level problem solving, communication, reading, writing and math skills.""    Without a federal initiative on literacy, these workers will be more vulnerable  to a shift or advance in the marketplace, be confined to dead-end jobs or  always be in danger of dislocation.    President Bush and the nation's governors have embraced a new national policy  calling for every American to be literate by the year 2000. To that end, two  major literacy bills are on the verge of final congressional approval this  fall.    Sawyer's bill is part of the omnibus ""equity and excellence in education act""  (H.R. 5115) sponsored by Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). The House  approved it overwhelmingly.    Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.) sponsored the Senate counterpart, the National  Literacy Act of 1990 (S. 1310), which passed unanimously. The bills'  differences will be ironed out in a conference committee this fall.    The main federal program to fight illiteracy today is the Adult Education Act,  which is funded at $160 million, less than 1% of the Department of Education's  budget. Sawyer's bill calls for an additional $250 million, Simon's for an  additional $230 million.    The purpose of both bills is to provide federal leadership and focus for an  issue dominated by fragmented state and local efforts. It would create the  federal infrastructure to coordinate and strengthen efforts at all levels. And  it would provide incentives for the private sector to become more involved.    The bills would create a national center for literacy to write national  educational goals, develop better teaching methods and tools and train  teachers.    But while Simon's bill focuses more on the unemployed person who can't read,  Sawyer's bill concentrates on the functionally illiterate employed worker. His  bill would establish a National Workplace Literacy Assistance Collaborative to  help small and medium-sized businesses and labor organizations implement  special programs through a system of grants.    ""It's tremendously important to upgrade the skills of today's work force,"" said  Harold W. McGraw, president of the Business Council for Effective Literacy,  ""not only in terms of our own profitability and ability to compete  internationally, but also in terms of giving workers new opportunities. There  are less and less low-level jobs out there today.""      Bill Would Let U.S. Firms Recruit Aliens    New employment-based immigration laws could open doors to the U.S. job market  for foreign recruits while providing money to educate and retrain American  workers.    Jobs are going begging in the current economy, said Rep. Bruce A. Morrison  (D-Conn.), primary sponsor of the ""family unity and employment opportunity  immigration act"" (H.R. 4300).    Instead of the quota system used under current law, Morrison proposes awarding  visas to people overseas with relatives already in the United States. This  system would allow employers to recruit workers from abroad.    Morrison proposes a head tax, of sorts. After attempting to find workers in  this country, companies would be allowed to recruit immigrants -- for a fee.  Companies with 200 or more employees would pay $1,000 per worker; companies  with 50 to 200 employees would pay $500. There would be no fee for companies  with fewer than 50 employees or for nonprofit organizations.    The money would go to the American Workers' Educational Trust Fund, which the  secretary of Labor could use to provide education grants to states.    ""By balancing the benefits to employers who recruit immigrants to fill jobs  with raising revenues to educate and train American workers for the jobs of the  future, we will have built a system of employer-based immigration where  everybody wins -- the immigrant, the employer and the American worker,""  Morrison said.    The bill, which has passed the House Judiciary Committee, is expected to come  to the floor for a vote when Congress returns from summer recess.

0,FT922-4429 ,"FT922-4429 _AN-CFEA9ADZFT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (12): Hopes for a quick future - Corporate South Africa is holding up well      By PHILIP GAWITH   MOST South African businessmen believe business will flourish in the new South Africa because the operating environment cannot possibly be worse than that of the 80s. But, as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries, has commented, the quicker the future comes, the better. He has good reason for saying so. South Africa's corporate sector is under considerable pressure from the effects of a three-year recession. Calculations from the Reserve Bank's quarterly bulletin reveal that operating profits of the corporate sector, as a percentage of the fixed capital stock of private businesses, declined from 12.5 per cent in 1985 to 9.4 per cent in 1989 and 8.9 per cent in 1991. According to the Reserve Bank, manufacturing output, which started to decline in 1990, decreased at an annualised rate of 4 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1991. Real value added by the manufacturing sector dropped by 2.5 per cent in 1991. Percentage utilisation of manufacturing capacity reached a new low of 80.4 per cent in the third quarter of 1991. An indication of hardship on the ground is the 41 per cent increase in company and close corporation liquidations for the first quarter. Cumulative motor vehicle sales, a useful indicator of economic activity, were 11.4 per cent down for the first four months of 1992 compared to 1991. Although conditions are difficult, corporate South Africa seems to be holding up reasonably well. A survey by the Financial Mail of 160 leading industrial and commercial companies which reported in the second half of 1991, showed overall growth in earnings per share of 7.3 per cent, compared to negative 0.4 per cent growth for the same period in 1990. This was achieved in spite of lower turnover growth - at 13.7 per cent, below inflation - and shrinking margins. Interest cover was an average 5.1 times, suggesting balance sheets remained in fair shape. Mr Charles Booth, research director at stockbrokers J D Anderson, says balance sheets are in better shape than at the bottom of the previous cycle when interest rates were higher and many companies suffered large foreign exchange losses. Companies learned their lesson then and this time kept their gearing down. A number of blue-chip companies, both fixed-investment and consumer-oriented, reported a decline in earnings during the first quarter. Mr Booth believes, however, that recent results, notably respective increases in earnings of 10 and 15 per cent from South African Breweries and Barlow Rand, the country's two industrial heavyweights, suggest that an upturn has begun. The fact that the performances of these companies was not worse, in spite of the extremely difficult trading conditions, is also a measure of the market domination that some of the large companies are able to exert within a small market. If the upturn has begun, the question is whether it will replicate past upturns in which earnings growth of 20-30 per cent in the first year was normal. Mr Booth argues that the present upturn is likely to be more subdued on the grounds that there seems little prospect of a rise in commodity prices, particularly gold, which have in the past helped fuel economic growth in South Africa.

0,FT922-4424 ,"FT922-4424 _AN-CFEA9AD4FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (19): Out of the cold into the sun - The call of the wild in a tourist's paradise      By PHILIP GAWITH   I do not believe there are many more impressive sights than a city man's first glimpse of a live, maned lion loose on a plain in a strange country. Robert Ruark FOLLOWING a recent visit to Sabi Sabi, one of the luxury game lodges in the Eastern Transvaal, I can unequivocally endorse the comments of the famous American hunter and novelist. The spectacle of two lions roaring at each other, literally yards away from our open Jeep, was one of such primal power and immediacy as to defy adequate description. Likewise, the sight of a leopard cleaning her two cubs in a sandy river bed and, later, the massive, tank-like menace of the white rhino. But it is not only the big animals which constitute the appeal of the bush. The sights, sounds and smells are so distinctive, and the locations so remote, as to allow for the sort of relaxation not easily found elsewhere. Robert Ruark would not have been familiar with the modern phrase 'eco-tourism', but those who now make heavy play of the 'eco' prefix are essentially making a similar appeal about the call of the wild in an age when the quality of city life is widely perceived as deteriorating. Already 80 per cent of visitors to South Africa come to see its fauna and flora. Mr Clem Sunter, South Africa's leading scenario guru, has predicted that conservation is the area where the smart money is heading and he is enthusiastically supported by people such as Mr Dave Varty who is associated with the Londolozi and Phinda eco-tourism developments. Mr Varty comments: 'We see eco-tourism as being the next major growth industry in South Africa.' The reasoning is simple: wildlife is a finite resource, for which there is an increasing tourism demand. It is also an area, of course, in which South Africa has a competitive advantage. Only a handful of other countries in Africa can offer a similar product, and South Africans believe they offer a more sophisticated wildlife product than East Africa and a better balanced destination overall. In support of his claim, Mr Varty cites the high occupancy rates achieved by places such as Sabi Sabi, Londolozi and Mala Mala through the sanctions period. Although eco-tourism is seen as probably South Africa's main marketing feature, enthusiasm in the tourism industry is more widely based. Mr Pieter van Hoven, chairman of the South African Tourism Board (Satour), notes: 'We've come out of the cold era into the sun. For many years we had to deal with South Africa's moral unacceptability as a tourism destination. Now all this has changed. Effectively the country can market itself on equal terms with other competing destinations.' South Africa markets itself, not unreasonably, as 'a world in one country'. From game parks in the east, to the Drakensberg mountains in Natal and fine beaches along the coast, there is a lot of variety to offer the tourist. Aside from intrinsic merits, however, Mr van Hoven believes the tourism industry has a good future merely in catch-up terms. He notes that the industry at present only constitutes about 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product, compared to a world average of about 10 per cent. In 1990, South Africa attracted about 1m visitors, making it the fourth most popular destination in Africa behind Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, all short-haul destinations. Mr Org Marais, minister of tourism, talks in terms of South Africa attracting 3m foreign visitors by 2000. Mr Van Hoven says any post-apartheid benefit in 1991 was obscured by the detrimental impact of the Gulf War. He says, however, that for the first quarter of 1992 quite a few European markets showed growth of 45-47 per cent compared to 1990 and he forecasts overall growth of 30 per cent in foreign visitors for 1992. The government has recently shown a new-found enthusiasm for the economic potential of tourism. A White Paper in May outlined a policy for assisting the industry, including financial assistance for new tourist accommodation projects and a commitment to deregulate the industry to assist the private sector. A recent liberalisation of international aviation policy should also make South Africa a considerably cheaper destination to fly to. Last year saw 16 international airlines start new scheduled flights to South Africa. There is not yet much indication of additional investment from the private sector, because there is considerable spare capacity following a few lean years in the hotel industry. That said, industry consensus is that up to five foreign hotel groups are likely soon to announce investments. In a category of its own is the R730m Lost City project being developed at Sun City by Mr Sol Kerzner.

The Wingti Government's expansionist budget strategy, based  on the expectation of an oil and mining boom, has left the  country with almost no foreign reserves.    The mini-Budget, brought down in March by the new Finance  Minister, Mr Masket Iangalio was supposed to start bringing the  Government's finances back under control by cutting the 1994  deficit from 7 per cent to just under 5 per cent of GDP. It  accepted the reality of depressed oil prices, cutting spending  and increasing taxes.    However, like last November's Budget, the mini-Budge was  based on absurdly optimistic estimates of the cost of the war in  Bougainville. Mr Iangalio's spending cuts have been almost  completely offset by additional, unplanned spending in the  province.    Economists are now expecting a budget deficit of between 5  and 6 per cent of GDP. It will be the third year in a row that  the deficit has exceeded 5 per cent of GDP.    Rising oil and mineral prices should come to PNG's aid over  the next few years. However, the PNG Government seems  determined to do all in its power to deter new mining investment.    The Minister for Mining and Petroleum, Mr John Kaputin, has  just announced a moratorium on new mining projects while he  sorts out a new mining policy.    This follows a series of damaging controversies in which the  Government has acquired a 15 per cent equity in the Porgera  mine, delayed the Lihir project by making contradictory  agreements on ownership, and changed the mining laws to deprive  CRA [expansion not known] of its Mt Kare tenement. At the same  time, BHP [Broken Hill Proprietary] has been the subject of a $4  billion suit over pollution from its Ok Tedi mine.    Mr Iangalio immediately contradicted Mr Kaputin's  announcement of the moratorium. However, that just seems to  confirm that the administration of PNG's mining policy will  continue to be erratically driven by short-term political  considerations.    And these problems overlay the long-standing structure  problems of the PNG economy: urban wages that are five to six  times higher than the country can afford; an oversized public  sector; an overvalued exchange rate; a largely-neglected  agricultural sector; and one of the lowest levels of spending on  infrastructure in the Third World.    Despite the country's extraordinary mineral wealth and  generous aid from Australia, the quality of life of the great  majority of Papua New Guineans who live in the countryside is  below that of comparable developing countries. Education  standards are very low, with adult literacy and school  participation rates below comparable developing countries.  Health services are also inadequate in the country areas.  Infant and maternal-mortality rates art very high. Life  expectancy is five years below the average for middle-income  countries.    The result has been the large-scale migration of people to  the towns and a breakdown in law and order.    In an effort to keep people on the land, the Government has  introduced price support schemes for the major export crops --  coffee, cocoa, palm oil, and copra. These schemes, which made  an important contribution to the blow-out of spending last year,  are highly inefficient because they encourage production of  crops when farmers should be cutting back. They also put the  Budget at considerable risk.    The question is what will it take to persuade PNG's leaders  to adopt more responsible economic policies.    One option is to leave the country to the tender mercies of  the IMF. However, there's no guarantee that PNG's leaders would  learn from the experience.    What is certain, however, is that Australia will always be  under international pressure to bail out PNG. It will be seen  by everyone as our special responsibility.    Perhaps Australia can do more to avert disaster now. Its aid  to PNG is largely determined by treaty, although it may still  have some leverage.    Australia is switching from general budget assistance to  program aid, which gives Canberra more say in the way the money  is spent. This year, just over a quarter of our aid to PNG will  be program aid. By 1996-97, the proportion of program aid will  be up to 52 per cent.    What happens after that is a matter for negotiation although  the broad agreement is that all aid will be program aid by about  the end of the decade. Australia can be more or less generous,  depending on the behaviour of the PNG Government.    While that may not seem to offer much leverage over Port  Moresby's notoriously myopic politicians, it gives Australian  ministers an opportunity to comment on the state of PNG economic  management and potentially influence the bureaucracy, public  opinion and the markets. It may strengthen the hand of those in  the PNG Cabinet, like Mr Iangalio, who are trying to achieve  reform.    We will get no thanks for the intervention, but we might  save  Papua New Guinea from a period of self-inflicted misery.     "
0,FT943-14 ,"FT943-14 _AN-EI3DUAIPFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (57): After apartheid, optimism grows - South Africa / The crucial problem is government spending      By MARK SUZMAN   For most of the past decade, South African planners have been warning that without drastic policy changes in the political and economic arenas, the domestic economy was doomed to continue on a downward spiral of high inflation, low growth and stagnant employment. Testifying to the accuracy of such predictions, South Africa's economic record over the past 10 years has been dismal, averaging growth of less than 1 per cent a year. At the same time, triggered by the combination of sustained political unrest, the loss of international confidence, and gross economic mismanagement by the government, inflation and government spending soared while investment, domestic savings and overall business confidence plunged. Now that the political side of the equation has finally been resolved, however, there is widespread optimism in the country that the economic challenges can be tackled with equal success. And with political change fortuitously coinciding with an upturn in the global business cycle, there is a widespread belief that South Africa can become an economic engine capable not only of pulling millions of its own citizens out of the mire of poverty, but acting as a catalyst for renewed growth in the region as well. Unfortunately, however, the situation is not that simple. The distorted policies of the apartheid era have left a deep-seated and destructive economic legacy that will take years to resolve. The crucial problem remains government spending, which accounted for 21 per cent of GDP over the first half of 1994 - a figure double the norm in most developing Asian economies. This extraordinarily high level of government involvement in the economy causes other problems, too. Funding the budget deficit, expected to be 6.6 per cent of GDP, diverts money from new fixed investment while continued spending by government intensifies inflationary pressures. The high level of government borrowing also means that gross domestic saving in the economy, essential to help fund new development, is at only 16 per cent of GDP. Compounding the problem is the fact that the economy remains overwhelmingly dependent on commodity exports, which account for some 71 per cent of foreign exchange earnings. Although the government has been trying for some years to switch the focus to manufactured goods, it remains hampered by the fact that South Africa's economy is still highly protected, and many of its enterprises uncompetitive by global standards. In addition, the maintenance of a relatively expensive workforce with a low skills base acts as a further obstacle to development. In an international competiveness survey released by the World Economic Forum this month South Africa ranked 35th out of 41 countries and came last in the 'people' category, assessing the educational and training levels of the general populace. Despite all this, however, the underlying fact remains that the economic outlook for South Africa is better than it has been for decades. Growth this year is expected to be around 2.5 per cent, below the more optimistic forecasts made at the beginning of the year, but still up on 1993's 1.1 per cent, which itself followed four years of painful recession. Next year the figure is expected to reach between 3.5-4 per cent. The consensus among most economists is that provided the government sticks to conservative fiscal and monetary policies, South Africa is capable of continuing to generate domestic growth of around 3.5 per cent for the next five years. But to achieve more than that, a significant inflow of foreign investment, bringing with it exposure to new international skills and technology denied to the country during its years of isolation, is desperately needed. So far, the first condition seems to be met. Despite the immense political pressures on the ruling African National Congress to provide the populace with tangible benefits following the demise of apartheid, it has successfully resisted the temptation to undertake high spending, populist policies that would further destroy the economy's fragile base. Indeed, in its public statements to date, including the June budget, the government has been a model of fiscal probity, stressing its commitment to reducing the budget deficit and promising to fund its centrepiece reconstruction and development programme through savings rather than new borrowing. And while inflation may be rising, its current level of 8.2 per cent is still well down on the double digit rates that characterised the 1980s. In addition, trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel has shown an encouraging willingess to take on entrenched business lobbies and has already started to dismantle tariffs in sectors such as the motor and textiles industry to force South African manufacturers to become more competitive. Despite its good track record, however, the markets remain sceptical of the government's ability to successfully rein in spending - a fact signalled in the recent rise of bond yields to more than 17 per cent, representing a real rate of return of more than 9 per cent. And while industrial restructuring is an essential step if South Africa is to successfully start pursuing an export-led growth strategy, in the short term it is likely to depress rather than enhance growth prospects. However, most analysts agree that the key to whether the South African economy can finally step on to the high road of renewed growth is whether it can successfully attract renewed inflows of foreign capital. Although the country has seen net capital outflows of around R50bn between 1985 and the first half of 1994, since June the situation appears to have stabilised. But it has not yet reversed. People have stopped taking money out of South Africa, but few people are yet willing to start putting new investments into the country. Meanwhile, the country's foreign reserves remain seriously depleted and are currently able to cover only five weeks of imports. With total foreign currency debt at only Dollars 16.7bn and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, one possible means of correcting this is renewed borrowing. However, the far more desirable route is new foreign investment. But while a large number of foreign companies have set up offices or franchise operations in South Africa over the past 18 months, few have yet made any investments of any significance. As a result, over the next few years South Africa is likely to follow a path of only moderate growth, representing a significant improvement over the recent past but still well short of the high levels the ANC needs to satisfy the needs of its black constituents.

The modification of  financial policy on the part of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board  (FRB) was a logical measure to prevent an overheating of the  economy and to correct the bubble phenomenon, but, as financial  markets become globalized and increasingly affected by  computerization, the aftereffects are of an unexpected  magnitude. Since the world economy as a whole is just nearing  signs of a recovery, the advanced nations face the need to seek  policy coordination to prevent a chain of hikes in U.S. interest  rates.    In response to the combined 0.5-percent hike in the federal  funds (FF)--which influence short-term market rates--in two  stages by the FRB, 30-year government bonds, which serve as an  index for long-term U.S. interest rates, temporarily rose to 7.4  percent. The hike in U.S. interest rates has caused New York  Stock Exchange indices to drop 10 percent from their recent  peaks. Turmoil in U.S. securities markets has adversely impacted  not only markets of advanced nations such as Japan and Europe,  but newly emerging markets found in Asia, Central and South  America, the former East European nations and Africa to which  large sums of U.S. capital were flowing. [passage omitted]    The fact that changes in policy in the United States had a  worldwide ripple effect attests to the fact that national  barriers no longer exist in terms of the flow of capital.  Moreover, the computer dependence of markets has had a tendency  to amplify fluctuations. Such circumstances make it almost  impossible for monetary authorities of the various nations to  intervene and shield their markets from the effects of rising  U.S. interest rates.    The problem is that the effects of those policy changes have  impacted on the Japanese and German economies which hold the key  to future worldwide economic recovery. Now that there is the  fear that foreign capital once flowing into Germany will flow  out of that country, there is the possibility that the German  Federal Bank will hesitate to continue with its policy of easing  restrictions on the money markets. The situation in Germany  could very well serve to shackle monetary easing policies of the  other European continental nations. Rising long-term interest  rates are a headache for Japan, too, where it appears that the  economy is ready to bounce off from the bottom of the cycle.    The seven advanced nations (G-7) have no choice but to  reconstitute their efforts at policy coordination. Lurking under  the surface relative to the current monetary turmoil is the huge  recurring U.S. international balance of payments deficit.  Reducing the international balance of payments deficit will  require the Clinton administration to cut federal government  deficit spending and encourage a reversal in the savings rates  which has fallen to 4 percent of earnings.    Japan must clearly enunciate tax reform primarily  encompassing an income tax cut and a future hike in consumption  tax. If government deficits should rise in an uncontrolled  manner, the pressure on long-term interest rates will rise. We  must also launch a market-opening plan of substance as a means  to overcome Japan-U.S. economic friction which can become the  cause for securities market turmoil.    Unfavorable news impacting on securities markets such as  President and Mrs. Clintons' Whitewater scandal, Prime Minister  Hosokawa's resignation and tension in the Korean peninsula are  intensifying. Political factors coming into play just as world  economic tides are about to change make securities markets more  susceptible to chain reactions. This is the very reason why  there is a need for renewed coordination by monetary authorities  at the G-7 Finance Ministers Meeting scheduled for the end of  June.     "

Experience demonstrates that educational level alone, i.e., the numerical grade level that an individual has attained, may not be a good indicator of ability to function.

0,FT941-10902 ,"FT941-10902 _AN-EBGC7AFBFT 940207   FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (25): Continent of hazard and opportunity - Africa      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Which of the world's emerging markets can boast an investment fund where a Dollars 1,000 stake a year ago has risen to nearly Dollars 1,500? Surprisingly, the answer is Africa. Even more surprising, the country concerned is Nigeria, where the economic reform programme has collapsed  - but a shrewd purchase of Nigerian debt is paying off for investors. The New York-based International Asset Transactions decided in 1992 that Nigerian promissory notes (issued in the mid 1980s to clear Dollars 4.2bn in trade arrears) and par bonds (which discounted commercial bank debt at 40 cents to the dollar in a 1991 settlement with the London Club) were underpriced. Gus Udo and Donna Young of IAT noted that servicing these deals cost Nigeria comparatively little - around 14 days a year of the country's 1.4m-barrel daily production of oil. They reckoned that no sensible government would alienate the banks and the trading houses by defaulting on the terms of the two settlements. So, in January 1993 they launched the Nigeria Emerging Market Fund, an open-end mutual fund registered in the Cayman Islands, with about two thirds in Nigeria Central Bank promissory notes and most of the balance in Brady par bonds. The results have been remarkable. Behind the general view that Africa's debt instruments are generally undervalued lies a fundamental reappraisal of the continent's prospects. 'Africa is poised for growth,' declares Morgan Stanley, which has launched a Dollars 40m Africa Investment Fund. Its bullish 50 - page appraisal of the continent argues that the economic and political reforms under way for the best part of a decade are coming good. Prices for the region's exports such as cocoa, coffee, gold are recovering, and industrial metals are bottoming. Africa, argues the report, which includes a useful guide to the dozen stock markets operating and the 20 others being developed, 'harbours undervalued assets, particularly in the natural resource and manufacturing sectors'. 'Where stock markets are up and running,' says Morgan Stanley, 'investors can find attractively priced issues, both on a price-earnings and price-to-book basis.' By international standards the African market - excluding South Africa, which ranks just outside the world's top 10 - is tiny. Its exchanges have a combined market capitalisation of around Dollars 12bn compared to India's Dollars 91bn. Nevertheless, the belief in the resurgence of Africa's fortunes, led by hopes for a thriving post apartheid South Africa, has caught the imagination of international fund managers. Mr Miles Morland, of London-based Blakeney Management, calculates that at least Dollars 3bn of foreign money is being targeted at South Africa and a further Dollars 1bn at the rest of Africa in 1994: 'Peanuts in Mexico or Hong Kong, but they are liable to blow the African market apart at the seams.' The total amount of stock available in the whole of Africa (excluding South Africa) is about Dollars 2.2bn, he reckons: 'If almost half of this turns over in 1994, a huge increase on the 1993 levels, there will still only be Dollars 1bn of African equities to be fought over by local investors, global investors and all the new Africa funds.' The continent's heavyweight is South Africa. With a market capitalisation of some Dollars 150bn, South Africa is not so much an emerging market but a re-emerging market, comments Nigel Scheckter of Micropal, the Boston-based fund performance measurement service, which monitors 26,000 funds. But 'the true float is tiny relative to the wave of US guilt money that will elbow its way into the market this year,' says Mr Morland. Foreign buyers have already made their mark on Diagonal Street. Figures supplied by Baring Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthing in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. 'The market is the best one-way ticket I can think of, barring the 20 per cent bloodbath prospect' - a reference to fears that the April elections may trigger destabilising violence. Elsewhere, Mr Morland singles out Ghana, a tiny market but likely to grow rapidly as the privatisation programme led by Ashanti Gold moves ahead, Zimbabwe, where foreign buying in the second half of 1993 helped more than double the industrial index, Morocco and Tunisia. Is the excitement warranted, are the risks appreciated, and how well do the analysts know Africa? Morgan Stanley's upbeat view of the continent does not overlook the problems  -pointing among other things to weak management, and what it calls Africa's 'fear and distrust of foreign business influence'. But the overall picture that emerges may strike some readers as too rosy. The assertion that 'tribal tension in most of black Africa is probably less of a problem than racial tension in the US' may simply be an unorthodox view. More serious is the assertion that 28 of Africa's 50 states 'have economic reform programmes in place'. This list is based, says Morgan Stanley, on World Bank evaluations - not always, it should be said, the best judge of its own reform efforts. Some examples of reform listed by Morgan Stanley are risible - such as Zaire, where the political and economic malaise deepens by the day. Also on the list is Burundi, where the recent coup (which took place after the report's publication) illustrates the volatility of the African condition. The inclusion of Sao Tome, little more than a dot in the ocean, trivialises the list. Nigeria - 'a powerhouse waiting to happen', according to Morgan Stanley - 'perseveres with its structural adjustment programme, launched in 1986', writes the analyst. At the time the report was published (October 1993) it was clear that Nigeria's erratic attempt to implement the programme was the reason an IMF agreement lapsed some two years ago. Any hopes that Nigeria's military regime would revive the lapsed programme were set back last month, when it fixed the exchange rate and local interest rates at unrealistic levels. Africa's performance in general has been weak. As Professor Tony Hawkins of the University of Zimbabwe writes in a recent paper: 'More than a dozen years after the launch of aid-funded structural adjustment programmes, it is impossible to identify a single mainland sub-Saharan country that has made a success of economic reform.' 'The best that can be said,' he continues, 'is that in countries such as Ghana and Uganda, the spiral of decline has been reversed, but it will take well into the next century before earlier living standards are regained.' A somewhat tougher investment appraisal comes from the Meridien BIAO group which runs a network of banks in 20 countries across Africa, led by Andrew Sardanis and Colin Goodwin, two veteran Africa hands. The investment climate is improving, says Colin Goodwin, president of the group, 'but by nothing like enough. 'Investment through individual African stock exchanges is not the best route for the emerging market fund,' he adds, 'as these exchanges are still too small and surrounded by too many restrictions'. The response of Africans with resources abroad may well prove the acid test of whether an African investment makes sense: if the continent's politicians, businessmen, civil servants are not risking their capital, foreign investors may suspect that Africa's elite knows something they do not. *Africa: Wrestling with the stigma of history.

0,FT944-13875 ,"FT944-13875 _AN-EJZDWAA9FT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, NICHOLAS SHAXTON and PETER STANLEY   If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this week. The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades, secure peace. Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400 years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are taking place. It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack, for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and the end of superpower rivalries. In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and external aggression. In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the 1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of the regional settlement falls into place. And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa. Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves. But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go wrong before the edifice is finally complete. In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat at the polls. Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'. The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms, unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies. The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries. 'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not an opposition in ideological terms.' Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls. Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers. Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of colonialism and 30 years of war. Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the people in Luanda. 'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by October 31. Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991 accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new hatreds. The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups hunted down and killed Unita supporters. The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under the new peace plan, a difficult exercise. The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful, however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale and provide the manpower required. Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds. Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main diamond producing areas. Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for peace. Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent. Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment  -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether. For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to harness the power of South Africa. If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy, the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as the start of a new and more prosperous era.  --------------------------------------------------------       THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including       Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began       in early 1960s.

When public school students returned to class there was something else beyond  the usual change of new classes, new teachers and new books. There also was a  new administration, run by Boston University.    After months of sometimes bitter controversy, the private university was at the  helm of the Chelsea public school system. It is the beginning of a 10-year  experiment to see if academia's resources can make a difference.    ""It's like Christmas morning and we're ready to go,"" said Ted Sharp, an  assistant dean at BU's School of Education, on the first day of classes earlier  this month.    Despite the fanfare, there was little evidence of the university's new role.  Signs welcomed students and university officials in Vietnamese, Cambodian and  Spanish, reflecting the native tongues of a third of the student body.    There also was talk of a new computer system and a special program for truants.  But the university has longer-term goals than improving attendance or school  equipment.    University officials talk of creating a new climate in this working-class  community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents about nutrition, child  care, even neonatal care, with the idea of preparing children for school long  before they can read or write.    ""We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate the underclass  in the United States,"" said Peter Greer, dean of education who oversees the  management team.    But there are many who still have doubts about the university's involvement in  the local schools. The teachers' union and Latino parents have filed separate  suits challenging the agreement. Others are worried the city may be left in  deeper debt if the university doesn't raise the $2 million to $3 million it  promised for special programs this year.    ""I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money doesn't come in,"" said Elizabeth  McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea School Committee.    The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows years of hard  times for the 3,500-student system. An influx of immigrants from Latin America  and Southeast Asia swelled the school population; declining tax revenues cut  school budgets.    Chelsea spends $1,600 less per student annually than the national average. Test  scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the state's lowest.    School committee members sought help by approaching John Silber, president of  Boston University, who has long sought to use his school's resources in public  education. After months of negotiations among the school committee, aldermen  and the Legislature, an agreement was reached in June giving the university  control.    Althoug planners have talked about new courses and individualized teaching  plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children and their parents for  school. Last spring, the university experimented with a literacy program for  mothers and their young children.    There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and classes for  expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of future students.    But the ambitious plans require money. University officials talked of raising  $50 million through the life of its contract with Chelsea. More money is  expected, but only $726,000 in pledges are in hand.    And there are other concerns. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of Silber's stormy  relations with his university's unions; Latinos, fearful that the new  management might end bilingual education, went to court to try to stop the  takeover.    The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a management team  with several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam, a Peruvian-born Boston  school administrator, picked to be Chelsea's new school superintendent.    The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives teachers an average  bonus of $1,300.    ""There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers,"" said Edwin  Weinstein, head of the Chelsea Teachers Union. ""Now they've adopted a  wait-and-see attitude.""

University officials talk of creating a new climate in this working-class  community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents about nutrition, child  care, even neonatal care, with the idea of preparing children for school long  before they can read or write.    ""We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate the underclass  in the United States,"" said Peter Greer, dean of education who oversees the  management team.    But there are many who still have doubts about the university's involvement in  the local schools. The teachers' union and Latino parents have filed separate  suits challenging the agreement. Others are worried the city may be left in  deeper debt if the university doesn't raise the $2 million to $3 million it  promised for special programs this year.    ""I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money doesn't come in,"" said Elizabeth  McBride, chairwoman of the Chelsea School Committee.    The unique agreement between the university and Chelsea follows years of hard  times for the 3,500-student system. An influx of immigrants from Latin America  and Southeast Asia swelled the school population; declining tax revenues cut  school budgets.    Chelsea spends $1,600 less per student annually than the national average. Test  scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the state's lowest.    School committee members sought help by approaching John Silber, president of  Boston University, who has long sought to use his school's resources in public  education. After months of negotiations among the school committee, aldermen  and the Legislature, an agreement was reached in June giving the university  control.    Althoug planners have talked about new courses and individualized teaching  plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children and their parents for  school. Last spring, the university experimented with a literacy program for  mothers and their young children.    There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and classes for  expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of future students.    But the ambitious plans require money. University officials talked of raising  $50 million through the life of its contract with Chelsea. More money is  expected, but only $726,000 in pledges are in hand.    And there are other concerns. Chelsea's teachers are mindful of Silber's stormy  relations with his university's unions; Latinos, fearful that the new  management might end bilingual education, went to court to try to stop the  takeover.    The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a management team  with several bilingual experts, including Diana Lam, a Peruvian-born Boston  school administrator, picked to be Chelsea's new school superintendent.    The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives teachers an average  bonus of $1,300.    ""There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers,"" said Edwin  Weinstein, head of the Chelsea Teachers Union. ""Now they've adopted a  wait-and-see attitude.""      Wire    "

Birth rates in the region are falling rapidly, and European fears of a flood of Arab immigrants are wildly exaggerated, Mr Courbage told a conference in Brussels yesterday. In fact, he added, the working-age population in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia will level off in about 2005, when the number of job applicants will begin to decrease. 'Just as Europe's bulging baby-boom generation leaves working life for retirement, and will need to rely on a sufficient labour force - foreign workers in particular - to finance it, the Maghreb labour markets, where labour will be in short supply, will be hard-pressed to meet export demands.' Mr Courbage, a senior researcher at the Institut National d'Etudes Demographiques in Paris, was speaking at a workshop on Europe and the Mediterranean at the Centre for European Policy Studies. The decrease in fertility in the Maghreb countries is acknowledged by the UN and the World Bank, he said, but those organisations had not yet taken the full measure of the decline. The UN had significantly overestimated fertility in all three countries.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P99  Nonclassifiable Establishments.   Types:-  PEOP  Personnel News.

0,FT932-16746 ,"FT932-16746 _AN-DDDAIAFBFT 930403   FT  03 APR 93 / Gardening: Blooming culture: Gardening Books      By PATRICIA MORISON   THE CULTURE OF FLOWERS by Jack Goody Cambridge Pounds 40, 480 pages AFRICANS DO not grow flowers, do not give flowers. This one observation was the seed of Jack Goody's book, The Culture of Flowers. Goody is a social anthropologist famous for studies of literacy and marriage in different societies. In his retirement, the former Professor of Social Anthropology at Cambridge University has turned, not to growing roses, but to analysing why people have ever grown roses. This is a wide-ranging and readable book, although somewhat repetitive. Goody compares the different meanings attached to flowers across cultures, starting with the Garden of Eden (not, it would appear, a flower-garden) and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and ending with present day. Are Africans uniquely unappreciative of flowers? What did it mean to 'say it with flowers' in ancient Egypt or 17th century Holland, and what does it mean today in India, Russia or China? Certain subjects, such as the Dutch tulip craze, will already be familiar to many. But many will be fresh, for Goody gathers an extraordinary mass of facts - about burial customs, the Chinese New Year, Jesuit theology, the recent Indian custom of garlanding politicians, and shifts in the symbolic meaning of individual flowers. Throughout history, humans have given flowers to their gods. The gift takes many forms, from the towering temple-offerings of the Balinese to the English parish flower-rota. Perfume comes from the Latin per fumum, because people of the ancient world used the smoke of burning petals to waft their prayers to the nostrils of their gods. The Roman soldiers made Christ a crown of thorns in mockery of the chaplets adorning their cult idols. Few flowers bloomed in the gardens of the Pharaohs, whereas Egypt under the Romans became a paradise for floriculture. (On the whole, this book lacks the savour which would come from referring to primary sources. However, in a splendid papyrus we find an Egyptian grower proudly recording the despatch of 1,000 roses and 4,000 narcissi to be worn as garlands at the wedding of a Roman dignitary's children.) The Jews, it seems, share with Africans the distinction of being an unfloral people. They do not decorate synagogues with flowers and mark graves only by stones. It seems that only three kinds of flower are mentioned in the Bible, by which I take Goody to mean the crocus, the Rose of Sharon and the so far unidentified 'lilies of the field'. The God of the Jews had no truck with pagan garlands, and neither did Allah. But although Islam rejected the use of real flowers in worship, images of flowers were permissible, as we see from the carpets and exquisite tiles of Ottoman mosques. Islamic art and literature is drenched in the scent of flowers. Delightful flower-baskets were carved on the gravestones of Ottoman ladies. Goody believes that only societies with a reasonably complex economy are flower-minded. Hence one reason why Africa is unfloral, although its people also express a moral and spiritual dislike for sacrificing fruit for the sake of flowers. From this perspective, picking flowers is frivolous, let alone covering coffins with floral wreaths. In the funeral announcement 'No Flowers Please', Goody detects the kind of anti-floral puritanism which has been bad news for flower-sellers in such very different societies. He traces the impact of two hard frosts of Puritanism in western Europe, when the goddess Flora was driven out. The first frost to wither the flowers came with the establishment of Christianity, the second at the Reformation. However, this is all rather fuzzy, not least since Goody himself admits that eminent 4th century Christians urged congregations to deck the tombs of martyrs with flowers. Floriculture on the grand Roman model no doubt did perish during the barbarian invasions, but I for one am loth to take it on trust that it was only in the 12th century Renaissance that Flora tiptoed back into people's lives. One brief passage suggests what, to my mind, this book lacks: the vivid, sharp-focus description of communities which one would expect of an anthropologist. It concerns a French village where it was the custom when someone died for the villagers to pick all the flowers from that person's garden. Man's life is as the flower of the field. Surely all cultures, even in Africa, have seen in flowers the transience of life and beauty? The Culture of Flowers swamps one with detail and it becomes easy to lose the thread, yet it succeeds in being a richly stimulating account of a wonderful subject.

0,FT931-1806 ,"FT931-1806 _AN-DCXCKAG8FT 930323   FT  23 MAR 93 / Wave of immigration at new peak: Western Europe and North America each take over 1m a year in 1991 and 1992      By BRONWEN MADDOX      GENEVA   WESTERN Europe and North America each received more than 1m immigrants in 1991 and 1992, a United Nations Conference on European population, which opens today in Geneva, is to be told. The total, mainly relatives joining earlier immigrants and a new wave of asylum seekers, is higher than the previous peak in the early 1960s, according to Mr David Coleman, a demographer at Oxford University. Immigrants are not generally economically beneficial to their host countries, he argues, although they may solve short-term labour problems. 'Only around 60 per cent of the potential workforce in western Europe is actually working and there is plenty of slack to cope with future labour demand,' he says. The past availability of cheap labour may be one factor behind Europe's relative lack of investment in high technology industries, he adds. The immigration numbers include 250,000 leaving Yugoslavia last year. Germany last year took 438,000 asylum seekers, two thirds of the European total. But so far 'it is Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia which are taking the brunt of Russians, gipsies and Romanians from the east,' Mr Coleman says. An outbreak of fighting in Russia could intensify the pressure for westward migration, and pressure will come too from the projected rise of nearly 2bn in the populations of the south Mediterranean, tropical Africa and south Asia in the next 12 years. The conference, one of five regional debates before next year's UN World Population Conference in Cairo, is expected to call for more money to be spent on family planning to curb high rates of population growth in developing countries. The UN Population Fund wants the total amount of money spent each year to double from the present level of Dollars 4.5bn by the year 2000. Developed countries contribute only Dollars 800m of the total, and the Population Fund the main UN family planning agency, has seen its budget frozen at Dollars 238m. The conference will also hear warnings that current projections of the world's population could need considerable revision. By the year 2050, the world's stable population could be anywhere between 5bn and 20bn, according to Mr Miroslav Macura, of the UN Economic Commission for Europe. Present estimates of a doubling in population from the present 5.5bn by that date could be altered by small changes in fertility rates, he said. Scientists are also arguing that traditional assumptions between economic development and falling birth rates - captured in the phrase 'Development is the best contraception' - no longer appear true. Gulf states have seen fertility rates - the average family size if the current birth rate were maintained - of around three, compared to a European average of around 1.7, despite a huge increase in wealth. Mr Macura also points out that Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Bulgaria have seen sharp falls in birth rate despite low prosperity levels. Social changes in Europe are causing sharp fluctuations in birth rate. East German fertility rates, which were 1.6 before German unification compared to West Germany's 1.4, have now fallen to 0.8 because of uncertainty. However the increasing prosperity of Italy and Spain is thought to be responsible for the fall in fertility rates to about 1.2, below West German levels.   Countries:-  XGZ  Europe.

AFRICA TO PERMIT MIXED NEIGHBORHOODS;    FIRST SUCH INTEGRATION IN NEARLY 40 YEARS; LIMITED IMPACT SEEN      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A new law that will permit integrated neighborhoods in South Africa for the  first time in nearly 40 years went into force Wednesday, but it is expected to  affect only new townships and the few areas where blacks already live illegally  in large numbers.    The government, hoping the measure will ease international criticism of  apartheid, its system of racial separation, hailed the Free Settlement Areas  Act as a significant milestone on the road to apartheid reform.    ""It's a very important development,"" Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe  said. ""Now the whole principle of mixed residential areas has been introduced  and we're dealing with a much more fluid, much more dynamic situation.""    But the government, in an effort to mollify its far-right opponents among the  4.5 million whites, has said it remains committed to segregated neighborhoods  for those who want them.    Frederik W. de Klerk, leader of the ruling National Party and heir-apparent to  ailing President Pieter W. Botha, vowed in a major policy speech last month  that the government will continue to protect ""group rights,"" the South African  term for racially separate housing, schools and hospitals.    But De Klerk said the new legislation will begin to allow some people to form  their own ""groups"" voluntarily, without regard to race.    The new law establishes a Free Settlement Board to hear applications from areas  that wish to declare themselves open. The board then makes recommendations to  the president, who can declare the areas open. No final decisions are expected  this year.    Schools and hospitals will remain segregated, at least at first, and the  government says it has not decided how to deal with the new non-racial groups  on the voters' rolls. Elections in South Africa are racially segregated;  blacks, who account for three-fourths of the population, have no vote in  national affairs.      Dozen Neighborhoods    The government has said that a dozen neighborhoods have expressed interest in  becoming open. Officials say the most likely candidates are new townships and  several inner-city white districts -- Hillbrow in Johannesburg and Woodstock in  Cape Town, for example -- where more than 50,000 blacks already live in  defiance of the law.    The white Conservative Party has demanded that the government enforce  residential segregation more strictly, and some far-right whites have recently  picketed and vandalized the houses of Indian families living in whites-only  areas. Some of those Indian families have received death threats.    The government tried last year to tighten up enforcement of the 1950 Group  Areas Act, the apartheid cornerstone that divides South Africa into separate  neighborhoods for whites, blacks, mixed-race Coloreds and Indians.    But that move stalled because of a severe housing shortage in black areas and a  judge's ruling that blacks could not be evicted from a whites-only area unless  alternative accommodation can be found.    Anti-apartheid activists, who want the Group Areas Act scrapped, complain that  a law allowing some open areas will have little effect on the overall level of  integration in South Africa.    Most whites in the country live in comfortable suburbs, with neighborhood  schools that have empty classrooms and hospitals with empty beds. Most blacks  live in high-density townships with overcrowded schools and hospitals and long  commutes to work.    Critics also contend that high demand for housing among blacks will create a  run on the few open areas and that this will quickly turn them into overcrowded  slums.    ""You will have second-class areas, ultimately, receiving third-class services,""  Tony Leon, leader of the white liberal Progressive Federal Party on the  Johannesburg City Council, said in an interview.    Meanwhile, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Wednesday that he has  released 230 of the estimated 1,000 political activists held without charge in  South Africa. He promised to release an additional 50 by Friday. The black  detainees, some held for as long as 32 months, agreed last month to suspend a  mass hunger strike after Vlok promised at a meeting with Anglican Archbishop  Desmond M. Tutu to free ""substantial numbers"" of them.    Also on Wednesday, the Justice Ministry announced that President Botha had  commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners -- a move that human rights groups  said may indicate a softening of the government's attitude toward capital  punishment.    South Africa, with 164 hangings in 1987 and 117 last year, has one of the  highest per-capita execution rates of any country in the world. Among those  reprieved Wednesday was Paul Setlaba, on death row for a murder conviction  arising out of the 1985 black consumer boycott. The United Nations, among other  groups, had appealed for clemency for Setlaba.

A partnership requires a signed agreement between at least one entity described in 472.2(a)(1) and at least one entity described in 472.2(a)(2). Note that State and local governments_like any other entities_may not qualify as partners unless they fall within these descriptions. For example, under the regulations, a State or local educational agency or a municipal employment and training agency is an eligible partner, but a State or city government is not an eligible partner. No agency of the Federal government is an eligible partner. Federal employees including members of the armed services are not eligible for training. If you are not sure whether a particular entity is an eligible partner, please call the program officers listed as information contacts in the application notice.   Q. Can entities that are not eligible partners be involved in a workplace literacy project?   A. Yes. They could potentially be involved as ``contractors,'' ``helping organizations,'' or ``sites,'' as defined in 472.5 of the regulations. Note that entities that are ``helpers'' or ``sites'' may not receive funds from the grant.   Q. Must the signed partnership agreement be submitted with the application?   A. Yes. The agreement is required both to establish the partnership's legal eligibility and to ensure each partner's continuing commitment during the workplace literacy project. Prior to submitting an application, partners should ensure that each partner clearly understands its role and responsibilities in the project.   The Department interprets even a single reference in the application to an organization as a partner to mean that it is a bona fide partner in the partnership and, thus, is required to sign the partnership agreement. The applicant should be careful to designate partners, helpers, contractors, etc. in the same way wherever they are mentioned throughout the application. Because partnership requirements are established by law, the Department reviews each agreement form to be certain that it meets the terms of the law requiring all entities named as partners to sign the agreement. The Department wishes to underscore that if any of the entities named as partners in the application have not signed the agreement form, the application will be returned to the applicant without further consideration for funding.   Q. How does the Department define ``small business''?   A. In 34 CFR 472.5, the Department defines ``small business'' as a business entity that_  (1) Is organized for profit, with a place of business located in the United States and that makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials, or labor, or both; and   (2) May be in the legal form of an individual proprietorship, partnership, corporation, joint venture, association, trust or a cooperative, except that where the form is a joint venture there can be no more than 49 percent participation by foreign business entities in the joint venture; and              "

Figures from the World Health Organisation show that more than half of the world's 15m sufferers are in Africa. The virus has already killed about 1.2m Africans, and it is estimated 14m of the region's people will be infected by 2000. The disease in Africa is mainly transmitted through heterosexual contact, affecting men and women equally. Figures for each country remain patchy, but Aids-control programmes in Uganda suggest between 7 and 10 per cent of the population is infected with HIV. In Zambia, the ministry of health estimates between 20 and 25 per cent of Zambian women of child-bearing age have HIV. The problem is believed to be growing in West Africa and in South Africa. According to the World Bank, in many African countries, particularly in the urban areas, Aids has become the 'major cause of adult mortality, leading to a doubling and even a tripling of the adult mortality rate'. In Africa, the disease is concentrated in the 20-45 age group, the strongest section of the labour force, and many now fear labour shortages will become widespread on the continent - leading to rising employment costs, which could impede development. The increasing incidence of tuberculosis, which has killed more than 1.3m people since 1980, has also been linked to the increase in Aids, with nearly 50 per cent of sufferers said to be HIV-infected. Experts now believe there is a real danger that the disease will derail attempts in recent years by African governments to restructure their economies. In rural areas, the backbone of many African economies, the disease has had a devastating impact. A report for Panos, the research charity, by Tony Barnet, of the University of East Anglia, said in many parts of southern Uganda (an area once known for its fertility), HIV-related illness and death had resulted in less careful tending of banana plots, unpruned coffee bushes, a reduction in the size of cultivated plots and a narrowing in the range of crops. In parts of Zimbabwe, the cultivation of Chilli peppers had grown at the expense of more lucrative crops - it needs less energy for harvesting - and, as Panos says, 'in Rwanda, the long-term effects may be increased cultivation of cassava and reduced cultivation of other foods and cash crops'. This in turn could lead to less export income and poor nutrition. In parts of Tanzania, agricultural production is said to have fallen by between 3 and 20 per cent, due to HIV-related deaths. In addition, says the recent World Bank report, 'the viability of agricultural credit schemes may also be affected. The number of defaulters may rise, as households use credit to finance medical care, leaving survivors to liquidate their remaining assets in order to repay loans'. But it is perhaps in the urban areas and more formal sectors of the economy that the impact of Aids is most visible. In many urban centres, the infection rate has been put as high as 30 per cent. Ironically, the higher the income, the greater the sexual activity, and a 1988 study in Zaire found higher HIV rates among better-educated and higher-paid workers. In industry, whole sectors are under threat. In Zambia, where the copper industry is the source of 75 per cent of export earnings, researchers have not only warned that workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be trained, but have added: 'The result will not be a sudden collapse in minor output; rather there will be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents, and delays and output will suffer.' In other countries, the loss of output and earnings in manufacturing due to HIV/Aids illness have become apparent with the decline in production levels. The service sector has not escaped either, and Panos highlights the situation in South Africa where life insurance companies face a huge increase in payments. Aids-related claims in the period 1985 to 1988 amounted to Pounds 855,000. Yet in 1989 alone the figure was Pounds 700,000. Productivity levels have been hit across the continent, due to ill-health among workers and funeral attendance. An official at the Uganda ministry of commerce and industry said last year: 'Even if someone does not die here, every week we have at least three employees asking for permission to attend a relative's funeral.' According to forecaster DRI/McGraw Hill, Aids will see Africa's gross domestic product depressed by more than 4 per cent by the end of the decade. Companies have already taken action. BP's African subsidiary has a formal 'common agreed policy' on Aids written into its employee handbook. Unilever, with 80,000 employees on the continent, has 'guidelines rather than a formal policy', and takes an active monitoring and educational role in relation to Aids. British American Tobacco in Uganda subjects its workforce, or even prospective employees, to blood tests. The South African Chamber of Mines is reported to have refused to recruit anyone who reacts positively to a test. The World Bank adopted an Agenda for Action on Aids in Africa, in 1988, and has loaned more than Dollars 100m in its fight against the condition and other sexually-transmitted diseases since 1986. That total includes its single biggest loan for fighting Aids, totalling Dollars 64.5m, which it gave to Zimbabwe in June. If Africa is to fight the scourge, more assistance is vital.

0,FT932-2277 ,"FT932-2277 _AN-DFTAMAB0FT 930619   FT  19 JUN 93 / Basic skills don't add up: The high rate of adult illiteracy is placing a heavy burden on industry      By JOHN AUTHERS   It might not seem difficult to calculate 10 per cent of Pounds 4,900, but a survey published this week found that 23 per cent of the UK's 21-year-olds could not work out the answer - even with calculators. The survey, conducted by the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit, an independent government-funded agency, poses rather more difficult questions for educators and industrialists. It indicated that one in five young adults needs urgent help with numeracy, while one in seven has serious problems with literacy. Many more had a barely adequate command of reading, writing and arithmetic. For example, 35 per cent of the 21-year-olds had mathematical skills inferior to those expected by the national curriculum of a 12-year-old. Such difficulties with basic skills cause problems for those who suffer them. But they also inflict great damage on the economy. A separate survey of 400 companies by the Albsu, carried out at the end of last year, produced an estimate that the total cost of poor basic skills to industry in the UK was Pounds 4.83bn a year. This estimate includes Pounds 2.5bn as the cost of rectifying customer orders dispatched incorrectly, and Pounds 1.8bn for the cost of lost custom and orders. Industrialists believe such costs are growing, and will continue to grow, as the changing workplace requires greater skills. Mr Edward Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Heath Springs, a small West Midlands spring manufacturer, said: 'In the last five years there has been a dramatic change in the skills needed on my shop floor. The artisans who work here don't just have to measure the components they produce, as in the past. Now, the whole factory is run using statistical controls. If you don't have workers with the basic skills required, those controls will fail.' Many workers were uneasy about their ability to use computers when the company introduced them. And Mr Roberts has had problems bringing in the Japanese technique of 'visual management', which uses written signs on the shop-floor to direct workers. Such techniques are doomed to failure if the workers cannot read. Mr Roberts does not believe his workforce has grown less literate; what has changed is that he now needs a higher standard of literacy among his employees. While illiteracy was once a problem that could be ignored, industry is now forced to confront it. As Mr Roberts said: 'If companies aren't bothered whether their employees are literate or numerate, they won't be internationally competitive and they may as well close down now.' Precise international comparisons are difficult, but research suggests the UK's problems are not unique. In Australia, 28 per cent of those tested failed an exam in 'practical' literacy, which involved such tasks as filling in forms. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in the US found in 1989 that 42 per cent of the population had difficulties with day-to-day tasks, such as working out percentages on a restaurant bill. In Canada, 38 per cent of the adult population had 'some difficulty dealing with the reading demands they encounter in their everyday lives', according to an extensive survey carried out by Statistics Canada in 1990. Estimates by the UN agency Unesco for European countries put the proportion of the population having some difficulty with basic skills at 15-25 per cent in Belgium, 15-20 per cent in France, 15-25 per cent in Italy and 15-30 per cent in Spain and Portugal. It is far from clear how to attack the problem. During the 1970s, adult literacy programmes were emphasised - perhaps most memorably in the BBC television series On The Move in which the actor Bob Hoskins played an adult illiterate nervously encouraging himself to go to evening reading classes. But teaching adults is difficult, complicated and expensive, according to Ms Ann Barnes, general secretary of the National Association for the Teaching of English. 'They develop inhibitions and defence mechanisms', she said. 'Resources, skills and expertise should be put in at a very young stage.' That shift in emphasis to improving basic skills among younger people has now been adopted by the Department for Education. Last year, the department announced grants of Pounds 4.4m for pilot projects in 'reading recovery'. These were modelled on projects pioneered in New Zealand, in which six-year-olds who had slipped behind in reading were given intensive one-on-one tuition. Parents provide another line of attack. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, this week announced a small grant of Pounds 250,000 for pilot schemes in family literacy, modelled on programmes developed in the US, where parents are given help with reading and encouraged to help teach their children. Neither approach is uncontroversial, however. Ann Barnes of the National Association for the Teaching of English is dubious about reading recovery programmes, which she believes to be unnecessarily expensive. Resources might have been better used by experimenting in the use of computers in the classroom to help children read and write, she says. Nor is it always possible to rely on parents: the Albsu research shows that children who have difficulty with reading and writing often have parents with the same difficulties. And some teachers are unhappy about encouraging parents to help their children as it can make life difficult in the classroom when some pupils have been taught to read while others have not. Yet finding ways to raise the level of literacy and numeracy skills is essential given their increasing importance at work. Not only employers lose out when their employees are not fluent in reading and writing or with numbers. Mr Patten likes to point out that adults of today who lack confidence with language may be at a greater disadvantage than they would have been in the Victorian era.

There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, the well-used park  benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men work on the black-and-white  tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through honking, fume-spewing traffic. The  people look sturdy, and not particularly fashion-minded.    This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on the southwestern fringe of  Europe, has to go to achieve its goal of catching up with its neighbors. Now an  overheating economy is further imperiling that ambition.    A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small country's  ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992. That's when the  12-nation European Community, which Portugal joined in 1986, becomes one  barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers.    In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attention eastward to the  rest of Europe after hundreds of years of looking across the Atlantic and into  Africa and India.    The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman and Moorish conquerors,  perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the globe-circling empire that  their famous explorers discovered five centuries ago.    Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed mingling of black,  brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in the curry in Portuguese food, in  the easy command of English in this Portuguese-speaking country.    After painful recession, austerity and more than 25% inflation in 1983 and  1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamic economies. Gross domestic  product has grown 4.5% a year on average for three years, and is projected to  continue at 3.5%. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6%.    A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debt to $16 billion,  down from 80.4% of GDP in 1985 to 40.7%.    But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcing unpopular  measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's center-right Social Democrats,  who won an unprecedented majority in Parliament in the June, 1987, general  election, have lost support in recent months.    A poll recently published in O Jornal showed the Social Democrats down to 41%  nearly halfway through their four-year term from just under 50% in the  election. The clean-cut, 49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation  for being abrasive and overly self-confident.    The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36% from 22.3%, and  Socialist President Mario Soares, a legendary, consummate politician, has  become increasingly popular.    Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the first Portuguese leader  to survive a full four-year term since the 1974 Revolution of the Carnations,  which ended 48 years of authoritarian rule, mostly under rightist dictator  Antonio Salazar.    ""We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient and competitive  economy, a more creative and enterprising society, a freer, more modern  country, without being perturbed by those who would like Portugal to turn back  to the past,"" the prime minister said in a recent speech.    The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers, who are  resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp processing, fearing  these will replace traditional olive trees and threaten farm jobs.    The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March, when local people trying to  dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed with national guardsmen.    In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.    Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of Portuguese Industry, said,  ""Now people tend to criticize the government a lot and the mood is a very  critical one.""    Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo, ""I think we  have a certain situation of crisis.""    You hear it on the streets.    Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ""Many people are unhappy  because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. The cost of living is very  hard.""    But not everybody is negative.    Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ""There are more jobs.  There is less poverty in particular than in the other days.""    Inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 12.3%, more than twice the  government's 6% target for this year, while the trade balance went into the red  last year, giving it a $5.9-billion gap.    Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent political stability has  unleashed long pent-up demand.    To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11 financial measures  that raised interest rates -- now at nearly 15% -- reduced banks' liquidity and  restricted the availability of credit, particularly in the booming car-sales  market.    Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, they were attacked as  late and misdirected. They have underscored the government's tendency to  intervene while simultaneously championing free-market policies.    ""Again, it is the private sector that is suffering,"" said Luis Campos e Cunha,  an economics professor at Lisbon's New University. ""They should be thinking of  squeezing public expenditure.""    Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent policy changes  and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and labor laws restrictive. There  are periodic public sector strikes.      Foreign Investors    Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the Common Market ahead  of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested $496 million in the  year ended October, up significantly from $166 million in 1986.    Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.'s  Portuguese operations, ""You have to keep plugging away.""    But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowed into Portugal  have proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabled much-needed improvements  to transport and communications to begin, EC demands for Portuguese matching  funds have worsened the budget deficit.    The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms, including  restructuring the capital markets.    The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fully recovered from  the stock market crash, are being modernized and combined into a national  bourse. In late April, the government launched an ambitious privatization  program with the sale of a 49% stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer.    ""We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels, not just in  the market but also in the financial institutions,"" said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet,  the Lisbon Stock Exchange's general secretary.    But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected to widen social  divisions.      'Everyone for Himself'    Said Cavalheira Antunes: ""The idea of social solidarity is regressing and the  idea of everyone for himself is coming out on top.""    Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts.    At about $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has the worst  literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates.    Portugal imports 80% of its energy and, surprisingly, half its food, even  though one-fifth of the population works in agriculture.    The country is extremely dependent on tourism. Each year, Portugal's population  more than doubles as tourists flock in, mostly to the southern Algarve coast.    Other big industries tend to be traditional: textiles, footwear, cork, forestry  products, fishing, wine and ceramics. Shipbuilding and repair, and construction  also are important.    The experts say 1992 poses two possible scenarios.    If it's lucky and smart, Portugal could become Europe's California by  concentrating on exotic produce, high technology, light manufacturing and  tourism.    If it is not, foreigners might buy up Portugal's choice assets, leaving it  flooded with imports and producing the low-tech, low-profit goods.    The Portuguese, who are mostly Catholic, conservative and family minded, have a  reputation for being resilient in adversity and flexible in the face of change.    In particular, Portugal prides itself on successfully absorbing about 700,000  Portuguese retornados and African immigrants who fled to the country in the  mid-1970s after Portugal gave up its African colonies of Angola, Mozambique and  Guinea-Bissau.    Optimistic about the outlook is the industry confederation's Lacerda, who said:  ""I think we are not going to miss the opportunity of 1992.""

There are the sloping terra-cotta roofs, the palm trees, the well-used park  benches and ugly modern monuments. Shoeshine men work on the black-and-white  tiled sidewalks and pedestrians dart through honking, fume-spewing traffic. The  people look sturdy, and not particularly fashion-minded.    This scene underscores how far Portugal, perched on the southwestern fringe of  Europe, has to go to achieve its goal of catching up with its neighbors. Now an  overheating economy is further imperiling that ambition.    A surging inflation rate and trade deficit could hamper the small country's  ability to expand and modernize in readiness for 1992. That's when the  12-nation European Community, which Portugal joined in 1986, becomes one  barrier-free marketplace of 320 million consumers.    In the late 1980s, Portugal is belatedly turning its attention eastward to the  rest of Europe after hundreds of years of looking across the Atlantic and into  Africa and India.    The 10.3 million Portuguese, descended of Celtic, Roman and Moorish conquerors,  perhaps have come to terms with the loss of the globe-circling empire that  their famous explorers discovered five centuries ago.    Portugal's colonial legacy is still evident in the relaxed mingling of black,  brown and white faces in Lisbon's cafes, in the curry in Portuguese food, in  the easy command of English in this Portuguese-speaking country.    After painful recession, austerity and more than 25% inflation in 1983 and  1984, Portugal is one of Europe's most dynamic economies. Gross domestic  product has grown 4.5% a year on average for three years, and is projected to  continue at 3.5%. Unemployment has been halved to nearly 6%.    A conscientious debt-repayer, Portugal has cut its foreign debt to $16 billion,  down from 80.4% of GDP in 1985 to 40.7%.    But signs of economic overheating appeared last year, forcing unpopular  measures. Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's center-right Social Democrats,  who won an unprecedented majority in Parliament in the June, 1987, general  election, have lost support in recent months.    A poll recently published in O Jornal showed the Social Democrats down to 41%  nearly halfway through their four-year term from just under 50% in the  election. The clean-cut, 49-year-old prime minister has developed a reputation  for being abrasive and overly self-confident.    The opposition Socialists, meanwhile, have gained to 36% from 22.3%, and  Socialist President Mario Soares, a legendary, consummate politician, has  become increasingly popular.    Nonetheless, Cavaco Silva is still expected to be the first Portuguese leader  to survive a full four-year term since the 1974 Revolution of the Carnations,  which ended 48 years of authoritarian rule, mostly under rightist dictator  Antonio Salazar.    ""We are making our way firmly forward toward a more efficient and competitive  economy, a more creative and enterprising society, a freer, more modern  country, without being perturbed by those who would like Portugal to turn back  to the past,"" the prime minister said in a recent speech.    The most prominent opponents of modernization are farm workers, who are  resisting the planting of eucalyptus trees for paper pulp processing, fearing  these will replace traditional olive trees and threaten farm jobs.    The eucalyptus war reached a climax in late March, when local people trying to  dig up newly planted trees in Valpacos clashed with national guardsmen.    In Lisbon, there are plenty of complaints, too.    Jaime de Lacerda, director of the Confederation of Portuguese Industry, said,  ""Now people tend to criticize the government a lot and the mood is a very  critical one.""    Said economist Jose Cavalheira Antunes of Banco Espirito Santo, ""I think we  have a certain situation of crisis.""    You hear it on the streets.    Isaac da Silva, a 52-year-old taxi driver, said, ""Many people are unhappy  because life isn't easy. We have to work very hard. The cost of living is very  hard.""    But not everybody is negative.    Licelia Godinho, a 35-year-old car rental worker, said, ""There are more jobs.  There is less poverty in particular than in the other days.""    Inflation has jumped to an annual rate of 12.3%, more than twice the  government's 6% target for this year, while the trade balance went into the red  last year, giving it a $5.9-billion gap.    Strong consumption and investment are to blame. Recent political stability has  unleashed long pent-up demand.    To cool the economy, the government in April instituted 11 financial measures  that raised interest rates -- now at nearly 15% -- reduced banks' liquidity and  restricted the availability of credit, particularly in the booming car-sales  market.    Although some measures were widely regarded as necessary, they were attacked as  late and misdirected. They have underscored the government's tendency to  intervene while simultaneously championing free-market policies.    ""Again, it is the private sector that is suffering,"" said Luis Campos e Cunha,  an economics professor at Lisbon's New University. ""They should be thinking of  squeezing public expenditure.""    Foreign investors complain of having to cope with the frequent policy changes  and voluminous red tape. Taxes are complex and labor laws restrictive. There  are periodic public sector strikes.      Foreign Investors    Nonetheless, foreign investors, seeking a foothold in the Common Market ahead  of 1992 and attracted by Portugal's low wages, invested $496 million in the  year ended October, up significantly from $166 million in 1986.    Said Nicholas Racich, administrator of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.'s  Portuguese operations, ""You have to keep plugging away.""    But the millions of dollars of EC financial aid that have flowed into Portugal  have proved a mixed blessing. Although it has enabled much-needed improvements  to transport and communications to begin, EC demands for Portuguese matching  funds have worsened the budget deficit.    The government is implementing far-reaching economic reforms, including  restructuring the capital markets.    The third-tier Lisbon and Oporto stock exchanges, not yet fully recovered from  the stock market crash, are being modernized and combined into a national  bourse. In late April, the government launched an ambitious privatization  program with the sale of a 49% stake in Unicer, the state-owned brewer.    ""We want to create the confidence, confidence on various levels, not just in  the market but also in the financial institutions,"" said Rui Ambrosio Tribolet,  the Lisbon Stock Exchange's general secretary.    But another problem is that Portugal's progress is expected to widen social  divisions.      'Everyone for Himself'    Said Cavalheira Antunes: ""The idea of social solidarity is regressing and the  idea of everyone for himself is coming out on top.""    Portugal lags behind its neighbors on many counts.    At about $3,700, its per capita GDP is Europe's lowest. It has the worst  literacy rate and one of the highest infant mortality rates.    Portugal imports 80% of its energy and, surprisingly, half its food, even  though one-fifth of the population works in agriculture.    The country is extremely dependent on tourism.

0,FT944-16107 ,"FT944-16107 _AN-EJND7AGLFT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / Property: Great expectations in Pretoria - South Africa's market is poised for growth      By DONALD NEWELL   With its immense natural resources and financial, professional and legal infrastructure, South Africa is well placed to attract the foreign investment needed to underpin President Nelson Mandela's ambitious programme of economic revitalisation. After three years of negligible growth, the economy is forecast to grow by 3.5 per cent this year; inflation has fallen to a 20-year low of 7 per cent, before recently nudging up to 8.2 per cent. Recent foreign corporate arrivals in South Africa include aircraft and car manufacturer Deutsche Aerospace, insurer Irish Life and Swedish consumer goods group Electrolux. There are great expectations of the tourism sector, with some observers forecasting 12-20 per cent expansion over the next few years. The number of tourists has increased sharply over the past three years but still amounts to only 650,000 a year (compared with Kenya's 4m a year). All this increased business activity will benefit the commercial property sector through additional demand for space. Ensuring an adequate supply of high-quality commercial and industrial accommodation is therefore an essential carrot with which to attract foreign companies. Public-sector office space is also likely to increase significantly under the government's development programme. Office demand in Johannesburg, the commercial hub, and Pretoria, the capital, will be markedly affected by government demand. The property market's fortunes have reflected those of the broader economy, bumping along the bottom of the cycle. By world standards property prices in South Africa are cheap. State-of-the-art offices are priced at Pounds 4.5-Pounds 6.3 per square metre (compared with central London rates of Pounds 31.5 per sq m); retail levels vary between Pounds 8-Pounds 19 per sq m and industrial property averages at about Pounds 1.8 per sq m Yields for office investments, at 10 per cent, are high by world standards - yields in Dublin are 7 per cent, Amsterdam 7 per cent, Jakarta 8.5 per cent and Chicago 8.5 per cent. Yields on industrials are between 11-12 per cent; regional shopping centres yield between 9-10.5 per cent and community and local shopping investments range between 10.5-12.5 per cent. Vacancy rates for offices in central business districts are high. The vacancy rate for grade A space - top of the market - in central Johannesburg is 16 per cent (10 per cent in 1990) and in Durban 24 per cent (15 per cent four years ago). In Johannesburg, demand for US-style suburban shopping malls is growing. In the suburb of Rosebank, for instance, which contains one of the city's busiest malls, rent at a typical grade A building is about Pounds 6.3 per sq m, while the vacancy is a low 2.5 per cent. Leases are usually for five or 10 years with an annual rent rise which last year averaged 12 per cent. Along with the rest of the economy, the property sector is showing early signs of recovery, a useful encouragement for foreigners contemplating investment. At a recent auction of property in Durban, for instance, a commercial property sold at 10 per cent more than the original reserve. Among local institutional investors, Sanlam, Liberty Life and Old Mutual - all insurers - are the most active. Old Mutual predicts that rentals will double over the next 4-5 years. Development activity is picking up too. Johannesburg Consolidated Investments, a diversified industrial and mining group, is developing a 225,000 sq m building in the suburb of Sandton for Alexander Forbes Consultants and Actuaries (part of Price Forbes insurance group). Although it is too soon to identify firm trends, the boldest investors could reap benefits by purchasing at this early stage. Many smaller investors, however, are likely to be deterred from making direct property investments because of the high capital requirements. Such potential property investors may therefore take advantage of the unusually high number of listed property unit trusts, a popular investment instrument. The trusts do not incur tax and distribute all their income to unit holders. The income, however, incurs tax with the level determined by the unit holder's individual tax status. The trusts offer a spread of risk by geography and type of property. An average trust will typically yield about 12.5 per cent income return and capital growth potential is considered promising. 'As about 90 per cent of the 14 listed property unit trusts are owned by institutions, this sector is unlikely to slide,' said Mr Les Weil, executive chairman of local property consultants J H Isaacs, and deputy president of the South African Chamber of Business. 'This therefore creates a solid investment vehicle for the smaller investors,' he added. The idea of South African property-owning organisations setting up joint ventures with foreign investors is also gaining currency. Whether joint ventures take off will depend, in large part, on political stability. President Mandela's pledges to deliver better housing, education, health and jobs will form a vital ingredient to long-term political and economic stability. The generally optimistic business outlook is reflected in the chart, which shows a rise in business confidence, particularly in the past 12 months. In the same vein, J H Isaacs forecasts real gross fixed investment to grow by 5-7 per cent this year and 12-15 per cent in 1995, a trend that augers well for the commercial property sector.

0,FT932-12865 ,"FT932-12865 _AN-DD1BPAA0FT 930427   FT  27 APR 93 / Oxfam wants urgent Marshall Plan for Africa: West attacked for lacking political will while IMF/World Bank policies 'hurt but do not work'      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   OXFAM yesterday called on the west to back a Marshall Plan for sub-Saharan Africa, warning that without greater assistance the region's economic crisis is set to deepen. 'Africa is on a knife edge,' Mr David Bryer, director of the Oxford-based charity, told the London launch of its Africa recovery programme. The end of the Cold War, 'fragile' peace in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Mozambique, and the emergence of more representative governments in Africa provided the opening for a western initiative, said Mr Bryer, adding: 'Northern nations have the power to tip the balance: to support the current opportunities for recovery or to sentence the region to a spiralling and agonising decline.' But unless the opportunity were seized, prospects were bleak, Mr Bryer warned. In the words of the charity's 40-page analysis* of the crisis: 'Economic stagnation, social breakdown, decaying infrastructures, crippling debt burdens, ruinous prices for commodity exports, and environmental degradation threaten to retard Africa's development prospects into the next century, with frightening consequences for human welfare.' 'Without recovery, more than 300m people - half the region's population - will be living in poverty by the end of the decade.' The report accuses the west of lacking the political will, contrasting the response to problems of eastern Europe and Russia with 'their neglect for over a decade of Africa's far deeper problems'. Some of Oxfam's sharpest criticism is directed at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, arguing that their policies are 'hurting but not working'. The Fund's 'increasingly damaging role' stems from policy mistakes in the early 1980s, says the report: 'The Fund treated what was a problem of insolvency as one of short-term liquidity, extending short-term loans at high interest rates to cover structural and trade deficits.' The Fund embarked on financing 'what was bound to be a slow process of adjustment and recovery with the wrong resources and the wrong approach . . .'. 'Africa has been paying the price ever since.' It is time for northern governments 'to face up to the fact that the IMF has failed Africa . . .'. 'The time has come either fundamentally to reform the IMF or extricate it from Africa.' The report calls for a write-off or concessional rescheduling of much of the region's external debt. The debt crisis is deepening, says Oxfam. Total external debt in 1992 was Dollars 183bn (Pounds 116bn), including IMF and World Bank debt - Dollars 30bn higher than in 1989 when large scale cancellations began. Multilateral agencies, mainly the World Bank and IMF, accounted for 36 per cent of debt servicing payments in 1991. Neither agency, under existing rules, is permitted to reschedule or write off debt. Tackling the debt burden would be central to Oxfam's five-point recovery programme, which urges western governments to treat Africa with the same sense of urgency and concern that prompted the Marshall Plan. Under the plan, launched at the end of the second world war, the US transferred some 2 per cent of its gross national product to support the rebuilding of post-war Europe. Oxfam will put its debt proposals to the G7 summit in Tokyo in July. Oxfam's recovery programme also calls for: Increased aid flows, moving towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP for aid budgets. Oxfam urges Britain to take a lead by agreeing an extra Pounds 100m in support of Africa's recovery. A fund to help Africa process its commodity exports; the ending of subsidised disposal of agricultural surpluses; reduction of protectionist barriers against Africa's exports. Reform of structural adjustment programmes, including protection for African industries and greater investment in health and education. Strengthening the UN role in aid and peacekeeping; the appointment of one special representative responsible for co-ordinating UN operations. The report says that while the 1980s were grim, 'things are getting steadily worse'. Gains in health and education are being eroded, and as a result 'Africa is being disempowered as the educational gap between itself and other parts of the world widens'. Oxfam's analysis is at odds with the World Bank's appraisal, published last February.* * 'Sub-Saharan countries have achieved significant progress in the last few years. Growth has resumed,' said the Bank. Though it acknowledges the 1990s will be a critical decade, the Bank maintains that there has been general agreement on the merits of its reforms, arguing that 'adjustment has improved the lives of the vast majority of Africa's poor'. * Africa, make or break: Action for recovery, Oxfam, 274 Banbury Road, Oxford OX2 7DZ; tel (0865) 312498/311311 fax 312580 Africa. * * From stagnation to recovery, World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433; tel (202) 4771234 fax 4776391 ***** Our current trends, Africans living in poverty will increase from 218m to 300m - half the poulation - by 2000 The region has 32 of the world's poorest 47 nations It has 10 per cent of the developing world's population but receives over 30 per cent of official aid It relies on aid for 80 per cent of its financial resource flows - 11 per cent of GDP (Asia 1 per cent) Its share of world trade has fallen from 3 per cent in 1970 to just over 1 per cent It receives less than 1 per cent of worldwide foreign investment The slide of commodity prices between 1986 and 1990 cost Africa Dollars 50bn in lost earnings - more than twice the amount received in aid IMF Economic Outlook, Page 6   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

By ROSE ELLEN O'CONNOR, TIMES STAFF WRITER      SANTA ANA      As a young woman in Cambodia, Kol Yon started chewing a concoction of betel  nut, lime juice and thick clumps of tobacco because she wanted the scarlet lips  and black teeth her culture considered beautiful.    Now Kol Yon, 78, says she chews for the sensation on her lips and the nicotine  high. She picks out her ingredients from dozens of products on sale at the  Asian market near her apartment in downtown Santa Ana.    She has never heard, she said, about cancer.    Not far from where Kol Yon and her friends congregate to chew together at an  apartment that doubles as a Buddhist temple, a Spanish-language billboard on  17th Street adorned with a cartoon camel and a flashy convertible promises  young Latinos that a cigarette is suave, or smooth.    Both examples are drawn from the newest front in the state's $220-million war  on tobacco: Orange County's effort to reach minorities who have brought age-old  tobacco customs with them to the United States or -- far more disturbing to  health officials -- who are being attracted to smoking for the first time.    ""They (tobacco companies) need to find new markets because smoking kills off a  lot of their customers, and a lot of others are quitting,"" said Dr. Hildy  Meyers, director of the county's new anti-tobacco campaign.    ""It's kind of obvious where they're going. A lot of promotional and billboard  advertising is aimed at minorities.""    The anti-tobacco campaign will be paid for with the county's share of the  Proposition 99 statewide tax, which added 25 cents to a pack of cigarettes as  of January, 1989, and is expected to net Orange County $2.9 million over the  next two years.    The money will be used to build a network of educational and counseling  services that will work through schools, physicians, clinics and neighborhood  community groups to discourage tobacco use. Health officials are putting the  final touches on a proposal expected to be presented to the Board of  Supervisors in May.    The program, the first comprehensive anti-tobacco effort ever undertaken by the  county, is set to get under way in June.    The theme of the public awareness program echoes that of the state's sometimes  controversial anti-tobacco billboard and broadcast advertising blitz. Since it  was unveiled two weeks ago, several television stations have refused to run  some of the ads, saying they are unfair to the tobacco industry.    Like the state, the county will target minorities, who health officials say are  being exploited by cigarette advertising. Those considered most vulnerable,  according to the county's target list, are blacks, Latinos, Asians and  teen-agers. The county campaign will also focus on those who face the greatest  risk from tobacco smoke: women and teen-age girls who are pregnant.    Among the trends most disturbing to health officials is the apparent increase  in cigarette use among female members of minority groups. Smoking rates among  young female Asian and Latino immigrants, for example, have tended to be lower  than the rates among young Anglo females born in the United States. But as  these young immigrant women have become more westernized, their smoking rates  have climbed, health officials said.    These young women are among the most likely to be attracted by cigarette ads  that stress sophistication and liberation, officials said.    Young male Latinos, whose smoking rates are far higher than their Anglo  counterparts, are also increasingly targeted by cigarette advertising, health  officials said.    Meyers cites a 1987 study by a private health research group that reported the  tobacco industry spent $490.7 million on advertising aimed at Latinos living in  the United States, more than a 20% increase over the year before.    ""The cigarette marketing people are very clever so the health department people  need to be,"" explains Nampet Panchipant-M, director of immigrant services for  the county health department and one of the coordinators of the anti-smoking  campaign.    As part of their counterattack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour  multilingual hot line to offer advice and counseling referrals to smokers or  relatives of those who smoke within minority populations.    The dangers of secondary smoke, especially to pregnant women, will be given  heavy emphasis in the county campaign. Pregnant women who call the hot line,  for example, might be offered advice on reducing their exposure to cigarettes  even if they don't smoke, but live or work closely with a smoker.    County officials are quick to acknowledge, however, that they must place their  greatest emphasis on work outside their offices and within the community. The  addition of three ""bilingual and bicultural"" health educators was recommended  in an earlier report to the Board of Supervisors to help bridge both language  and cultural gaps.    ""We're going to have to go where the target population is,"" said Panchipant-M,  herself a native of Thailand. ""If we say you can come to our clinic and we'll  help you, they're not going to come. . . .""    Health department officials say they will borrow a page of the tobacco  industry's advertising manual by trying to come up with themes that target  specific ethnic groups.    As an example, officials point to a Spanish-language brochure produced by the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which they say capitalizes on the  Latino culture's traditionally close-knit families. Rather than stressing only  the benefits to an individual's health, the brochure urges smokers to quit for  the sake of their loved ones.    On the other hand, messages aimed at Asian smokers, Panchipant-M said, must be  carefully worded to politely suggest that they consider quitting while avoiding  a more direct message that would be considered culturally rude.    In any case, reaching the diverse Asian community with an effective  anti-tobacco campaign will be a formidable task.    Simply put, Panchipant M said, there is no ""unified infrastructure"" for  communicating to the 200,000 Asian-born residents of Orange County. Officials  must shape a message for 17 different population groups, each with distinct  cultures and languages or dialects.    Moreover, some of those population groups -- the Hmong mountain tribes of Laos  recruited by the United States to fight during the Vietnam War, for example --  have no tradition of a written language. Many other immigrants from war-torn  rural areas of Southeast Asia have no formal education and have never learned  to read or write.    For those groups, county officials said they will have to rely heavily on  visual messages and direct person-to-person contact. But beyond literacy  problems lies a more fundamental barrier: the lack of even the most rudimentary  understanding of health issues.    TROUBLESOME TARGET    * The state's $220-million war on tobacco will direct $2.9 million into Orange  County.    * A main target will be the 200,000 Asian-born residents here, but officials  must shape a message for 17 groups, each with distinct languages.    * Some messages must be worded to politely suggest that they quit, while  avoiding a more direct message that would be taken as culturally rude.    * As part of their attack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour  multilingual hot line to offer advice to minority-group smokers.

Health officials are putting the  final touches on a proposal expected to be presented to the Board of  Supervisors in May.    The program, the first comprehensive anti-tobacco effort ever undertaken by the  county, is set to get under way in June.    The theme of the public awareness program echoes that of the state's sometimes  controversial anti-tobacco billboard and broadcast advertising blitz. Since it  was unveiled two weeks ago, several television stations have refused to run  some of the ads, saying they are unfair to the tobacco industry.    Like the state, the county will target minorities, who health officials say are  being exploited by cigarette advertising. Those considered most vulnerable,  according to the county's target list, are blacks, Latinos, Asians and  teen-agers. The county campaign will also focus on those who face the greatest  risk from tobacco smoke: women and teen-age girls who are pregnant.    Among the trends most disturbing to health officials is the apparent increase  in cigarette use among female members of minority groups. Smoking rates among  young female Asian and Latino immigrants, for example, have tended to be lower  than the rates among young Anglo females born in the United States. But as  these young immigrant women have become more westernized, their smoking rates  have climbed, health officials said.    These young women are among the most likely to be attracted by cigarette ads  that stress sophistication and liberation, officials said.    Young male Latinos, whose smoking rates are far higher than their Anglo  counterparts, are also increasingly targeted by cigarette advertising, health  officials said.    Meyers cites a 1987 study by a private health research group that reported the  tobacco industry spent $490.7 million on advertising aimed at Latinos living in  the United States, more than a 20% increase over the year before.    ""The cigarette marketing people are very clever so the health department people  need to be,"" explains Nampet Panchipant-M, director of immigrant services for  the county health department and one of the coordinators of the anti-smoking  campaign.    As part of their counterattack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour  multilingual hot line to offer advice and counseling referrals to smokers or  relatives of those who smoke within minority populations.    The dangers of secondary smoke, especially to pregnant women, will be given  heavy emphasis in the county campaign. Pregnant women who call the hot line,  for example, might be offered advice on reducing their exposure to cigarettes  even if they don't smoke, but live or work closely with a smoker.    County officials are quick to acknowledge, however, that they must place their  greatest emphasis on work outside their offices and within the community. The  addition of three ""bilingual and bicultural"" health educators was recommended  in an earlier report to the Board of Supervisors to help bridge both language  and cultural gaps.    ""We're going to have to go where the target population is,"" said Panchipant-M,  herself a native of Thailand. ""If we say you can come to our clinic and we'll  help you, they're not going to come. . . .""    Health department officials say they will borrow a page of the tobacco  industry's advertising manual by trying to come up with themes that target  specific ethnic groups.    As an example, officials point to a Spanish-language brochure produced by the  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which they say capitalizes on the  Latino culture's traditionally close-knit families. Rather than stressing only  the benefits to an individual's health, the brochure urges smokers to quit for  the sake of their loved ones.    On the other hand, messages aimed at Asian smokers, Panchipant-M said, must be  carefully worded to politely suggest that they consider quitting while avoiding  a more direct message that would be considered culturally rude.    In any case, reaching the diverse Asian community with an effective  anti-tobacco campaign will be a formidable task.    Simply put, Panchipant M said, there is no ""unified infrastructure"" for  communicating to the 200,000 Asian-born residents of Orange County. Officials  must shape a message for 17 different population groups, each with distinct  cultures and languages or dialects.    Moreover, some of those population groups -- the Hmong mountain tribes of Laos  recruited by the United States to fight during the Vietnam War, for example --  have no tradition of a written language. Many other immigrants from war-torn  rural areas of Southeast Asia have no formal education and have never learned  to read or write.    For those groups, county officials said they will have to rely heavily on  visual messages and direct person-to-person contact. But beyond literacy  problems lies a more fundamental barrier: the lack of even the most rudimentary  understanding of health issues.    TROUBLESOME TARGET    * The state's $220-million war on tobacco will direct $2.9 million into Orange  County.    * A main target will be the 200,000 Asian-born residents here, but officials  must shape a message for 17 groups, each with distinct languages.    * Some messages must be worded to politely suggest that they quit, while  avoiding a more direct message that would be taken as culturally rude.    * As part of their attack, county officials hope to set up a 24-hour  multilingual hot line to offer advice to minority-group smokers.

The  average inflation rate was 9.7 percent -- the lowest since 1973  when it was 9.6 percent. Last year's rate was 4.2 percent lower  than 13.9 percent in 1992.    The average annual rates of change in the CPI [Consuer Price  Index] for the higher, middle and lower income groups were 10.2  percent, 9.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively. In 1992 these  rates were 13.3 percent, 14.5 percent and 14.7 percent  respectively.    The average food inflation rate of 6.8 percent for 1993 was  18.6 percent lower than the corresponding rate of 25.3 percent  for 1992. This rate is the lowest since 1971 (3.9 percent).    The price index for housing showed a negative inflation rate  of -01 percent for 1993. This rate has shown a decreasing  tendency since 1989 and is the lowest since 1959 when the index  in this format was started, CSC said.    December's inflation rate was 9.5 percent -- 0.3 percent  higher than November's 9.2 percent. Contributing to this 0.3 per  cent increase were the decrease in the price index for housing  (-0.2 percent) and increases in the price indices for food (0.2  percent), transport (0.1 percent) and all other items (0.2  percent).    December's food inflation rate was 5.2 percent -- 1.3  percent  higher than November's 3.9 percent. Against this, the annual  increase in the price index for all items excluding food was  10.7 percent, ""which indicates that the change in food prices,  notwithstanding the increase, still has a retarding effect on  the inflation rate,"" CSS said.    The monthly increase of 1.1 per cent in the food price index  was due to increases in the price indices for meat (2.8  percent), fruit and nuts (5.5 percent), fish and other seafood  (1.3 percent), coffee, tea and cocoa (0.8 percent) grain  products (0.7 percent), fats and oils (0.4 percent) and sugar  (0.3 percent).    ""These increases were slightly counteracted by decreases in  the price indices for vegetables (-3.5 percent) and milk, cheese  and eggs (0.2 percent),"" CSS said.    The monthly decrease in the housing index (-1.2 percent) was  due to the decrease in interest rates on mortgage bonds.    The fuel price decrease of December 17 was not taken into  account in the CPI for December. The direct effect of this would  be reflected in the inflation rate for January.    In the urban areas, the highest inflation rate of 12.2  percent for December was recorded in the OFS [Orange Free State]  goldfields, while the lowest rate of 8.3 percent occurred in the  Vaal Triangle.    The food price index for Pietermaritzburg showed the lowest  annual increase of 3.3 percent, while the highest of 7.8 percent  was shown in the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage area.    The inflation rate for pensioners was 10.1 percent -- 0.6  percent higher than december's official inflation rate. The  lowest annual rate of increase was recorded in the Port  Elizabeth/Uitenhage area, while the highest of 12.6 percent  occurred in Bloemfontein.    Food prices at chain stores showed an annual increase of 5.3  percent and a monthly increase of 1.0 percent, while those at  the other retailers showed an annual increase of 4.3 percent and  a monthly increase of 1.4 percent.

0,FT934-7748 ,"FT934-7748 _AN-DKRC7AGGFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (5): Business is sitting on its hands and waiting - The recession is ending, inflation is in single figures, but many hurdles remain      By TONY HAWKINS   BARRING dramatic political setbacks, the worst is past for the South African economy. In the closing months of 1993, the country is beginning to emerge from its longest ever recession, with economists predicting marginal GDP growth of around 0.5 per cent this year, accelerating gently to around 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent in 1994. Thus far, the recovery is mainly attributable to the rebound in agriculture from last year's drastic drought, with mining and manufacturing remaining in the doldrums. But from next year all sectors of the economy should start to benefit. The policy environment is markedly friendlier than in the 1980s. Corporate taxes have been cut, inflation is in single digits (9.7 per cent forecast for 1993) for the first time in 20 years, a new tariff structure is about to be launched and both real wages and real interest rates have started to fall. The balance of payments remains a problem area as capital outflows continue and Pretoria is committed to repay over Dollars 1bn annually for the next eight years. Bankers and stockbrokers say the country is underborrowed - which it is, with a foreign debt of Dollars 17.3bn or 15 per cent of GDP - leaving scope to refinance previous commitments. But such rollovers merely provide a breathing space rather than a solution. This suggests that - in the absence of strong export growth - there will be little room for abandoning the financial rand and liberalising exchange controls, at least until 1995. The strength, and duration, of the upturn will depend on three main factors; the new administration's ability to restore confidence to a badly-mauled business sector; developments in the global economy, especially the commodity price cycle, and the economic policy framework that evolves in the 'new' South Africa. There are grounds for cautious optimism on all three counts. A reduction in the violence and general acceptance of the election results, would do wonders for business morale, simultaneously opening the door to a strong upturn in public works spending on housing, electrification and roads. On the policy front, finance minister Derek Keys has managed through the National Economic Forum to put together a middle-of-the-road consensus to secure agreements on resolving the debt standstill, an Dollars 850m IMF loan, future relations with the World Bank and the crucial GATT Uruguay Round submission that will liberalise and streamline South Africa's tariff structure. Disconcerting though the latest EC and Japanese numbers may be, South African economists are modestly confident that the commodity cycle has done its worst and that demand and prices for many of the country's key exports - especially gold - will recover in 1994-95. Even so, the upturn is going to be relatively limp through next year, as investors and businessmen sit on their hands until the elections are out of the way and they have some idea of who will be holding the reins of economic power. Many hope and expect that Mr Keys will retain the finance portfolio, while Dr Chris Stals, whose term as governor of the South African Reserve Bank expires next year, and whose tough monetarism has done so much to reduce inflation, fiscal follies notwithstanding, will be reappointed. Continuation of the Keys-Stals double-act would certainly calm business and banking nerves, abroad as well as at home, providing much-needed continuity and stability. But whether the ANC is ready to allow whites to retain control over key economic management decisions is unclear. Mr Mandela and his close aides may be happy with such a transitional arrangement - for two or three years - but already there are demands lower down the ANC hierarchy for some relaxation of monetary and fiscal policy. Fiscal policy is going to be crucial. While some in the ANC exude moderation, insisting that large tax increases are not necessary, this begs the Dollars 64 000 question - how is the country to fund the proposed social upliftment and job-creation programmes? Professor Dennis Davis, an ANC tax adviser, has suggested increased estate duties along with differential rates of VAT so that some basic necessities can be zero-rated while higher rates are applied to luxuries. Some rationalisation too of tax-breaks seems probable thereby raising the effective rate of corporate tax - from around 20 per cent at present - while leaving the basic rate unchanged at 40 per cent. One senior ANC economist, Mr Tito Mboweni, has ruffled feathers with his suggestion of a once-off 'reconstruction levy,' though this has since been played down. ANC economists believe there is scope to fund upliftment programmes by restructuring government spending. This is questionable; the 'peace dividend' from defence cutbacks has been largely siphoned into increased spending on the police, and in a country where crime levels seem destined to remain uncomfortably high, there is little room for savings. Nor is there going to be any 'apartheid dividend' since the elimination of wasteful, duplicative spending on social services for blacks and whites, will be offset by a larger public service and the need to establish regional governments and structures. Mr Keys himself believes there is likely to be a net increase rather than saving, and sees his job as minimising that 'hump.' One of the conditions of the IMF loan is a reduction in the budget deficit to 6 per cent of GDP in 1994-95, down from the 6.8 per cent forecast for the current year. Mr Keys says that 2 per cent of this represents public sector investment spending, while 2.5 per cent is needed to build up the civil servants pension fund in terms of already-announced political guarantees. He hopes to achieve savings by eliminating the remaining 1.5 per cent of 'discretionary' deficit, but it is hard to square his plans with the social upliftment goal. It has been estimated that racial parity in social service spending would cost almost a quarter of GDP, with education alone requiring 15.4 per cent, more than double the 7.3 per cent provided in 1993-94. Indeed, a 'parity budget' would mean shifting 10 per cent of GDP into the social services budget from a budget total of 28 per cent (excluding debt-service expenditure). Since such a target is out of reach, the likely implication is that the ANC's sweetness and light on the tax front will fall foul of political realism on one hand, and the need to deliver some form of liberation dividend on the other. Cost-recovery in the public sector, in the form of user charges for education and health, targeted initially on the better-off, could well be necessary. The fragile economic strategy consensus will come under strain too on the labour front. While there is broad agreement on the need to put job creation ahead of wage increases, optimism that the lifting of sanctions and increased investment will make a significant dent in unemployment looks misplaced. Unemployment, estimated at a frightening 46 per cent by the SARB, is the most important single challenge that will face the next government. The optimists argue that the SARB's doomsday scenario exaggerates the problem, citing the 1991 census which found that 19 per cent of the workforce were actively seeking jobs, with one quarter of the black workforce falling into this category compared with only 4 per cent of the whites. Critics accuse employment pessimists of ignoring the vibrant, fast-growing informal sector that is crucial to any strategy for easing the crisis. In 1989, the Central Statistical Service (CSS) estimated that there were some 304,000 fulltime black informal sector operators in South Africa to which can be added 1.9m part-time informal sector entrepreneurs and 350,000 employees, making more than 2.5m or almost a third of the economically-active black population. Unfortunately though, much of this informal sector activity is described as 'survival' rather than 'voluntary' entrepreneurship, implying that many self-employed would sooner have a formal sector job. The formal sector employment conundrum raises a question that few South Africans feel confident to answer: where can the new South Africa develop competitive advantage? Primary sector activities with value-added through beneficiation of minerals is perhaps the most obvious answer, but hardly reassuring given the probability of continued sluggish growth in primary product demand and the possibility of ongoing excess capacity. In any event, such operations are highly capital intensive, creating few jobs. The finance minister is optimistic though, pointing out that Samcor, which assembles vehicles, takes 34 hours to produce a motor car compared with 44 hours in Western Europe. In the pulp industry, productivity is higher at one South African plant than in Germany, 'We have nothing to worry about in terms of productivity,' says Mr Keys confidently, arguing that low black worker productivity under the apartheid system reflected demotivation. 'There was nothing in it for them.' Black people could not move to better areas, nicer homes or send their children to better schools. They were not motivated to improve productivity. South African businessmen acknowledge that they cannot expect to match the Asians in terms of costs, work ethic or productivity. Their competitive edge is in resource-intensive activities, low-cost energy, a superb infrastructure, and in services such as banking and information technology. In manufacturing though, competitive advantage will depend on investing in skills, technology and training and since this kind of investment does not yield quick returns, success in manufacturing is more likely to be found in niche operations than in any single industry. Even if the foreign investor is satisfied that the country has put political violence and instability behind it and has the capacity to develop competitive advantage in specific areas, the nagging question remains: why should South Africa be different from the rest of the continent? Mr Keys brushes all doubts aside. 'South Africa is totally different - always has been,' he says, putting his finger on what few would dispute is the country's single most important advantage - its powerful, battle-hardened, diversified private sector. 'We have' he says, 'a lot of indigenous capital here making a return and which has every intention of going on doing that.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT922-4982 ,"FT922-4982 _AN-CFCAXAAMFT 920603   FT  03 JUN 92 / ANC economic policy praised by government      By PHILIP GAWITH and REUTER      JOHANNESBURG, TOKYO   THE South African government yesterday described new economic policies adopted by the African National Congress last weekend as 'pragmatic'. The ANC concluded a conference on Sunday where a comprehensive set of policy guidelines was adopted, revising the organisation's economic stance for the first time since 1955. Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said ANC economic policies represented a 'very material advance' on those of two years ago. He said they meant 'it should not be impossible to agree a growth strategy'. His comments raise the prospect for the first time of a constructive economic dialogue between the National Party and the ANC. It improves the chances of agreement being reached in the Economic Forum, set up last month to map out future strategy. The forum is made up of representatives from the business community, trade unions and the government. He said there were three economic problems the government was in a position to address. These were the high individual tax burden, high interest rates and inflation. Mr Keys said a lower level of government spending would help alleviate these problems and said he would begin his campaign 'to reduce in real terms the level of government spending' this month. On corporate taxes, Mr Keys said he would favour the dispensation that gives the best growth prospects. 'It may be the one with lower tax rates, but it may not be.' He argued that areas where co-operation was required to make progress were unemployment and investment. He warned that what he called the 'economic civil war' had to be stopped if the South African economy was going to recover. This involved stopping political wars being fought on economic terrain - such as over the issue of sanctions. He also called for 'sensible wage bargaining'. Mr Keys said South Africa needed to invest more than 25 per cent of its gross domestic product (compared to 18-19 per cent now) if the growth rate was to keep pace with the birth rate. Achieving this required greater investor confidence, he said. On foreign investment Mr Keys said: 'I don't think in practice it will be found possible to impose conditions on foreign investment that foreign investment doesn't want to have imposed on it.' The South African president, FW de Klerk, will face calls in Tokyo today formally to scrap the 'honorary white' status granted to Japanese more than 30 years ago, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Human rights groups want the prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, to discuss the 'shameful' issue with Mr De Klerk. Mr Akira Kusuhara, a human rights spokesman, said the status was introduced in the 1960s at a time when Japan was experiencing high growth which South Africa wanted to take advantage of.

0,FT922-4425 ,"FT922-4425 _AN-CFEA9AD3FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (17): Daunting burden of development  -Tough social problems loom      By PATTI WALDMEIR   'WE ALL, whites and blacks, think we're entitled to Swedish social security, but with Polish GDP. It won't work like that,' says Mr John Kane-Berman, director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, highlighting the most daunting problem of the post-apartheid era: how to meet the enormous economic expectations raised by the prospect of black rule. For any new government will immediately face one grim truth: that South Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards overnight to white levels, and there is no explosion of economic growth on the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs. South Africa's under-educated population lacks the skills needed for economic revolution along Far Eastern lines. And over the next generation, the sheer weight of numbers will depress efforts at economic upliftment: by 2010, South Africa's 1980 population of 29.1m will have nearly doubled to 59.7m, according to the Urban Foundation, a business-funded policy institute. It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task of housing, educating and employing nearly 60m people. Black South Africans may well find that life remains a struggle. The first post-apartheid government will inherit a country where, in the words of the authoritative Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and Development in Southern Africa, published in 1989, 'poverty is deep and widespread and . . . the degree of inequality is as great as in any other country in the world.' For a nation so advanced - the World Bank classifies it as an upper middle-income developing country - the extent of poverty is striking. The charity Operation Hunger feeds 1.8m people daily, victims of the three-year recession and this year's catastrophic drought. In 1989, 40 per cent of the population (excluding the nominally independent homelands where poverty is rife) is estimated to have lived below the so-called 'minimum living level' or poverty line. A recent IMF report* notes that in terms of social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality 'black South Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy'. The gap between white and black incomes further emphasises black deprivation: according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa, though black incomes have risen more than white incomes in recent years, the white share of total personal income was 54 per cent in 1988 (whites are 13 per cent of the population) while blacks representing nearly 80 per cent of the population had a 36 per cent share. Apartheid has ensured that state spending on social services is similarly skewed. According to the IMF, government spent R4,087 per capita educating whites in 1990, and only R907 on blacks, R2,406 for coloureds and R3,055 for Asians. Pensions, which are a principal source of income for the poorest South Africans, are also unequal: whites get a R345 monthly payment, blacks R293. Health spending is also distorted. And while whites are all at least decently housed - South African cities boast some of the world's most luxurious suburbs on earth - over more than 7m non-whites live in informal urban dwellings such as shacks. Racial disparities in social spending have narrowed substantially in recent years, and the government has devoted an extra R3bn of extra-budgetary funds for special education and housing projects. But the cost of introducing per capita parity between races would be extremely high. The IMF report states: 'Equalising spending levels at the present white level would result in an overall level of social spending dramatically beyond the capacity of the budget.' It notes that overall spending on education and health (though not on pensions) is already high in relation to GDP: indeed, education spending, as a share of the budget and of GDP, substantially exceeded not only that of middle-income countries, but also industrial nations. Abolishing the senseless duplications of apartheid would generate some savings: the new South Africa will not need 15 racially-based departments of finance, 15 education departments and 14 health ministries, complete with Mercedes-driving ministers in each one. But the cost of reincorporation is likely to exceed any savings: to raise per capita socio-economic spending on homeland blacks to the level which prevails in the Republic would mean a 38 per cent overall increase. And given that independence governments elsewhere in Africa have tended to increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it, there seems little chance that bloated homeland civil services or central government will be streamlined. The IMF report concludes: 'The scope for further compressing non-social spending (eg defence) . . . is limited and therefore implies that social expenditures will need to be re-ordered if the budget is to attend to the needs of the least privileged groups of society without significant resort to deficit financing or to higher taxes.' What this means in practice, according to minister of (black) education and training, Sam de Beer, is that if South Africa continues to spend 6 per cent of GDP on education (assuming 3 per cent overall economic growth and a 1:32 pupil/teacher ratio), government will be able to finance only seven years of compulsory education by 2000. The inevitable conclusion is the one drawn by the late Mr Simon Brand, formerly Development Bank chairman: 'We don't have the resources for the kind of welfare state we have been running for whites.' Substantially increasing taxes to fund greater social spending on blacks would be counter-productive, the IMF argues: 'The tax burden on the white community appears to be relatively high even by industrial country standards. This would argue against raising tax rates in South Africa and running the risk of heightening disincentive effects.' The IMF concludes: 'Redistribution policies will need to be firmly supported by growth-orientated policies if the social spending gap is to be effectively bridged.' For without economic growth, very little progress can be made toward a more economically just society. Yet sustaining growth at the 3.5 per cent required for what the IMF calls a 'meaningful increase in living standards' - during a period of great political and social turmoil - could well prove a tall order.* Economic Policies for a New South Africa, IMF, January 1992.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EDUCATION INDICATORS IN 1990*  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           White   Black   Coloured   Asian  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pupils (m)                 1.0     7.7       0.9      0.3 Pupil/teacher             18.6    40.8      23.3     21.7 Expenditure/pupil (R)    4,087     907     2,406    3,055  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Including public ordinary schools, secondary schools and technical training colleges  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: South Africa department of National Education: IMF staff estimates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SELECTED SOCIAL INDICATORS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year                            White   Coloured   Asian   Black  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Life expectancy at birth                                          (in years) 1970                            68.5      58.0      62.5 1979                            69.9      61.5      64.8 1980*                           69.5      58.6      65.5    58.5                                            Literacy                                   (rates of adult literacy) 1970                            98.0      69.0      74.0 1979                            99.3      84.5      92.4 1980                            99.3      84.5      92.4    67.0                                        Infant mortality                                (deaths per 1,000 live births) 1950                            35.7     134.3      68.5   165.0 1960                            29.6     128.6      59.6    95.0 1970                            21.6     133.5      36.4    85.0 1980                            13.1      60.7      24.4    70.0 1988                            13.2      57.5      17.4    57.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *1980 figures are computed at age 12 months  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sources: Eckert (1986); South African Department of Information, Official Yearbook of the Republic of South Africa; Department of National health and Population, 1990 Health Trends in South Africa  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page VIII  "
0,FT923-3216 ,"FT923-3216 _AN-CINBUADSFT 920914   FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (3): Miracles need a long haul - Tony Hawkins takes an overview of the economic prospects      By TONY HAWKINS   ONLY a handful of third world countries in East Asia have made the difficult leap from factor-driven growth, exploiting abundant low-cost labour or rich natural resources, to a modern, investment-driven economy. Mauritius, having already exploited to the full its narrow resource base, will try during the 1990s to make this transition to a skills-intensive, service-led economy. It has little choice, because employment of both labour and land is forcing it upmarket into territory where, today at least, it has no obvious comparative advantage. International trends are forcing it along a new, more difficult, growth path too. Liberalisation of the world trading system - especially the phasing out of the multi-fibre agreement (MFA) - will remove an important source of past competitive advantage in the form of preferences in the European Community, while reform of the EC's common agricultural policy will hurt the sugar sector. With two of the island's three economic pillars, clothing and sugar, under threat from global forces, as well as domestic constraints, the third pillar, tourism, will have to be supplemented by new sources of growth. The trick in the 1990s will be to 'grow' new competitive advantage, especially in services: offshore banking and other business services, a free port, increased tourism, diversified agriculture and manufacturing; in the same way as it successfully developed into a world-class exporter of knitwear over the last decade. But it is going be more difficult this time round, partly because there is no longer a pool of skilled and semi-skilled workers to exploit, but also because the world of the 1990s threatens to be far more competitive. Mauritius expects to lose some of its preferential advantage in the single European market to low-cost manufacturers like Greece and Portugal, while facing tougher competition from other third world exporters if and when the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation measures is implemented. Following the important structural reforms of the early 1980s, the Mauritian economy has grown at almost 6 per cent a year, with the main thrust coming from the export processing zone( EPZ), dominated by clothing manufacturers, whose share of GDP more than doubled from 6 per cent in 1984 to 14 per cent last year. Sugar, the traditional locomotive of growth, whose reinvested profits fuelled both industrial and tourism expansion, still accounts for 10 per cent of GDP, while tourism's direct share, at 3 per cent, much understates its real importance as a foreign currency earner (16 per cent of the total) and as a source of employment. Growth prospects have deteriorated with the onset of full employment. EPZ growth slowed dramatically from more than 30 per cent annually in the mid-1980s, to an average 7 per cent a year since 1987. This reflected intensified competition in global markets, some loss of competitiveness as wage inflation took hold, and the tightening labour constraint as unemployment fell below 3 per cent last year from 19 per cent in 1983. Despite this, EPZ expansion still accounts for more than a fifth of post-1987 economic growth. By contrast, the sugar sector has gone backwards, with value-added declining 6 per cent over the past five years The bulk of growth (60 per cent) has come from services, with the finance sector, on which great hopes are pinned, expanding at more than 6.5 per cent a year. The balance of payments is healthy: a current account deficit of MR274m (Dollars 20m), 0.7 per cent of GDP. Mauritius has a large trade deficit of MR3.3bn (Dollars 235m), but this will be more than offset by tourist earnings of over MR4bn in 1992, while capital inflows, in recent years, have averaged MR1.5bn. External debt is modest at Dollars 938m (1990), with a debt-service ratio of 6 per cent. Hopes of maintaining growth at 6 per cent look optimistic. The signs are that Mauritius will have to settle for a more sedate 4 per cent growth rate in the 1990s, although this year GDP is forecast to rise 6.5 per cent, chiefly on the strength of a recovery in the sugar sector following last year's drought. Export processing zone (EPZ) diversification - with reduced dependence on clothing in favour of electronics, watch assembly, jewellery manufacture - has not yet materialised. There is a strong feeling that the Free Zone firms would do better to stick (literally) to their knitting. At present almost 85 per cent of EPZ workers are employed in the garment industry, with another 6 per cent in textiles, and this sectoral concentration has been increasing. The Mauritian education system is well equipped to provide the type of worker required for relatively low-skill clothing manufacture, but its capacity to turn out workers capable of operating high-tech state-of-the-art equipment, and people trained to staff and manage entrepreneurial service activities, is very much in doubt. Even if indigenous skills can be developed, there are just not enough pairs of hands to go round. This means not only that labour participation rates must rise, with more women being enticed to take jobs - participation rates are twice as high among men - but also that productivity growth must be secured from substantial new investment in both the software and hardware of modern business. Traditionally, growth and diversification has depended heavily on the reinvested surpluses of the sugar sector. But with sugar profitability on the wane, new sources of savings will have to be found. The 1992 budget tackles this problem, with a raft of new savings incentives targeted specifically at stock market investment. Unlike the Asian tigers, Mauritius is not a significant player in the inward investment game, attracting less than Dollars 150m in new foreign capital inflows during the 1980s. Investment has therefore been dependent on domestic savings levels which, fortunately, have averaged 27 per cent of GDP in recent years, sufficient for GDP growth of at least 5 per cent a year, given existing rates of investment efficiency. As sugar surpluses fall, however, so Mauritius will need to attract more foreign interest - not just financial inflows, but the even more important inputs of technology, expertise and access to markets, to brandnames and subcontracting arrangements. Attracting these inflows is not going to be easy; with a GDP of less than Dollars 3.5bn, the domestic market has little to offer. Government ministers believe that the improved economic prospects in the island's natural hinterland - east and southern Africa - will turn Mauritius into an attractive location for entrepot business, interfacing between Africa and south-east Asia; for regional headquarters for multinational companies as well for the offshore banking and financial services. Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, sees post-apartheid South Africa as the locomotive most likely to start up the regional economy. But there is an element of wishful thinking in this regional service centre picture, given the continuing - indeed, accelerating - marginalisation of Africa and the probability of only a sluggish South African economy for the next few years at least. Even if the plan were to come good, it is very much a long-haul one. The upbeat side of it is the Mauritian track record. Given the transformation in little more than a decade from sugar mono-economy to a finely-balanced three-legged stool - sugar, clothing and tourism - the islanders' resilience and resourcefulness should not be underestimated. Mr Sithanen has started well by rationalising domestic monetary and tax policies to increase savings and investment, while also abolishing what remained of exchange controls. There is more to be done. For all its reputation as a liberal, outward-oriented economy, Mauritius today has more price controls than five 5 years ago; its system of centralised wage-bargaining is a drag on industrial and commercial efficiency. Mr Sithanen acknowledges that the public sector is overmanned, agreeing that labour must be retrained and redeployed; the sugar milling sector needs to be rationalised to reduce the number of mills and thereby improving efficiency, and the one-stop investment shop at the ministry of industry needs to be streamlined. Above all, the Mauritian miracle is going to run out of steam unless it can revitalise its human sector. Two elements are crucial. The first is the will to win, and many doubt whether the cheerful, easy-going Mauritian people, increasingly accustomed to rapidly-improving living standards (per capita income have risen 70 per cent since 1980 - have that killer instinct. Second, and perhaps more importantly, they may not have the core competencies necessary to succeed in a world where low-cost labour is no longer a passport to economic growth. Developing new attitudes and new competencies will - like financial sector growth  - be a long haul.  ----------------------------------------------------------- GDP GROWTH RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years                          Annual growth rates  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980                           -10.1 1981                             6.4 1982                             5.8 1983                             0.4 1984                             4.7 1985                             6.8 1986                             8.9 1987                             8.4 1988                             6.1 1989                             4.7 1990                             7.1 1991                             4.6 1992*                            6.5  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------- INFLATION  ----------------------------------------------------------- Years     Annual %  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1980      42 1981      14.5 1982      11.4 1983      5.6 1984      7.3 1985      6.7 1986      1.8 1987      0.6 1988      9.2 1989      12.6 1990      13.5 1991      7.0 1992*      5.0  ----------------------------------------------------------- *Forecast Source: Central Statistical Office, St Louis  -----------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------              BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (MRs in millions)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiscal years                   1989-1990     1990-1991     1991-1992  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Exports                        15,925        18,166        19,499 Imports                        20,019        21,971        22,846 Trade deficit                  -4,094        -3,805        -3,347 Net invisibles                 +2,228        +2,945        +3,073 Current account deficit        -1,866        -860          -274 Net capital                    +1,409        +1,714        +1,428 Unrecorded flows               +3,498        +2,259        +1,894 Overall balance                +3,041        +3,113        +3,048  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Bank of Mauritius  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page II  "
0,FT943-5793 ,"FT943-5793 _AN-EICAFABGFT 940902   FT  02 SEP 94 / Falling prosperity hurts family planning      By PAUL ADAMS      LAGOS   In a continent where population growth outstrips economic growth, Nigeria at 90m people is by far the biggest nation in Africa. Until 1988, when Prof Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, then health minister, launched a national population policy, Nigerians had been so proud of their self-styled tag as the 'giant of Africa' that, as long as the oil money rolled in, they regarded high population growth as healthy and saw little point in controlling the rate of growth. Nigeria was then believed to have at least 110m people, putting it among the 10 largest populations in the world. The 1991 census caused a surprise: Nigeria had only 88.5m. The over-estimate was a result of inflated numbers by tribal chiefs and regional governors hoping to boost their political clout and revenue allocation. The United Nations Population Fund has projected the average population growth rate between 1990 and 1995 as 3.1 per cent (which would double the population in about 30 years) with the birth rate at 45 per 1,000 persons and death rate at 14 per 1,000 (including an infant mortality rate of 96). The UN estimates the fertility rate at 6.1 children per woman, while the national policy set a target of only four. Since the 1970s the urban population has risen from 30 per cent to nearly half and the rate of growth in the towns is higher at 5.5 per cent. Generalising about Nigeria, a country of over 200 ethnic groups and very diverse cultures, is often deceptive and never more so than in attitudes to education and the role of women. In the mainly Christian south, female education and literacy are far higher than in the predominantly Moslem north, where even the discussion of birth control is not widely accepted. In the south-east there is a high percentage of Catholics especially among the Ibo tribe. The alarming decline in social services during the 1990s has halted the progress towards family planning clinics and universal primary education, especially in the north, bolstering the influence of the Koranic schools. Even nationally, the UN paints a bleak picture. 'The status of women in Nigeria has improved little over the last decade. In general, they are considered second-class citizens not by law but because of the social and cultural climate', says the UNFPA's 1993 review of the national programme. The literacy rate for women was 31 per cent (54 per cent for men) and more than half of all Nigerian women were married at the age of 15. The problem of education lies not just with women. As a prominent women's group in Nigeria points out, there may be a target of four children per woman, but in a polygamous society many men far exceed that figure. If the prospect of curtailing population growth is limited, the outlook for economic growth has become bleak. Despite the massive oil boom in the 1970s, the GDP income per capita is down to around Dollars 290, about the level of 1963. In the period, Indonesia has risen from a lower per capita income to a level three times that of Nigeria. In January's budget speech the finance minister, Mr Kalu I Kalu, commented on three years of political uncertainty, capital flight government over-spending, which 'resulted in a further decline in GDP growth rate from 4.8 per cent in 1991 to 2.9 per cent in 1993. A comparison with the average growth rate of 5 per cent from 1988-91 demonstrates the enormity of the task involved in resuscitating the economy in 1994 and beyond,' concluded Mr Kalu. Since then strikes, shortages and a dearth of foreign exchange have taken the economy further down hill. Nigeria accounts for about half of West Africa's population and whereas Ghanaians once poured into Nigeria for a better life, the chances of reverse migration look more likely.

0,FT933-923 ,"FT933-923 _AN-DI0BZAA9FT 930927   FT  27 SEP 93 / Lurking threat of a first world debt crisis      By EDWARD BALLS   'IS THE Debt Crisis Over?' the International Monetary Fund asks in a supplementary chapter to its latest World Economic Outlook. But which debt crisis is really on the Fund's mind? Ask finance ministers from sub-Saharan Africa whether their debt crisis is over and the answer would be an emphatic No. For, as the IMF also points out, interest and amortisation payments now consume nearly a quarter of the continent's export earnings every year, far higher than in any other region of the world. The IMF says that heavily indebted, low-income countries need substantial debt reduction. Oxfam, the international aid agency, advocates debt relief using the Trinidad terms, which allow for a two-thirds debt reduction. The World Bank says, in private, that even this does not go far enough. So far, sub-Saharan debt relief has not gone very far at all. But ask a group of bankers in New York and London whether the third world debt crisis is over and the answer will be a relieved Yes. Countries accounting for about 80 per cent of the commercial bank debt which had to be rescheduled in the 1980s have now participated in debt restructuring. These have lowered the net present value of repayments by a third, while banks have made provision to cover their remaining exposure. The international financial system, the IMF concludes, is no longer at risk from a widespread third world debt default. Yet, as this risk has receded, so others have taken its place. While commercial banks were removing third world debts from their balance sheets in the late 1980s, they were simultaneously engaging in another bout of speculative lending, this time to consumers and property developers in London and Tokyo and across the US. Once more, a rise in world interest rates turned many of these loans into bad debts, this time with much more severe effects on developed-country growth. The hangover from the debt binge of the late 1980s helps explain why the IMF is now exercised by the threat of a new debt crisis. For the combination of public spending pressures, high interest rates and persistently slow growth has produced large budget deficits in many developed countries, particularly in Europe. The combined budget deficit of European Community members is expected to be 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product this year. The US budget deficit peaked in the 1980s at only 4.1 per cent of GDP. Judging whether developed-country fiscal policies are sustainable is a tricky business. Governments, unlike private individuals, cannot actually go bankrupt, and even severely indebted developed-country governments have still been able to borrow from the capital markets. But, as the IMF points out, the share of net public debt in GDP can only rise for so long before troubles begin. A rising debt-GDP ratio means a growing share of interest payments in the budget, making the government increasingly vulnerable to a sharp rise in interest rates if the capital markets start to worry that the government might be tempted to inflate away the debt, as Italy and more recently Belgium have discovered. The IMF has calculated the budget deficits that developed-country governments would need in order to stabilise their net debt ratios, given projected growth rates and real interest rates. The chart compares these calculations, both this year and in 1998, to the actual deficits that the IMF expects to prevail. The message is clear. Japan has no fiscal difficulties, while Italy and the US plan actions which should bring debt ratios under control by 1998. But Germany, France and the UK all face medium-term deficits which imply rising debt ratios. The UK, in particular, is on an explosive course: by 1998, its budget deficit is expected to remain more than twice as great as that needed to stabilise its debt ratio. Little wonder the IMF privately fears that the debt threat is moving north. These days it is the build-up of first world debt, not Africa's lingering crisis, that haunts the sleep of IMF officials.

0,FT943-12701 ,"FT943-12701 _AN-EGXAHABVFT 940723   FT  23 JUL 94 / The sounds of a continent cracking: The west must recognise its self-interest in dealing with the crisis engulfing Africa      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   'The record is grim and it is no exaggeration to talk of crisis . . . What is needed is a new kind of social compact, an agreement within the world community that the struggle against poverty in Africa is a joint concern which entails responsibilities for both parties'  - World Bank, 1981 The warnings have gone unheeded. Now come signs of a continent under intolerable strain, poised between crisis and catastrophe, lacking both the capacity and the will to implement economic and political reforms. Rwanda is the latest in Africa's roll call of disasters over the past 20 years, during which at least 10m people have died and as many have become refugees. For some governments, the strain has proved too much. Zaire, almost straddling the waist of Africa, is less a state than a collection of fiefdoms. Sudan, Africa's largest country, has been destroyed by civil war, and Sierra Leone, Liberia, Somalia, Angola are joining them. Worse may be to come, for two of Africa's most important countries are now at risk: Nigeria in the west and Kenya in the east are both showing signs of stress. Nigeria's leaders squandered Dollars 100bn of oil earnings over the decade of the oil boom from the 1970s to the early 1990s. External debt, currently Dollars 34bn, rises by Dollars 6bn a year, the civil service is undermined by political interference and corruption, per capita gross domestic product has halved since 1980, the fault line is deepening between Moslem north and Christian south. Meanwhile Kenya is battling against impossible odds. Its population has tripled over the past 20 years to 25m, land hunger grows, unemployment rises, and 400,000 school-leavers compete annually for 20,000 jobs in formal employment. Corruption and vested interests stand in the way of effective reform. Meanwhile Africa's rare 'success stories' such as Ghana and Uganda, are not inspiring. 'Current growth rates among the best (emphasis added) African performers are still too low to reduce poverty much in the next two or three decades,' warned a recent World Bank review. The Bank's hopes, back in 1989, that African economies could grow at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent proved optimistic. Growth has been barely half that, well below the region's 3.2 per cent annual rise in population. Unless Sub-Saharan Africa's 'poor' economic policies improve, it will be 40 years before the region returns to its per capita income of the mid-1970s, says the Bank. Dissenting voices suggest ways out of the predicament. 'More aid]' cries one. But aid has increased and the crisis deepens. Net aid transfers to Africa increased from 5.6 per cent of regional GDP in the early 1970s to 8.3 per cent in the late 70s, reaching 11.7 per cent of GDP by 1990. Sub-Saharan Africa's share of global aid is up to 38 per cent in 1991 from 17 per cent in 1970. A decade of structural adjustment, and net aid flows of Dollars 170bn, has stemmed the region's decline but not launched a revival. 'Reform the international trading system,' cry others, pointing to Africa's deteriorating terms of trade. Perhaps, comes the response, but why has Africa lost its market share of cocoa, tea, coffee to other third world countries who live under the same system? 'Foreign investment is the key,' say others. But who will invest in a continent where the infrastructure has deteriorated, skills are in short supply, and instability endemic? 'Impose democracy by making aid conditional on good governance,' say western governments. But democracy isn't working; and +++++++ End of Leg 3 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ the World Bank's report on the 'east Asian miracle' suggests there is not necessarily a link, says another. What can be done? First, the World Bank, the continent's leading donor, and the aid agencies must find common cause. Africa needs their vigorous lobbying of the west's decision makers. John Clark, who used to work with Oxfam, put it well in his book, Democratising Development: The Role of Voluntary Organisations. Non-governmental organisations, he says, 'will make little headway unless their ideas are grounded in economic reality and unless they search for positive as well as negative lessons within the programmes of the World Bank and other practitioners of development orthodoxy.' Once there is agreement on the economic and political agenda, non-governmental organisations should play a greater role. In certain countries, where the mangement capacity of government is weak, NGOs should run primary health care, or primary education, or drought relief. The private sector should make investment decisions, rather than aid workers without the necessary skills. Increase transparency. Too often donors are willing to conceal what they know of corruption in African governments. They fail to insist on minimum levels of accountability and access to information. By withholding or denying African electorates information about structural adjustment programmes, they stifle debate about economic policy. Constitution making. Hopes for the revival of democracy will be dashed unless Africa draws up constitutions which take account of ethnic, religious and regional differences. Rebuild the parties and institutions of democratic government. Set levels of military spending at a percentage of GDP below spending on housing, education and health. Radical measures to ease Africa's debt burden should be accompanied by tougher monitoring of reform policies, including donor officials in institutions such as central banks and finance ministries. If governments are not willing to embrace structural adjustment and good governance requirements, then donors should only finance humanitarian projects. Above all, the west must be motivated by self-interest as much as compassion in its response to the African crisis. Possible solutions will only be implemented when an ailing Africa is seen as a threat and as a loss. As Africa's economy declines, so immigration to southern Europe will rise; Moslem extremism will intensify; drug-trafficking will increase; disease, whether Aids or the discovery of bubonic plague in Zaire, will pose a serious health problem; environmental erosion or neglect will lead to the destruction of valuable flora and fauna. Africa cannot be ring-fenced: and the longer a co-ordinated response to its crisis is postponed, the more daunting become the problems and more serious the consequences of failure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  AFRICA: FROM CRISIS TO CATASTROPHE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ETHNIC AND RELIGIOUS CONFLICTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country            Group      Major armed      Refugees from                  rebellion*    conflict**       the country                                                   ('000)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1980-89       1989-92          1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Mozambique           no            yes           1,730 Somalia             yes            yes             870 Ethiopia            yes            yes             840 Liberia              no            yes             670 Angola              yes            yes             400 Sudan               yes            yes             270  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Non-state armed groups of over 1,000 fighters, in conflict with other such groups **Involving more than 1,000 battle-related deaths with government forces  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           WORLD LENDING RELATIVE TO MILITARY SPENDING  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Country         Military        Average annual       Loans as                 expenditures    World Bank loans     % of total                as % of GDP      per capita          World Bank Loans                                  (dollars)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Major rise in military spending  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1960    1990     1960s  1989-91     1960s   1989-91  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ethiopia        1.6     13.5      10.2     77.4        1.0     0.4 Tanzania        0.1      6.9       5.3    283.0        0.5     1.3 Zambia          1.1      3.2       5.7     92.7        0.5     0.4 Burkino Faso    0.6      2.8       0.1     68.2        0.0     0.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Bush said they plan to visit the  new baby in the next month.    Neil Bush, now a 34-year-old oilman, suffered as a child from dyslexia -- a  learning disability that causes letters and words to be perceived backwards.

Group net freight revenue rose to NKr1.79bn from NKr1.58bn as operating profit increased to NKr274m from NKr218m. The shipowner posted a nine-month financial profit of NKr48m against a financial loss of NKr83m during last year's comparative interim. Hoegh said the improvement was due to a rise in net interest income to NKr64m from NKr58m, a decline in foreign currency losses to NKr24m from NKr38m and a drop in interest expenses to NKr57m from NKr77m. The group also achieved financial gains of NKr66m on investments, against a loss of NKr26m last year. Hoegh said the oil products market from North Africa to the US and Europe for combination carriers was quite good throughout the third quarter but that it had weakened for tankers with a strong autumn market yet to materialise. IM Skaugen, the Norwegian gas carrier group, reported a reduction in nine-month pre-tax losses to NKr151m from NKr338m, helped by a fall in financial and operating costs and a stronger dollar. Last year the group also operated tankers which it has since divested, so figures are not directly comparable. Group operating losses were cut significantly to NKr75m from NKr236m from last year's comparative period. Voyage costs in the nine-month period were reduced to NKr60m from NKr267m as other operating costs were cut by more than half to NKr101m from NKr247m.   Companies:-  Leif Hoegh.     IM Skaugen.

0,FT944-10915 ,"FT944-10915 _AN-EKHDPAICFT 941108   FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (33): Some places feel like Japan - Madhya Pradesh is flexing its industrial muscles      By GORDON CRAMB   In his office, Honda's Mr H Masuda dispenses green tea. He wears a white uniform, as does everyone else at this scooter manufacturing plant. Compulsory morning exercises are followed by group production meetings. The company union avoids strife and is unaffiliated to any umbrella labour organisation. Apart from the complexion of his fellow-workers, only two things belie the fact that this could be Japan: the relative lack of automation in the assembly process, and the handle on the colonial-style teacup. Mr Masuda is on secondment as technical director of Kinetic Honda, 51 per cent owned by the Japanese automotive group. Its factory is at Pithampur, an industrial zone in the central state of Madhya Pradesh which lays claim to be the Detroit of India. The title is presumptuous, as no cars are produced there. But Hindustan Motors has a plant for passenger vehicle engines, and Mitsubishi operates a joint truck making venture. Officials say it and Volkswagen of Germany are seeking land for possible car assembly. Pithampur, near the commercial centre Indore, is one of two dozen growth areas designated by the Madhya Pradesh government with the aim of promoting industry in backward parts of the country's biggest state. Others include Mandideep, on the outskirts of the capital Bhopal, from where Procter and Gamble of the US supplies the Indian market with Ariel washing powder. Progressive state governments in India are competing fiercely for new investment, domestic and foreign, with packages of incentives and concessions. In the case of Madhya Pradesh these offer a holiday from state commercial taxes of up to seven years, and single-window clearance of projects to expedite approvals. Another main thing Madhya Pradesh can provide is a central location, with road, rail and air arteries reaching each of the biggest cities in roughly equal time. But its position (as the region's publicists would have it) 'at the heart of India' is also a drawback: the state is landlocked. Undaunted, the AVN, the industrial development corporation, is seeking to buy waterfront land in Gujarat to the west in order to build a deep-water jetty. This it believes would stimulate an edible oils industry in Madhya Pradesh based around soyabeans, of which the state accounts for 80 per cent of Indian production. Most output is sold as cattle feed. Through similar interventions the state authorities have restored an air service to centres abandoned by Delhi's government-owned Indian Airlines - taking a stake in a private carrier with the requirement that it include specified destinations - and built India's first toll road as an alternative to the pitted national highway which serves Pithampur. Poor roads and power shortages are, as elsewhere in India, the two handicaps most frequently cited by businessmen. Export-oriented industries enjoy a protected electricity supply and Mr S K Jain, president of Indo Rama Synthetics, an Indonesian-controlled spinning mill which employs 1,850 in Pithampur, says that 'in three years we have not shut down once because of a power cut'. But he adds that his parent company has chosen a site near Bombay in Maharashtra state for its newest facility because of easier access to a port. A state industrial policy set out in May acknowledged that 'accelerating the pace of development requires the expansion and strengthening of infrastructure' and that this necessitated private sector involvement. To this end, Bhopal's budgetary allocation for industry is planned to rise to 7 per cent from 4 per cent over the next two years. In trying to close the gap with Maharashtra and Gujarat, its two main rivals, the state's extra spending is intended to bring in private capital rather than create public sector employment. If the government sets up industrial projects on its own 'we are not going to be very efficient,' says Mr M P Rajan, managing director of the AVN. Uniquely, he couples this bureaucratic role with that of Madhya Pradesh president of the private-sector Confederation of Indian Industry. 'No other state would allow this,' he says. 'The government doesn't even mind if I criticise their policies.' Ultimately he wants to shift majority control of the AVN itself into private hands. Madhya Pradesh has its share of state industries, some of relatively recent origin, for which new roles need to be found. There are, for example, no plans to privatise Optel, set up in 1989 as an integrated maker of telephone cable, optical fibre and telecoms equipment, but it is seeking joint ventures with Japanese industry majors. The present Congress party government headed by Mr Digvijay Singh, chief minister, came to power in elections last December after Delhi ended a troublesome period of rule by the Hindu militant Bharatiya Janata party. Unlike leaders of several other states, Mr Singh is still a full four years from the next polling day and can shape economic policy without looming electoral considerations. While accepting that new private investment is likely to become increasingly capital-intensive, he stressed in an interview that 'wherever government comes in, we would rather have it labour-intensive'. However, Mr Singh, a 47-year-old engineer, said he supported 'a massive dose of privatisation in infrastructure' which would help the government maintain social spending while increasing the proportion of the budget devoted to industry. Madhya Pradesh has lower literacy levels and higher poverty and infant mortality rates than the Indian average. It also remains less urbanised. The European Union is the main backer in a primary education programme for deprived areas of the state which will be worth some Rs7bn over seven years, the largest such scheme in India. But another large scheme, from which multilateral donors have withdrawn backing, threatens to cause unprecedented upheaval to rural communities. The chief minister reaffirmed his government's commitment to the Narmada Dam project which will flood vast tracts of the south of the state, saying only that it was 'only hesitating on the issue of lowering the height' of the dam wall. Such a reduction, he indicated, could reduce by at least a quarter the 100,000 people who would be uprooted while losing a rather smaller fraction of the expected generation capacity for hydroelectric power. His figures are not far out of line with those cited by local aid agencies, but they argue that the greater clout of Gujarat and Maharashtra, which are to share in the project while avoiding most of the resettlement problems, would mean that their wishes were more likely to prevail. The World Bank pulled out after campaigners highlighted social aspects of the project. Narmada, if it is a disaster, is at least one the locals can see coming, and one which was decided by their politicians. That was not the case nearly a decade ago when a leak of poisonous gas from the US-controlled Union Carbide factory in Bhopal killed thousands of mainly slum-dwellers and hardened attitudes across India against multinationals. In September, amid a mass of litigation, a takeover by domestic interests was finally agreed. Social and environmental questions will also surround future foreign involvement particularly in the energy and mining sector, where de Beers of South Africa is poised to land diamond exploration rights over as much as 20,000 sq km in an eastern area of the state with a large tribal population. The state has other minerals such as coal and iron ore, but these areas are largely coterminous with forests. Perhaps conveniently, forestry and mining fall under the same ministry in Bhopal. The government is trying to close the state mining corporation, though arranging the transfer of workers has been slow. Long-term contracts to supply iron ore to Japan are being wound down as the recession in that country has reduced demand for steel. Demand for Kinetic Honda's scooters has brought large-scale export orders from as far afield as Mexico and Turkey. As Mr Masudah and his local colleagues sip their tea, Madhya Pradesh is trying to offer other foreign investors a handle on India.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.

More specifically, how should the reauthorization address the area of career development and counseling?        Adult Education        1. State Programs        Program Focus.    According to an analysis of 1990 census data, more than 44 million adults, nearly 27 percent of the adult population of the United States, have not received a high school diploma or its equivalent. The adult education formula targets this population. Of that population, 39 percent have completed eight or fewer years of education, but 61 percent have finished between nine and twelve years of schooling. Forty-one percent of the target population is 60 years of age or older, while 11 percent fall between 16 and 24 years of age. The variation in these individuals' educational needs and goals can make it difficult and time-consuming for adult educators to design effective instructional strategies for them. An additional complication is the broad statement of purpose contained in section 311 of the Adult Education Act, which focuses, in part, on providing assistance to States ``*** to improve educational opportunities for adults who lack the level of literacy skills requisite to effective citizenship and productive employment. ***''    Should Adult Education remain as a separate program serving a diverse population of adult learners with diverse needs? As one alternative, should the programs be refocused, for example on work preparation and literacy skills upgrading for adults? How can Federal Adult Education programs best be structured to achieve the current objectives in areas such as workforce preparation, family literacy, and English proficiency? Should program services be organized around target populations (such as dislocated workers or immigrants)? By program objective (such as basic skills or workplace literacy)?    General Educational Development (GED) Preparation.    Many of the approximately one million adults who enrolled in Adult Secondary Education programs in 1993 had as their goal the attainment of a GED certificate. The value of the GED examination as a measure of academic competence and achievement has attracted increasing attention over the past several years as the percentage of high school certificates awarded through equivalency examinations has increased. In the United States, 475,602 of the 756,645 adults who took the GED in 1993 passed the test. Studies focusing on the skill levels, economic outcomes, and postsecondary education experience of GED holders have yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradictory results. For example, most research on the economic value of the GED shows that it is significantly less valuable than a high school diploma; on the other hand, some evidence indicates that GED recipients have higher incomes than high school dropouts.    Should attainment of a GED diploma continue to be a primary focus of Adult Secondary Education? If not, what credential alternatives are available for adults seeking to complete their secondary education? Should local programs be encouraged to offer courses that allow adults to earn a high school diploma?     Set-Asides.    By establishing set-asides and targeting the needs of special populations, the Adult Education Act requires States to use their Federal adult education funds to address the educational needs of a diverse population, for example: those in need of basic education services, the limited-English-proficient, incarcerated and otherwise institutionalized individuals, and public housing residents. While each of these groups may have a well-established need for adult education services, the mix of their needs may make it difficult for adult education providers to target limited resources on, and create solutions to, the most pressing problems in adult education.

Studies focusing on the skill levels, economic outcomes, and postsecondary education experience of GED holders have yielded inconclusive and sometimes contradictory results. For example, most research on the economic value of the GED shows that it is significantly less valuable than a high school diploma; on the other hand, some evidence indicates that GED recipients have higher incomes than high school dropouts.    Should attainment of a GED diploma continue to be a primary focus of Adult Secondary Education? If not, what credential alternatives are available for adults seeking to complete their secondary education? Should local programs be encouraged to offer courses that allow adults to earn a high school diploma?     Set-Asides.    By establishing set-asides and targeting the needs of special populations, the Adult Education Act requires States to use their Federal adult education funds to address the educational needs of a diverse population, for example: those in need of basic education services, the limited-English-proficient, incarcerated and otherwise institutionalized individuals, and public housing residents. While each of these groups may have a well-established need for adult education services, the mix of their needs may make it difficult for adult education providers to target limited resources on, and create solutions to, the most pressing problems in adult education.

Stocks become less attractive when interest rates rise because investors can  earn more from government bonds and bank deposits.    However, the Nikkei index's decline had little effect in the United States,  where the Dow Jones industrial index closed at 2,564.19, down only 10.58  points, or 0.4%.    U.S. market experts had been concerned that a steep decline in the Nikkei index  would be echoed by the Dow for two reasons. The Tokyo Stock Exchange fell  dramatically after the Wall Street crash of 1987, which was taken as a sign  that in today's global economy all stock exchanges are linked. Second, there  were worries that if the Japanese exchange were to suffer a major decline,  investors might be persuaded to sell their overseas holdings and reinvest at  home. That could hurt both the U.S. stock and bond markets.    Although there are few recent statistics, the Japanese are believed to be  substantial holders of U.S. Treasury bonds as well as corporate stocks.    If the Japanese pulled out of the bond market, it is possible that the U.S.  government would have to raise interest rates in order to attract new buyers  for its debt. This, in turn, would put strong downward pressure on stock  prices.

Last week's trading activity did a great deal to quell those fears because the  U.S. market did not react violently to the problems in Japan, analysts said.    ""As the Japanese market has shown its fragility, U.S. prices have held up very  well,"" said Alan R. Ackerman, market strategist for Grunthal & Co. ""We are  not held hostage to the Japanese, but we are clearly concerned about what they  do.""    Moreover, analysts maintain that the effect of the Japanese on the U.S. stock  market may be less substantial than previously imagined.    Foreign investors owned only about 6.3% of U.S. companies' stock outstanding in  early 1989, Dudack said. Additionally, although the Japanese habitually snap up  close to one-third of the U.S. debt sold at Treasury auctions, they also often  resell the bonds, said John Hickling, portfolio manager of the Fidelity  International Growth & Income Fund.

Japanese rates for 10-year government bonds have jumped about 1 percentage  point since year-end 1989, to 6.8%, and U.S. rates have risen a similar amount  and now yield about 8.5%, said Joseph Wahed, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in  San Francisco.

But China, where the authorities have just also ordered a crackdown on basics such as spelling, might seem to have special difficulties. In English-speaking nations, for instance, the problem usually results in nothing worse than puzzling new words (an 'enjuiced' pregnancy, for example) which, with a bit of thought, can be decoded from the context. The equivalent in China, however, is the distortion not just of words but the individual characters. Fortunately, Observer's checks reveal that literate Chinese can still work out the intended meaning, even if - as one translator said - 'it's sometimes like looking at a bit of finished knitting and divining what should have been in the pattern'. As a by-product of the checks, too, there's news for the innumerable public speakers on management who're forevertelling their audiences that the Chinese word for 'crisis' is formed by linking together the characters for 'danger' and for 'opportunity'. It is true.  The Financial Times   London Page 11  "

Most are in work but the unit's survey concludes that the range and number of jobs open to them is shrinking. The survey, one of the most extensive on basic skills, was carried out in 73 of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils. It encompassed 24,000 employers, covering 1.3m lower-level jobs. Only half the employers surveyed said their workforces generally had good basic skills. Mr Alan Wells, director of the unit, warned that people with poor skills faced intense competition from people with better skills - even for the decreasing number of jobs that did not require much competence in basic skills. He said there was no single reason why people had difficulties with basic skills. Some had missed long periods of schooling, others had physical problems such as undiagnosed hearing or sight loss, some had not been well-taught or some did not have English as their mother tongue and were not educated in the UK.

But it is nowhere near enough to lift an  economy which, nevertheless, has the potential to achieve  much-heightened growth rates.    Aid of about R1.7 billion a year might seem a lot of money.  Yet perspective indicates that R1.7 billion worth of aid in the  next 12 months is about equal to the cost of establishing one  new gold mine. It's half the sum South Africa borrowed from the  International Monetary Fund at the end of last year -- funds  used to bolster foreign exchange reserves which, in spite of  that injection, are now, only five months later, under severe  pressure. Indeed, in the first four months of 1994, the net  reserves plummeted by R3.2 billion, equivalent to more than two  years' worth of foreign aid.    Accordingly, the aid-to-SA [South Africa] conduit won't even  begin to have a favourable impact on an economy desperately  trying to emerge from five years of crippling recession. Not  that we should be looking for handouts to pull us out of the  economic mire. We need to be tugging ourselves up by our own  bootstraps. Aid dents the pride of the nation and promotes a  poor work ethic -- as countries to our north have discovered at  exorbitant cost. In short, the entire country has to get back  to work -- to work hard, efficiently, and assiduously. Is the  nation prepared and able to do just this? The portents are  promising. What remains is for the potential to be realised.    It is the new Government's most awesome task to get people  into jobs, to train them to do those jobs well and to ensure  that they keep doing them well. It won't be easy and it won't  happen soon. The starting point is to enhance South Africa's  economic growth rate. Even this year's predicted 3 percent is  well short of the desired mark. Next year simply has to be 5  percent plus -- and, if one is to take a less than jaundiced  view of the future, it can be achieved. How?    -- The psychology is right. All South Africans are suddenly  on the same side, working for the same goals. No more is  government at such odds with labour and business; no more is  labour at such odds with business. Co-operation among all the  aspects of production translates into meaningful economic growth.    -- Foreign investment, as opposed to foreign aid, stands  ready to enter an economy no longer constantly threatened by  violence and labour unrest -- an economy with a well-developed  infrastructure, a sound legal system and one which offers an  attractive platform for launching products into sub-Saharan  Africa.    -- Even without the post-apartheid benefits that are about  to  accrue, the economy has been emerging from recession. The major  indicators are pointing up and, given a heightened level of  foreign and domestic investment, they are poised to point yet  higher.    -- Inflation remains in single-digit territory. While many  fear that the huge social upliftment expenditure targeted by the  new Government will before long jerk inflation back into double  digits, the substantial excess production capacity in the  economy and the Reserve Bank's continued vigilance are notable  ameliorating factors.    -- International capital markets are now, as seldom before,  ready to lend to South Africa. Although they involve a cost in  the form of interest payments, if the funds thereby raised are  used to expand the nation's productive base, the interest bill  can be covered many times over by heightened exports and import  replacement.    -- Much local and foreign money is destined for education  and  training. Some dividends will be garnered only many years into  the future. But some, particularly in the training arena, will  accrue in the near term. In concert with the will to work hard,  those dividends will help lubricate South Africa's economic  engine.    -- Interest rates are scheduled to decline in the near  future  as the balance of payments constraint is rendered less onerous  by capital inflows. Cheaper money implies more investment in  productive capacity and increased spending -- vital ingredients  for growth.    -- The global economy is expanding. This is bound to benefit  all exporting nations, including South Africa. In addition, the  upturn is coinciding with a revival in the commodities cycle.  And South Africa is among the world's leading exporters of  gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, manganese, and chrome.    Too optimistic a scenario? Are there no flies in the  economic ointment?    Earlier in the year, the gloom and doom merchants predicted  that the election would bring chaos; that the Left-leaning  elements in the ANC would drive the country down the communist  precipice. Today they're silent. Business people are positive.  The Johannesburg Stock exchange continues to scale new peaks,  pointing to a future more prosperous than the recent past.    Even so, flies, among them exchange control, are by no means  absent from the ointment.    International investors are invariably reticent about  placing  their money in a country which prevents its unfettered  repatriation. They're wary of a country which aims to attract  foreign capital via a discounted financial rand.    Why not, then, abolish exchange controls and scrap the  financial rand? Because vast sums of funk money would leave our  shores, plundering our scarce foreign exchange reserves. At  least that's been the reason for the past decade or so. It's a  reason which could evaporate if confidence is restored --  confidence that South Africa does indeed have a bright future;  confidence that capital seeks to flow into the country rather  than out of it; confidence that democracy will bring with it  responsible government of responsible citizens.    Ultimately, South Africa will row its own boat. Its  oarsmen's determination, wisdom, and strength will determine its  destiny.     "
0,FT924-5594 ,"FT924-5594 _AN-CKZCGAA2FT 921126   FT  26 NOV 92 / S Africa investment up - but so are the outflows: Disinvestment and investments abroad amount to more than double inward flows      By PHILIP GAWITH   SOUTH AFRICA'S business leaders seldom waste an opportunity to lecture the politicians that without political stability there will be no foreign investment in the country. Recent evidence suggests they are at least half right. A study* by the London School of Economics shows that while South Africa has enjoyed a renewal of foreign direct investment since President F W de Klerk embarked on reforms in late 1989, it has been less than half as much as disinvestments and investments abroad by South African companies in the same period. Indeed, the impact of this investment outflow is probably the main reason behind the recent weakening in the financial rand, the investment currency for foreigners investing in South Africa, and South Africans investing abroad. Yesterday the currency closed at R5.00/Dollars 1 - a 40 per cent discount to the commercial rand rate of exchange of R3.00/Dollars 1. The discount, which is a barometer of investor confidence in the country, was only 13.5 per cent at the end of 1991. The recent trend to invest abroad is being investigated by Mr Derek Keys, minister of finance and trade and industry, and it is possible changes in exchange control regulations may follow. Another recent study, by the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC), concludes, however, that the trend of disinvestment has been reversed over the past year. The IRRC report on International Business in South Africa, notes that 508 non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. US companies have returned in smaller numbers, increasing to 111 from 106 a year ago. There has also been a considerable upsurge in foreign companies having non-equity links (such as licensing or distribution arrangements) in South Africa. A longer term perspective on capital outflows from South Africa was recently offered by Mr Michael Marks, chief executive of brokers Smith New Court. He noted that since 1959 capital inflows have totalled R100bn, in 1990 values. During this period, disinvestment has taken R84bn back out. He speculates that without spells of heightened political tension, South Africa could have expected capital inflows to have continued, as they did between 1946 and 1959 and between 1965 and 1976. He calculates that this might have added another R104bn, in 1990 terms. It has often been pointed out that South Africa is not so much short of funds to invest, but of attractive investment opportunities. Continued current account surpluses, and large sums raised on the stock exchange, testify to the former. Reserve Bank figures, showing that real investment by the private sector shrunk by 9.5 per cent from the end of 1989 to mid-1992, are evidence of the latter. It is hardly surprising that foreigners are also holding back. Business confidence - reported recently by the Bureau of Economic Research to be at its lowest level since ex-President P W Botha's disastrous Rubicon speech in August 1985 - is clearly the key factor, with political uncertainty one of the main contributors. But there are also important economic realities which are a disincentive to investment for domestic and foreign businesses alike. Mr Ted Osborne, group economist at the Nedcor group, listed them earlier this year as including such factors as 'high tax rates, high wage rates in relation to skill and productivity levels, shortages of skill, a less than demonic work ethic, highly politicised trade unions, and high inflation'. He also mentioned the limited size of the South African market and its growing exposure to international competition as tariff walls are lowered. These factors, together with a logical desire to spread risk and access new markets, explain the recent upsurge in investments abroad by South African companies. These include large investments by the country's two forest products groups, Sappi and Mondi, acquisitions by First National Bank and the Standard Bank group and the proposed takeover of Del Monte Foods International by the Royal Group and Anglo American. Large disinvestments this year appear to have been more a function of internal strategic issues within the companies concerned than any particular view of the South African economy. At the same there has been a steady flow of mostly smaller inward investment flows. The LSE study (which does not pretend to be exhaustive, especially of smaller projects) identifies a total of 51 new investments made in South Africa since late 1989. The 20, to which an exact size could be put had a cumulative value of just more than Dollars 700m. The authors say they believe it unlikely that the total new inflow to South Africa as a result of these new investments will exceed Dollars 1.5bn. Although economists caution against trying to establish a relationship between capital inflows and economic growth, figures from the Central Economic Advisory Service, a government economic research body, suggest that if the country is to achieve an average GDP growth rate of 3.5 a year between now and the end of the century - the minimum necessary to absorb new entrants to the labour market - then an annual capital inflow of 1.5-2 per cent of GDP (R4.5bn-R6bn in 1991 terms) is necessary. *Centre for the Study of the South African Economy and International Finance, London School of Economics, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, Tel: 071 955 7280  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Chien, replying to an interpellation by Democratic  Progressive Party legislator Parris Chang, said the government  had foreseen as long as three and a half years ago that drastic  political changes would occur in South Africa, even though  bilateral ties with the white-ruled government at that time were  solid.    ""We indeed had promised a U.S.$60 million loan to help South  Africa finance a farming development project during F.W. De  Klerk's tenure as the president, but the loan has not yet been  given,"" Chien said.    The loan proposal was raised again when President Li  Teng-hui  visited South Africa to attend Nelson Mandela's presidential  inauguration on May 10, Chien said, adding that both countries  may re-start negotiations on the loan.    Chien emphasized that Li had not offered any new loans to  South Africa during his visit, but did agree to help South  Africa implement a vocational-training project. ""South Africa  will send people here to see for themselves how job-training  projects are implemented,"" Chien said.    He added that the ROC has agreed to share with South Africa  its successful experience in helping military personnel  assimilate into society after retirement.    Many legislators here are against any new economic aid to  South Africa on grounds that the Nelson Mandela-led African  National Congress, which now rules the new government, has  maintained close ties with Beijing for many years, and may  eventually shift diplomatic recognition away from Taipei.    On the contrary, though, Li's visit, previously perceived as  a last-ditch effort by Taiwan to salvage its relationship with  South Africa, seems to have paid off handsomely. A confident  Li, shortly after a meeting with Mandela, told a group of  Chinese and representatives of Taiwan-owned companies in South  Africa on May 11 that the bilateral ties between the two  countries are strong and steady.    South Africa is the largest country of the 29 with which the  ROC maintains official diplomatic ties.     "

Turnover rose marginally to R2.37bn (Dollars 764m) from R2.31bn during the same period in 1991, but operating profit was 1 per cent lower at R334.6m compared with R337.8m. A sharp rise, however, in net interest paid - to R24.2m from R1m - and a decline in the share of associated companies' profits, which fell to R36.7m from R63.4m, caused attributable earnings to fall to R109.4m from R133.3m. The interim dividend is being maintained at 65 cents per share despite earnings per share falling by 18.6 per cent to 202 cents from 248 cents. Increased competition and the recession, both in South Africa and abroad, caused Safmarine, the shipping and transport subsidiary, to experience declining cargo volumes and reduced freight rates in its liner and bulk trades. Increased depreciation and interest arising from large investments in new ships and containers also affected profit adversely. Safair, the freight carrier, suffered from the resurgence of hostilities in Angola, while Flitestar, the domestic airline, incurred substantial losses owing to overcapacity and predatory pricing on domestic routes. Profits at Kersaf, the leisure and entertainment arm, were lower due to difficult trading conditions, aggravated by construction work at its main resorts and competition from unregulated casinos. Rennies, the freight handling group, benefited from its participation in a drought relief scheme in the region and lifted profits.

It pleases me on this happy occasion--the opening of the  30th  African summit--to express warmest gratitude and appreciation to  the fraternal people of Tunisia and their leader President Zine  El Abidine Ben Ali for the hospitality they have accorded us and  for their obvious eagerness to provide all the necessary  requirements for the success of this conference. I am also  pleased to express my complete confidence that the ability and  wisdom of President Ben Ali will lead the OAU, at its 30th  summit, in extensive work and great achievements.    Brothers and sisters: It is one of the greatest moments in  the history of Africa and its organization to see the new South  Africa, under dear brother President Nelson Mandela, join the  independent and free countries that are working to advance the  united African march. The people of South Africa were not  absent from us and from the OAU. They have always been with us  in their heroic and glorious struggle, through which they  recorded a bright page in the history of humanity and  strengthened man's confidence that truth, virtue, and justice  must triumph over the forces of evil, darkness, and coercion.    Allow me to salute brother President Nelson Mandela once  again and to congratulate him on the high confidence he won from  the sons of his country, both the majority and the minority, and  on the establishment of the first nonracist government,  reflecting the united will of the entire nation, without  discrimination. While we wish this historic experience in  democratic transformation all success and prosperity, we hope it  will become a model to be emulated, not only in Africa but  throughout the other continents, where there is a pressing need  for coexistence, dialogue, the renunciation of violence, and  elimination of hatred and the spirit of contradiction and enmity.    Reconstruction is, and will always be, harder and more  difficult than revolution and change. The task of  reconstruction requires security and stability as well as the  cooperation of everyone in the pursuit of the national goals of  social and economic development.    The African nations, who have stood firmly behind the South  African people during their struggle, are determined to maintain  their solidarity with the South Africans in the reconstruction  phase. The Africans will give their support to the brotherly  South African people and help them assume their responsibility  in this strategic part of our glorious continent.    Brothers and sisters, a year has passed since we last met in  Cairo last June, a year that brought with it glimmers of hope  for a better future. The past year saw continued efforts by the  OAU leaders and peoples to confront the numerous problems facing  our nations, which are and exhausting a large portion of our  resources and potentials.    It is a regrettable and painful fact that many of these  problems were caused by the Africans themselves. Therefore, the  way to rid ourselves of the evils of war and destruction is  something that we, not others, have to find. Making and  preserving peace is our responsibility, not that of other  international organizations and outside powers.    The OAU has taken a large and remarkable stride toward  adopting preventive diplomacy as a way to avoid perils, foresee  crises, and settle disputes. Among our accomplishments in the  past year was the agreement by African leaders in Cairo OAU  summit last June to set up a central mechanism of preventing,  managing, and settling conflicts. This was followed by a meeting  in Cairo last September at the level of heads of state. This  meeting succeeded in formulating the principles and determining  the framework for the mechanism's operation through its central  body.    The OAU took this great achievement to a higher plateau with  its decision to set up a peace fund to finance the mechanism's  activities and enable it to deal effectively with a number of  African problems. This will give the entire OAU the credibility  it needs. There is a mounting international tendency to try to  resolve disputes through regional organizations before resorting  to external powers, the aim being to prevent these disputes from  assuming an international dimension that might lead to further  complications.    In order to preempt crises and curb fledgling disputes, an  African minisummit was held in Harare in March, and it was a  success. It involved in-depth discussions of the situation in  South Africa on the eve of the elections that led to the birth  of a new government.    Within this context, on the basis of experience and events,  as I hand over the chairmanship of the OAU, I call for great  attention to be paid in the coming period to preventive  diplomacy and to establishing an early-warning system that  anticipates disputes before they turn into military showdowns.  The OAU Secretariat General must provide a data base for the  current and expected disputes on the continent.    As we view this historic achievement, we must not forget  that  the wisdom of the leaders, the vigilance of the African people,  and response of all forces to the call to discard violence and  maintain the unity of South Africa resulted in the call I made  in the name of the OAU to a number of heads of state and  government in major Western capitals. This undoubtedly enabled  the OAU to spare the people of South Africa further violence and  confrontation and to maintain that country's unity and the  integration of its components.    Brothers and sisters: Our African continent has adopted  these two big steps, which are considered the most prominent  indications of wisdom and political pragmatism, whether in  achieving national detente through the democratic choice in  South Africa or in maintaining unanimity in establishing a  watertight system and a mechanism to settle its disputes by  peaceful means. An our organization has taken a third daring  step by its correct realization and understanding of the new  economic facts of the modern world.    The organization discovered that the phenomenon of blocs,  groupings, and mutual reliance is the hallmark of economic  relations among the countries of the North, whether in Europe,  North America, or the Asian Far East. Our organization felt the  long-term effects of its relations with the states of the North  and the sum total of international economic relations. From  this premise, brothers and sisters, and realizing the need for  integration between the North and South, right after our  previous summit and in the name of all you, I addressed the  leaders of the major industrial powers on the occasion of last  July's Tokyo summit [of the G-7]. I explained the nature of the  economic problems in Africa and submitted our just and realistic  demands, especially the easing of the heavy burdens of our  countries' debts within the framework of a relationship based on  constructive dialogue and mutual understanding among the states  of the North and South. Within the same framework, the brother  leaders in Africa responded brilliantly--not only to the needs  dictated by the international economic situation but also out of  a real desire by the continent's states and peoples--when they  each approved the African Economic Group agreement. Thus, the  necessary approvals have been received for this important  agreement to legally take effect.    With that, Africa will enter a new phase of integration  involving its various economies. We hope that this integration  will reflect positively on its relations and dialogue with the  states of the North. We also hope that this integration will  positively affect the development of its energies and wealth and  will achieve higher growth rates and greater prosperity for the  African nations.    I have no doubt that this accomplishment and the successful  efforts of the African continent to forge ahead along this road  will guarantee a good position for Africa on the world's  economic map. They will also enable the African states to  benefit from the various privileges of economic integration,  such as lessening the cost of production, increasing the number  of markets, and ensuring better transportation and communication  facilities. Economic integration will also enable the continent  to have negotiating power vis-a-vis the other world blocs.    Brothers and sisters, this step was very important for us in  Africa after the introduction of the new GATT Agreement and the  impending establishment of the World Trade Organization. These  developments could bring positive and negative results that  might affect the developing countries in general and the African  states, which produce raw materials, in particular. Such  developments could also dictate the lifting of restrictions and  barriers hindering international trade, especially the exports  of the advanced industrial countries.    Accordingly, the African Economic Group Agreement will  provide a protective umbrella for our interests and a strong  guarantee against any effects that could harm our economic  conditions if we are not well prepared for it. What  consolidates the role of this Economic Group and gives it  impetus is that the Group's states agreed last year to establish  the first African import-export bank. They also agreed on Cairo  as site of the bank's headquarters.    We are also confident that this vital economic establishment  will open up broad horizons for inter-African trade and will  achieve the desired integration. It will also create new fields  for balanced trade relations with the rest of the world.    We recorded undeniably positive aspects in the economic  field  thanks to a sound awareness of the economic facts and changes.  We must never forget that advancing the wheel of economic  development in Africa can only be achieved by effectively and  wisely confronting Africa's chronic and persistent  problems--drought and desertification and the accompanying  famine and refugees. We witnessed one of its painful chapters  in the Horn of Africa 10 years ago.    We must also not forget that pushing forward the wheel of  economic development in Africa requires that we always maintain  the delicate balance between population and resources or between  land and people. No matter how great the resources, they are  liable to be depleted due to the constant increase in  population. This poses a social and economic challenge to the  continent's people, who must face it with wisdom and reason.    Finally, we must not forget that economic growth cannot be  achieved without a comprehensive and balanced infrastructure and  without human development that raises the standard of the  individual, maintains his dignity, and releases his potential  and energy. I will continue to call for a climate of political  and social security and stability as a necessary and vital need  for the economic development process. Security is the main  pillar of stability, and stability is the guarantee for the  success of development. Africa urgently needs these three  components together.    Brothers and sisters, Africa has emerged cohesive and strong  from the era of colonialism and foreign domination. Its groups  and tribes have coexisted as brothers and neighbors across  borders and within the same homeland. Loyalty to the homeland  has remained above any other loyalty. Our affiliation to the  African continent and to its civilization and interests has  superseded all other affiliations. Africa has respected its  borders, enshrined its territorial unity and integrity, and  safeguarded its states' sovereignty, independence, and freedom  in accordance with its charter, which was adopted by its  founding leaders 30 years ago. Therefore, the recent aspects of  struggle that have divided the sons of the same homeland and  threatened security and stability in some parts of the continent  do not conform with the genuine African spirit. They must not  be interpreted as representing an African phenomenon or a  permanent fixture in Africa with which we have to coexist and  accept as part of the new continental reality. On the contrary,  it must be viewed as a passing and temporary phenomenon that  does not conform with firm African traditions and does not agree  with our long history and rich heritage.    An example of this deteriorating situation, on which we must  not remain silent, is the situation in fraternal Somalia.  Despite the honest and sincere efforts undertaken by  neighboring countries, the OAU, the United Nations, and several  friendly states, the Somali people continue to pay a heavy price  for the power struggles and rivalries at the expense of the  country's unity and its social fabric and at the expense of its  stability and the security of its citizens.    I have taken it upon myself to do my utmost to put an end to  this destructive crisis by virtue of my responsibility as OAU  chairman and by virtue of my capacity as president of Egypt,  which has strong historical and cultural relations with Somalia.    The efforts, which we coordinated with the brothers and  presidents, who played a special role in this regard, focussed  on closing ranks and calling on all factions without exception  to agree to a national reconciliation formula. The efforts  resulted in the issuance of the Cairo Declaration, which  constituted a solid base and a common ground for all factions to  get out of the current crisis. We are renewing our call to all  sides to place Somalia above ambitions, and to restore unity to  the country and security and reassurance to the people. We urge  them to start a sincere and determined march toward unity and  national reconciliation so that this fraternal country can  continue its development and message.    If we are to learn a lesson from this tragedy, it is that  Africa is most capable of solving its problems by itself.  Assistance from friendly countries and international  organizations, no matter how necessary, cannot replace the  African role but only support it. The responsibility lies  primarily with the people of Africa, because they know best the  problems of their countries and societies.    In central Africa, that strategically important region  thanks  to its unique location where the great Nile starts and many  friendly countries share borders, heavy blood was shed on the  soil of two friendly countries, Rwanda and Burundi. The vicious  fighting pained our hearts because it bordered on genocide,  where hundreds of thousands of people were killed, resources  that we urgently need were wasted, and hundreds of thousands of  people were turned into refugees burdening the neighboring  countries and depleting their resources, let alone the war's  negative reflections on Africa's image and culture.    These tragic situations, brothers and sisters, place on the  shoulders of our organization, the world community, and the  United Nations a common humanitarian duty and a moral obligation  to move to stop this bleeding so that its aftermath and  consequences do not extend to the heart of the continent and to  this spot, which is vital to its own peoples and to the  neighboring peoples.    In Burundi, the OAU's swift moves to control the situation  prevented further deterioration. These moves constituted one of  the first successful trials of the conflict resolution mechanism  which the OAU has established. The OAU envoy contacted all  forces in the government and the opposition, and this set the  appropriate stage for containing the situation and easing  tension.    Another lesson to be learned from our experience in this  central African region is that the presence of peace-keeping  forces, although undeniably important, is not an alternative to  a genuine peace among the sons of the nation, whether in the  government or the opposition, within the framework of  legitimacy, law, respect for man's dignity, and the use of the  language of dialogue and reconciliation.    Perhaps the real dilemma facing African countries in  certain areas is that of maintaining internal stability and  national cohesion. Unity should be preserved through pluralism.  The time is right for the OAU, with all its agencies, to turn  its utmost attention to this issue, among others.    Against this background, the OAU continued its efforts to  restore stability, consolidate national cohesion, and unify  national forces in Angola, Liberia, and Mozambique. I had  urgent exchanges with the influential forces in these countries  with a view to probing the problems there and resolving them.    In the same context, the OAU is in touch with the brothers  in  Cameroon and Nigeria in an effort to resolve their dispute. We  hope that our efforts there will succeed in defusing tensions  and finding an acceptable solution. Both sides have exhibited a  desire to reach an understanding and begin a dialogue.    Brothers and sisters, solidarity among African and Arab  nations both inside and outside Africa has been instrumental in  many great achievements concerning African liberation, the  liquidation of imperialism, and the achievement of  self-determination.    The firm backing by African nations of just Arab causes in  various international forums has been remarkable. African  support of the Palestinian issue and the rights of the  Palestinian people has always been courageous and impressive.    Brothers and sisters, I am pleased to tell you that,  following daunting negotiations, our efforts have been crowned  with great success in the signing of the self-rule agreement in  Gaza and Jericho. Israel and the Palestinians signed the  agreement on 4 May 1994. The self-rule agreement is merely a  first step toward fulfilling the rights and aspirations of the  Palestinian people for self-determination. We hope that it will  be followed by similar steps on other tracks of the Arab-Israeli  peace talks and that a just and comprehensive peace will be  achieved by all the nations of the Middle East.    Brothers and sisters, seen from a political and strategic  overview, African and Middle East security are linked. This is  why we made an initiative, which we are trying to promote in  various forums. This initiative calls for turning the Middle  East and Africa into zones that are free from nuclear weapons  and weapons of mass destruction.    Today, Africa and the Middle East face new horizons as the  21st century approaches. Our nations need to preserve their  resources and potentials, elevate their standards of living, and  achieve development and prosperity. The only way to attain  these noble objectives is by maintaining security and stability  throughout Africa and the Middle East. The threat of mass  destruction should disappear from Africa, the birthplace of the  oldest civilizations, and the Middle East, the birthplace of  major religions and the ancient cultures of the East. Our  nations look with hope and confidence to reaping together the  fruits of the great seeds sown by our founding fathers 30 years  ago in the black African soil.    Brothers and sisters, during the past year you gave me the  honor of being OAU chairman for the second time in five years.  You laid on me the responsibility of representing it and  speaking with the leaders of the outside world on your behalf.  I hope that my efforts in this connection were adequate to the  task.    On this occasion, I feel it is necessary for me to offer my  thanks to all the brother presidents for the sincere fraternal  cooperation they have shown me. This helped me to accomplish  the chairman's tasks. Throughout my period of responsibility I  did not feel I was alone but was always surrounded by your  sincere support. None of you hesitated to carry out what I asked  them to do for the good of our mutual interests and united  destiny. This gave me additional pride in your comradeship and  fraternity and in belonging with you to the greater African  entity and its splendid civilization. Furthermore, your  objective attitude, frankness, truthfulness to yourselves, and  putting the general interest above other considerations have  given me fresh confidence in this young continent's future and  the ability of its future generations to confront new problems  and challenges with total fortitude. In this task they will  rely on their unshakeable faith in the principles of African  unity and their firm commitment to strengthening solidarity and  cooperation among the continent's nations until their noble  objectives are attained.    Brothers and sisters, I must not forget to offer my thanks  to  OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim for his sincere  cooperation and perseverance which decisively helped us to carry  out the achievements of the past year.    Long live our African continent in security and stability.  Long live its nations, united and strong. Long live the  African nations' struggle for economic development and progress.  Long live the memory of Africa's devout martyrs.    Let the torches of liberty burn everywhere in Africa. Let  the light of learning and civilization spread in the corners of  this glorious continent.    Long live the OAU. Long live the memory of its pioneers and  founding leaders. May God give us all success. Peace and the  mercy of God be with you. [applause]     "

0,FT931-892 ,"FT931-892 _AN-DC1AGAB2FT 930327   FT  27 MAR 93 / Pressure of people to test the west: Migration has focused attention on soaring world population      By BRONWEN MADDOX   Industrialised countries will be confronted with an unprecedented influx of would-be immigrants in the next few decades, putting their economies under enormous pressure. That is the message delivered by Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), to the UN conference on European population this week in Geneva. More than 2m immigrants are believed to have entered both Europe and North America over the past two years alone. While Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have so far taken the brunt of Russians, gypsies and Romanians from the east, political chaos in Russia could intensify westward migration. This is quite apart from the pressures from the south, Mrs Sadik warned. Migration, many UN officials and economists in Geneva argued, would be the factor spurring industrialised countries to pay more attention to the world's soaring population. Prince Charles pointed out that at last June's Earth Summit in Rio, the link between numbers of people and destruction of the natural environment was conspicuous by its absence from the agenda. The Vatican's resistance to including population in the talks was unsurprising, but the Philippines and some Middle Eastern countries with high birth rates also proved obstructive. Environmental pressure groups, wary of telling developing countries how to manage their affairs, were also quiet. Such reticence is difficult to understand in the light of UN population projections - one puts the world's population at 11bn in 2050, double its present 5.5bn, before it stabilises. Mr Miroslav Macura, demographer with the UN Economic Commission for Europe, reminded the conference that the total 'could be anywhere from 5bn to 20bn' if fertility rates turned out to differ even marginally from the model's assumptions. Nearly 95 per cent of the projected rise will come from developing countries, despite the considerable success of many Asian and Latin American countries in bringing down the rate of population growth in the past two decades. India now has a fertility rate of about 4 - the average number of children per woman implied by the current birth rate - a fall of about a third in the last two decades. China, after its ferocious policy of curbing family size, has a rate of about 2.4, though that is still above the two children per woman which maintains a static population. But across much of sub-Saharan Africa, fertility rates have been running at more than 6. Recent studies, although based on less than perfect data, suggest the Aids epidemic is cutting only 1 percentage point off population growth. Ethiopia, despite recurrent famine, still has a fertility rate of about 3. According to Mr Fred Sai, president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation and chairman of Ghana's population council, African countries now recognise that family planning is a tool for health improvement. But the answers to restraining a high growth rate of population are not clear-cut. Recent evidence shows that the traditional assumption that family size falls with economic progress does not always hold true. Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bulgaria and Kerala in India have all shown sharp falls in family size despite relatively low prosperity, while the Gulf states have maintained fertility rates of more than 3 during a period of sharply rising wealth. 'For every level of prosperity, you can find an enormous range of fertility rates,' said Mr David Coleman from Oxford University. 'The things that really bring down family size are more complex, to do with culture and education'. Contraceptive programmes do help though, the UNFPA, maintains: it called last week for the present total of Dollars 4.5bn spent worldwide on family planning programmes to double by 2000. But even if such measures are successful, the population of developing countries will continue to surge ahead that of industralised countries. Fertility rates in western Europe now average only about 1.7 children per woman - the UK rate is 1.8. Italy and Spain have rates of only 1.2, below West German levels of 1.4, according to Ms Charlotte Hohn director of the Federal Population Institute of Germany. The result is that pensioners will soon outnumber children in Europe and North America for the first time, the UNFPA said. Under-15s currently outnumber the elderly by a third in Europe and North America. But the number of people older than 60 has risen from 90m in 1950 to 185m today, and could reach 310m in 2025. The idea that any resulting labour gap could be filled by immigration is disputed. Mr Coleman argued that 'only about 60 per cent of the potential workforce in western Europe is actually working, and there is plenty of slack.' Past immigration can adversely affect the host country, he added. The availability of cheap labour may be one factor behind Europe's relative lack of investment in high-technology industries, he said. It is clear from west European delegates that the increasing pressures of migration are likely to prompt a tightening of frontiers to try to preserve standards of living for their own citizens. But if the arguments that Europe does not need immigrants to maintain prosperity are right, its cultural urge to shut the doors may not have adverse economic consequences.  ------------------------------------------------ Immigration pressure on developed countries from growth in developing countries' population  ------------------------------------------------                      Pop in   Increase (million)              1991   by 2005  ------------------------------------------------ Western Europe          379       4 Eastern Europe          124      11 Ex-Soviet Union         209      10 US                      253      81 Mediterranean*          186     158 Latin America           451     289 Tropical Africa         531     826 South Asia            1,206     920  ------------------------------------------------ Source: D Coleman, Oxford University *south-east Mediterranean  ------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  QOZ  Developed Countries.

The report says industry could save up to Pounds 8.4bn if basic skills were improved. Ernst  Young's estimates are based on a Gallup poll of 400 large companies conducted earlier this year for the Adult Literacy and Basic Skills Unit and grossed up to take account of companies of all sizes. The total annual cost of rectifying customer orders despatched incorrectly estimated at Pounds 4.3bn, while the cost of cancelled orders was put at Pounds 1.6bn and the cost of customers lost through errors Pounds 1.5bn. Poor basic skills also affect recruitment. According to Ernst  Young, companies could save Pounds 300m a year by shedding staff if basic skills were better, while the cost of recruiting employees whose problems with literacy and numeracy limit their chances of promotion is estimated at Pounds 600m. Ernst  Young say areas of savings for the public purse would include the penal system, because 45 per cent of those under 30 in prison have no educational qualifications, more than double the figure for the population as a whole. Mr David Rees, of Ernst  Young, added that the lack of skilled staff in the UK was a 'major concern of potential investors'.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

""Today Africa stands at the door of total  political liberation as apartheid is about to be relegated to  the ignominy of history"", the organisation's secretary general,  Salim Ahmed Salim said.    Addressing the 59th session of the OAU Council of Ministers  which began in Addis Ababa Monday, Salim said at a time when  South Africa was undergoing fundamental transformation, Africa  which had invested so much energy and resources in support of  the liberation movements must make its presence felt in that  country.    He told the foreign ministers that Africa had a  responsibility to South Africa and must sustain interest and  keep the momentum of support to the on-going process in order to  accomplish the objectives it set for itself in the country.    ""Today, when we are walking the final mile and we are about  to see the results of years of struggle and sacrifice, we owe it  to ourselves and the people of South Africa not to relax our  vigilance or allow our enthusiasm to diminish"", he said. The  end of apartheid, Salim stressed, marked not only the closing of  one of the saddest chapters in the history of Africa, but also  the beginning of a new challenge of economic cooperation in the  southern African sub- region and Africa as a whole. ""We now need  to see how the immense potential which exists in South Africa in  terms of capital, resources and know-how, can interface with  those found in the rest of the continent, to forge an economic  partnership which can propel the continent to new heights of  growth and development"". Salim said for Africa to successfully  monitor the forth-coming South Africa elections, ""we need to be  there, in good time and in sufficient numbers, to support the  process and to encourage our brothers and sisters"". He said  that concerted action on the part of African countries would  make a difference similar to the success they achieved during  the Namibian election. Africa must give some material  assistance to the liberation movements to enable them compete  against a government ""endowed with almost unlimited resources  and the advantage of incumbency"", he added. The OAU scribe  urged African states to urgently contribute to the election fund  established at the OAU summit in Cairo in 1993 to support the  liberation movements.     "
0,FT941-15881 ,"FT941-15881 _AN-EAMCUAA5FT 940113   FT  13 JAN 94 / IMF persuades French Africa to go for growth: The CFA bloc's devaluation will ensure the adjustment needed for revival      By DAVID BUCHAN   The 13 French-speaking countries of west and central Africa finally bit the bullet on Tuesday night and agreed to depreciate their common currency, the CFA franc, by 50 per cent against the French franc to pull their economies out of deep recession. Described by an economist as the 'most foretold and least well prepared devaluation in economic history', it came after two days of often acrimonious wrangling between African leaders and the International Monetary Fund, abetted by France, in Dakar, the Senegalese capital. It is the first parity change since 1948 for the CFA (Communaute Financiere Africaine) franc, which is now worth one French centime. The distant Comores Islands in the Indian Ocean have devalued their CFA franc by one third. Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director who was in Dakar to press for devaluation, said in Paris yesterday that at the outset many of the African leaders thought they were being asked to make 'a leap into the void without a parachute', but were subsequently convinced that devaluation would promote 'a dash for growth', with the accompanying aid provided by the IMF, World Bank and France. The IMF chief expressed confidence in the CFA franc's new parity, whose change would produce the external adjustment necessary to the franc zone's revival. France said it would continue to guarantee the convertibility of CFA francs which, along with fostering regional integration, is the aim of the franc zone. In a joint statement, President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur also said France 'will not fail to show its solidarity with its (CFA) partners' by, for instance, forgiving FFr25bn (Pounds 2.87bn) worth of their debts to it. The Balladur government denies it imposed devaluation on the CFA countries, acknowledging only that in its tougher financial attitude abroad as well as at home it had recently made clear to CFA countries that they could no longer expect France to top up their budgets, unless they reached agreements with the IMF. But this is a pro-forma distinction, since Paris knew well the IMF's strong preference for CFA devaluation. The package of measures to support the devaluation includes: The IMF will provide aid worth *something in here (HP) * Dollars 1.5bn-Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.01bn-Pounds 1.14bn) over the next three or four years, Mr Camdessus said. This would initially take the form of standby credits because, being quicker to negotiate, they would more rapidly unlock other credit possibilities and pave the way to possible debt rescheduling. But thereafter the 10 poorest CFA countries would be able to draw on the IMF's 'enhanced structural adjustment facility' at a 0.5 per cent rate of interest repayable over 10 years. To soften the impact of higher prices for imported staples, particularly on the poorest, the IMF would approve subsidies on some basic goods like bread, vegetable oil, rice or even petrol out of the CFA countries' budget revenues which were expected to rise, Mr Camdessus said. The World Bank will step up its lending, partic-ularly to education and health. For the 10 poorest CFA countries, France is to forgive all of the FFr6.6bn of bilateral aid debt which it did not cancel in 1989. Paris is also cancelling half, or FFr18.4bn, of the aid debt that the four relatively richer countries - Gabon, Cameroon, Congo and Ivory Coast - owe it. In addition, France is to set up a FFr300m 'special development fund', to which it hopes the European Union and World Bank will contribute and with which Paris intends to help the urban poor in CFA countries. 'We hope that other creditor governments in the Paris Club (which deals with the rescheduling of official debt) will give CFA countries the best terms,' said a French official yesterday. Clearly, France is willing to pay a price to keep the franc zone going. The cost to the Bank of France of converting CFA francs into French ones on demand is minimal, because the arrangement is backed by the requirement that CFA countries keep 65 per cent of their hard currency reserves with the French central bank. The Bank of France pays market rates on these deposits and charges market rates on any CFA borrowings. Nor is cancelling the debt of the 10 poorest countries a big sacrifice; it might never have been recovered. But the much larger cancelled debt of the four richer countries might one day have been repaid. France's private sector will also pay a price. 'The shock wave of the CFA devaluation for French investors could reach FFr10bn this year,' complained the head of the Council of French Investors in Africa in a letter yesterday to Mr Balladur. Yet such sacrifices are small beer compared to the 40 per cent drop in real per capita income suffered by the inhabitants of the franc zone since the mid-1980s. A World Bank report prepared for the Dakar meeting comments that 'the only other region of the world experiencing an economic decline of comparable magnitude is the former Soviet Union'. While in 1970-85 output and exports grew faster and inflation was lower in the CFA zone than in the rest of Africa, the trends reversed dramatically thereafter. Internally, CFA governments continued to spend too much on their public sectors and civil servants, while externally the terms of their trade worsened with their currency tied to a French franc itself trying to hold fast to the D-Mark. The World Bank and IMF have privately pointed to the 'silent crisis' caused by the increasing over-valuation of the currency. By the end of the decade, average government and manufacturing wages relative to average incomes, in Senegal for example, were three to six times higher than in Indonesia or Ghana. Last year Mr Ishrait Husain, chief economist in the World Bank's Africa department, published a study in which he compared the economic performance of the CFA countries with 14 countries which have pursued structural adjustment in the 1980s. Between 1986 and 1991 the appreciation of the CFA franc and subsequent losses in competitiveness cut the output of the CFA countries by an average of 0.2 per cent a year. But GDP in the other 14 African countries which the Bank classifies as 'adjusters' rose by an average 4.5 per cent a year over the same period. The losses were not evenly shared, however. The gainers were civil servants and students whose salaries and grants consumed an increasing majority of CFA governments' dwindling budgets. The losers were the rural masses whose incomes from agricultural production dwindled while access to primary education and health remained low. The World Bank and IMF say the devaluation was needed to sharpen the incentives for exporters and raise the incomes of poor farmers. But, in the short-term, the immediate sharp rise in import prices will aggravate rising labour unrest among civil servants and urban dwellers in West and Central African states, many of whom already have trouble meeting wage bills because of falling tax revenues. Cameroon's civil service has already been paralysed for a month by a strike over a 50 per cent wage cut announced last November. Some 55,000 secondary school teachers have been on strike since the end of November and many state hospitals are closed or maintaining only emergency cover. Magistrates went on strike at the beginning of the year. Further north, in landlocked Niger, the government closed Niamey university last Friday after students hurling stones and petrol bombs fought riot police. The students' grants have not been paid for eight months. In January 1993 the university cancelled teaching for the academic year because of lack of funds. The contrast with the tendency for neighbouring anglophone countries to devalue frequently has been felt in both exports and imports. Cheap imports from Nigeria have flooded into the CFA zone, while Ghanaian pineapples have edged those of the Ivory Coast out of the European market. 'Devaluation will bring instantaneous benefits to the Ivory Coast,' says Mr Cheikh Ibrahim Fall of the African Development Bank in Abidjan. 'Exports revenues will increase, farmers' incomes will rise and the government will have more cash to pay its domestic debt. . . But I am not convinced of the long-term benefits, if devaluation is not accompanied by other reforms.' Mr Camdessus sees signs of a new seriousness to reform and to integrate the CFA zone, particularly in the African leaders' pledge in Dakar to meet every six months to review their imminent IMF agreements. 'The CFA zone has been just a monetary arrangement. Now we may see some genuine economic convergence within it.'   Countries:-  CMZ  Cameroon, Africa.     GAZ  Gabon, Africa.

0,FT943-1808 ,"FT943-1808 _AN-EIVD2AD3FT 940922   FT  22 SEP 94 / Economic Viewpoint: Pay and jobs in a global economy      By SAMUEL BRITTAN   If problems could be cured by conferences, unemployment in the older industrialised countries would be well on the way to solution. At one recent gathering, organised by the Kansas Federal Reserve at Jackson Hole, Paul Krugman of Harvard university set out to extract a core consensus on the subject. He starts from the well-known phenomenon that, while US unemployment has been rising and falling with the business cycle, there has been no change of trend since the mid-1970s. European unemployment has, on the other hand, soared and remained at 8 per cent even in buoyant periods when the economic brakes had to be put on to prevent inflation accelerating. The US has, alas, had its own problem: a widening of pay differentials associated not with any kind of 'trickle down' but with an absolute drop in remuneration at the bottom of the pay scale. The Krugman diagnosis is that the same process which has expressed itself in high unemployment in Europe has emerged in poverty at work in the US. The demand for unskilled or less favoured workers has fallen everywhere in relation to better trained or more fortunate workers. In the US the strain has been taken by pay rates. In Europe the welfare state has prevented a similar widening of differentials and, instead, the strain is taken by unemployment. The resulting non-idyllic nature of the US labour market was vividly described by the noted US specialist Richard Freeman, at another symposium in Salzburg organised by the Egon Sohmen Foundation. He would link it with the fact that the proportion of young US males in jail, on parole or on probation, rose from 4 per cent to 11 per cent in only 13 years (1980-93); among young blacks the rise was from 11 per cent to 25 per cent. In Europe there are two ways in which prevailing institutions can worsen unemployment. There is the effect on incentives. High social security taxes add to the cost of employing workers or subtract from their take-home pay; while 'social' benefits provide a floor or reservation wage below which actual wages cannot be dragged without people being better off not working. The other way concerns not so much the welfare state itself as collectivist institutions which price workers out of jobs. There are, for instance, minimum pay provisions and restrictions on the extent to which employers can differentiate between workers of different age and experience according to the value of their skill. Then there are collective agreements between employers and unions which price the unlucky out of jobs. Indeed it is difficult in Germany for employers and workers to opt out of such agreements even if both are willing to do so in high unemployment regions. There are also restrictions on the hours and flexibility of work which have a similar effect in raising the effective costs of hiring labour. These two kinds of influences shade into each other. But it does make a difference where one puts the emphasis. If the main part of the problem is the lack of work incentives, then unemployment is to some extent voluntary and the need to reduce the jobless percentage is a matter of easing the tax and transfer burden on those at work, or of reducing the adverse social effects of idleness. If, on the other hand, pricing-out-of-work laws and practices are the main culprits, then the unemployed are themselves the principal 'outside' victims of the 'insiders' who have made the agreements and the rules. In continental Europe the emphasis should be at least as much on collectivism as on incentives. I would also put more emphasis than is fashionable among economists on the role played by moralistic or traditional objections to undercutting. I am sometimes asked what would happen if another journalist offered to join the staff to write Economic Viewpoint for much less pay. It would be an interesting experiment. The central theme, however, is that neither the welfare state nor collective procedures for setting pay would on their own have been enough to generate the European unemployment explosion. The welfare state is probably not on average more generous than 20 years ago. Nor are pricing-out-of-work arrangements more strict. The important point has been the interaction of European practices with a sharp widening of the pay relativities which would prevail if the labour market were left to itself. Is it possible to square the circle and combine the benefits of a European welfare state with an American-style flexible labour market? The upbeat answer is to call for more education and training, so that workers near the bottom of the income scale acquire more of the capacities of the ones at the top. It is to Krugman's credit that he steers clear of this industrial correctness. He rightly queries how much of the wider spread in equilibrium pay rates is due to formal education. Differentials among people of similar educational qualifications have increased at least as much as differentials between people of different qualifications. He also adds that Americans who hold up the superior performance of France and Germany in teaching basic literacy and numeracy fail to notice that the results have not translated into lower unemployment. Shrinking the welfare state is at the other extreme - the hard-nosed approach. This would have many very harsh effects. Not only would benefits be less for those still unemployed; but there would be a shakedown in pay rates for those who have always had jobs near the bottom of the scale. One approach, which has been powerfully argued by Edmund Phelps of Columbia is that of an employer subsidy to take on unskilled workers. This would be expensive and would have to be very tightly policed to prevent abuse; there would, for instance, have to be a sliding scale for borderline workers. Moreover, because of differing family circumstances the net redistribution of income implicit in such a scheme would be badly targeted. The still distant ideal would be of a basic income paid to everyone to provide a floor, on top of which market earnings would be added. To say that this would be prohibitively expensive is partly a matter of tax illusion. The real drawbacks are that there could be a large incentive to voluntary unemployment or underemployment for those prepared to make do with the basic income; and much of the benefits would spill over to those higher up the income scale needing it least. The best present compromise would be a negative income tax which would differ from a basic income in being conditional on work search attempts and in being withdrawn at a much higher rate than the basic rate of income tax. Indeed an embryonic British system of this kind exists in the form of family credits for households with breadwinners on low incomes. This could be built on, for instance by extending it to workers without children and making some of the conditions less irksome. But on neither side of the Atlantic is it easy to interest people in British experiments; and there is a preference for a priori proposals. Just for once, however, I want to move off remedies and discuss the diagnosis further. For the main problem of the Krugman consensus is that the reason labour market relativities should have changed so much is left hanging in mid-air. The conventional explanation - of technology driving out unskilled workers - is unconvincing. For pay differentials within every skill and educational category have risen quite as much as differentials between them. And as Krugman remarks: 'The time could well come when most tax lawyers are replaced with expert systems, but human beings are still needed for such truly difficult occupations as gardening and house cleaning.' The most controversial explanation centres on competition from low-wage workers in the developing - and more recently the former communist - countries in a liberalised global economy. This was suggested by Douglas McWilliams of the London Centre for Economics and Business Research in a couple of lectures last year. It has since been most fully developed in a book by Adrian Wood, North South Trade, Employment and Inequality (Clarendon Press, Oxford). The respectable form of this thesis must be sharply distinguished from that of populist opponents of the Gatt accord, who do not understand that countries of very different income levels can profitably trade with each other. If trade is freed between two groups, North and South, the presumption is that both sides benefit, although not necessarily everyone in both groups. The suggestion, rather, is that in the North unskilled or semi-skilled workers, whose tasks can be equally well carried out by workers elsewhere at much lower wages, will lose out. The problem then becomes one not of 'unfair' trade, as the Clinton administration seems to think, but of income distribution within the North. Many orthodox trade experts reject this diagnosis, although a new analysis by Jeffrey Sachs and H J Shatzin in the latest Brookings Papers gives it partial support. But the real point is that the globalisation of the world economy (a term to which Krugman strongly objects) could easily throw up such problems in the future even if it has not done so already. Indeed, it is possible to bypass the complexities of international trade theory by looking at the world as a single economy. In such an economy not only goods but capital is mobile - physical as well as financial capital. It only takes a few years to put up a new plant anywhere where the local political environment is favourable. In such a world, as Patrick Minford eloquently maintained at Salzburg, pay differences among workers of comparable skill will tend to be reduced, if not eliminated, by owners of capital seeking the best return, and able to introduce best-practice technology wherever they go. This will be so even if labour itself remains relatively immobile between countries or areas. If this were to happen, the conditions of the workers of the world would indeed tend to be equalised - at least among those of comparable skills - but by means very different from those that the early socialists envisaged. What are the main snags in this equalisation scenario? Why did nothing like this happen before 1914 when there was, indeed, a single world economy and many such fears were expressed by European and American protectionists? The big difference is that literacy has become very widespread in the third world in the last 40 years - which it was not in Queen Victoria's time. Looking ahead, the most under-discussed problem is: what will happen to wage rates in the emerging countries? On productivity grounds they should rise towards those of the west, thus tackling the problem in the best possible way. This is a reasonable hope for a country like the Czech Republic, where the skills, capital and entrepreneurship for near full employment already exist and where people have agreed to a sharp, but they hope temporary, sacrifice to repair the ravages of totalitarian rule. Matters are very different in China, where there are said to be 200m workers surplus to farm needs who could presumably be enticed into the cities at wage rates only marginally above subsistence. But the final ray of hope which I would like to point to takes us back to the more prosperous north. If the liberalisation of the world economy is going to make northern countries richer, but make many industrial or clerical workers within them worse off, then who will gain the difference? For a time it may be the owners of capital - a foretaste is visible in the worldwide rise in long-term real interest rates. But capital will be eventually affected by the tendency of funds available for investment to increase to meet new opportunities. One is then left with the conclusion that much of the gain will go to owners of land, who outside the rural shires are hard to distinguish from owners of capital. Classical economists, right down to supposedly extreme free marketeers like Friedrich Hayek, have always accepted that land in the shape of pure space is a suitable object for redistributive taxation. But they despaired about being able to separate in practice the return from owning land, on the one hand, from the yield to the capital and ingenuity spent on improving it, on the other. The effort to distinguish it may still have to be made.   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

He brushed aside news that the London-based credit rating agency IBCA had only awarded an inferior BB, or sub-investment grade, rating on Thursday. The IBCA rating was greeted with disappointment in South Africa because many fund managers are not allowed to buy sub-investment, or junk bonds, but there was little surprise in the international markets. The South African government is seeking ratings from the international rating agencies in order to facilitate its return to tap the international bond markets, to fund its reconstruction programme. Speaking in Edinburgh to European securities analysts, Mr De Klerk expressed regret that South Africa's political transformation had not yet been adequately recognised by the markets. 'I find it strange that the financial markets should reflect a scepticism on the government's ability to govern the country efficiently and prudently. This is unfair to the government of national unity and has no basis in fact,' he said. He insisted the government would maintain fiscal discipline and would not repeat the populist mistakes of other countries in funding the reconstruction and development programme. Higher interest rates would increase debt service costs and thus would lead to a slight expenditure overrun for 1994-95 but steps would be taken to finance it on a sound basis. Mr De Klerk said the South African authorities would not spring a surprise on the nervous markets by an early abolition of the financial rand system. They were keen to change as soon as possible - but would not be rushed.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

The ten-year project aims to wipe out illiteracy and improve  the overall talents of rural people in this comparatively  backward region of the country.    Previously, illiterate people aged between 14 and 40 made up  22 percent of the 4.8 million rural population of the autonomous  region.    During the past three years, local government has earmarked  six million yuan to set up 2,158 cultural and scientific  schools, 2,800 popular science associations and 200-plus  specialized technique societies for local farmers.    Some 318,000 rural people have participated in literacy  classes and 180,000 of them can now read and write.    Two million farmers have learned some farming techniques  that  can help them make more money, thanks to the fruitful work of  training programs offered by the project.    All over the region, more than 20,000 local teachers and  technicians have enthusiastically taken part in the project and  work with much patience and devotion.

0,FT932-3841 ,"FT932-3841 _AN-DFKB5AG0FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (2): Structural defects in an ailing economy - Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty and violence have taken their toll      By TONY HAWKINS   SOUTH AFRICANS have to believe that post-apartheid economic performance will break the post-independence African mould. For many such a belief has to be a triumph of faith over experience and possibly even logic, especially since for the past 20 years, the South African economy itself has performed no better than many in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of this year, per capita incomes, at 1985 prices, will have slipped below R3,100 to their lowest point since 1970. The South Africa economy is certainly not 'in ruins' as suggested in 1991 by Nelson Mandela, but then neither is it in anything remotely resembling peak condition. Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty, violence and mass action have taken their toll on the economy and continue to do so. The skills haemorrhage is resuming on a debilitating scale to be followed, no doubt, by an exodus of experience from the public sector as affirmative action takes off. Structural defects are highlighted in the recently-published Normative Economic Model (NEM) - the work of Pretoria officialdom. A decade of stagnation is blamed on double-digit inflation since the early 1970s, declining investment volumes and efficiency, increased government consumption spending - up to 18 per cent of GDP during the 1985-91 period from 12 per cent in the 1960s - and the juxtaposition of rising real wages and falling formal sector employment. Growth potential has slowed dramatically from an average of 5.5 per cent between 1961 and 1978 to 1.3 per cent in recent years. In narrow macroeconomic terms, this is the result of a decline in net investment to less than 4 per cent of GDP since 1985, falling below 1 per cent last year, while the capital output ratio has widened from 2.1 in the 1960s to 3.0, meaning that more investment rands are needed to increase output. A crucial structural defect, too, is the high level of capital intensity. According to the NEM, a prime goal of a labour-surplus country should be the promotion of labour-intensive techniques, but South Africa has been heading in the opposite direction. Since 1961, the capital-to-labour ratio has virtually doubled with the result that even were the economy to grow at 4.5 per cent annually for the rest of the decade, unemployment would continue to rise. Not everyone agrees with this analysis. Not only does it assume that future relationships between investment and employment will replicate the past - a generic weakness of such models - but it is guilty of what Mr Edward Osborn, chief economist of Nedbank, calls 'a fallacy of aggregation'. The NEM has several explanations for the rise in capital-intensity, including large capital-intensive projects carried out by the state which has left the country with surplus capacity in energy and transport, negative real interest rates which encouraged capital-intensive investments, existing consumption patterns and, of course, relatively high labour costs. Nedbank is more circumspect, pointing out that the growth in capital intensity in manufacturing is traceable to heavy investment in the steel, synthetic fuels and pulp and paper sectors. Whoever is right, the prospects for a reversal of this trend - fundamental to the NEM's aim of employment-generating economic growth - are belied by recent significant investment decisions. The principal commodity-based investment projects now being developed - the Alusaf aluminium smelter, the Oryx and Moab gold mines, the Namakwa Sands mining project, and the Columbus stainless steel complex - are all capital-intensive. This is not to criticise the model's appropriate focus on employment creation. As a supplyside model, the NEM concentrates on fostering a policy environment conducive to export-led, labour-intensive industrial growth. It says little about the demand side of the equation which, if the Alusaf and Columbus projects are any guide, points in the direction of continuing capital intensity. Similarly, the country's existing export portfolio reflects an essentially resource-based pattern of industrialisation with direct mining and agricultural exports accounting for more than 70 per cent of the total, and processed primary products for a further 5 per cent. The balance is dominated by iron and steel products (10 per cent) and chemicals (3.5 per cent). This leaves a little over 10 per cent for manufactured exports - dominated by textiles, machinery and equipment. Even that could well be an overstatement when account is taken of re-exports to the sub-continent. Private sector economists argue that in terms of productivity, labour costs and the cost of capital, South Africa is simply not a world class player in manufacturing. Officials say this is changing, predicting 5 per cent inflation in 1995/6 compared with a forecast 11 per cent this year, and arguing that the NEM's prescriptions of increased market competition and the phasing down of tariff protection and exchange controls will boost international competitiveness. In part, this optimism is based on the moderation in wage demands and awards that has followed four years of recession, and on the restructuring that has already taken place in gold mining where more than 120,000 jobs have been shed and in the state-owned railway system, Transnet, which has halved its workforce to 135,000 from 289,000 in 1982. If narrow economic considerations were all that mattered, such optimism might well be justified. But engineering a sustainable fall in inflation and a significant shift of resources from consumption to investment at a time of wrenching political change, when the majority of the population is expecting a 'liberation dividend' and when the underlying fiscal situation is far from healthy, will be exceptionally difficult. The signs are that the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, the architect of monetary restraint, will be reappointed, thereby ensuring that monetary discipline is retained. But the planned halving by 1997 of the public sector deficit, from a forecast 6.8 per cent of GDP this year will be extremely difficult to achieve. Even before the transfer of power to a more 'people-oriented' administration, the Reserve Bank says the level of government spending is 'exceptionally high', reaching 31.4 per cent of GDP last year. There will be savings as the apartheid-driven duplication of public services is eradicated, but a significant peace dividend is unlikely given the proposed integration of the ANC's military wing into the armed forces. Spending on job creation, social upliftment and poverty reduction will put an enormous burden on the public purse along with the expansion of public sector employment, the cost of reintegrating the 6.5mpeople from the TBVC (homeland) states, and terminal benefits for many whites in the public sector and the security forces who will want to embark on fresh careers within and outside South Africa. Although South Africa is substantially underborrowed externally, domestically it is teetering on the brink of a debt trap. Interest payments which accounted for a mere 3.9 per cent of the national budget in 1976 will absorb 17.4 per cent this year. Unless government spending  - and the deficit - are tackled decisively, the public debt, currently 53 per cent of GDP, will escalate pushing the country ever deeper into a debt trap where increased borrowing will be needed to finance interest payments. African experience in structural adjustment is less than reassuring. Governments have been unwilling, or unable, to impose fiscal discipline. Why should South Africa be any different ? Possibly because it has excess infrastructural capacity, the strongest private sector and financial infrastructure in the continent, a strong skills base - by African standards - and the advantage of having travelled some distance down the learning curve before having to make hard economic choices. The ANC has moved a long way towards the centre largely dropping nationalisation from its policy agenda, softening its antipathy towards foreign investment and backing away from many of its interventionist ideas. There is a high degree of convergence in economic thinking with economists from the ANC and the labour unions reluctantly accepting that they will not be able to create a brave new world in a matter of a few years, and that wage restraint and fiscal and monetary discipline must remain at the head of the policy agenda for the foreseeable future. One businessman, who works alongside the ANC/Cosatu alliance in the tripartite National Economic Forum, representing business, government and the unions, is confident that the ANC will be 'ruthlessly pragmatic' in economic policy-making. This may well be the present game plan, but it assumes not only that the ANC will abandon much of the ideological baggage accumulated during its years in the political wilderness, but also that its constituencies  - the unions, the students, the peasants and the unemployed - will be willing to forgo butter tomorrow in anticipation of butter and jam in five years' time. The optimists argue that it need not come to this; that the recent surge in the gold price and the forecast world economic recovery will provide a window of opportunity taking the pressure off the balance of payments, the budget deficit and monetary policy. The upbeat scenario has a final agreement on the debt standstill in place before the end of this year, resumed access to IMF and World Bank funding during 1994, the rationalisation of tariffs and partial liberalisation of exchange controls, including abolition of the financial rand, and a significant rand devaluation to boost industrial exports. On this scenario, the four-year-long recession bottoms out in the latter half of 1993, and the economy rebounds on to a 4 per cent growth path from next year. Once devaluation is digested, inflation stabilises at 8 per cent to 10 per cent, and foreign investment resumes in the mid-90s when the international business community is satisfied that the mould really has been broken. For this upbeat scenario to materialise, a formidable array of conditions must be satisfied, most crucially the next government being sufficiently strong-willed to tread the finest of lines between satisfying its disparate constituencies and rebuilding business and investor confidence at home and abroad. A tall order for any administration, and especially one with a built-in mistrust of big business and a naive confidence in the ability of macro-economic policies to restructure an essentially third-world, commodity-dependent economy.  ----------------------------------------- GNP per capita  ----------------------------------------- Year         Rand*  ----------------------------------------- 1960        2,485 1970        3,078 1974        3,894 1980        3,981 1985        3,533 1990        3,345 1991        3,286 1992        3,103 1993**      3,060  ----------------------------------------- * 1985 constant prices; ** Forecast  ----------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------------  -------------------------------------- Investment  -------------------------------------- Year              %  -------------------------------------- 1978           26.2 1980           26.2 1982           27.9 1984           24.4 1986           20.2 1988           19.1 1989           20.8 1990*          20.0 1991           18.0 1992           15.9  -------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  --------------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Inflation  ----------------------------------- Year            %  ----------------------------------- 1986         18.5 1987         16.2 1988         12.9 1989         14.7 1990         14.4 1991         15.3 1992         13.9 1993*        11.3  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Gross domestic product  ----------------------------------- Year         Growth rates %  ----------------------------------- 1984             5.1 1985            -1.2 1986             0.0 1987             2.1 1988             4.2 1989             2.3 1990            -0.5 1991            -0.4 1992            -2.1 1993*            0.0  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  -----------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 183.7m to Pounds 194.8m in the six months to September 30, while sales increased by 6.4 per cent to Pounds 1.25bn (Pounds 1.71bn). The group said the home shopping side lifted sales by 5 per cent to Pounds 780.5m, helped by increased investment in warehouses, distribution and marketing, and operating profits rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 81.5m. Overseas retailing boosted operating profit by 24 per cent to Pounds 10.8m on turnover of Pounds 83.3m, a rise of 6.4 per cent. South Africa produced a good result, but the Canadian performance had been affected by economic problems. Sales of Burberrys products, including royalties, rose 10 per cent to Pounds 71.2m with operating profits were up 6 per cent at Pounds 12.5m. GUS said prudent lending policies enabled the consumer and corporate finance division to contain bad debt and this contributed to a modest 1.5 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 62.1m on sales of Pounds 311.2m, a rise of 8.8 per cent. Reviews of existing leases saw rental income from the property division increase by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 25.3m. GUS said: 'The recent turbulence in the currency markets and rapidly fluctuating interest rates represent a basic malaise in an unsettled economic climate, making forward business planning hazardous and complex.' Earnings increased from 49.2p to 51.4p. The interim dividend is 13.75p (12.75p). COMMENT GUS's A shares closed 35p down at Pounds 16.18, reflecting both that these profits were slightly below some expectations and the cautious tone of the terse accompanying statement. GUS said sales since the half-year had been satisfactory, but the volatile nature of trading made the outlook difficult to predict. Net cash is above the year-end total of Pounds 590m. Falling rates mean lower interest income, but the group contends that should be more than offset by the impact of cheaper money on consumer spending. Overseas earnings, accounting for nearly a fifth of group profits, benefited from the translation being made post-devaluation. Forecast full-year profits of Pounds 470m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 12.6. The shares have had a good run from Pounds 12.80 in the past year, and were no doubt overdue for some profit-taking. However, they appear to have little downside at this level, given the group's consistent record of earnings growth.  The Financial Times   London Page 25  "

Perez]    [Text] Davao City -- The Davao City Government, in  coordination with the Private Investments and Trade  Opportunities-Philippines (PITO-P), has identified the list of  preferred investment areas (PIAs) to further lure local and  foreign businessmen to the area.    BUSINESS WORLD learned PIAs included under the ""Invest in  Davao"" project are classified into five major groupings, namely,  agri-business, tourism and recreation, manufacturing and  assembly, transshipment infrastructure, and property development.    The Invest in Davao project is a short-term (three years)  development scheme for the city. It has a fund of P37 million  [Philippine pesos] of which P20 million was pledged by the city  government and P17 million from PITO-P.    The Service Group, a Washington-based consultancy group, was  also used to conduct the study or assessment on the investment  climate in Davao.    Being the biggest producer of agricultural products, a  reason  Davao was dubbed as the ""Fruit Basket of the Philippines,"" the  city plays an important role in enhancing the agri-based  industry.    Agri-business development in the area focuses on fruit  processing using dehydration, vacuum or spray technologies, and  canned specialty vegetables.    The potential is large for the agriculture and agri-based  industries in Davao and in the whole of Mindanao due to the  relatively favorable climate throughout the year, available  skilled and professional manpower supply, high literacy rate,  and low cost of labor.    Davao City's role as the regional commercial center will be  boosted anew with Mindanao gearing up to become one of Asia's  tourist destinations.    Records show that within six years, tourist arrivals in  Davao  jumped to 193,000 last year from 150,000 in 1987, a reason to  develop international standard hotels and beach resorts, sports  complexes, recreational facilities such as golf courses, and  marine/wildlife parks.    The manufacturing sector earmarks potential investment areas  in garments, footwear, toys, bulky kitchen and house wares,  among others. There is also a need to invest in common and  bonded warehouses to support agricultural productivity.    Roberto Arquiza, Invest in Davao assistant project manager,  told BUSINESS WORLD there is a need to develop the manufacturing  industry in Davao. ""In spite of the rapid progress of the area  (Davao), most of the goods are still coming from Manila,"" he  said.    Councilor Aristeo Albay, chairman of the city council urban  planning and development committee, added, ""It's about time that  Davao develop its manufacturing industry so that it will be less  dependent from Manila.""    In terms of transshipment infrastructure, there are seven  private piers operating in Davao. Four investors (two Filipino  shippers, a Greek firm, and a British company) have also shown  interest to set up shipping operations in Davao.    The Greek shipping company, Hellenic Shipyard of Perama  S.A.,  is also planning to improve the maritime school by upgrading the  teaching facilities.    With the rise in industries and business activities in Davao  City, investments are needed to finance the construction of more  commercial office buildings, residential villages, industrial  estates, and convention/seminar centers.    As a come-on for prospective investors, the city government  included in the investment priority plan provisions for fiscal  and non-fiscal incentives.    These privileges are in addition to incentives granted by  law  and the Local Government Code.    The incentives provide that a new enterprise will be fully  exempt from mayor's permit fees, building permit fees, and local  business tax imposed by city ordinances. The incentives are  good for two years from the start of commercial operation.    There will also be tax reductions in the gross sales or  receipts taxable base for a given period after a tax holiday.    Deductions    The following deductions for business sales taxes will be  allowed as deductions from gross receipts during the preceding  calendar year for three years starting from the date of  registration:    -- a non-cumulative operating loss equivalent to 25 percent  of losses of the preceding year as indicated in the financial  statement submitted to the Bureau of Internal Revenue;    -- 20 percent of expenditures from annual wages paid to  newly  hired employees who are residents of Davao City;    -- 25 percent of expenditures on infrastructure and/or  facilities built by investors which are accessible to and used  by the public; and,    -- 25 percent of expenditures on human resource/skills  training based on a training program.    There are also incentives on real property tax (RPT) such as  tax exemption for two years from the start of commercial  operation, reduced RPT rates for new investors for two years,  and two-year exemption on machinery and equipment used for  pollution control.

President Mugabe said Africa was embarking on a program of  economic structural adjustment, political reforms and regional  integration. Good governance had been accepted as vital  throughout Africa as democracy could not be complete without it.  He said those African countries that had demonstrated  seriousness about their political and economic reforms deserved  support and cooperation more than ever before.     "

In an interview en route to Addis Ababa, he said possible  military intervention in Rwanda by the South African troops  would have to be carefully considered by the government. ""There  is no plan so far of any military action. But the spirit to  assist and desire to help is there.""    Mr Nzo and senior officials of his department arrived in  Addis Ababa on Wednesday afternoon to officially raise South  Africa's flag outside the Organisation of African Unity  headquarters.    South Africa became the 53rd member of the OAU on Monday.    Mr Nzo said South Africa would play a role in conflict  mediation efforts in Africa in consultation with the OAU and the  United Nations.    He warned against exaggerated expectations of economic  benefits arising from South Africa's admission to the OAU.  ""Charity begins at home. South Africa also has large foreign  debt and must do everything possible to end that debt.""    The foreign minister said South Africa's membership of the  OAU was ""the culmination of a dream that one day South Africa  will take its rightful place alongside the independent states of  Africa"".    South Africa would assist the continent in asserting itself  in international politics and there was an increased potential  for trade links with other African states.    He emphasised however that South Africa's foreign policy  would be guided by the priority of improving the lives of South  Africans. ""We are not going to foster big brother relations with  the rest of Africa. We are for mutual co-operation to help  uplift the other countries of Africa.""    The flag-raising ceremony, which would be attended by the  OAU  Secretary-General Dr Salim Ahmed Salim, is scheduled to take  place at 3PM SA [South African] time.     "

The central bank announced a 20 per cent devaluation of the official rate - used solely for government imports and servicing public and publicly guaranteed debt - from 36.4 to 45.6 shillings to the US dollar. The commercial rate of exchange, set by the banking sector for all other trade, is hovering around Sh60 to the dollar. The move is a further concession to the International Monetary Fund and removes an obstacle to speedy resumption of crucial quick disbursing aid worth up to Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) a month, suspended in 1991 because of economic mismanagement. The IMF left Kenya last weekend without agreeing a provisional deal which could lead to the resumption of the frozen aid. The Fund was reported to have insisted on a staggered merging of the official and commercial exchange rates before giving its stamp of approval to the government's reform programme. Money supply grew last year 35 per cent and inflation is between 40 and 60 per cent. After months of delay the government embarked on a serious programme of reforms in mid-February. It floated the currency for commercial transactions, announced tighter expenditure controls and took steps to restart the liberal-isation of the agricultural sector. Next Monday the World Bank will chair an informal donors' meeting in London to review the recent measures and discuss the possibility of resuming the suspended aid. Among proposals to be discussed is the rapid unblocking of a World Bank export promotion loan worth Dollars 150m in World Bank and bilateral funds.   Countries:-  KEZ  Kenya, Africa.

0,FT932-3834 ,"FT932-3834 _AN-DFKB5AG7FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (9): Challenge of banking the unbanked - The way forward in the new South Africa for financial services      By PHILIP GAWITH   AS BEFITS a society undergoing fundamental transition, South Africa is full of examples of poacher turned gamekeeper. A case in point concerns Moses Mayekiso, head of the SA National Civic Organisation (Sanco), one of the country's most prominent communist leaders. He has been a key figure in recent years in organising civil disobedience, such as rent boycotts, in black townships which has made the black home loan market a perilous place for banks to be. Mr Mayekiso is the man with whom the Association of Mortgage Lenders (AML) has worked in an attempt to restore stability to this difficult market. Two months ago the AML and Sanco reached an historic agreement on a set of principles to be followed in the handling of bond payments in arrears, payment defaults and repossessed properties. The agreement is, in effect, a peace treaty between the two parties. What is telling, however, are the principles underlying the treaty which make explicit the sort of issues which need to be tackled if banking is to be successfully transacted in the new South Africa. Home loans, of course, are a particularly politicised area. For decades apartheid decreed where blacks should live and denied to most the right to home ownership. This politicised the question of where people live, and by association, products in the housing market. The act of repossession, for example, when a loan was in arrears, was not seen so much as the normal functioning of the system, but as a perpetuation of the apartheid plan of depriving blacks of housing. Though politics has made home loans the most fraught area of lending, the root problem, which confronts banks across the full spectrum of their activities, is the enormous gap between the formal banking sector and the black community. The symptoms are typically South African. On the one hand, evidence of considerable sophistication - reputedly the highest number, per capita, of automatic teller machines in the world. On the other, evidence of the most basic developing country - very few black people, who constitute about 80 per cent of the population, have cheque accounts. How to bridge this gap - to bank the unbanked, bridge the gap between first and third world, call it what you will - is a huge strategic challenge facing South Africa's banks. Given that they make handsome profits serving the first world, it might well be asked why they should bother with the problematic third world market. There are two legs to the answer: Profit: it constitutes a huge potential growth market; and Self-preservation: in the words of Mr Jopie van Honschooten, head of the Community Banking Division at Standard Bank: 'If you don't have stability in the wider community, then you can forget about success in the formal banking sector. It will be like having first class tickets on the Titanic.' That is the easy part. The difficult question is that having decided it is a market you cannot ignore, how do you approach it, and how far do you become involved? These are still early days, but the broad outlines of the way forward are fairly clear. First, in Mr Van Honschooten's words, 'new mechanisms are needed for new markets'. Products developed in the developed market cannot simply be transferred into the developing market. There is ample evidence that this method has failed. New products and approaches are required. In terms of product, banks have realised that their offerings must be more closely tailored to the actual needs of the developing community. For example, research shows that in these communities access to credit is often more of a problem than the cost of that credit. Also, time horizons are often shorter. A hawker wants a loan not for three or six months, but for three weeks. Hence, greater attention needs to be paid to 'velocity loans' - where interest rates of 0.5-1 per centa day make sense in the short term, in spite of appearing usurious on an annualised basis. In terms of approach, banks have realised that they have a development role to play. Given that most of the developing market is outside the banking system, there is very little informal transmission of knowledge about banking practices - for example, how to get a home loan, what commitments are expected, what to do when in arrears, etc. If the banks want to create a sustainable environment in which to do business, they have to take on this educational task themselves. As Mr Van Honschooten makes clear: 'We're not in development per se, as some politicians would have us be. We're in development to the extent of making banking sustainable.' He reminds that 'the role of the bank is actually as intermediary to channel surplus savings to those who need to borrow. At our peril in South Africa do we endanger that process.' The way to secure it, of course, is to maintain sound principles of risk management. What this involves is clearly spelt out in the AML/Sanco accord which, inter alia, accepts the principles that financial institutions: Have a contractual commitment to depositors to pay them an agreed return on deposits; Would be unable to raise funds for lending if they didn't offer shareholders and providers of capital a fair return; As custodians of the nation's savings have to act with utmost prudence in assessing risks. These principles are balanced by others which recognise, for example, that 'community empowerment, education and participation are vital to the process of creating a normal property market'; repossession should be avoided wherever possible; and the need for alternative forms of housing tenure. In practice, what this means is that the formal banking sector is likely to limit itself to meeting the needs of the economically active - those who have stable employment and regular income. Those who are 'sub-optimally economically active' - in the informal sector, with irregular income, will have their needs met by community-based structures, supported by the formal sector. In this regard a Community Banking Project under leadership of Mr Bob Tucker, formerly head of The Perm building society, has done considerable work towards establishing the commercial and practical viability of community banking in South Africa. There seems to be a reasonable prospect that community banking will soon be established in South Africa to introduce, on a pilot basis, 'mass banking' into the black community.

By DAVID SMOLLAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER      What a difference a couple of years make.    In 1988, the San Diego Community College District was awash in controversy,  with distrust between the faculty and a long-entrenched board of trustees over  a stagnant educational philosophy, the personality of administrative leaders  and an unusual financial arrangement for a district foundation.    Two years later, district relationships have moved light-years from those  times, with two new board members elected in November 1988, two new  administrators widely praised by faculty and community alike and a solution to  the festering foundation issue.    So, in contrast to past elections, the campaigns this fall for three of the  five trustee seats have been marked not by rancor or back-biting on philosophy  or personality, but more traditional debate -- rare in many campaigns these  days -- over who is more qualified to continue and improve upon present  district policies.    None of the three incumbents, two retiring after 17 years and a third after  nine years, chose to stand for reelection. With the 1988 election of reform  candidates Evonne Schulze and Fred Colby, all trustees after the November  balloting will have come aboard within the past two years, symbolizing the  change that has swept the district.    The San Diego district is the second-largest among California's 71 community  college districts, providing vocational and part-time education to working  students, as well as preparing others who are unable at first to meet  four-year-college financial or academic entry requirements for transfer to the  UC and Cal State systems .    In District A, which covers the Point Loma and beach areas, Yvonne Larsen is  running against Kara Kobey. Larsen took 41% of the June primary vote to Kobey's  30.5% preparatory to the citywide runoff next week.    Larsen, 59, has a long record of involvement in both San Diego and national  educational activities, which she points to as proof of her ability to handle  matters at the community college level, with its $230-million annual budget,  its 120,000 full- and part-time students, and its 7,000 faculty and other  employees. The district has three campuses -- Mesa, City and Miramar -- as well  as numerous continuing education centers throughout the city.    Larsen, a San Diego State graduate, served eight years on the San Diego Unified  School District board, which governs kindergarten-through-12th grade policies  in the city, was a trustee of the California State University system, and held  the vice chairman role on the 1981 National Commission on Excellence in  Education. That commission produced the watershed ""Nation at Risk"" study in  1983, from which nationwide reforms have since emanated.    Larsen has stressed her management experience at numerous candidate forums,  saying she knows how to ""stand and fight"" when things do not always run  smoothly. Larsen wants the district to offer more literacy programs, put more  technology into its classrooms and act more creatively with the San Diego  school district in devising programs for preventing and recapturing dropouts.    Kobey, 32, is making her first run at elected office, saying she herself  benefited from the community colleges -- she is a 1982 graduate of Mesa before  going on to San Diego State -- and wants to return something.    Kobey, best known as the daughter of the late Monte Kobey and his famous swap  meets, calls for more rapid completion of Miramar College, the district's  newest, and for renovation of Mesa, now severely crowded after more than 25  years of use.    Kobey also advocates more trade partnerships between private businesses and  vocational programs at the colleges, saying such links could provide students  with a more realistic understanding of how their training will pay off with  private industry.    ""I know the value of a community college education, and I know how useful it  can be to those who go on to other study,"" Kobey said.    In District A, Miramar College political science and physical education  professor Robert Bacon, 57, is paired against Maria Senour, a professor of  counseling education at San Diego State. Senour won 48.3% of the primary vote  against Bacon's 16.7% in the district, which covers the northern tier of the  city.    Senour, 46, a graduate of Marygrove College in Detroit, has emphasized her  experience in training counselors, since a large part of the district's  challenge is in retaining more ethnic-minority students after they begin their  studies. Senour also would like Mesa's renovation to be moved higher on  district capital improvement lists, as well as have an expansion of the  transfer guarantee program that automatically ensures students entry in their  junior year to UC San Diego if they complete a prescribed course of study.    ""I see the community colleges as particularly important for poor people  economically,"" Senior said. ""For many students, the push to succeed comes from  educators who take the time to help, and the community colleges need more  people who can personally touch a student in some way . . . to be role models  in making a personal outreach.""    Bacon, 57, has taught at district sites for 31 years and is known to legions of  longtime San Diegans for his tennis instruction. A San Diego State graduate, he  has been a professor at Miramar the past 12 years and was the president of the  faculty senate for the past two years.    Bacon reflects the view of all the candidates in saying that ""this is a good  district already, which can be made better"" and he stresses his familiarity  with Assembly Bill 1725, the 1988 state legislation that requires sweeping  changes in the state community college system, both in educational offerings  and in improving the quality of full-time faculty.    As Miramar faculty senate president, Bacon had a role in the district's record  of hiring almost 50% new faculty from nonwhite applicants in an effort to have  its professorial staff represent more closely the multiethnic mix of its  student body.    As a trustee, Bacon would work to increase academic course offerings and  especially try to improve the college libraries, which have suffered along with  libraries throughout the state's educational system because of budget cuts and  higher costs for periodicals and specialized serials.    Hope Logan and Denise Ducheny are the finalists in District E, which  encompasses many of the city's nonwhite neighborhoods including Logan Heights,  Southeast San Diego, Paradise Hills and Encanto. Logan garnered 51.6% of the  primary vote, and Ducheny won 24.7%.    The 68-year-old Logan is well-known for her longtime community and educational  activism. She has served as an officer of the Urban League of San Diego, as a  member of the city's Civil Service Commission and as a member of the San Diego  Community Foundation board of directors.    Logan, a graduate of UCLA, also was a lecturer for many years at San Diego  State and chairwoman of an education committee for the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People.    As a product of public schools, Logan said the community colleges are the last  hope for many young people who otherwise have no future as productive citizens.    ""For some time, I've seen too many children who complete 12th grade with  nothing for them to do; they are not yet educated or trained to get a job,"" she  said.    Logan said she would work hard to fulfill the obligation of community colleges  to serve the ""underclass"" with literacy and up-to-date vocational educational  classes.    Ducheny, 37, is equally known throughout the Southeast San Diego area for  advocacy in support of minorities.    A Pomona College graduate and practicing attorney, Ducheny and her husband, Al,  have lobbied for community interests in Barrio Logan and Southeast San Diego on  a variety of City Council and Port of San Diego issues. Ducheny would follow  that pattern as a trustee, lobbying for more literacy and vocational education  programs, for better academic preparation under the transfer agreement programs  and for better libraries.    ""This is a board that can do a lot more, especially with City College  (downtown) and at the Educational Cultural Complex (in Southeast San Diego) to  get more people the education that they need,"" Ducheny said. She would push for  more partnerships with both the private sector and public agencies, and to  boost counseling efforts.

A Pomona College graduate and practicing attorney, Ducheny and her husband, Al,  have lobbied for community interests in Barrio Logan and Southeast San Diego on  a variety of City Council and Port of San Diego issues. Ducheny would follow  that pattern as a trustee, lobbying for more literacy and vocational education  programs, for better academic preparation under the transfer agreement programs  and for better libraries.    ""This is a board that can do a lot more, especially with City College  (downtown) and at the Educational Cultural Complex (in Southeast San Diego) to  get more people the education that they need,"" Ducheny said. She would push for  more partnerships with both the private sector and public agencies, and to  boost counseling efforts.    "

Africa should not be neglected or marginalized.""    Qian made the statement at a press conference held here  today  at the end of his visit to Kenya.    He said, ""though Africa faces many difficulties, it also has  its own strong points. Africa is not hopeless its future is  bright.""    On his current East Africa trip, he said he has come to see  developments in the region by himself and promote bilateral  relations between China and the countries he visits.    On the major problem facing African countries, Qian said  African countries are not able to concentrate their efforts to  develop economy, adding many problems cannot be solved without  real development of economy.    He said Africa is under great political and economic  pressures from the outside world. Under such circumstances  there are turmoil and unrest in some African countries.  ""Without stability, it is hard for them to develop economy,"" he  pointed out.    On the democratic process in South Africa, Qian expressed  his  hope that the planned non-racial general election on April 27  will take place on schedule and a new democratic non-racial  South Africa will be established. ""China is willing to develop  relations with a new South Africa in various fields on the basis  of the principles of peaceful coexistence,"" Qian said.    As for the establishment of diplomatic relations between  China and South Africa, Qian said South Africa should follow  international regulations. ""It should not have diplomatic  relations with China and China's Taiwan province at the same  time.""    On the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and  Lesotho, Qian said this has once again demonstrated there is  only one China in the world, Taiwan is an inalienable part of  the Chinese territory, the government of the People's Republic  of China is the sole legal government of China, and the attempt  of the Taiwan authorities to create ""two Chinas"" or ""one China,  one Taiwan"" has no popular support and will never succeed.

But he does not get to the heart of the matter. The strength of the continental system is that education and training are treated holistically. Studies of the economic effectiveness of training which do not refer to education, particularly primary education, miss the point. The core of the transferable skills Mr Brittan alludes to is the set acquired in primary and early secondary phases of education. It involves what the French would call the 'formation' of an individual. It includes basic literacy and numeracy and, above all, an ability to concentrate. This produces a trainable, adaptable workforce able to acquire vocational qualifications. If the educational foundation is sound, the training function becomes simpler, more directed and less costly, and conflicts between exogenous and endogenous benefit less acute. It is the provision of a sound 'formation' to succeeding generations of school leavers that separates the sheep from the goats in national economic performance, and it is the neglect of the need to provide all our youngsters with these basic skills that is at the root of the UK's seemingly terminal decline.

0,FT934-5207 ,"FT934-5207 _AN-DLACGABBFT 931201   FT  01 DEC 93 / Asia comes to terms with growing threat from Aids: The disease came late to the continent but governments no longer sweep it under the carpet as a 'foreign' problem      By TONY WALKER, GORDON CRAMB, WILLIAM BARNES, EMIKO TERAZONO, NIKKI TAIT, KIERAN COOKE and SHIRAZ SIDHVA      BEIJING, LONDON, BANGKOK, TOKYO, SYDNEY, KUALA LUMPUR, NEW DELHI   China yesterday established a new 'Association for Preventing Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Aids' at a ceremony held in the Great Hall of the People. It was a measure of China's, arguably belated, recognition of the threat posed by Aids in the world's most populous country that the Great Hall itself was given over to such a meeting on the eve of World Aids Day. The Chinese bureaucracy appears to have begun to take the problem seriously. It has started to devote more resources to public education, and officials are now talking more openly about the issue. The shift echoes a rethink taking place across Asia as governments in the region, which previously preferred to sweep Aids under the carpet as a 'foreign' problem, come to terms with the threat the disease poses to their populations - in particular, to the economically active portion. In India, where nearly seven in every thousand are testing positive to the HIV virus which is believed to lead to Aids, 83 per cent are below the age of 50 years, and more than two-thirds of those affected are between 20 and 40. Authorities in Thailand, the Asian epicentre, estimate that between 400 and 600 of its people are infected every day. Attention paid to the issue is likely to increase ahead of the 1994 international annual conference on Aids, which is being held in the region for the first time. According to Prof Yuichi Shiokawa, chairman of the organising committee for the conference, in Yokohama next August, 'Asia faces the possibility of an explosive increase in Aids from now to the end of the century'. The disease came fairly late to the continent - Japan registered its initial case in 1985, the same year that the first annual conference was convened in the west. This has given rise to hopes that, with preventive education, its prevalence in the region may plateau at a lower level than elsewhere. But economic considerations and cultural obstacles in many places still combine to assist its proliferation. As Asia is more urbanised than Africa, its cities provide the conditions for even more rapid transmission. India's Directorate of Health Services has projected that Bombay already has 120,000 citizens infected. Mr Neil McKenna, the editor of WorldAids, a newsletter produced by the Panos Institute, a development organisation, says: 'HIV is accelerating very rapidly, as fast as it was in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1980s . . . India's great cities are a potential time-bomb.' Labour migration is a factor. Indian truck drivers show a higher than average exposure to the virus. According to Mr Zeng Yi, president of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, the main channels for HIV into China are through Thailand and Burma. The incidence of HIV-related infections, it is suggested, is particularly high among Malaysia's large immigrant workforce. Malaysia is the world's largest producer of condoms - but usage is still very low. With its high rate of literacy and generally well organised medical services, the country is in a good position to combat Aids. But government efforts to launch nationwide campaigns and sex education programmes have been opposed by conservative Moslem groups. The Thai government gives away 80m condoms a year which can be obtained free in many brothels. The use of condoms appears to have increased following a modest decline in sexually transmitted diseases. However, Thai health care workers say many customers still do not use them. Conditions in Asia assist HIV's other common means of transmission as well. In China, the fairly common practice of using one syringe for dozens of people in impoverished country regions is blamed for the spread of the virus in remote areas. Intravenous drug use in southern Yunnan province, which adjoins the 'Golden Triangle' of Burma, Thailand and Laos, is believed to have left thousands infected. While blood transfusions in Thailand are now considered safe, the Indian government has by no means been able to clean up its contaminated blood supplies. With the main source of blood being paid donors, and demand far outstripping supply, it is virtually impossible for the government to screen blood supply. The developed countries of the region no longer have such problems. But even in Japan, health care for Aids patients remains a low priority. The Health and Welfare Ministry is currently telling regional governments to create Aids facilities in at least two hospitals within a prefecture. But even in Tokyo, only eight hospitals treat people with Aids, with just three accepting in-patients. In Australia the incidence of Aids cases per 100,000 population is about 18, putting it in the top third of OECD countries (though the US has almost 86 per 100,000). Australia was probably fortunate in having a strong gay rights movement, which built on experience in the US and disseminated HIV/Aids information quickly when the infection surfaced. Early projections there have proved overly pessimistic. China, in coming to terms with the problem, still has official statistics maintaining that only 19 people have developed Aids, 14 of whom have died. But Mr Wan Yanhai, who has established Aids hotlines in several Chinese cities, believes that numbers infected exceed 100,000. The country has begun working more closely with international agencies. In September, it drew up a draft programme with WHO. Mr Zeng of the preventive medicine academy will attend the Yokohama conference - an indication that China is becoming more willing to participate in global solutions to health problems.

Africa Opens First China  Fair""]    [Text] South Africa's first commodity fair in China opened  yesterday in Beijing, marking a further step by the growing  African nation into the mainland market.    More than 300 South African business representatives are  attending the four-day event.    ""The exhibition is a landmark of the strengthened relations  between the two countries,"" said David Graaff, South Africa's  deputy-minister of industry and trade.    Companies at the South Africa China Exhibition 1994 come  from  31 industries including South Africa's strongest sectors such as  mining equipment, electronics and jewellery.    Many South African big name companies such as Sasol, Iscor  Mining  Steel Production, Saflec Electronics and Nampak are  seeking shares in China's flourishing industrial and commercial  market.    Graaff said he believes the exhibition ""will make an  important contribution to bilateral trade relations by  stimulating more joint ventures, flow of investment and tourism.""    Since the normalization of bilateral relations in 1992,  sound  trade ties have been achieved, he said.    Since then, bilateral trade volume has risen more than 30  percent to reach $658 million last year.    If trade through Hong Kong is included, the figure surpasses  $1 billion.    ""China is one of the world's fastest-growing economies and  we  always take her as an important trading partner,"" said the  deputy-minister.    He added that South Africa will continue to enjoy ties with  China for years to come.    After years of isolation on the world market, South Africa  has become a strong economic power.    Fifty-five percent of the nation's gross national product  comes from international trade, 30 percent of which is generated  by exports.    China mainly imports minerals and exports light industry  products to the South African nation.    Besides being rich in mineral resources, South Africa also  produces construction equipment.     "

The loan will be used for projects to be picked up at the  request of South Africa and will include construction of roads,  ports and power plants, the sources said.

Japan will also expand its grant-in-aid program, focusing on  education facilities, technical assistance, medical support and  agricultural development, they said.    In tandem with other industrial nations, Japan to date has  not extended full-scale economic assistance in protest of the  country's apartheid policy. But some 100 million yen has been  given as grant-in-aid to support blacks since the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development's development  assistance committee allowed the assistance in 1990.    Japan and six other Group of Seven industrial nations agreed  earlier this month to coordinate their backing to South Africa  under its new government following the African National  Congress's victory in the first all-race elections.

Of the 47 countries that attended the meeting, 36 were represented by heads of state. GLOBAL TRENDS AND PROSPECTS Heads of government welcomed continued easing of global tensions and expressed conviction that the United Nations was now better placed than ever before to fulfil its role. . . They underscored the complementary role which the Commonwealth and regional organisations could play in supporting the efforts of the UN. They reaffirmed their commitment to democracy, fundamental human rights, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and just and honest government as essential ingredients of the Commonwealth's fundamental political values. Democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom were inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing. Commonwealth leaders stressed the need to strengthen international security through disarmament and non-proliferation. They noted the world economy faced grave uncertainties but believed the current climate of low inflation and declining interest rates presented opportunities for economic recovery. They welcomed the broadening political consensus on market-friendly measures, combined with human resource development and poverty reduction. They acknowledged special difficulties of sub-Saharan Africa and noted the performances of many countries were constrained by weak commodity prices and deteriorating terms of trade. Big efforts were still required throughout the developing world to overcome institutional, economic and financial barriers to stronger growth; they also recognised these reforms should be supported by an appropriate blend of adjustment and external financing. They expressed disquiet at the continuing debt problems of many developing countries and called for measures to cut the debt burden to sustainable levels and for the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms. They noted with concern that official development assistance had fallen in real terms and called for action to reverse the fall in aid flows. Commonwealth leaders noted with appreciation numerous practical measures undertaken by the Secretariat to promote the Commonwealth fundamental political values, including monitoring elections in seven member states. SOUTH AFRICA Commonwealth leaders agreed that developments had marked irreversible progress to democracy. They endorsed lifting of sanctions but the arms embargo would remain until a new post-apartheid government was established with full democratic control and accountability. But the communique recognised that the process remained fragile and agreed the pre-eminent need was to help ensure a united, non-fragmented, democratic and non-racial South Africa. They agreed the Commonwealth Observer Mission to South Africa should remain in South Africa until after the election planned for April 1994 when the situation would be reviewed. MOZAMBIQUE Leaders expressed concern at recurring delays in implementing the October 1992 peace accord and called on the Renamo opposition party to comply fully with its terms, including despatch of its personnel to UN-administered assembly points. They urged all concerned to co-operate in ensuring multi-party elections are held by October 1994 and called on Renamo to co-operate with the government in the speedy completion of an election law. ANGOLA They deplored continuation of the civil war and called on Unita to end hostilities. Failure on the part of Unita to comply with UN Security Council resolutions on Angola would justify further sanctions and other measures. CYPRUS Commonwealth leaders reiterated support for the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and non-aligned status of Cyprus. They stressed the importance of securing compliance with all the UN resolutions on Cyprus, divided when Turkey invaded the northern part in 1974. Lack of progress would prompt the Commonwealth secretary general to request the UN Security Councilto consider alternative ways to promote effective implementation of the UN resolutions. MIDDLE EAST Commonwealth leaders welcomed the agreement of September 13 1993 between the government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation and expressed the hope that the momentum for peace would be sustained. BOSNIA-HERCEGOVINA They expressed deep concern at the continuing hostilities and urged the international community to make all efforts to arrive urgently at a just, equitable and comprehensive political settlement based on strict adherence to Security Council decisions, international law and preservation and protection of the legitimate rights and dignity of all the Bosnian community. BELIZE Support was reaffirmed for the security, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Belize. The leaders urged Guatemala and Belize to resume and successfully conclude their dialogue.

One is ""South Africa Now,"" a low-budget, low-key -- but in its own way  absolutely spectacular -- weekly newsmagazine that is indispensable viewing for  anyone who wants to know what's really happening in southern Africa. Aired on  PBS outlets in 62 cities, it's available locally at 9 a.m. Sundays on KCET  Channel 28.    The other face is ""Shaka Zulu,"" a gory, historically suspect,  Pretoria-encouraged miniseries about unredeemably savage and blood-lusting  Zulus in early 19th-Century southern Africa. ""Shaka Zulu"" has been traveling  across America in syndication since 1986, amassing impressive ratings, and now  gets its first national airing this week on cable's TBS network. It runs in  five installments, today through Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.    Made at a cost of $24 million -- including $2.5 million from the  state-controlled South Africa Broadcasting Corp. -- the 10-hour miniseries is  lavishly mounted, but so ineptly executed that it's mainly for viewers who like  seeing barbaric, semi-nude blacks running around carving each other up as  civilized whites look on in horror.    ""Shaka Zulu"" is a muddy window.    Watching ""South Africa Now,"" however, is like seeing through a clear window for  the first time.    Always spotty, American television coverage of South Africa has dropped off  considerably since the Pretoria government declared a state of emergency and  increased media censorship in June, 1986. And even in the best of times, the  time limits imposed on network news stories are not conducive to in-depth  reporting.    ""South Africa Now,"" a nonprofit series that has had a single focus since its  inception in April, 1988, has more than filled the coverage gap, drawing from a  variety of sources, ranging from Afrovision to free-lancers in South Africa who  smuggle their material out of the country at great risk. Although a culture  segment is slipped into each half hour, the heaviest emphasis is hard news:    * Black youths turn their bare backs to the camera to display ugly wounds said  to come from police whippings.    * An investigation reveals ways South Africa is said to circumvent a global oil  embargo.    * A white leader in the rebellion against South Africa's continued control over  the South West Africa territory of Namibia speaks about threats and attempts on  his life. He was assassinated after taping the interview.    * A renegade American conservative is accused of violating U.S. law by  representing South Africa's extreme-right, rigidly pro-apartheid Conservative  Party in this country without registering as its agent.    * Anti-apartheid journalists appear in an excerpt from an Irish documentary  about hazards faced by the dissident press operating inside South Africa.    Produced by the independent production firm Globalvision in association with  the anti-apartheid Africa Fund, ""South Africa Now"" surely is anti-apartheid,  which is about as dishonorable as being anti-Nazi.    ""South Africa Now"" is anything but a shrill soap box, however, and the  reporting is usually fiercely sober and thorough.    Produced on a relatively spare budget of $26,000 a week -- which is  underwritten by mainstream foundations and individuals, including Bruce  Springsteen -- this is also not a gleaming, elegant program with wide anchor  desks and dazzling technology.    Because of its diversity of sources, moreover, the quality of production varies  greatly from story to story. So does the quality of the anchors, who range from  rough-edged quasi-amateurs (who are in the show's training program for young  journalists) to producer Carolyn Craven, a polished former anchor-reporter for  KQED in San Francisco and former White House correspondent for National Public  Radio.    What makes ""South Africa Now"" special is that there's nothing like it anywhere  else. No other program sheds so much light on the dark continent.    Mainstream media coverage of Southern Africa does not escape its close  scrutiny. A segment on Sunday questioned New York Times reporter Christopher  Wren's use of ""shadowy"" to describe the ""mass democratic alliance"" against  apartheid in South Africa.    ""South Africa Now"" failed to clarify the context in which Wren had applied  ""shadowy"" to organized apartheid opposition. What it did do was demonstrate the  power and potential hair-trigger combustibility of words used to characterize  political or human rights movements.    Without a doubt, ""shadowy"" does apply to ""Shaka Zulu,"" whose resurfacing on TBS  also occupied a portion of Sunday's ""South Africa Now.""    Los Angeles-based Harmony Gold is listed as the producing company for ""Shaka  Zulu."" Directed by white South African William C. Faure and featuring such  prominent English actors as Edward Fox and Christopher Lee, the miniseries  centers on the great warrior king of the powerful Zulu nation from 1816 until  his murder in 1828.    This is more of the black experience through white eyes. The bottom line here  is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to  argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule,  ""Shaka Zulu"" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen  motivated only by barbarism and black magic.    ""We think it's a fascinating depiction of a turbulent part of world history  that's rarely seen,"" Bob Levi, executive vice president of TBS, said from his  Atlanta office. Levi characterized the South Africa Broadcasting Corp.'s  financial involvement -- which was unpublicized by KCOP Channel 13 in Los  Angeles and other stations previously airing the miniseries -- as nothing more  than a routine ""pre-buy"" for South African broadcast rights. ""The key is that  they had no script approval,"" he said.    However, ""Shaka Zulu"" is labeled ""the greatest project yet undertaken by the  SABC,"" and crucial for the nation's ""image abroad"" in the public record of a  1984 South African parliamentary debate. And a sales ad for the miniseries in a  1985 London trade publication bore the SABC logo, address and telephone and fax  numbers.

One is ""South Africa Now,"" a low-budget, low-key -- but in its own way  absolutely spectacular -- weekly newsmagazine that is indispensable viewing for  anyone who wants to know what's really happening in southern Africa. Aired on  PBS outlets in 62 cities, it's available locally at 9 a.m. Sundays on KCET  Channel 28.    The other face is ""Shaka Zulu,"" a gory, historically suspect,  Pretoria-encouraged miniseries about unredeemably savage and blood-lusting  Zulus in early 19th-Century southern Africa. ""Shaka Zulu"" has been traveling  across America in syndication since 1986, amassing impressive ratings, and now  gets its first national airing this week on cable's TBS network. It runs in  five installments, today through Friday from 5 to 7 p.m.    Made at a cost of $24 million -- including $2.5 million from the  state-controlled South Africa Broadcasting Corp. -- the 10-hour miniseries is  lavishly mounted, but so ineptly executed that it's mainly for viewers who like  seeing barbaric, semi-nude blacks running around carving each other up as  civilized whites look on in horror.    ""Shaka Zulu"" is a muddy window.    Watching ""South Africa Now,"" however, is like seeing through a clear window for  the first time.    Always spotty, American television coverage of South Africa has dropped off  considerably since the Pretoria government declared a state of emergency and  increased media censorship in June, 1986. And even in the best of times, the  time limits imposed on network news stories are not conducive to in-depth  reporting.    ""South Africa Now,"" a nonprofit series that has had a single focus since its  inception in April, 1988, has more than filled the coverage gap, drawing from a  variety of sources, ranging from Afrovision to free-lancers in South Africa who  smuggle their material out of the country at great risk. Although a culture  segment is slipped into each half hour, the heaviest emphasis is hard news:    * Black youths turn their bare backs to the camera to display ugly wounds said  to come from police whippings.    * An investigation reveals ways South Africa is said to circumvent a global oil  embargo.    * A white leader in the rebellion against South Africa's continued control over  the South West Africa territory of Namibia speaks about threats and attempts on  his life. He was assassinated after taping the interview.    * A renegade American conservative is accused of violating U.S. law by  representing South Africa's extreme-right, rigidly pro-apartheid Conservative  Party in this country without registering as its agent.    * Anti-apartheid journalists appear in an excerpt from an Irish documentary  about hazards faced by the dissident press operating inside South Africa.    Produced by the independent production firm Globalvision in association with  the anti-apartheid Africa Fund, ""South Africa Now"" surely is anti-apartheid,  which is about as dishonorable as being anti-Nazi.    ""South Africa Now"" is anything but a shrill soap box, however, and the  reporting is usually fiercely sober and thorough.    Produced on a relatively spare budget of $26,000 a week -- which is  underwritten by mainstream foundations and individuals, including Bruce  Springsteen -- this is also not a gleaming, elegant program with wide anchor  desks and dazzling technology.    Because of its diversity of sources, moreover, the quality of production varies  greatly from story to story. So does the quality of the anchors, who range from  rough-edged quasi-amateurs (who are in the show's training program for young  journalists) to producer Carolyn Craven, a polished former anchor-reporter for  KQED in San Francisco and former White House correspondent for National Public  Radio.    What makes ""South Africa Now"" special is that there's nothing like it anywhere  else. No other program sheds so much light on the dark continent.    Mainstream media coverage of Southern Africa does not escape its close  scrutiny. A segment on Sunday questioned New York Times reporter Christopher  Wren's use of ""shadowy"" to describe the ""mass democratic alliance"" against  apartheid in South Africa.    ""South Africa Now"" failed to clarify the context in which Wren had applied  ""shadowy"" to organized apartheid opposition. What it did do was demonstrate the  power and potential hair-trigger combustibility of words used to characterize  political or human rights movements.    Without a doubt, ""shadowy"" does apply to ""Shaka Zulu,"" whose resurfacing on TBS  also occupied a portion of Sunday's ""South Africa Now.""    Los Angeles-based Harmony Gold is listed as the producing company for ""Shaka  Zulu."" Directed by white South African William C. Faure and featuring such  prominent English actors as Edward Fox and Christopher Lee, the miniseries  centers on the great warrior king of the powerful Zulu nation from 1816 until  his murder in 1828.    This is more of the black experience through white eyes. The bottom line here  is image: At a time when Pretoria's white-minority government continues to  argue that South Africa's overwhelming black majority is unfit for self rule,  ""Shaka Zulu"" arrives almost on cue, filling the screen with black tribesmen  motivated only by barbarism and black magic.    ""We think it's a fascinating depiction of a turbulent part of world history  that's rarely seen,"" Bob Levi, executive vice president of TBS, said from his  Atlanta office. Levi characterized the South Africa Broadcasting Corp.'s  financial involvement -- which was unpublicized by KCOP Channel 13 in Los  Angeles and other stations previously airing the miniseries -- as nothing more  than a routine ""pre-buy"" for South African broadcast rights. ""The key is that  they had no script approval,"" he said.    However, ""Shaka Zulu"" is labeled ""the greatest project yet undertaken by the  SABC,"" and crucial for the nation's ""image abroad"" in the public record of a  1984 South African parliamentary debate. And a sales ad for the miniseries in a  1985 London trade publication bore the SABC logo, address and telephone and fax  numbers.    The miniseries shows ""African resistance to English colonialism,"" Levi said.  ""It's relevant and it's good television.""

This is a historic day for which  the world has long awaited and I dare say the path has well been  laid to welcome South Africa back to United Nations. Mr.  Mandela, when he visited New York and I had the pleasure of  speaking with him on that occasion, made it quite clear that the  United Nations will represent a cardinal feature of South  Africa's foreign policy and I think we there at United Nations  are very ready to welcome your country to the organization once  more.    [Robinson] Now those are very kind words, Mr. Insanally, but  the point that I am trying to make is this: It is a question of  South Africa being obliged to formally readmit credentials. Is  that the position or not?    [Insanally] I dare say South Africa will have to formally  express its desire to return and as I said I am pretty sure that  that request will be very spontaneously entertained. The other  matters, all the residual matters of financial standing, the  question of contributions, clearly are -- as in the case of all  countries -- there's a question of a assessment of  contributions. I imagine that this is a matter that will have  to be discussed with the South African Government. There is a  scale of assessment and I imagine this will have to be through a  dialogue between the government of South Africa and the United  Nations Secretariat.    [Robinson] As I understand it, South Africa is about $100  million in arrears. So what is going to happen as far as that is  concerned?    [Insanally] As I said, the primary criterion I imagine the  United Nations will use is to open its doors to South Africa, an  important member of the United Nations family. I do not believe  that the question of arrears will be a stumbling block to its  reentry into the organization. Clearly....    [Robinson, interrupting] But will South Africa have to pay  that amount?    [Insanally] I really can't say. I really would be  very...[pauses] I would be hazarding an answer there. It would  be for the committee on contributions to study the case. Let me  say that, you know, the United Nations is composed of a number  of bodies and South Africa has in fact not been entirely  excluded from participation in some of the agencies, so one has  to look at it in fine [as heard], and it would be very  presumptuous of me to give you a sort of blanket answer. As I  said, many countries are in arrears. I am sure that some  arrangement can be worked out which would facilitate South  Africa's entry as soon as it expresses a desire to return to the  international family.    [Robinson] The United Nations arms embargo against South  Africa is still in place. Are you going to take the initiative  to remove that?    [Insanally] That is a matter for the Security Council, and  again I do not wish to sort of tread on their prerogative. I  would think that in so far as it does not affect the general  purposes of the United Nations, such an embargo will be reviewed  with some...[pauses] with a new eye and in an attempt to respect  the sovereignty of South Africa. I am sure the Security Council  will take the necessary measures in that regard.    [Robinson] One of the bodies of the United Nations is the  Special Committee Against Apartheid. One might expect that the  duties of that particular committee will now lapse.    [Insanally] Oh yes, that I can say positively. I was,  myself, a vice president of the council for Namibia and that was  one body which I was very glad to see pass out of existence,  although it's left me without a particular job. The same will  occur for the Special Committee -- apartheid -- and as I said  we'll be very happy to see the end of it. It will take a little  time to dismantle, to redeploy, but that certainly will go now  that South Africa is now with us, fully, in the United Nations  family.    [Robinson] If South Africa reenters the United Nations, do  you see any specific or special role for South Africa in that  body?    [Insanally] Indeed I do. I see it as a sort of a two-way  street. I see, first of all, South Africa playing a very key  role in United Nations affairs, in all its aspects. South  Africa, indeed, is an important nation, not only within Africa,  and indeed I must say that we look upon South Africa as the  dynamo for development in the region, in all of Africa, and in  the political sense what South Africa has been able to  accomplish through excellent leadership, excellent vision for  the future, and the process of dialogue and reconciliation --  that can be a model for other countries in the region. At the  same time the United Nations, as I am sure the secretary general  may have mentioned to the president of South Africa, I think we  can look to South Africa also to making a contribution to  international affairs, in the areas of peace keeping, peace  making, technical cooperation. You are indeed, in this part of  the world, a very advanced country and, therefore, can play a  very preeminent role in the furtherance of peace and development  in the continent.     "

AFRICA A-ARMS PROGRAM SINCE '70S TOLD;    WEAPONS: CIA DOCUMENTS DISPUTE OFFICIAL DENIALS FROM PRETORIA. 1979 TEST IS  RECALLED.      By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      South Africa has had an active nuclear weapons program since at least the  mid-1970s, despite years of official denials from Pretoria, according to  recently declassified CIA documents.    South Africa almost certainly conducted an atmospheric test of a low-yield  nuclear bomb off its coast in 1979, the documents state. Pretoria has never  acknowledged possession of nuclear weapons and the U.S. government has never  publicly stated that it believes South Africa is capable of producing them.    While most of the world has assumed that South Africa carried out the Sept. 22,  1979, test, which was detected by U.S. intelligence satellites, Pretoria has  clung to its ""longstanding practice of cloaking its nuclear intentions in  ambiguity,"" the CIA said.    The CIA report also said that Israel cooperated closely with South Africa in  the 1970s on nuclear weapons programs and provided ""various sorts of advanced  non-nuclear weapons technology to South Africa.""    Officials of the South African Embassy in Washington did not return telephone  calls seeking comment on the disclosures.    A spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy here said that Jerusalem repeatedly has  denied any cooperation in nuclear weapons matters with South Africa.    In March, 1987, the Israeli Defense Ministry announced it was suspending all  new weapons development contracts with South Africa, and the Israeli government  has strictly adhered to that decree, she said.    The CIA report, which was prepared in December, 1979, was released in heavily  edited form in response to a Freedom of Information Act request from the  Natural Resources Defense Council.    ""This marks the first time that the U.S. government has confirmed that South  Africa has had a dedicated nuclear weapons program and the U.S. government knew  about it,"" Richard Fieldhouse, a senior researcher with the environmental  group, said Wednesday.    Fieldhouse added that the disclosures call into question South Africa's stated  intention to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, saying that it would be  ""an empty and cynical gesture because South Africa would maintain the ability  to produce nuclear weapons quickly.""    He said South Africa continues to seek nuclear weapons technology from a  variety of sources, despite international efforts to halt exports of sensitive  technology to the racially polarized nation.    Fieldhouse noted that the U.S. Customs Service last week raided a Boynton  Beach, Fla., firm for allegedly selling guidance components for nuclear-capable  ballistic missiles to South Africa.    The CIA report, entitled ""The 22 September 1979 Event,"" gives previously  classified details of the blast off the coast of southern Africa and explores  the question of who was responsible.    The explosion was assumed to be a nuclear blast with a yield of less than three  kilotons, about a quarter the size of the Hiroshima bomb and equivalent to the  yield of a nuclear-tipped artillery shell. The test was carried out in darkness  and under heavy cloud cover.    The report indicates that South Africa was the only likely source of the test,  noting that South Africa had an active nuclear weapons development program and  sufficient supplies of highly enriched uranium to build several small bombs.    The agency said that the South African government earlier suspended nuclear  tests planned for two years because ""strong U.S. pressure and other  international reactions appeared to have deflected South Africa at least  temporarily from testing.""    The 1979 explosion was carried out in secrecy over remote waters off South  Africa's southern coast after the nation's authorities declared the harbor and  the naval base at Simonstown to be off-limits to the public.

The multi-million dollar  programme focusses on a South African industrial trade expo in  New York City from September 20 to 23 where about 150 South  African firms are expected to show their goods and services.  ""South Africa and the USA: Strengthening the Link"", the expo is  being staged by the Department of Trade and Industry and the  South African Foreign Trade Organization (SAFTO).    Addressing a news conference in Washington, Mr Manuel said  the idea was to reintroduce South Africa--not as an emerging  market but as a emerging market with a highly sophisticated  physical and financial infrastructure. He said President  Mandela had set out a vision of South Africa's future based on  compromise, peace and stability. Now the ""battle royal"" was on  to give hard-won democracy some content. ""Now we have to ensure  that markets in South Africa are sharpened so that we can create  jobs and improve on our manufacturing, that we can move up the  value chain from our rich mineral endowment and re-position  South Africa in the global economy.""    Mr Manuel said South Africa's return to the Commonwealth,  while unlikely to make a significant difference in the narrow  sense of trade and economic terms, was part of the approach that  South Africa was back in the family.    Referring to government's Reconstruction and Development  Programme, he said South Africa had an enormous capacity to  build a consensus society in the context of partnership and  cooperation. This was the case between not only government and  business but also South Africa and its major trading partners.    A series of initiatives being worked about between the  United  States and South Africa would be announced in a few weeks, he  disclosed.    Mr Manuel said the development of southern Africa regional  trade and stability was an important element in South Africa's  drive into world markets. It was important for South Africa to  stimulate economic development across the region with its  100-million inhabitants. ""Any notion that you build an island  of prosperity in a sea ravaged by war is clearly a non-starter,""  he said.    South African Ambassador Harry Schwarz told the news  conference that trade was like a tango -- and it took two to  tango. With respect to the US and South Africa, one tango  dancer was a powerful economy and the other was a fast-improving  existing market. South Africans of all races were a proud  people, Schwarz said. ""We are not standing with a begging  bowl....We stand as a proud people wanting to build an economy  and saying that we have tremendous resources and the capacity to  become a major world power.""

The 8th five year plan registers an increase of 48 per cent  over the 7th five year plan which was Rs 1149 billion. The size  of the plan has been fixed on the constant price to make the  comparison with the 7th five year plan easy.    The major emphasis in the 8th five year plan is on  education,  health and energy sectors. The share of public and private  sector in the plan has also been increased compared to the  previous plan.    The major character of the 8th plan is to ensure a minimum  investment of Rs 949 billion against Rs 596 billion in the 7th  five year plan.    The share of the public rector in the 8th plan has been  increased to Rs 751 billion compared to Rs 553 billion in the  7th plan, showing an increase of 59 per cent. The budget  announcing over the five years in the public sector would be of  Rs 483 billion.    The share of private sector has been envisaged as Rs 949  billion compared to Rs 596 billion in the 7th plan reflecting an  increase of 48 per cent.    The Deputy Chairman, Planning, Saeed Ahmad Qureshi and  Minister for Information, Khalid Ahmad Kharal, gave the briefing  regarding the 8th five year plan.    The size of the public sector programme has also been  increased in the 8th plan [word indistinct] it is nominal.    It has been kept at Rs 752 billion out of which Rs 483  billion would be budget financed whereas Rs 269 billion would be  corporate and market financed.    In the 7th five-year plan, the size of the Public Sector  Programme was of Rs 553 billion out of which Rs 457 billion were  budget financed and Rs 96 billion were corporate and market  financed. This means that in the 8th five-year plan, the share  of corporate and market financed has been increased three-fold  which to many seems overoptimistic.    The growth targets have also been fixed in the 8th five-year  plan. These targets for all practical purposes are unrealistic.    A comprehensive macro economic management policy has been  adopted in the 8th five-year plan, according to which the growth  targets would be achieved in a frame work of equity, stability  and sustainability.    The overall fiscal deficit would be reduced from 7.9 per  cent  to 4 per cent of GDP and the current account deficit would be  brought down from 3.7 billion dollars at present to 1.84 billion  dollars by the end of 8th five-year plan, which means the level  would be brought down from 7 per cent a present to 24 per cent  of GDP.    The plan is also aimed at containing the long-term external  debt at 36 per cent of GDP and keep monetary expansion below the  growth of nominal GDP and also to reduce inflation rate from 9.3  per cent to 6 per cent. The plan also envisages to raise  national savings from 15.8 per cent to 19.9 per cent and  generate 6.2 million new jobs against 3.2 million in the 7th  plan.    The 8th five-year plan has been targeted to make the GDP  growth rate to increase by 7 per cent, agriculture sector 4.9  per cent, industry 9.4 per cent, manufacturing 9.9 per cent and  services sector 6.7 per cent.    The annual plan for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 was  also approved.    The targets for the forthcoming fiscal year 1994-95 have  been  envisaged as GDP growth 6.9 per cent, agriculture 8 per cent,  manufacturing 6.9 per cent, exports 19 per cent, imports 10.7  per cent and inflation to be reduced to 7.5 per cent.    The size of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP)  for the forthcoming fiscal year was also approved. The original  size of the PSDP was Rs 94 billion but NEC approved the size of  the PSDP for Rs 90 billion.    Provinces would be given Rs 25 billion. The important  budgetary programme was approved which include Social Action  Plan (SAP) community health, water and drainage, [word  indistinct] Nuclear and [word indistinct].    To meet the new challenges of competitive market, the 8th  five-year plan provides three-pronged strategy. This includes:  (1) lowering tax rates and broadening tax base; ensuring  documentation of the economy, (2) establishment of special  concessions and rent-seeking activities and (3) lowering tariff  structure and integration with the world economy.    On the education side, a major breakthrough would be  achieved  by increasing the literacy rate from 34 per cent to 48 per cent.

The results of the  first multiracial general election in South Africa showed that  the African National Congress [ANC] of South Africa led by  Mandela will win a majority of the vote. In South Africa, a  ANC-led national unity government will be formed. The result of  the general election showed that the last apartheid system,  which was also the most inhumane one in the world, has come to  an end; and a new South Africa with racial equality is born.  The vast number of black people being oppressed under the  racist rule in South Africa have stood up today, and they,  together with white people, have become masters of the country.  The success of the first multiracial general election in South  Africa was not only a significant event in the political life of  the South African people and the African people as a whole, but  was also an event of great historical significance in, and with  far-reaching impact on, the history of human civilization in  this century. The Chinese people always firmly support the just  struggle of the South African people, and also heartily rejoice  at the historic victory scored by the South African people. We  extend warm congratulations to them.    In order to achieve today's universal suffrage, the people  of  South Africa continued to fight for more than 300 years. In  particular, after the ANC was founded in 1912, it led the black  people in the country to carry out prolonged and unremitting  struggle against apartheid and racial discrimination and to  fight for South African black people's equal political and  economic rights. Their struggle drove the racist regime into  dire straits, made the authorities realize that they could no  longer maintain racist rule, and forced them to hold peace  talks. Constitutional talks began in December 1991. The  multiparty talks, which lasted more than two years and were  attended by the ANC and more than 20 other political parties,  underwent innumerous twists and turns and encountered many  obstacles, because there were different opinions and interest  conflicts between various parties, and the far-right wing of the  white people continued to stir up trouble and provoke conflicts.  However, backed by Mandela and De Klerk, representatives of  most political parties cherished the spirit of racial  reconciliation and democratic consultation, continued to make  joint efforts to remove various difficulties and obstacles, and  eventually achieved significant results in advancing the process  of peace and democracy in South Africa.    Today's victory won by the people of South Africa is also  inseparable from extensive assistance and support from other  African countries and peoples, especially the great assistance  and sacrifice made by the forefront countries in Southern  Africa. The Organization of African Unity, the United Nations,  other international organizations, and the international  community as a whole have also made positive contributions to  supporting the struggle of the South African people. Because  the struggle of the South African people won extensive support  and assistance from all justice-upholding and peace-loving  people inside and outside the country, the situation in South  Africa could develop in an orientation favorable to the people's  progress.    The success of the first whole-people-involved election in  South Africa does not indicate the end of the South African  people's struggle. An extremely small number of far-rightists  among the white people are not willing to see the collapse of  the racist system, and they will continue to stir up trouble and  carry out sabotage. The differences among various organizations  of the black people have not been completely solved. It will be  hard to eliminate the influence of the long-standing racist rule  and violent conflicts within a short time. However, people  believe that the South African people, who have freed themselves  from the shackles of the apartheid system, will certainly be  able to overcome difficulties, and continue to advance along the  course of racial reconciliation and national peace and  stability. A new South Africa with democracy, equality, peace,  and prosperity will certainly appear on the continent of Africa.     "

[Ebok] For 21 years of its existence, we as the OAU have  confronted the problems in South Africa. At the first meeting  of the OAU, one of the first decisions which was taken was that  on decolonization and which led to the establishment of the  Liberation Committee at the OAU. That committee has more or  less attained its mandate having contributed to the  decolonization process, and also in a very significant way to  the ending of apartheid. That committee is winding up, so it  means a lot to us who had been attached to it with a sense of  nostalgia. It's like one era has ended. Now we would look  forward to a period, you know, in which we can pursue economic  emancipation with the same vigor that we have pursued the  political liberation.    [Xhobule] Let's talk about current conflicts on the  continent. With regard to conflicts happening in various parts  of the continent at the moment, what role would you see South  Africa playing?    [Ebok] One of the things which has impressed people all over  the world, not just in Africa, is the way South Africans  resolved their problems through negotiations. It has opened the  doors to that possibility that every conflict could be resolved  through negotiations, because I mean, if you look at it, when we  came here about two years ago we never thought that the  elections would come off so peacefully. A few months back we  never thought that we would have such a peaceful election. So  one of the things which South Africa had experienced, which  South Africa would bring to the organization, are its experience  in conflict resolutions.    [Xhobule] In practical terms, what would this entail both  for  the OAU and for South Africa?    [Ebok] Well, for the OAU it means that our membership has  been enriched. South Africa comes to the organization with some  leadership role. South Africa is a very advanced country  technologically and even politically. And so those experiences  are the experiences which we'll learn, which our organization,  as we move into the 21st century....[pauses] For South Africa,  I believe that for once it has stopped being the (?burial) state  -- we will stop talking about South Africa in very negative  terms at meetings of the OAU, and South Africa will be in a  position to benefit from some of the experiences -- positive  experiences -- which the rest of the continent has. It would be  able to interact with the rest of the continent because South  Africa will first be an African country before it becomes a  member of any other international community. So for South  Africa, it is back in the fold as a member of the family. It  can reach out to the whole world from Africa as a legitimate  entity, and that is the benefit for both of us.     "

With respect to the African economic integration, an  encouraging sign is that the number of the countries has  increased to 34 that have ratified the treaty on the  establishment of the African Economic Community, which was  signed by the African leaders in Abuja, new capital of Nigeria,  in June 1991. With the ratification by one more country, the  treaty will come into force.    Besides, progress has also been made in regional economic  integration in 1993 in the western, eastern and southern parts  of the continent. Treaties on the establishment of regional  common markets have been signed to facilitate the inter-regional  trade and economic development.    In order to promote the intra-Africa trade, the African  Development Bank (ADB) took the initiative in establishing the  ""African Export-Import Bank"" in Cairo, while the U.N.  secretary-general has proposed the establishment of a commodity  diversification fund for Africa.    Those efforts have obviously demonstrated the eagerness and  determination of Africans to overcome the economic crisis and  step up the economic development on the continent.    As regards the economic situation of Africa in 1993, many  countries have appeared to set on course to harvest the benefits  of peace. The U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (ECA)  estimated that the economic growth in Ethiopia might reach 9.3  percent, 5.3 percent in Mozambique and 7.1 percent in Uganda due  to the relative peace and stability in the countries.    However, the economic situation in Africa as a whole was  still marked by a meagre growth in 1993. According to an ECA  preliminary estimation, African economy grew by only 1.4 percent  in the year, representing an improvement over the 0.7 percent  growth of 1992. This is barely half of the regional population  growth rate.    Analysts pointed out, in addition to the deep-seated  problems  including lack of domestic resources, poor infrastructure and  domestic political deficiencies, there are three major factors  that are hindering the African economic growth.    First of all, it is the continuing civil conflicts and  political crises in several countries that restrained the  economic growth. For example, the economic growth in Zaire is  estimated to have dropped by 4 percent in 1993 following a more  severe decline of 12 percent in the previous year because of the  political unrest resulting from disputes over democratization  process in the country. Nigeria's economy may have only grown by  about 3.7 percent in 1993, far below the annual average of 6.2  percent in the 1988-1992 period due to political upheaval.    The natural disasters, especially the drought that struck  eastern and southern Africa in the year, are another factor that  has suppressed the economic growth. Due to the worst drought,  Zimbabwe's economy is estimated to grow by 1.4 percent in 1993  as compared with the 8.5 percent growth in 1992. Parts of  Ethiopia and Eritrea have also experienced crop failures because  of the drought.    The third factor is the unfavorable international economic  environment. The weak growth in major industrial countries led  to a sluggish demand for main African products. And the weak  demand in turn led to the continuing fall in prices of fuel and  non-fuel commodities. As result, Africa's export earnings are  estimated to have shrunk by about 2.7 percent to 72 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, following a drop of 1.1 percent in 1992.    Besides, external debt has further deteriorated in 1993.  According to the ECA, the share of multi-lateral debt of Africa  in aggregated debt stock has risen to 24.2 percent in 1993  compared to 20.5 percent in 1992 and 19.5 percent in 1991. This  shows that Africa's external debt will be above 275.15 billion  U.S. dollars in 1993.    Meanwhile, external resources flowing to Africa are  declining. According to the latest estimation of the World Bank,  sub-Saharan Africa's share of total official development  assistance of the bank has fallen from 37.1 percent in 1990 to  36.3 percent in 1992. Net lending commitments by the World Bank  to sub-Saharan Africa fell a dramatic 30 percent or 1.2 billion  U.S. dollars in its last financial year. Non-project lending to  sub-Saharan Africa virtually halved in 1993 to 455 million U.S.  dollars from 895 million U.S. dollars the previous year.    IMF also reported a downturn in lending to Africa in its  latest financial year. The disbursements totalled some 525  million U.S. dollars in the year ending April 30, 1993 compared  with some one billion U.S. dollars for the previous year, a fall  of nearly 50 percent.    All those factors have added more difficulties to the lack  of  resources of African countries that need capital to develop  their economies.    With respect to the prospects for African economy in the new  year, it does not allow much optimism because all the factors  that have hindered the African economic performance in 1993 will  remain a constraint to the growth. Besides, with the loss of  some preferences conceded to Africa after the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement was signed and with the reduction of aid and resources  flowing to Africa from World Bank and other international  institutes, Africa will face more crises. In face of the  challenge, Africans have uttered stronger voice for  self-reliance and intra- Africa cooperation in developing the  continent's economy.     "

Bulger]    [Text] Johannesburg March 4 SAPA -- An African National  Congress [ANC] government would downplay South Africa's role as  a regional power in southern Africa, ANC foreign affairs  director Thabo Mbeki said on Friday. Mr Mbeki was presenting a  discussion paper, Foreign Policy in a Democratic South Africa,  to members of the media and diplomatic corps at the World Trade  Centre in Kempton Park.    The document outlines South Africa's likely international  orientation after the April elections. Rather than projecting  itself as a regional power, South Africa would emphasise  co-operation as defined in agreements with fellow southern  African nations. It would attempt to address the marginalisation  of the African continent in the world economy and would join the  Organisation of African Unity.    ""Closer regional co-operation and economic integration after  apartheid will benefit the entire region,"" the document says. ""A  democratic South Africa should explicitly renounce all hegemonic  ambitions in the region. It should resist all pressures to  become the regional power at the expense of the rest of the  sub-continent. Instead it should seek to become part of a  movement to create a new form of economic interaction in  southern Africa based on principles of mutual benefit and  interdependence.""    South Africa would contribute to conflict resolution  mechanisms and peacekeeping in Africa. South Africa would also  take part in discussions about the United Nations and would  support efforts to ""democratise"" that body by giving  traditionally less powerful nations more scope and influence.    The foreign policy document stresses South Africa's role in  promoting human rights around the world. South Africa would  actively involve itself in international forums in pursuit of  this goal.    An ANC government would foster links with the Islamic  community of the Middle East and follow international law and  practice in its relations with Asian countries. Relations with  the European Community would be emphasised as well as bilateral  relations with individual European countries.    Diplomatic ties would also be established with Cuba. ""We  believe that Cuba's right to self-determination is important in  the maintenance of international norms and principles,"" the  document says.    It notes its concern at the failure to finalise the Uruguay  Round of talks on the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  (GATT) and says this could lead to damaging protectionism among  the northern countries.    On the UN, the document says: ""We support endeavours to  democratise the UN. This entails reviewing the brief of both the  General Assembly and the Security Council.""    On security, the document says South Africa will sign the  Geneva Convention and protocols and will be committed to  resolving disputes peacefully.    South Africa would actively support non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction.    South Africa would return to the Commonwealth.    A new foreign service would be established independent of  party political considerations. ""We will immediately take steps  to ensure that, within a reasonable period, the diplomatic corps  will be fally representative of South Africa's people,"" the  document notes.     "

The Zimbabwean capital today played host to the meeting  of the Global Coalition for Africa and will tomorrow be the  venue for the meeting of the Frontline states.

Now that South Africa has shed its apartheid burden,  and is back with a vengeance in the international community and  the brotherhood of African countries, the organization has lost  the very reason for its existence.    However, it's believed that Zimbabwe is keen to see the  establishment of a new organization to replace the Frontline  states. But other parties feel that such a body would have  little value as most of the issues affecting southern African  countries could be dealt with by the Southern African  Development Community, SADC. Zimbabwean newspapers report that  the name Frontline States is expected to be dropped in  preference for something that sounds less confrontational.  Whatever the outcome of tomorrow's meeting, the future of  southern Africa will hopefully never be as divided as its past.    In recent years the world has increasingly turned its back  on  Africa. Any organization which unites South Africa with the  rest of the sub-continent in the interest of regional peace,  stability and economic growth, might just provide the impetus to  prove that this region can survive, and indeed prosper.

0,FT942-16430 ,"FT942-16430 _AN-EDKC1AATFT 940411   FT  11 APR 94 / WHO urges drugs groups to develop Aids vaccine      By DANIEL GREEN   Drugs companies should concentrate their efforts on developing a vaccine for Aids, the World Health Organisation said yesterday. Most pharmaceuticals companies are working on Aids treatments such as Wellcome's AZT, rather than vaccines, which immunise in advance of infection. Last week AZT, still the leading Aids drug, was shown in trials to have little if any effect on people infected with the virus who do not yet have the disease. The change to vaccines should come even though 'pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have been reluctant to become fully committed to the development of an HIV vaccine', said Dr Peter Piot, WHO's director of research and intervention development. He backed up his message with the organisation's latest estimate for the spread of HIV. 'Well over 14m adults and a further 1m infants have been infected with HIV. As of 31 December 1993, over 850,000 Aids cases had been reported.' About two thirds of cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, but the region where the infection is spreading fastest is now south east Asia. 'Five years ago, fewer that 200 people in Thailand were known to be infected. By late 1993 (the figures was) over 500,000,' he said 'In most areas, heterosexual transmission is now by far the predominant mode of spread,' he said. In some parts of the region, HIV is believed to be spreading as fast as it did in Africa a decade ago.' Dr Piot acknowledged that science did not fully understand the Aids virus and that he saw 'signs of discouragement among those working on vaccine development'. Nevertheless, a vaccine was needed to complement existing strategies of containment through the use of condoms and viricides. These strategies had worked well in Europe, with condom use among Swiss aged between 17 and 30, for example, rising from 8 per cent in 1987 to more than half in 1992. In the US, the story was more mixed with rapidly rising rates of infection in inner city populations.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.   Industries:-  P2836 Biological Products Ex Diagnostic.

Prof Black writes that 'short external tests are likely to give unreliable results'. This is simply not true. However reliability is defined, many standardised number and literacy tests have very high reliability ratings. There is always bound to be a small element of misclassification. But has Prof Black thought of comparing the reliability of standardised tests with the variability of 'classroom assessments by teachers', and the cost in terms of external audit of controlling such variability? Prof Black's second argument that 'short and apparently simple' tests cannot measure all 'important outcomes of learning' is correct. But would he not agree that many important outcomes of learning cannot and should not be tested? Would he not accept the conclusion of Alison Wolf of the Institute of Education, University of London, in her paper Assessment Issues and Problems in a Criterion-Based System, that criterion-referencing, of which he has been an ardent champion, leads to 'atomised objectives in a forest of verbiage'? Isn't that what has happened to the government's tests? My conclusion stands: let teachers test as they please, according to Prof Black's principles if they wish. But let there be 'short external tests' to measure the performance of schools.

From  the point of view of the Israeli defense industry, these are two  countries that stopped being excellent customers after going  through changes of regime.    The tremendous arms purchases that Iran made under the shah  were cut off when Khomeyni took power. South Africa is in a  transitional period now, leading to transfering power to the  black majority, and from being an important customer of the  Israeli defense industry, it is turning into a serious rival. In  this race, it is making wide use of Israeli advanced technology.    Over the years, foreign sources published many reports about  the close ties that had been woven between the defense  establishments in Israel and South Africa. Israel--so it was  reported--helped South Africa to build an arms industry that  produces everything from light weapons to warplanes and missile  boats.    Not long ago, the president of South Africa announced that  his country had also produced six atomic bombs. Foreign sources  claimed that these weapons, too, were produced with active help  from Israel, and that in return South Africa had allowed the  Israelis to test their nuclear weapons within its boundaries.  THE WASHINGTON POST also claimed that the South African  authorities sent enriched uranium (which is used to produce  nuclear weapons) to Israel, so that it will not fall into the  hands of the blacks when they take power in April 1994.    But from a partner and an ally, South Africa has turned into  a serious commercial rival. Today, at almost every international  arms fair, it shows off the products of its defense industry. It  does not even try to blur the source.    Its Cheetah jet is a perfect copy of the Israeli Kfir; the  sea-to-sea missile it produces is the twin brother of the  Israeli Gabriel; the assault rifle its soldiers carry is another  version of the Israeli Galil; and even skilled professionals  have trouble distinguishing between the Israeli pilotless plane,  Pioneer, and the South African pilotless plane, Siker; or  between the Israeli pilotless bomber, Harpy, which sails toward  its target and blows it up, and the South African pilotless  bomber, Lark. Air-to-air missiles of the Kukri type,  manufactured in South Africa, are amazingly similar to the  Israeli Phaeton missiles. And this is just a partial list.    Even the advertising the South Africans do for their weapons  systems is Israeli in character. At the weapons fair that was  held at the beginning of November in the Emirate of Dubai, there  was an unusually large number of exhibitors from South Africa.  The leaders of the South African arms industry explained to  reporters covering the fair that the international embargo,  which had been imposed on their country, and was in force until  not long ago, forced them to develop many systems on their own.  This kind of advertising has been characteristic until now of  the sales representatives of the Israeli defense industry.    For many years, South Africa was not been able to sell the  weapons its defense industry produced, because of the  international embargo imposed on it in protest against its  apartheid laws. Now, with both apartheid and the embargo lifted,  markets have opened up for South Africa all over the world.    Sources in the Israel defense establishment say that the  South Africans operating an aggressive marketing system in many  countries around the world, and it seems that they are ready to  sell ""at any price""--mainly to establish their position as a  country producing advanced systems.    Looking back, was it a mistake to cooperate so broadly with  the South African arms industry? Opinions are divided on this.  There are those who argue that South Africa was a good customer,  and Israel also profited well from cooperation with it.  According to foreign sources, over the years South Africa  acquired weapons systems and know-how from Israel that were  worth more than 5 billion dollars. Others argue that we should  have taken into account the political changes that were going to  come in this country, and to maintain our defense cooperation  with it accordingly.    The reports about Israeli engineers who went to South Africa  to work after the Lavi project was canceled were perhaps a  little exaggerated, but for many years, South Africa absorbed  not only finished products from the Israeli defense industry,  but also much know-how. You see the results now at almost every  arms fair.    ""Although so far they have still not caused us any real  harm,  they are turning into more than just a mild headache,"" a senior  source in the defense establishment said.     "

AFRICA RULING PARTY'S WHITE SUPPORT WAVERS AS VOTE NEARS      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      White South Africa's problem, as voter Peter Gray sees it, is that the  Conservative Party would create ""economic disaster"" by antagonizing the world,  and the liberal Democratic Party would allow black revolutionaries to trample  over the white minority.    What the country needs is ""something middle of the road but more  liberal-minded"" than in the past, the banker believes.    That's why Gray, and many whites like him, will probably be voting, somewhat  reluctantly, for the National Party in South Africa's Sept. 6 parliamentary  elections, one of the most important in 41 years of apartheid and Nationalist  rule.    ""I want South Africa to speed up (apartheid) reform,"" Gray said recently as he  and his wife waited in a primary school gymnasium in Johannesburg's northern  suburbs to hear President Frederik W. de Klerk address a political meeting.    ""But we South Africans are scared by what we've seen happen to whites in the  rest of Africa,"" Gray added. ""We're in a minority, and we would need  protection. How they're going to do that is the question.""    In two weeks, 5.5 million whites, Indians and mixed-raced Coloreds will select  racially segregated chambers of Parliament while the country's 26 million  disfranchised blacks watch from the sidelines.    De Klerk's National Party is all but guaranteed a majority in the controlling  white chamber, despite stiff challenges from the Conservatives on the right and  the Democrats on the left. But its margin of victory, and the enthusiasm of its  support, may be at the lowest level in its history.    Many white voters remain skeptical about the Nationalists' promises of ""new  action"" and dialogue with black leaders. Even a few government supporters have  complained that the campaign lacks the ideological fire of days gone by.    In the ward represented by the retiring leader of liberal white politics, Helen  Suzman, De Klerk was heckled relentlessly in one of his first outings since  being sworn in as state president following this month's sudden, ignominious  resignation of Pieter W. Botha, 73.    Above the door to the Houghton Primary School, a National Party campaign poster  read: ""Reject Racism."" But a cluster of hand-lettered signs near it suggested  how difficult it is to change attitudes among white South Africans. Above the  sign reading ""Firearms must be handed in at the lobby"" was another put up just  for the event: ""Right of admission reserved.""    Inside, an all-white audience had filled all 400 plastic chairs and standing  space, spilling into the lobby, where a Democratic Party heckler and a De Klerk  supporter almost came to blows.    The battle in this ward is between the National Party's Dr. Shlomo Peer, a  retired businessman and Jewish immigrant, and the Democratic Party's Tony Leon,  a charismatic young Johannesburg City Council politician. Not surprisingly, the  two men are getting competing signals from voters.    ""People are frightened of the left,"" Peer said in an interview. ""They are  telling me they want economic and political security.""    But Leon says he has tapped ""a real and conspicuous feeling that the National  Party just hasn't delivered."" Leon notes, for example, that the economy has  deteriorated sharply, with inflation running at more than 15%, home loan rates  of 20% and a steady weakening in the value of the South African rand.    For those and other reasons, white support for the National Party is softening  for the first time in four decades, according to Steven Friedman of the South  African Institute of Race Relations.    ""It is no longer an act of betrayal for many whites to vote against the ruling  party,"" Friedman wrote recently. ""The Nats are increasingly having to win white  support rather than take it for granted.""    The National Party currently holds 120 of the 166 seats in the white chamber of  Parliament, the Conservatives 22 seats and the Democrats 19. Opinion surveys  last month indicated that the National Party is losing votes to both the left  and right, and political analysts think the Conservatives could pick up as many  as 20 seats and the Democrats could add a dozen or more. That would saddle the  government with its largest white opposition in years.    To lure undecided voters from opposite ends of the political spectrum, De Klerk  has been widening his party's hold on the mainstream. The status quo in South  Africa will have to change, he tells his audiences. But not too quickly, he  adds.    The National Party vows to maintain racially segregated residential areas,  schools and hospitals, but it also says it wants to change the constitution to  share political power with blacks and eventually rule the country by consensus,  rather than one-person, one-vote.    On the right, the Conservative Party platform calls for a return to 1960s-style  apartheid and it advocates dividing South Africa into separate geographic  regions by race. In the ""white state,"" for example, blacks could work but their  activities would be monitored, and whites would govern.    National Party supporters say the Conservatives' policies would invite  additional sanctions, ruin the country's economy and probably trigger  widespread black unrest.    But the Conservative Party, formed in 1982 from a National Party split, has  grabbed many defecting Nationalists, especially among working-class whites, who  don't want to compete for jobs or share their neighborhoods, schools,  hospitals, beaches or parks with blacks.    To the left of the government are the Democrats, a new party formed by a merger  of the Progressive Federal Party and two smaller parties. The Democrats' power  base is well-to-do white suburbanites, such as lawyers, academics and  businessmen.    The Democrats advocate government negotiations with the outlawed liberation  group, the African National Congress, an end to the three-year-old state of  emergency and the release of all political prisoners. Only then, they say, will  the country be able to prove to the black majority and to the world that it is  serious about reform.    The Democrats want to change the constitution, too. They would institute a  one-person, one-vote system modeled on the American federal system, dividing  the country into geographic rather than racial groups and giving each region  proportional representation.    The National Party, which has refused to negotiate with the ANC unless it  renounces violence, has tried to paint the Democrats as naive do-gooders who  are too soft on security and too cozy with black revolutionaries.    The government's recent crackdown on a campaign of anti-apartheid civil  disobedience, using legions of policemen armed with whips to break up dozens of  gatherings and detaining key leaders without trial, has been seen here as an  attempt to show the electorate that the threat of violence from black  organizations continues and that it will be dealt with firmly.    While the Nationalists were attempting to hold the middle ground, though, they  discovered an ideological split in their own ranks. The blowup that led to  President Botha's Aug. 14 resignation stemmed from a disagreement over a  meeting that De Klerk, the party leader and Botha's heir apparent, planned with  Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda.    Although Botha's resignation was more the result of months of ill feeling  toward his own party, his bitter farewell speech criticized De Klerk's  willingness to meet Kaunda, an advocate of sanctions against South Africa and  host to the ANC, the principal guerrilla group fighting Pretoria.    The Botha-De Klerk dispute was not expected to have a broad impact on the  election, but the Conservative Party has taken the opportunity to suggest that  the National Party might trade white rights in exchange for peace with the ANC.    Among many National Party stalwarts, however, Botha's departure was seen as an  unseemly burial that was necessary to begin the program of ""new action.""  Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha himself told a national TV audience  that, ""with great respect, I must say that (Botha's) memory is sometimes  faulty.""    ""I'm glad it came to a head,"" said Neels Brits, a Johannesburg businessman and  third-generation Nationalist. ""We have compassion for the man (Botha). But the  simple matter is, there's nothing wrong with the Kaunda visit.""

Above the  sign reading ""Firearms must be handed in at the lobby"" was another put up just  for the event: ""Right of admission reserved.""    Inside, an all-white audience had filled all 400 plastic chairs and standing  space, spilling into the lobby, where a Democratic Party heckler and a De Klerk  supporter almost came to blows.    The battle in this ward is between the National Party's Dr. Shlomo Peer, a  retired businessman and Jewish immigrant, and the Democratic Party's Tony Leon,  a charismatic young Johannesburg City Council politician. Not surprisingly, the  two men are getting competing signals from voters.    ""People are frightened of the left,"" Peer said in an interview. ""They are  telling me they want economic and political security.""    But Leon says he has tapped ""a real and conspicuous feeling that the National  Party just hasn't delivered."" Leon notes, for example, that the economy has  deteriorated sharply, with inflation running at more than 15%, home loan rates  of 20% and a steady weakening in the value of the South African rand.    For those and other reasons, white support for the National Party is softening  for the first time in four decades, according to Steven Friedman of the South  African Institute of Race Relations.    ""It is no longer an act of betrayal for many whites to vote against the ruling  party,"" Friedman wrote recently. ""The Nats are increasingly having to win white  support rather than take it for granted.""    The National Party currently holds 120 of the 166 seats in the white chamber of  Parliament, the Conservatives 22 seats and the Democrats 19. Opinion surveys  last month indicated that the National Party is losing votes to both the left  and right, and political analysts think the Conservatives could pick up as many  as 20 seats and the Democrats could add a dozen or more. That would saddle the  government with its largest white opposition in years.    To lure undecided voters from opposite ends of the political spectrum, De Klerk  has been widening his party's hold on the mainstream. The status quo in South  Africa will have to change, he tells his audiences. But not too quickly, he  adds.    The National Party vows to maintain racially segregated residential areas,  schools and hospitals, but it also says it wants to change the constitution to  share political power with blacks and eventually rule the country by consensus,  rather than one-person, one-vote.    On the right, the Conservative Party platform calls for a return to 1960s-style  apartheid and it advocates dividing South Africa into separate geographic  regions by race. In the ""white state,"" for example, blacks could work but their  activities would be monitored, and whites would govern.    National Party supporters say the Conservatives' policies would invite  additional sanctions, ruin the country's economy and probably trigger  widespread black unrest.    But the Conservative Party, formed in 1982 from a National Party split, has  grabbed many defecting Nationalists, especially among working-class whites, who  don't want to compete for jobs or share their neighborhoods, schools,  hospitals, beaches or parks with blacks.    To the left of the government are the Democrats, a new party formed by a merger  of the Progressive Federal Party and two smaller parties. The Democrats' power  base is well-to-do white suburbanites, such as lawyers, academics and  businessmen.    The Democrats advocate government negotiations with the outlawed liberation  group, the African National Congress, an end to the three-year-old state of  emergency and the release of all political prisoners. Only then, they say, will  the country be able to prove to the black majority and to the world that it is  serious about reform.    The Democrats want to change the constitution, too. They would institute a  one-person, one-vote system modeled on the American federal system, dividing  the country into geographic rather than racial groups and giving each region  proportional representation.    The National Party, which has refused to negotiate with the ANC unless it  renounces violence, has tried to paint the Democrats as naive do-gooders who  are too soft on security and too cozy with black revolutionaries.    The government's recent crackdown on a campaign of anti-apartheid civil  disobedience, using legions of policemen armed with whips to break up dozens of  gatherings and detaining key leaders without trial, has been seen here as an  attempt to show the electorate that the threat of violence from black  organizations continues and that it will be dealt with firmly.    While the Nationalists were attempting to hold the middle ground, though, they  discovered an ideological split in their own ranks. The blowup that led to  President Botha's Aug. 14 resignation stemmed from a disagreement over a  meeting that De Klerk, the party leader and Botha's heir apparent, planned with  Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda.    Although Botha's resignation was more the result of months of ill feeling  toward his own party, his bitter farewell speech criticized De Klerk's  willingness to meet Kaunda, an advocate of sanctions against South Africa and  host to the ANC, the principal guerrilla group fighting Pretoria.    The Botha-De Klerk dispute was not expected to have a broad impact on the  election, but the Conservative Party has taken the opportunity to suggest that  the National Party might trade white rights in exchange for peace with the ANC.    Among many National Party stalwarts, however, Botha's departure was seen as an  unseemly burial that was necessary to begin the program of ""new action.""  Foreign Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha himself told a national TV audience  that, ""with great respect, I must say that (Botha's) memory is sometimes  faulty.""    ""I'm glad it came to a head,"" said Neels Brits, a Johannesburg businessman and  third-generation Nationalist. ""We have compassion for the man (Botha). But the  simple matter is, there's nothing wrong with the Kaunda visit.""

At the Organisation of African unity summit in  Tunis this week, President Nelson Mandela was embraced by fellow  African leaders as the continent's miracle-maker, forcing his  aides to squash ""exaggerated"" hopes for financial aid and  intervention in conflicts and requests that the president take  sides in international disputes. In developments this week:    -- Mr Mandela resisted pressure to send SANDF [South African  National Defence Force] troops to Rwanda or to mediate between  the representatives of the warring government and rebel forces.  Instead, South Africa donated R1-million [rand] to the OAU peace  fund, and will support church efforts to deliver supplies to  Rwanda.    -- South Africa declined to send troops to Lesotho despite  three separate demands that it do so by the Frontline States,  led by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe. Mr Mugabe argued for  military intervention at the OAU meeting, at the meeting of the  Frontline States in Harare, and at the World Economic Forum in  Cape Town last week.    -- Hopes that South Africa would mediate in the Angolan  conflict were also squashed when Mr Mandela declined a leading  role in this initiative.    -- South Africa rebuffed approaches to immediately cement  full diplomatic ties with North Korea after the Asian country  sent an urgent mission to the Tunisian capital. North Korea is  teetering towards a military clash with the U.S. over its  nuclear programme and is anxious to have South Africa on its  side.    -- Officials said reparation in cash, requested by the  Frontline States for their assistance in the war against  apartheid, would not be forthcoming. Instead, South Africa  would enter joint projects aimed at developing the region.    -- Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo tried to avoid a motion  backing Libya in its dispute with the U.S. and the United  Kingdom over the Lockerbie bombing being tabled at the OAU  meeting.    A presidential aide said that, apart from wanting to avoid  being drawn into energy-sapping disputes in Africa, the new  government was also aware that, as a ""newcomer"", it had to be  sensitive to other African leaders. The aide added the  government also had to be aware of is own domestic demands  before it committed huge resources to the rest of the continent.    In an interview this week, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz  Pahad  outlined a pragmatic, interest-driven foreign policy with the  chief priority of securing resources for the country's  Reconstruction and Development Programme.    Addressing a press conference on the issues of Rwanda and  Angola on his return from the OAU, Mr Mandela said: ""It appears  that leaders of countries where there is conflict would like to  exploit the experience we have had, but I feel we will achieve  better results if we fit in with the strategies already started,  instead of starting our own independent initiatives.""    He said he was willing to consider a possible meeting with  the warring Rwandan parties -- but to listen, rather than to  mediate. There were three other ""perfectly competent"" African  leaders who were already involved in mediating the conflict, he  added.    On the Angolan issue, Mr Mandela said that, while he had  been  asked to meet President Eduardo dos Santos and Mobuto Sese Seko,  he would prefer to support an initiative started by Mozambique  President Joaquim Chissano.    After the joy at admitting South Africa as the 53rd member  of  the OAU subsided, disappointment surfaced that Mr Mandela had  not done more to bolster the finances of the OAU or the  economies of its members. However, Mr Mandela made it clear  that South Africa would not hand out material resources except  to help raise living standards.    On several occasions he was forced to remind journalists and  delegates that he was not the Messiah and that no individual  would solve Africa's economic and social problems.    Foreign Affairs director-general Rusty Evans said in an  interview in Tunis: ""Of course they (African countries) have  expectations...of course, in their misery, they look at South  Africa as something that might suddenly bring relief of sorts.    ""At the same time there is a sense of realism. The South  African delegation has been warning against expecting too much.""    OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said people were  being unfair to South Africa in questioning what it would to  strengthen the African economy. ""The best contribution South  Africa can give is to become stable and strong and it will then  gradually impact on the continent,"" he said.    However, leading Africa analyst John Coker was critical. He  said South Africa's R1-million contribution to the OAU peace  fund was insignificant, in dollar terms, compared to the amount  of funds the OAU and its members had spent aiding the struggle  against apartheid.

However, since it has been shunned by the international investment community for so long, South Africa is playing hard to get with the numerous banks that have come courting. Although the gold and foreign exchange reserves have fallen, there is no urgent need for South Africa to raise funds internationally. An Dollars 850m loan facility from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) should be forthcoming by the end of the year and South Africa also has access to short-term credit lines from several banks. Nevertheless, bankers expect South Africa to launch its first international bond issue since January 1992 after the elections. South Africa is likely to test the waters with a Eurobond issue denominated in D-Marks. If the D-Mark Eurobond issue is successful, South Africa will then consider an offering in the higher-profile eurodollar sector. Offerings from parastatal issuers are likely to follow. The main bone of contention is the interest rate South Africa would have to pay to raise funds in the Eurobond market. Borrowers who want to raise funds in the Eurobond market have to pay a 'spread' or premium over the yield in the domestic government bond market. The size of the yield spread is determined by the market's perception of the borrower. The bigger the spread, the riskier the borrower. Bankers say that as long as South Africa is classified as an emerging market it will have to pay a yield spread of between 225 and 275 basis points over underlying government bonds. This is well above the yield spread of around 175 basis points which South Africa is prepared to pay. As a result, South Africa could refrain from coming to the international bond market until the pricing issue has been resolved.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

At a press  conference to mark the end of the two-day heads of state summit,  he said the committee would deal with African conflicts at  ambassadorial, ministerial and summit levels.    It would implement an early-warning system to identify  potential flashpoints and introduce measures to manage and  resolve conflicts throughout the continent.    Other African states serving on the committee are Tunisia,  Ivory Coast, Mauritius, Benin, Chad, Egypt and Ethiopia.    Dr Salim said the mechanism, established in Cairo last year,  needed financial support to function efficiently.    He said conflict resolution and peace-keeping had enjoyed a  high priority in the leaders' summit.    ""There was a clear determination to see an end to the  conflicts plagueing Africa. This culminated in the significant  achievement of the agreement by both parties in the Rwanda  conflict to introduce an immediate ceasefire.""    Dr Salim said the Rwanda Government and rebel forces were  both committed to ending the devastating civil war and allowing  the United Nations troops to provide protection and humanitarian  assistance to refugees displaced by the conflict.    Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia have each  contributed a batallion of 800 men to the UN mission in Rwanda  while Mali, Nigeria and Congo would send about 100 soldiers each.    South Africa had pledged humanitarian assistance and  possibly  logistical support in the form of approved personnel carriers.    Dr Salim also praised South Africa for paying its OAU  membership subscription in full and called on member states who  are in arrears to emulate their example.    He said the best contribution South Africa could make to  Africa was to remain a united, stable and peaceful society.    In the long term, South Africa would contribute  significantly  to the OAU and Africa, particularly in the sub-continent.    ""We can expect South Africa in the future to play a major  economic, political and security role in the continent,"" he said.     "

Already a lot of international aid has been  pledged to South Africa. America alone has promised $600  million. Zimbabwe, South Africa's neighbor and a country with  its own experience of racial division, is one of the countries  most likely to lose out in the battle for international aid.  President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is in London on a state  visit, and Julian Marshall asked him if Zimbabwe was now  competing with South Africa for international aid.    [Begin recording] [Mugabe] Some competition is inevitable,  and after all why shouldn't there be competition? If South  Africa will have that investment, well and good, but there are  also forms of investment which, because of the advantage that we  have over South Africa, will come our way. Anyway, we can say  that today as things stand, we are more peaceful and stable than  South Africa, that we have had areas of greater development and  progress than South Africa because of the problems they have  had, and that this gives us here in some way and some areas that  needed advantage.    [Marshall] How important is the white population in Zimbabwe  -- I am thinking particularly of white farmers -- to the  continued prosperity of the country?    [Mugabe] Very important. We still need commercial farming,  and don't forget that commercial farming has to do with just  more than production of food. We need cash crops; we need  greater productivity in the commercial sector so we can compete.  So, apart from the fact that we need more land from the  commercial sector, and how acquiring this land is going to  affect some of the farmers, apart from that problem, there is no  other problem. Really, the commercial farmer, I mean, the white  commercial farmer, is a happier person in Zimbabwe.    [Marshall] So, you do intend to continue with the process of  the equitable redistribution of land?    [Mugabe] It is equity we are aiming at -- land which must  come into the possession of the peasant community -- so that the  peasant community has a resource and asset for the improvement  of their economic position.    [Marshall] So, finally, given the experience of the white  population in Zimbabwe in 14 years of independence, what is your  message to the white people in South Africa?    [Mugabe] Our message is that they should look at how and why  community in Zimbabwe -- white and black community -- have  reconciled to each other, and I am glad that President Mandela  has pronounced the policy of national reconciliation and  national unity as guidelines for the people of South Africa, and  I hope they do respond to his call in a social and economic way,  reacting to it positively, trying to work together with the  majority of the people in South Africa, and trying also to  enhance the lot of the poor in their country. That way, there  will be greater harmony and greater stability, and the whites in  South Africa needn't fear of any repercussions, any policies of  retributions in the future -- if this happened.

This follows a series of missions to South Africa by  representatives of the African Development Bank group since  1991. The Development Bank of South Africa [DBSA] said it had  been decided that the republic would officially enter into a  series of consultations with the African Development Bank group  on the terms and conditions of South Africa's membership.    These consultations would be pursued under the auspices of  the government of national unity and might eventually lead to  South Africa becoming a fully fledged member of Africa's premier  development financing institution, the DBSA said.    The group has earmarked between R720-million [rand] to  R1.26-billion a year over the next five years for financing  investment projects and programmes to both South Africa's public  and private sectors, to enhance economic and social development.  The funds could come in the form of long term loans to finance  public sector project investments in agriculture, public  utilities, transportation, education, health and industry, or  long-term lines of credit to national development banks to  finance private sector projects or medium- to long-term loans  and equity investments, in all productive sectors of the  economy, made directly to the private sector.    The DBSA said it was probable a significant portion of the  group's resources to South Africa would be targeted at  disadvantaged South Africans. However, it was up to South  Africa to decide finally on such resource allocation from  African Development Bank sources.    There were also opportunities for South African firms to  supply goods and services for the execution of the group's  projects throughout Africa. In addition, South Africa could  draw on the group's grant-based technical assistance.    South African representatives would attend the group's  annual  general meeting in Nairobi from May 11 to 13, at which the  declaration of intent would be tabled. A series of joint South  African/African Development Bank Group consultations would  follow the successful adoption of the declaration of intent, the  DBSA said.     "

He identified the main internal weaknesses of  Africa as lack of technology and poor organization but stressed  the question of poor organization as having played the most  crucial role. He said that countries such as China, Ethiopia,  and Japan, although inferior in technology, were able to defend  their sovereignty due to a high level of organization.    Mr. Museveni also attributed Africa's problems to Africa's  self- inflicted damage. He explained that one of the most  important factors to be independent is production, and yet  African governments have continuously interfered with production  by imposing various obstacles such as roadblocks, visas, and  marketing monopolies. He said African governments have  themselves interfered with sovereignty in Africa. He therefore  called upon the seventh Pan-African congress to examine their  self-inflicted damages and come up with solutions.    On the question of reparations to Africa by Europe and  America, Mr. Museveni said that these countries have a moral  responsibility to pay for the damage inflicted on Africa by  their ancestors. He stressed that Africa will emancipate  herself with or without the sympathy of her former oppressors.  However he was of the view that compensation for the past  injustices is likely to come when Africa demands it from a  position of strength not from one of weakness. He therefore  commended the seventh Pan-African congress slogan of Organize  But Do Not Agonize, saying that it is definitely within our  means to end domination.    Mr. Museveni elaborated that he personally had been fighting  to end domination for the last 29 years and, although he has not  ended domination completely, he has pushed it back. Elaborating  on who are the members of the Pan-African movement, Mr. Museveni  categorized these as the black Africans on the African  Continent, the Africans in the Arab region, the Africans in the  Diaspora, and whites in South Africa whom he referred to as a  new African tribe. He appealed to all Pan-Africanists not to  draw ideology into the movement but to accept all  Pan-Africanists, both radical and reactionaries, as members of  the movement. [passage omitted]     "

That adage, from veteran South African entrepreneur Anton Rupert, forms the rationale around the world for regional integration: the argument is that a sated neighbour is a stable neighbour, unlikely to turn belligerent. And with peace and stability come economic development. Four years ago, southern Africa's prospects looked unrelievedly bleak, with Angola and Mozambique sunk in civil war, Zambia in turmoil, Zimbabwe in economic decline and South Africa exhausted by decades of repression. Today hopes are high that South Africa will prove the region's economic saviour. But the post-apartheid government in Pretoria is likely to pay little attention to the problem of hungry neighbours until it can solve the far more dangerous problem of hungry citizens. And that could take until the end of the decade, even on an optimistic timetable, dampening hopes that South Africa will be the 'locomotive' of rapid growth in southern Africa - at least in the short term. First among the problems is the political transition in South Africa itself, where violence and instability have severely depressed economic activity and deterred foreign and local investors. Until South Africa is stable, accelerated economic growth in the region remains a pipe dream: and achieving stability in the republic may prove a lengthy process. Similarly, political upheaval in other countries of the region will inevitably delay growth. The most economically promising country outside South Africa - Angola - looks set to languish in civil war for the foreseeable future; Mozambique's future is far from certain, in spite of plans for multi-party elections; Zambia is struggling under the burden of decades of past mistakes, economic and political; Zimbabwe is weak economically. The economic basis for regional integration is also shaky. Prospects for significantly increasing trade within the region are uninspiring: first and foremost, because most of the countries of southern Africa simply cannot pay, at least not with hard currency. To get around the payment problem, South Africa could extend the rand monetary area to include other countries - a far too costly option, given the lack of monetary discipline exhibited by most of the region's central banks - or resort to countertrade. But it will be difficult to boost two-way trade links given the fact that South Africa's neighbours are far less developed than the republic (in a market worth Dollars 130bn, South Africa already has an 80 per cent share) and because regional complementarities are few, outside of a limited range of raw materials. Little can be expected from the lifting of sanctions in this area either: even under sanctions, regional states grouped together under the Southern African Development Coordination Conference (since renamed the Southern African Development Community) imported R2.4bn of goods from the republic, or almost 60 per cent of Pretoria's African exports. The most promising areas could well prove inter-regional trade in services, such as power and water, with Eskom, the South African electricity utility, proposing a southern African electricity grid; Pretoria already imports water from Lesotho through the Highlands Water project. But important as this co-operation is, the record to date suggests there is little evidence that SADC politicians in the region are prepared to relinquish enough economic autonomy to form a truly integrated regional community. In the longer term, there is no alternative to regional integration. In a world of economic and political power blocs, southern Africa cannot hope to prosper in its present fragmented state. The risk is that, unless the region achieves political stability soon, it will simply miss the boat.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

Both Nelson Mandela and President FW de Klerk are determined to deliver a negotiated government of national unity. But time is running out      By PATTI WALDMEIR   THE centre holds. It held when South Africa faced the biggest political crisis of the post-apartheid era, the assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani. It held when the butchers of Boipatong and Bisho cut down innocent blacks. It held when black hands murdered white farmers. Over the past year, the centre has held against all the odds, against every threat from right or left. And it holds still. For a country divided by history and design, with one of the world's highest rates of crime, political violence, unemployment and poverty, that is something of a miracle. Over the next year, there is every chance that the centre will grow stronger still - if only because the spectre of racist radicals to left and right will frighten the ANC and the ruling National Party into an ever-tighter embrace. Weakness has always been the cement which bound their reluctant alliance - each knew it could not survive without the other - and that bond can only grow as inevitable defections to hard-line black and white parties (such as the black supremacist Pan Africanist Congress and the Afrikaner nationalist Conservative Party) render each weaker still. But within that centre ground, the most momentous shifts are taking place: for sometime over the Easter weekend - the fateful weekend of the Hani assassination - the National Party passed an historic point of no return. The balance of power - still nominally Pretoria's, with its control of the security forces, the administration and the fiscal purse-strings - began to tilt in favour of those who must eventually take over as the dominant force, the ANC. President FW de Klerk, with all his police and soldiers, had no choice but to hand over responsibility for law and order to ANC president Nelson Mandela. Mr Mandela - not Mr de Klerk - issued a televised appeal for calm, in tacit admission that only he could prevent the threatened descent into chaos. Mr de Klerk controlled the state; but Mr Mandela controlled the nation. Since then, President de Klerk has done all he can to restore the credibility lost during that period, when National Party supporters finally faced the inevitable: the loss of monopoly white power, and the spectre of black rule. He has ostentatiously wielded the levers of power - rejecting, to ANC howls of outrage, an independently-chosen board of governors for the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation - and insisting (as he does elsewhere in this survey) that the hand of a National Party leader will remain on the tiller for the foreseeable future. But many of his supporters - and a substantial section of his caucus - seem to have lost faith in these assurances. White morale has never been so low, generating a boom for international removals companies. According to the most recent opinion poll, National Party support among whites has fallen below 25 per cent for the first time. This may not be good news for South African democracy. For Mr de Klerk's mission has ever been to ensure that moderate forces - led by him, and including the Afrikaner nation which he alone can protect - can prevent a black government from ruling unchecked. If he thinks this goal is threatened, he is likely to harden his bottom line. He has made clear his demands: the National Party will require what amounts to a veto over cabinet decisions on fundamental issues - until at least the end of the century, perhaps beyond. ANC leaders reject this, though they have conceded the first post-election cabinet will include all leaders with more than 5 per cent of the popular vote (with cabinet posts distributed proportionately) and that Mr de Klerk will have what amounts to a veto over a very limited number of issues. They have also conceded that significant powers be devolved from central to regional governments - another check on ANC domination, demanded by Mr de Klerk - but the detailed distribution has yet to be agreed. In narrowing the gaps on these issues, Messrs de Klerk and Mandela will finally answer the question they have so long avoided: who will wield real power in the new South Africa? The answer seems obvious: the ANC and the National Party together - but not necessarily under conditions of true democracy. First prize remains a government of national unity ruling under a negotiated multiracial constitution, with maximum popular legitimacy. But stability - however it is achieved - is a close second, and gaining. After nearly four years of political upheaval, South Africa yearns for stability: without it, the economy cannot recover from its four-year recession; schools will remain in chaos; the water will not run and the toilets will not work in the townships; crime cannot be contained. And South Africa risks losing the skilled people who alone can prevent it, in the words of one leading Afrikaner, from 'sliding into Africa'. Both the ANC and the National Party are determined to deliver stability. For the moment, they are still striving for first prize, a negotiated government of national unity, ruling under a more or less liberal constitution. They may well get the first instalment of that prize soon: a 26-party transitional executive council with narrow authority to oversee government in the run-up to elections tentatively set for April 27 next year. But it falls far short of the constitutional deal which must be agreed by September if elections are to be held in April. The game plan is for the ANC and government to force through the 26-party constitutional negotiating forum their own outline agreement on a new constitution, which calls for a five-year multiracial power-sharing cabinet, proportional representation, a bill of rights, and substantial devolution of power to regions. Their dual challenge is to finalise their own agreement on power-sharing (which could prove more difficult than anticipated, if Mr de Klerk is serious about a permanent arrangement) while trying to drag other parties into the deal. Their goal is to ensure that those who could do most to sabotage elections and destabilise a new government - the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party, the black-radical Pan Africanist Congress, the right-wing Conservative Party and the moderate-right Afrikaner Volksunie - will give a new constitution their blessing. They may soon conclude that is an impossible task. So far, they have kept all parties at the table primarily by skirting important issues; but time has run out on such leisurely tactics. Before September, they must agree an interim constitution under which to hold elections; settle a host of problems such as the powers of the transitional executive, and of independent commissions to oversee elections and the state broadcast media; resolve the issue of joint control of the security forces and political armies; and agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution will be bound. This list goes on and on. Negotiators from both sides make clear that a deal will be pushed through, no matter who disagrees (Inkatha's broadly constructive attitude at the talks suggests Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi has accepted that reality). Legitimacy will be guaranteed either by free and fair elections (a long shot, given the present violence), by a popular referendum - or not at all. Dissent will be dealt with either within the constitution, or outside it, but it will be dealt with. It would be a shame if South Africa ends up with no more than - in the words of ANC constitutional expert Albie Sachs - 'deracialised oppression'. But if the choice is between peace, stability and economic growth on the one side - and democracy on the other - South Africa may yet decide democracy is a luxury it cannot afford.

Meanwhile, Canada announced the extension of General  Preferential Tariff treatment to South Africa, which makes it  easier to export to Canada. Application of the General  Preferential Tariff means that the rate of duty pay on eligible  imports from South Africa will be reduced by at least 33  percent. Australia announced that it would give an extra 17.1  million rands in aid to South Africa over the next three years.  This brings the total amount of aid to South Africa to about 90  million rands.    Promises of aid and support also came from Germany. The  German minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Klaus Kinkel, said South  Africa's new government needs international confidence and  support. He pointed out that nowhere else in Africa were the  chances for development and healthy and continuous growth so  great as in South Africa.

At the time of the acquisition, the group estimated first-year earnings of 60.1 cents a share and a total payout of 20 cents. Previous year figures are not comparable as they pre-date the transaction, but the group - owner of the Del Monte brand in Africa, the Middle East and Europe - bettered its forecasts only through unexpected reductions in its interest bill and tax liability. Mr Vivian Imerman, chairman, said a South African Reserve Bank ruling prevented disclosure of company details in the past year, but he hoped the release of new information would bolster the group's stock market rating in London and Johannesburg. He said the key to future earnings growth would be the development of new Del Monte and private label products, licensing agreements, and new market penetration in Europe and Asia. Adverse currency movements, particularly the devaluation of the Italian lira, and tough trading conditions associated with recession in Europe, responsible for 80 per cent of sales, depressed turnover which at R1.28bn compared with a forecast R1.82bn. Mr Enrico Sola, chief executive officer, said consumer spending was on the slide in most of the group's main markets. However, Mr Sola said Del Monte had maintained its share of the premium brand market, without cutting prices, as the proliferation of cheap brands and private label lines affected rival products. Pre-tax profit stood at R233.3m, well below the forecast R331.5m. Net interest payments of R32.2m were half the group's forecast reflecting lower interest rates in Europe and South Africa as well as a windfall gain from the strengthening of the financial rand through which DMFI was acquired, against sterling. The exchange rate gain cut the payment price by R192m to improve the debt-to-equity ratio and lower finance charges.   Companies:-  Del Monte Royal Foods.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The move should go ahead soon after South Africa's first universal suffrage elections on April 26-28, when the EU should have finalised its 10-year review of the GSP system, held up until the recent completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. 'This is aimed as a substantial gesture of support for the elections,' said an aide to Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner. 'This is what both the government and the African National Congress have been asking us for.' But ministers resisted a British-led move to get the EU to commit itself now to a fully-fledged trade and co-operation agreement with South Africa as the next stage in closer links. France, Spain, Italy and Belgium prefer a more evolutionary approach, and got reference to yesterday's decision as an 'interim' agreement struck out of the Council of Ministers' conclusions. Behind their lukewarm enthusiasm is reluctance to treat South Africa as a developing country, although its relatively high average earnings mask huge income gaps within its population. Nevertheless, all 12 EU states agreed to treat South Africa as a special case. The EU runs a substantial trade deficit with South Africa, from which it largely imports minerals and precious metals, most of which already enter duty-free. In 1992, the Union had an Ecu3.7bn (Pounds 2.84bn) deficit on imports from South Africa worth Ecu9.1bn, over two-thirds of which were raw materials. For the first nine months of last year imports were Ecu6.7bn, against exports to South Africa of Ecu4.1bn, for a deficit of Ecu2.6bn. Because of the small flows of finished goods that South Africa exports, GSP treatment will at first be of limited benefit, even with, as ministers also agreed in principle, flexible rules on so-called accumulated rules of origin, or treating as South African goods which include components from neighbouring countries. However, along with recommendations that member states conclude bilateral investment protection and promotion pacts with South Africa, and a request to the European Investment Bank to extend its development financing to the republic, 'we are creating the climate for investors to take South Africa more seriously,' as a British official put it.

'There is an awareness that South Africa is a promising market,' says Mr Sota Sakai, manager of the Middle East and Africa Section at Marubeni, the trading house. 'But when it comes to investment, this is like a marriage so it will take more time to reach that point,' he notes. While Japan was South Africa's fourth largest trading partner in 1990 after West Germany, Great Britain and the US, due to international sanctions there has been no Japanese direct investment in South Africa for at least the past 10 years, the ministry of finance says. The political situation is still a strong concern. The Japan Bond Research Institute, gave South Africa a 5.9 general rating in its latest July report, which was up from 5.4 in January and 4.0 in January, 1989. The Institute attributed the higher ranking to the positive aspects of the government's fiscal and monetary policies as well as enhanced international trust in South Africa. Geography is also a problem. 'Japan is not that internationalised yet,' explains Mr Sakai. Japanese businesses also believe that the entire business environment in South Africa needs to be improved before the country can expect to see a significant influx of investment from Japan. Greater communication between the two countries is also necessary before Japanese businesses are likely to feel comfortable with the idea of investing in South Africa. For much the same reasons, there is little interest in Japan in South Africa's capital markets. Meanwhile, the activities of Japanese banks with regard to South Africa have been frozen since the country declared a debt standstill in 1985.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship. Now, in an era of  reconciliation, African countries are not in the mood to overlook past slights  -- or present conditions.    But the delicate relationship with the rest of Africa is crucial to South  Africa's future in the Olympic movement, for Olympic officials have made it  clear that the way back for South Africa must wind through Africa.    Two workmen are sitting in a tin shed by the Eastbank Hall swimming pool in  Alexandra, waiting for the delivery of paint for the bottom of the pool. They  have been waiting for two weeks. When the pool was built, the wrong paint was  used, and ever since it hasn't been right. Sometimes someone comes by with some  paint for the pool, but it isn't right, either.    So, here in the middle of South Africa's summer, the only pool in this black  township is closed.    Alexandra's best soccer field was partially covered with brown grass and  potholes because residents weren't able to water, resod or bring in equipment  to grade it.    Soweto, with a population of 2.5 million, relies largely on its schools to  provide sports facilities for the black children. It is a faint hope, however,  in a country where schools are segregated and the government spends five times  more money to educate its white children than its black.    ""They are telling you lies abroad,"" said a community activist in Soweto who  would give only his first name, Rapu. ""They tell you our facilities are equal.  You can see they are not. South Africa belongs to all who are in it. We must  work to make a country for all the people. Sport has a significant role to  play. But there are priorities. You can't have a society that has thousands of  sports facilities when you have people who are not healthy enough to play the  sports.""    Rapu is fully behind the sports boycotts, even though he acknowledges that  black South Africans are doubly punished: They are not allowed free and open  competition within South Africa, and, as South Africans, they are not allowed  to compete against the rest of the world.    There is an argument advancing the notion that rather than stifling sports in  South Africa, those who seek to bring about political change ought to encourage  sports and nourish them. This argument holds that the interaction among races  that sports bring, the camaraderie it engenders, is a far more effective tool  to bring people together than laws and edicts.    Jannie Momberg, a Member of Parliament from the Democratic party, agrees with  this view and says that in South Africa, sports has another role.    ""I would say that sport has been used by the South African government as a kite  -- to see which way the wind was blowing in the country,"" he said. ""If it  worked in sports, they put it in place elsewhere in society.""    This kite is difficult to fly in a wind so strong that it seeks to bring it  down. However, in the last year, three historic meetings took place that may  have changed the direction of the anti-South African wind.    On Sept. 11, Johan du Plessis and J.B. du Plessis, the director of the South  African National Olympic Committee, met in Lausanne, Switzerland, with Juan  Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee. The topic:  How to get South Africa back into the Olympic movement.    Samaranch explained that for South Africa to get back, it must work through its  continent -- only the IOC members from Africa will be able to help South  Africa. ""If they accept you, the rest of the world will accept you,"" Samaranch  said.    Events moved swiftly. On Oct. 11, the Du Plessises (they are unrelated) met  with Judge Keba Mbaye, an IOC vice president from Senegal. Mbaye told them that  Africa was their ticket back, and expected no less than the abolition of  apartheid.    That paved the way for a meeting on Jan. 9 in Paris with Sam Ramsamy and Fekrou  Kidane, who are advisers to the IOC Commission on Apartheid and Olympism.  Ramsamy, in particular, has devoted his life to the anti-apartheid sports  movement. The South Africans were excited about the unprecedented meeting.    Obviously, apartheid was singled out as the biggest problem. Another was the  IOC's concern about lack of unity among South African sporting bodies. In some  sports, there are five or six governing bodies. The IOC, through Ramsamy, told  the SANOC to unify its sports bodies under one umbrella and get rid of any  discrimination.    The South Africans came away from the 5 1/2-hour meeting excited about the  future for the first time in decades.    ""It was the first time we had concrete suggestions,"" Johan du Plessis said. ""We  didn't talk about politics. We talked about sports. We know what we have to  do.""    Some sports administrators here are angry at what they see as the IOC's  selective boycott of South Africa. Ray Moore of the South African Tennis Union  said: ""Listen, in 1980 the Soviets invaded Afghanistan, and the IOC saw fit to  hold the Games in the capital city of the invading nation. Where is the line of  demarcation? Is there a set of standards for Africa?"" Moore said.    ""If you want to go into human rights in Africa . . . most of the countries in  Africa are governed in tyranny. They have dictators. You have people who have  sworn themselves into a presidency or as king for life. Ethiopia . . . what is  happening in Ethiopia is unbelievable. And Uganda. They are in the Olympics.  They are a respected member of the IOC. This was during a time when Africa was  becoming more powerful internationally. They could turn the whole thing the way  they wanted it to turn.""    In their excitement about the opening of a dialogue with the IOC, South African  officials are overlooking other signs. Last month Samaranch was asked about the  possibility of South Africa being readmitted in time for the 1992 Olympics.  Samaranch said it would not be possible. And the African nations are no less  militant regarding their neighbor to the south.    Rise like Lions after slumber    In unvanquishable number --    Shake your chains to earth like dew    Which in sleep had fallen on you --    Ye are many -- they are few.     -- Percy Bysshe Shelley, The Mask of Anarchy    Despite political changes and some historic talks with the IOC, South Africa is  no nearer to being readmitted to the international sports community. And while  some officials in South Africa are optimistic, others note that only a month  ago, Samaranch rejected the notion that South Africa would be back in the IOC.  He called the changes ""cosmetic.""    Said Momberg: ""I'm very negative about being readmitted before South Africa  becomes an independent, non-racial democracy. We've done a lot in certain areas  to integrate, but then we have segregated schools. I would be most amazed if  the people in the Olympic movement, after so many years of successfully  pressuring South Africa, would give up and say, 'Come back, all is forgiven.' ""    One likely scenario for South Africa is for sports to be recognized piecemeal,  federation by federation. The IAAF could allow the South African track  federation back, for example, the international governing body for swimming  could recognize South Africa's federation, and so on. In this way, South  Africans may compete internationally before they compete as a team in the  Olympic Games.    South Africa has its friends within the IOC, proof enough that its years of  lobbying have not gone to waste. But others have read the IOC charter and see  no allowance for a country where apartheid is still the law.    ""We are all held hostage by apartheid -- the black athletes in South Africa,  the white athletes in South Africa,"" said Anita De Frantz, a U.S.  representative on the IOC. ""The black and white athletes in the rest of the  world are held hostage by that system. That's why it must be dismantled.    ""Our charter says you cannot discriminate. I don't know if it's politics and  sports not linking, but it's part of the rule of the Olympic movement. While it  may look to the rest of the world as politics and sport, it's our charter, it's  our document describing what it takes to be a part of the Olympic family that  prohibits them from being a part.    ""Of course, the rejoinder is, 'Well, what about places where there are human  rights violations?' Yes. But this is a country that openly, notoriously, says  that on the basis of the color of your skin, your rights are different. It's  just so clear. I use the word open and notorious -- there's just no mistake.""    This, then, is the rope South Africa clings to. Its end is in the isolation of  home; the other is in the freedom abroad. South Africa's inability to pull the  rope, or to allow itself to be tugged, has kept this athletic landscape static.    ""We have done all we can do,"" they say to the world. ""Let others compromise.""    While black and white athletes clamor to break free of the borders of South  Africa's exile, sports officials are held hostage by politicians who are held  hostage by apartheid.    And so South Africa remains, clenching its fist and stamping a tiny foot  against the world.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Why anyone would care about sports in South Africa, a country flirting  simultaneously with democracy and anarchy, is a good question. Surely, the  officials attempting to hold the country together have more pressing concerns.    This is understood. So why, then, do politicians here come back again and again  to the plight of the athletes of South Africa, who ask: When will we become  acceptable enough to the world sports community to be let back in?    Maybe it is because every day, in offices and schools and bars and clubs, South  Africans of all colors talk about sports; they debate and even come to blows  about sports. And as sports is a mirror of society, so does society mirror  sports. This color-conscious land is peopled with fans who fall in along color  lines: Blacks love soccer, Afrikaners love rugby and English-speaking whites  love cricket.    If only every issue in South Africa were so simple.    The biggest problem facing South African sports officials is how to get back  into the Olympic movement. The problems are not simple, and many of the  solutions are out of the hands of sports officials and in the hands of South  Africa's legislators.    After three decades of boycotts and isolation, South Africa wants back. It  wants to be friends again. South African sports officials have tried  everything. They have lobbied. They have hovered in hotel coffee shops. They  have attended conventions and congresses and meetings to which they have not  been invited, and smile even when delegates walk briskly past.    ""We go to all the (International Amateur Athletic Federation) meetings, but no  one will meet with us,"" said Gert le Roux, director of the South African  Amateur Athletic Union. ""We are never welcome, and some of these people used to  be our friends. After a while, we become embarrassed by hanging about in hotel  lobbies.""    The snubs are difficult to swallow. Professor J.S. Vermaak, President of the  South African Rugby Board, explained that while South Africa is still a  founding member of the International Rugby Football Union, the country is  effectively banned.    ""Every year, South Africa is on the schedule,"" he said. ""Every year, no one  comes.""    In their search for acceptance, sports officials even placed a ""sports  ambassador"" from South Africa in London.    Eddie Barlow was one of South Africa's best cricket players when he was sent on  a three-year stint to England to direct South Africa's sports office there. His  mandate: Promote South African sport internationally and let the world know how  integrated it was.    Barlow came back to South Africa in 1987 a disillusioned man. He said the job  was nearly impossible, especially with the fast-growing international  anti-apartheid lobby.    In his contacts with sports officials, Barlow said he made a significant  discovery: The sporting world was not anti-South Africa, it was anti-apartheid.  He transmitted this message many times to sports officials in South Africa, and  it was their lack of response that drove him to quit.    ""If sports administrators continue to wrap themselves up in political  ideologies, and believe that South Africa is right and the rest of the world is  wrong, then they shouldn't cry if we remain isolated,"" he said.    ""The name of the game is upholding human rights, not playing political power  games. Doors will open if we abandon apartheid as a repressive and political  tool -- that's the chance our sporting friends abroad are asking for.""    Since the begining of South Africa's isolation, the intent of the world's  sporting bodies was to pressure politicians through sport. Since the beginning,  South African officials believed they could withstand the pressure, and the  world sporting community believed the pressure would work. Both appear to have  been correct.    Clearly, three decades of sports boycotts have brought about change in South  Africa, not only in sports but also in society as a whole. It is equally clear  that the very relic the boycotts meant to cast out still remains in place --  apartheid has been chipped at since 1948, but it remains one symbolic wall that  hasn't been brought down.    So, there has been some change and some resistance. South African sports  officials today find themselves holding onto a taut line with no more to give  either way.    ""In the early days, they really thought they would be able to overcome all the  pressure from the world. I think that was the big mistake they made in the  past."" said Johan du Plessis, president of the South African National Olympic  Committee. ""That (mistake) was, from our side, matching up with Europe and  maybe America, that (coalition) would be strong enough against Africa. They  didn't realize the whole thing was going to turn in favor of Africa. Africa  took over the United Nations, the IOC.""    Agonizing over missed opportunities doesn't help solve problems -- even if the  mistakes are grave, such as South Africa's snubbing of its neighbor nations in  favor of ""white"" countries in which it felt more kinship.

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.    ""The whole of this area will stop looking to London and start looking to  Johannesburg"" for imported goods, says one East African businessman.    These include anything from military hardware, necessarily an industrial  specialty of sanction-beset South Africa, to automobile assembly kits for  plants in Zimbabwe and Kenya and fruits and vegetables that grow better in  South Africa's temperate climate than in the tropical zone girdling the rest of  the continent. South African wines, barred by trade sanctions from European and  American shops, are world-class.    ""A lot of things that Ivoirians consider indispensable to their lives, like  scrunchy apples, salad greens that don't grow here and wine, are cheaper coming  from South Africa than from France,"" says one diplomat in Abidjan, the capital  of affluent Ivory Coast.    Accordingly, planning in many countries for post-apartheid relations with South  Africa has been going on for far longer than their governments admit.    Kenya Airways's preparation for flights to Johannesburg began as long as a year  ago, sources say. The airline's purchase of three Boeing 757 aircraft, to be  delivered in January, was predicated partly on its ability to use two of them  to service the new Johannesburg route.    The World Bank's Jaycox says that not only the group of so-called front-line  states in southern Africa, but also the African National Congress and the  Pan-African Congress, have asked his institution to draw up economic forecasts  based on a new relationship between black-ruled Africa and South Africa.    But whether South Africa will be able to export prosperity to its neighbors is  open to question. Although some analysts suggest that South African  manufacturers might open satellite plants in neighboring countries to take  advantage of their cheaper labor, others note that these businesses will be  under pressure to first raise black South Africa's standard of living by  creating more jobs at home, not abroad.    So South African industry might view black Africa largely as an untapped market  for its exports. The net result of increased South African involvement in  Africa's economy could be harmful competition from its better-equipped and more  efficient manufacturers and growers.    A major victim could be Zimbabwe, whose once-impressive industrial structure,  built during its own period of isolated white-minority rule in the 1960s and  1970s -- is falling apart from old age and the total absence of outside  investment during its 10 years of black-ruled independence.    ""Manufacturing in Zimbabwe will crash,"" says one businessman with extensive  experience in Africa, ""because they can't compete with the efficiencies down  south.""    For all that, South Africa's apparent interest in reuniting with the rest of  its continent is based on more than just economics. One of the enduring  self-images of the Afrikaners of South Africa is that they are a white African  ""tribe,"" a view that underscores the group's discomfort at being so politically  isolated.    ""Yes, I am an African,"" De Klerk said last month during his state visit to  Senegal. ""My family fought in the first war in Africa against colonialism (the  Boer War), and I don't want to go anywhere else in my life.""    But the road to genuine political and economic cooperation will be marked by  large potholes; most business leaders and politicians knowledgeable about  improving ties choose to speak off the record, for political animosity to the  South African regime remains potent in black-ruled Africa.    ""There's lots of exploration going on now, but lots of countries are  constrained because they want their policies and actions to remain in harmony  with black South Africans,"" says Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, a prominent African  banker.    Anyone seeking a hint of the pitfalls still confronting South Africa's desire  to become a regional player needs look no farther than the Kenya-South Africa  airline agreement.    The arrangement was announced in Nairobi on Oct. 4, with twice-weekly flights  set to begin Saturday. Travel agents began booking South African tourists into  Kenyan lodges, and seats on the first flights from South Africa quickly filled  up. Then African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela passed through  Nairobi's airport Oct. 14 in transit. He called an airport press conference to  blast the Kenyan government for what amounted to prematurely lifting sanctions.    Eleven days later, Kenya President Daniel Arap Moi, presumably cognizant that  the ANC could be ruling South Africa some day soon, unilaterally suspended the  airline deal until South Africa ""dismantles"" apartheid.    Kenya Airways officials privately acknowledge that they or the government  should have informed the ANC well in advance of the impending deal, in the  hopes of defusing any opposition. Business leaders and others in Nairobi now  regard the affair as a damaging lost opportunity to secure South African  goodwill and trade concessions.    ""It would be good to be first into South Africa,"" says one leading East African  businessman. ""You certainly don't want to be last.""    The Weekly Review, Kenya's most authoritative news publication, estimated the  potential lost revenue for Kenya Airways at nearly $23 million a year.    Perhaps the sector with the most to lose is tourism. Kenyan travel agents  estimated that easing travel restrictions could bring as many as 200,000 South  Africans annually to Kenyan game parks and, even more inviting, its beach  resorts. That would make South Africa the biggest source of tourists in Kenya  and increase total visits, which in 1988 came to 680,000 and brought $400  million into the country, by nearly 30%.    Prospects for reinstating the flight agreement are unclear right now -- the  suspension has still not been publicly acknowledged in Johannesburg -- but  Kenyan travel professionals say the important thing is to establish the flights  in time to attract beachgoers during the South African winter, beginning in  April or May.    Across Africa, open links with South Africa will bring to the surface plenty of  activity that has been going on quietly for as long as South Africa has been a  political pariah.    Sub-Saharan Africa's covert trade with South Africa has always been the  continent's worst-kept secret. In even the remotest up-country shops in Ivory  Coast, for instance, it is possible to buy a can of Coca-Cola with the legend  ""Keep South Africa Tidy"" embossed on the top. The labels of some consumer goods  found on the shelves in Zimbabwe supermarkets are written in Afrikaans.    Other ties are more subtle. Every Friday, a new, generally full Zambia Airways  plane takes off from Johannesburg for Lusaka, Zambia, and then continues to New  York. Few passengers ever get on or off the flight in Lusaka, and it is  considered largely a Zambia-assisted subterfuge allowing South Africans to  evade an American ban on direct flights to the United States from Johannesburg.    Of the 10 countries in the so-called Southern African Development Coordination  Conference (SADCC), a band of staunch anti-apartheid South African neighbors,  only two -- Tanzania and Angola -- officially bar all South African goods.  About 30% of the SADCC countries' total imports came from South Africa in 1986,  the latest year for which statistics are available. The share of SADCC exports  going to South Africa, 7%, exceeds the 4% that represents trade among the  conference members themselves.    About 32% of all South Africa's manufacture exports go north to black-ruled  Africa, says Kent Durr, the South African minister of trade and industry, and  the figure is growing. The South African government contends that of the 51  member nations of the Organization of African Unity, only one, Libya, has no  economic link with South Africa whatsoever. But only 13 of those countries  acknowledge having any ties.    Ivory Coast is perhaps one of the best examples of how a country can maintain  informal partnerships with South Africa. The country's main airport at Abidjan  has for years been one of the few permitted refueling stops for South African  Airways planes on the way to Europe.    Ivory Coast might be one of South Africa's most important diplomatic catches  because President Felix Houphouet-Boigny is considered the doyen of African  leaders, particularly in the set of former French colonies in West Africa.    Houphouet has never been a strict observer of political and economic sanctions  against the apartheid regime. For instance, South African Foreign Minister  Roelof F. (Pik) Botha was among the honored guests in September at the  consecration of Houphouet's massive new Roman Catholic basilica by Pope John  Paul II.    But diplomats and other political observers believe that Houphouet's opening of  official ties with South Africa will be a signal to other African leaders that  it is safe to move ahead on trade and diplomatic ties.    ""Once Houphouet's done it,"" says a diplomatic observer in Abidjan, ""quite a few  others will come scurrying in his wake.""

AFRICA;    MORE OF ITS AFRICAN NEIGHBORS HAVE SOUGHT TO DO BUSINESS WITH PRETORIA SINCE IT  BEGAN DISMANTLING APARTHEID. DIPLOMATIC TIES, THOUGH, MAY HAVE TO WAIT.      By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      NAIROBI, Kenya      Executives from government-owned Kenya Airways emerged from a secret meeting in  Johannesburg several months ago with a big prize -- a ground-breaking agreement  to resume reciprocal flights between Nairobi and Johannesburg by the flagship  carriers of both countries, after a gap of 27 years.    But on the way home the officials had to stop first in Gaborone, the capital of  Botswana, to have their passports stamped with a Botswana visa. The reason: It  is illegal under Kenya law to fly directly to Nairobi from South Africa.    It still is illegal, and that bureaucratic complication well reflects the  complexities and pitfalls facing South Africa and its black-ruled neighbors as  they begin to look ahead to new diplomatic and economic relations in a  post-apartheid era.    The change has already begun. Since he became South Africa's president in  September, 1989, and began dismantling institutional apartheid, Frederik W. de  Klerk has received red-carpet treatment on visits to six sub-Saharan African  countries: Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, Madagascar, Senegal and Ivory Coast.  South Africa has opened new trade offices in Togo and Zaire to supplement those  it already had in Swaziland, Lesotho, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.    The ruling party of Ivory Coast at its annual congress last summer approved  opening diplomatic relations sometime in the next few months. And Madagascar  President Didier Ratsiraka, who as a young seaman was barred on racial grounds  from coming ashore at a South African port in 1962, has agreed to reciprocal  air flights and liberalized trade links with South Africa.    These events all mark an astonishing evolution in the atmosphere prevailing  until last year.    In the period of black independence, the only African government that  maintained consistent diplomatic relations with South Africa is Malawi, whose  autocratic and contrary President H. Kamuzu Banda has always contended that  despite their political differences with the white regime, African countries  are better off talking with Pretoria than ignoring it.    That's a viewpoint that may derive from Malawi's vulnerability to the policy  whims of neighboring South Africa, which financed the construction of a new  Malawi capital but also caused it losses of $50 million a year when Malawi's  rail access through Mozambique to Indian Ocean ports was destroyed in a civil  war between that country's government and South African-backed guerrillas.    But if top-level diplomatic relations with most black-ruled countries are still  far off, already the air seems to be seeping out of the anti-South Africa  balloon in many places.    In August, for instance, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, a stalwart foe of  apartheid whose country was home to leaders of the African National Congress  during their long years of exile from South Africa, lifted a decades-old ban on  Zambia's using South African ports for imports and exports. At the same time  Zambia moved to alleviate its critical fuel shortage by importing South African  gasoline.    ""As a result of what is now happening in South Africa, we have gained greater  respectability,"" says Neil van Heerden, South Africa's director general of  foreign affairs. The scene is set, he adds, ""for us to take up our role as an  important African country.""    There are potential benefits on both sides. South Africa stands to profit from  supplying goods and services to a market until now closed to it, except  informally.    Black African countries have less to sell to their southern neighbor, but they  could gain development aid and technical assistance to replace what may  disappear as Western donors turn more attention to Eastern Europe. They might  also gain something that has proven elusive for 30 years -- substantial outside  investment in their economies, this time from South African businesses looking  for new investment opportunities.    South Africans, for example, are among the bidders for one bank currently up  for sale in Madagascar.    The prospects of integrating Africa's largest and most powerful economy into a  region that otherwise accounts for less than 2% of all world trade has many  businessmen in Africa salivating over the prospects of getting lucrative agency  licenses to sell South African goods in their own countries.    ""The potential is enormous,"" says Edward V. K. Jaycox, the World Bank's  regional vice president for Africa. ""If this part of the world became  acceptable partners, it would be a real economic event, important on the world  scale.""    A commercial officer in a European embassy here opined, ""Any (African)  businessman worth his salt will look at it as worth his while to get down  there"" to line up distribution and joint-venture deals with South African  companies.    Many African businessmen have already braved travel restrictions and official  disapproval to visit South Africa. Among them is the head of Kenya Breweries,  who reportedly returned from his visit wide-eyed at the prospect of importing  South African brewing technology into his Tusker Beer plants.    With an economy that grows and manufactures many European-grade products, South  Africa could conceivably replace Europe and America as the chief source of  industrial and consumer items, according to many businessmen working in Africa.

In an interview in Tunis, where he is attending the  Organization of African Unity conference, Nzo confirmed that the  Cabinet had decided to provide humanitarian assistance in  Rwanda, but had not yet decided on the form it would take. The  decision, he said, might be influenced by proposals emanating  from the OAU conference, which might assign specific tasks to  certain member states. The Minister said the types of  assistance contemplated by South Africa included helping to ease  the burden imposed on Tanzania's resources by the influx of  thousands of refugees from Rwanda. This could include food and  medical aid.    While South Africa was not ready to contribute to any  international military force sent to enforce peace in Rwanda, it  would inevitably become involved in such operations in future  crises, he said. South Africa would, however, place much  greater emphasis on mediation, recognising that peace could not  be imposed from outside, as had been demonstrated in Somalia.    ""That would be the ideal -- for African countries themselves  to try to resolve their problems in an African way, which would  mean that mediators should come from African countries. We have  expert negotiators in our country who could very well be  deployed to assist in negotiations.""    Asked whether these negotiators might become involved in the  Angola dispute, Nzo said this might happen if the Angolans  wanted it. The recent upgrading of diplomatic relations between  South Africa and Angola enhanced the opportunity to discuss the  situation with Angolan government representatives. The contacts  would not be with the MPLA government alone, however. ""Unita  [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola] must not  be made to feel that sides are being taken because that could  produce an unfortunate result ...that would be  counter-productive.""    On the question of changing the nature and title of the  Frontline states now that confrontation with South Africa was no  longer necessary, Nzo said exchanges were taking place at the  OAU conference as a follow-up to the recent meeting of Frontline  leaders in Harare, where agreement was reached in principle to  the changes. Whatever body was set up in place of the Frontline  states would be structured to deal primarily with regional  co-operation on security matters. He believed that while the  grouping should still be confined to southern African countries,  it should be enlarged to bring in states like Swaziland and  Lesotho.    He said no policy had yet been worked out by the Government  on membership of or relations with the existing regional  economic groupings: the Southern African Customs Union, the  Southern African Development Community and the Preferential  Tariff Agreement grouping.    Expressing his appreciation for the warm welcome given to  South Africa at its first OAU conference, Nzo said he saw this  not as a honeymoon that would fade but as a beginning that had  to be consolidated. He rejected any concept of South Africa  inevitably dominating its neighbours. ""There must be relations  of mutual benefit all the time. We want from the beginning to  have relations based on trust, on total friendship.""    Nzo confirmed that President Mandela would visit Morocco on  his way to Tunisia for the OAU summit next week. The purpose  was to complete talks that could not be finalised during his  previous Moroccan visit.     "

Qian expressed appreciation of the efforts Ethiopia has made  for the settlement of the Somali crisis and the maintenance of  regional peace and stability.    He said the Chinese Government is greatly concerned over the  Somali problem and holds its final settlement is up to the  Somali people.    Africa is facing a complex situation, the Chinese  vice-premier said, adding two tendencies -- neglect Africa or  interfere in Africa's internal affairs -- should be prevented.    The international community should show concern over Africa,  help Africa, he stressed, saying if the political situation in  Africa is unstable and its economy continues worsening, peace  and development in the world cannot be truly achieved.    Qian said China has always been attaching an importance to  strengthening its relations with african countries.    ""China is a developing country with a limited strength, but  we always cherish a stand on Africa. That is not to neglect the  problems appearing in Africa and at the same time respect the  will of the African people,"" he added.    The two leaders also discussed the way of further  strengthening and developing bilateral relations, with Meles  saying Ethiopia welcomes Chinese businessmen to invest and  create enterprises in Ethiopia.    Qian promised the Chinese Government will encourage Chinese  businessmen to enhance exchange of contacts and cooperation with  their Ethiopian counterparts.    On the same occasion, Qian conveyed the greetings of Chinese  president Jiang Zemin to Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi.    The Chinese vice-premier and foreign minister arrived here  on  Tuesday morning for a two-day visit to Ethiopia.     "

The ministers of the Twelve, meeting in Council session,  adopted a whole series of measures intended to offer support to  the new government that will emerge from the elections on 26 and  28 April 1994. The promise of aid to South Africa is a  Community action falling under the heading of European foreign  policy.    From the outset, however, the EU specified that respect for  human rights and democracy were an essential element of  relations between the EU and South Africa.    First of all, the Twelve promise to work toward canceling UN  sanctions against Pretoria, which are still being imposed.    The current support program for the peaceful transition to  democracy in South Africa is continuing provisionally, and the  Union must continue to earmark the funds required for this  action, maintained the ministers. They recalled that they  intend to contribute mainly toward improving the standard of  living of the poorest sectors of the population.    As for long-term relations, the Twelve emphasized that they  do not consider South Africa as a developing country, but that  they are inclined to allow it to benefit from the same  commercial advantages as such countries. They also promised to  contribute toward the establishment and development of regional  cooperation between southeast African and Indian Ocean  countries. The EU is calling for mutual investments, encouraged  and guaranteed by various agreements. To this end, it will ask  the EIB (European Investment Bank) to extend its activities to  South Africa.    The Twelve said they were ready to collaborate in a large  number of areas, such as education and training, industry,  trade, telecommunications, research, and technology.    As soon as the new government takes office, the EU intends  to  support the establishment of political dialogue and encourage  the South African cabinet to work toward social justice and to  eliminate all forms of racial, political, religious, and  cultural discrimination.    The Twelve also confirmed that they wanted to hold an  international conference on 6 and 7 September 1994 in Berlin,  gathering together all the countries of southern Africa.     "

The federal cabinet decided to end the 19-year-old ban and  has instructed public and private institutions that obstacles no  longer existed for dealing with South Africa, they sa?d.    Diplomats said the cabinet decision to end the boyco?t would  pave the way for establishment of diplomatic ties between the  UAE and South Africa.    The Dubai-based daily AL-BAYAN said the cabinet decision  cancelled a 1975 federal law banning any form of dealing with  South Africa because of its former system of apartheid.    The decision coincides with Pretoria's attempts to enter the  Gulf market, which is dominated by Japan, western countries and  other industrial powers.    South Africa's drive has already produced results. Its trade  with the UAE surged to around 150 million dirhams (40.8 million  dollars) in 1993 from less than 20 million dirhams (5.4 million  dollars) in 1992.    Officials from both sides expect trade to grow steadily in  coming years given their large business potential.    ""South Africa enjoys great economic and trade potentials,""  the director of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry,  'Abd-al- Rahman al-Mutaywi, said after returning Saturday from a  business trip to Johannesburg.    He said South Africa planned another major trade exhibition  in Dubai in May following the success of its first Middle East  fair in 1992.    Officials said South Africa was still planning to open a  commercial office in the United Arab Emirate of Dubayy to boost  exports to Iran and the GCC states of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain,  Oman, Qatar, Kuwait and the UAE.    South Africa is also aiming at the region's growing arms  market and has participated in two international defence shows  in the UAE.     "

By SHARON BERNSTEIN      Claiming that the series ""South Africa Now"" is biased in favor of the African  National Congress, programmers at Los Angeles public-television station KCET  have decided not to carry the public-affairs program when its new season begins  in November.    The Committee on Media Integrity, a conservative media coalition, claimed  victory Friday for the decision. The group, led by David Horowitz, a former  Ramparts magazine editor who went on to co-author the book ""Destructive  Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,"" has been waging a letter-writing  campaign and threatening legal action against KCET Channel 28 for airing ""South  Africa Now"" and other programs that it claims have a leftist bias.    Horowitz, who said he is opposed to apartheid but also is opposed to the  African National Congress, said that he had had several meetings about ""South  Africa Now"" with Stephen Kulczycki, senior vice president and station manager  at KCET.    ""I felt that the show was posing as a news report, but it was really just doing  propaganda,"" Horowitz said.    Kulczycki denied Friday that pressure from Horowitz's group had anything to do  with his decision not to renew the series, which has been running on Sundays at  9 a.m. He said that ""South Africa Now,"" which is produced in New York by  Globalvision Inc. and is seen on 80 U.S. public-TV stations, gives only cursory  attention to views of liberal whites and blacks, as well as to the South  African government and others who differ with the policies of the African  National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela.

By SHARON BERNSTEIN      Claiming that the series ""South Africa Now"" is biased in favor of the African  National Congress, programmers at Los Angeles public-television station KCET  have decided not to carry the public-affairs program when its new season begins  in November.    The Committee on Media Integrity, a conservative media coalition, claimed  victory Friday for the decision. The group, led by David Horowitz, a former  Ramparts magazine editor who went on to co-author the book ""Destructive  Generation: Second Thoughts About the '60s,"" has been waging a letter-writing  campaign and threatening legal action against KCET Channel 28 for airing ""South  Africa Now"" and other programs that it claims have a leftist bias.    Horowitz, who said he is opposed to apartheid but also is opposed to the  African National Congress, said that he had had several meetings about ""South  Africa Now"" with Stephen Kulczycki, senior vice president and station manager  at KCET.    ""I felt that the show was posing as a news report, but it was really just doing  propaganda,"" Horowitz said.    Kulczycki denied Friday that pressure from Horowitz's group had anything to do  with his decision not to renew the series, which has been running on Sundays at  9 a.m. He said that ""South Africa Now,"" which is produced in New York by  Globalvision Inc. and is seen on 80 U.S. public-TV stations, gives only cursory  attention to views of liberal whites and blacks, as well as to the South  African government and others who differ with the policies of the African  National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela.    ""As time has gone by, it appears more clear that the main issue in South Africa  is not whether there will be apartheid, but what kind of anti-apartheid  government in South Africa would come into power,"" Kulczycki said.

AGENCY PREDICTS 6 MILLION CASES BY THE YEAR 2000. DEVELOPING  COUNTRIES ARE HARDEST HIT.      By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      The World Health Organization on Tuesday predicted a cumulative global total of  at least 6 million cases of AIDS by the year 2000, with ""an alarming rate"" of  increase of new infections in developing countries.    Also, 15 million to 20 million people around the world could be infected with  the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS by the year 2000 because of  the soaring rate of new infections in developing countries, WHO said in  updating its worldwide AIDS projections.    ""If the situation in Africa continues to increase and if we continue to see a  rapid rise of infections in Asia and Latin America, then I think these  estimates we're giving are minimum,"" Dr. Michael H. Merson, director of the WHO  global AIDS program, said in an interview.    The projections are more pessimistic than those of about a year ago. Although  WHO initially released similar figures at that time, they were then considered  middle-range estimates, rather than the lowest possible.    Six million to 8 million people worldwide -- or about one of every 400 adults  -- are now infected with HIV. Most of them ultimately will become ill ""unless  therapeutic drugs are developed soon,"" WHO said.    The international health organization said that it is ""very unlikely"" that the  global prevalence of AIDS infections will stabilize or level off for at least  several decades.    As of this year, about 60% of all global infections had resulted from  heterosexual intercourse. WHO predicted that by the year 2000, 75% to 80% of  all HIV infections will result from heterosexual intercourse.    In the United States, where there has been a cumulative total of more than  132,000 AIDS cases, the majority of cases have occurred among homosexual and  bisexual men.    However, WHO said that heterosexual transmission of AIDS infection is  increasing slowly in industrial nations, especially in urban areas with high  rates of other sexually transmitted diseases and intravenous drug abusers.    ""Large numbers of uninfected IV drug users remain in many areas, and explosive  spread might occur among them if they continue their risk behavior,"" WHO said.    In North America, WHO estimates, one in every 75 men is HIV infected. In South  America, the estimate is one in 125 men; in Western Europe, one in 200.    Among women, WHO estimated that one in 700 women in North America is infected;  in South America, one in 500 women; in Western Europe, one in 1,400. In Eastern  Europe, Asia and the Pacific region, there are about 50,000 infected women, or  one in 20,000, WHO said.    Saying ""it is clear that the global balance of HIV infections is rapidly  tipping toward the developing countries,"" WHO noted that in 1985 about half of  the world total of infections were in developing countries. Today, WHO said,  the developing world accounts for an estimated 66%, and the figure is expected  to reach 80% to 90% by the year 2010.    ""The world outlook is increasingly somber,"" Dr. June Osborn, a member of WHO's  Global Commission on AIDS, said in an interview. ""In particular, we've seen a  startling emergence of new HIV infections related to intravenous drug use and  subsequent sexual spread in Southeast Asia that reminds us of the flash-fire  potential everywhere when HIV and illicit drug use are combined.""    The current level of infection is ""most acute"" in sub-Saharan Africa, WHO said,  estimating that about 3.5 million people were HIV-infected by mid-1989. These  figures include 1.5 million to 2 million women. WHO estimated that one of every  50 adult men and women in sub-Saharan Africa is now infected with HIV.    Further, as of this year, about 200,000 HIV-infected infants had been born in  Africa, and by the end of the decade, ""an additional million or more may be  expected,"" WHO said.    As of mid-1990, more than 250,000 new cases of AIDS have been reported from  more than 150 countries, WHO said. But because of under-recognition,  under-reporting and delays in reporting, the health organization said that it  estimates that nearly 700,000 cases may have already occurred.

Direct investment in  South Africa has stagnated at around 2 billion German marks [DM]  since 1989. Martin Kraemer, manager of the Africa Association,  is content if German investors are able to keep their position  at all. Well-established companies, such as Bayer, BMW,  Hoechst, Mercedes, Siemens, or Volkswagen might manage a smooth  transition to the time after the elections. Yet, as many as 300  German companies, that is about half of all German investors in  Africa, are represented in South Africa, employing a total of  36,000 staff.    According to the Africa Association, the fact that German  exporters could maintain their business with the continent's  most important trading partner ""in spite of the reform process""  is a success. While German exports stagnated at DM3.27 billion,  German imports from South Africa declined by 18 percent, to  DM1.95 billion, last year. After sanctions were lifted, South  Africa increased its exports of gold, copper, manganese, and  other ores to the Far East, East Europe, and the Middle East.    The Federal Government, which will hold the European Union  [EU] presidency in the second half of 1994, is skeptical about  African National Congress politicians' attempts to join the Lome  Agreement with the EU. The accession process is too lengthy,  and the system for stabilizing raw materials prices would not  cope very well with the membership of raw-materials supplier  South Africa, Christian Democratic Party development expert  Volkmar Koehler said at the African Economic Day in Hamburg.  Also, membership of the threshold country would lower the  amount of aid for the total 69 poor countries in Africa, the  Caribbean, and the Pacific area (ACP). Not only would all ACP  and EU countries have to agree to membership, but it is also  doubtful whether South Africa would meet the criteria of a  developing country.     "

AFRICAN IMAGE GAINS FROM NAMIBIA REBELS' MISSTEP      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South African military intelligence detected a buildup of rebel forces across  the Namibian border with Angola back in January. South Africans monitored  guerrilla meetings, saw the arrival of fresh uniforms and heard talk of an  invasion to ""finally chase the Boers out.""    But when South African officials complained to the world, as they often do, few  believed them.    Just as South Africa had warned, though, the guerrilla buildup developed into a  major cross-border incursion by the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), beginning only hours after a U.N. independence plan went into effect  April 1.    SWAPO's violation of the peace accord shook the world's high regard for the  liberation movement. But, at the same time, it gave South Africa -- often  considered the chief destabilizing influence in southern Africa -- a rare  moment on the diplomatic high ground.    Long accustomed to international scorn, South Africa's white minority-led  government suddenly has found itself in the world's good graces. SWAPO, with  U.N. support, had battled for 24 years to end South African rule of this  territory, sometimes called South-West Africa. But, literally overnight, South  Africa's troops were fighting SWAPO with U.N. blessing. And, after some initial  skepticism, the United Nations and Western governments that are often critical  of South Africa began believing Pretoria's version of events here.    South African officials, in a smug, I-told-you-so mood, have jetted in and out  of Windhoek, capital of this vast territory, to bask in their new credibility.  Even though the fighting has diminished and SWAPO insurgents are said to be  crossing northward back to their refuge in Angola, South Africa has yet to tire  of reminding foreign journalists that South Africa abided by its agreement to  follow the U.N. plan for Namibian independence while SWAPO did not.    ""There is not a responsible government in the world today that does not know  exactly whatSWAPO has done,"" South Africa's foreign minister, Roelof F. (Pik)  Botha, said recently. ""We wish it had never occurred. If the result is that  SWAPO's leadership pays a heavy price for it, that was not of our doing.""    Any threat to SWAPO's image is welcome in Pretoria, where the country that has  governed Namibia for 74 years fears that a Marxist SWAPO government will come  to power in November's U.N.-monitored elections. Despite widespread  condemnation of SWAPO's invasion, the insurgent movement remains the probable  winner of Namibia's first free and fair elections.    SWAPO's political opponents, chief among them the multiracial, capitalistic  Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), have taken to the streets with a  well-funded campaign to discredit SWAPO.    Several hundred black Namibians wearing alliance T-shirts turned up this week  at a South African military base in the northern Namibia city of Oshakati --  SWAPO's political power base -- to protest the incursions.    The alliance supporters carried signs reading ""Don't Sabotage 435,"" referring  to the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, and ""SWAPO -- Don't Kill the Peace.""    Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's president, ""failed hopelessly in his attempt to take over  Namibia by force,"" said Barney Barnes, head of a small political party that  merged with Democratic Turnhalle this week. ""In the process, he annoyed the  whole international community.""      A Shifting Story    Nujoma first said his forces were already inside northern Namibia before the  peace process began, but few world leaders believed him. Later, Nujoma  acknowledged that some of his rebel forces did cross the border, but only to  turn themselves over to the U.N. peacekeeping troops. Now Nujoma has accused  South Africa of hiding its advance knowledge of the infiltration in order to  justify an attack on SWAPO and have an excuse to back out of the independence  process.    Many international leaders not accustomed to siding with South Africa admit  that they agree with Botha. And even SWAPO's most ardent supporters in Africa  have criticized Nujoma.    Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has provided sanctuary for the  rebels, said his country ""regrets that the SWAPO leadership could not exercise  total control over its guerrillas at the critical moment.""    Botha goes much further. ""I don't see how the SWAPO leadership could have been  so stupid,"" the foreign minister told viewers of state-run television recently.    But the insurgents' support among Namibians remains strong. Several thousand  SWAPO supporters turned out Sunday in a black township near Windhoek for a  memorial service for guerrillas killed in 10 days of conflict. The service was  for the 38 fighters that SWAPO says were killed, but Namibian security forces  say more than 275 guerrillas have actually died in the battles.    ""We are here to pay tribute to heroic Namibians who have lost their lives in  the north of our land,"" the Rev. Jackie Basson told the mourners. ""The  independence we have been fighting for for years is being threatened by  unprovoked attacks by South Africa.""    Botha has lately suggested that SWAPO's actions have made South Africa less  willing to negotiate with other liberation movements, such as the outlawed  African National Congress, the principal liberation movement in South Africa.    ""We have no more illusions,"" Botha said. ""This perfidy by SWAPO has dealt the  good and positive prospects of negotiation politics a blow. One doesn't know  anymore who one can believe.""    For all its newly charged rhetoric, though, South Africa has passed up several  opportunities to scuttle the peace process here.    ""They had their chance to sweep it off the table and they didn't,"" a political  analyst in Namibia said recently. ""That must mean they're serious.""

Sam Nujoma, SWAPO's president, ""failed hopelessly in his attempt to take over  Namibia by force,"" said Barney Barnes, head of a small political party that  merged with Democratic Turnhalle this week. ""In the process, he annoyed the  whole international community.""      A Shifting Story    Nujoma first said his forces were already inside northern Namibia before the  peace process began, but few world leaders believed him. Later, Nujoma  acknowledged that some of his rebel forces did cross the border, but only to  turn themselves over to the U.N. peacekeeping troops. Now Nujoma has accused  South Africa of hiding its advance knowledge of the infiltration in order to  justify an attack on SWAPO and have an excuse to back out of the independence  process.    Many international leaders not accustomed to siding with South Africa admit  that they agree with Botha. And even SWAPO's most ardent supporters in Africa  have criticized Nujoma.    Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has provided sanctuary for the  rebels, said his country ""regrets that the SWAPO leadership could not exercise  total control over its guerrillas at the critical moment.""    Botha goes much further. ""I don't see how the SWAPO leadership could have been  so stupid,"" the foreign minister told viewers of state-run television recently.    But the insurgents' support among Namibians remains strong. Several thousand  SWAPO supporters turned out Sunday in a black township near Windhoek for a  memorial service for guerrillas killed in 10 days of conflict. The service was  for the 38 fighters that SWAPO says were killed, but Namibian security forces  say more than 275 guerrillas have actually died in the battles.    ""We are here to pay tribute to heroic Namibians who have lost their lives in  the north of our land,"" the Rev. Jackie Basson told the mourners. ""The  independence we have been fighting for for years is being threatened by  unprovoked attacks by South Africa.""    Botha has lately suggested that SWAPO's actions have made South Africa less  willing to negotiate with other liberation movements, such as the outlawed  African National Congress, the principal liberation movement in South Africa.    ""We have no more illusions,"" Botha said. ""This perfidy by SWAPO has dealt the  good and positive prospects of negotiation politics a blow. One doesn't know  anymore who one can believe.""    For all its newly charged rhetoric, though, South Africa has passed up several  opportunities to scuttle the peace process here.    ""They had their chance to sweep it off the table and they didn't,"" a political  analyst in Namibia said recently. ""That must mean they're serious.""

The EU's Ministerial Council of Foreign Affairs said in a  statement: ""The Union intends to send a strong political signal  to the incoming government and to the South African population.""    The Council agreed in principle to include South Africa in  its general system of preferences (GSP) comprising low tariffs  on manufactured imports from developing countries.    The decision was the centrepiece of proposals for the rapid  deepening of economic and political relations with South Africa  pending the negotiation of a comprehensive new system of  political, trade and economic links.    A formal decision on the GSP issue is expected following the  EU's 10-year review of its GSP system in May, and consultations  with other developing countries linked to the EU in the Lome  trade-and-aid agreement.    The EU also agreed in principle to extend its ""rules of  origin"" to South Africa, which means that South African  components of goods partly manufactured in other countries of  the region would also benefit from low tariffs.    And the Council agreed to pursue schemes for promoting and  protecting foreign investments in South Africa, and to boost  cooperation in such areas as education, industry,  telecommunications, science and technology.    ""We want South Africa to become a motor of economic growth  in  southern Africa,"" an EU spokesman said, adding that the GSP  break would boost South African exports of manufactured and  high-tech goods.    The EU is South Africa's biggest trading partner, but most  of  its imports of South African products currently comprise raw  materials.    Trade between the two sides totalled ECU10.8 billion (12  billion dollars) over the first nine months of 1993, resulting  in a trade surplus of ECU2.59 billion (2.95 billion dollars) for  the EU.    The EU has already dismantled all economic sanctions against  South Africa, and Tuesday's decision is the first element of a  new era of EU-South African links to replace the frosty  relations of the apartheid years.    The EU Council also proposed to open negotiations for a  strong interim agreement with the new South African government  soon after the elections, linking comprehensive cooperation with  respect for democracy and human rights.    And it agreed to use its influence at the United Nations to  have lifted the last remaining sanctions against South Africa --  an embargo on arms sales and military cooperation.     "

""Sub-Saharan Africa has  low savings, low investment, falling per capita GDP and relies  heavily on foreign resources. This must change. The region has  exhausted its capacity to borrow external funds on market terms.  And concessional aid, already down from its peak, may fall even  more i? the years ahead,"" the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana quoted  the GCA's 1993 report as saying.    Armed conflict had stifled development, drained resources  and  impoverished many African countries, the GCA said. Even after  conflicts ended many countries had to undertake massive  reconstruction programmes to repatriate refugees, resettle  displaced persons and demobilise and re-integrate combatants.  ""The estimated 5.4 million refugees in Africa are evidence of  the suffering. Unable to lead reproductive lives in their own  countries, they burden host governments and the international  community.""    GCA executive director Boubakar Daiby-Outtara emphasised the  need for Africa to mobilise its own resources to compliment  those received from abroad. ""African countries should clearly  see the need to take charge of their own priorities.""     "

The Iranian Government, which sent four delegates to  supervise the national elections in South Africa, is waiting for  the announcement of the results of the South African elections,  in order on that basis to organize relations with the next  government in Pretoria.    Iran's political relations began with South Africa in 1349  [21 March 1970-20 March 1971]. In that year the governments at  that time in Iran and South Africa opened consulates in  Johannesburg and Tehran. Following that, economic relations  between the two countries also developed to the extent that 90  percent of the Pretoria regime's oil needs were met by Iran.  Several years later, with the participation of the Iran National  Oil Company, construction began on the [?Natruf] refinery in  South Africa. In addition to its participation in the  construction of this refinery, at the outset Iran also owned  17.5 percent of its shares. The remainder of the refinery's  shares were owned by the French [?Gugal] company, with 30  percent, and the South African SASOL [South African Coal, Oil  and Gas Corporation] company, with 52.5 percent.    In the beginning this refinery's capacity was 50,000 barrels  per day, and after a time it increased to 78,000 barrels. Thus  Iran's shares in the Natruf refinery in 1974 increased from 17.5  percent to 33.3 percent of the entire refinery.    Based on a separate contract signed between the Iran  National  Oil Company and South African officials, the Iranian side was  required to supply 70 percent of the oil needed by the Natruf.  Based on this contract, Iran was required to deliver 25 million  tons of crude oil to South Africa over a 15-year period. By the  time of the triumph of the Islamic revolution, 12 million tons  of crude oil had been delivered to this country.    In an interview with KEYHAN-E HAVA'I, an expert on foreign  affairs discussed the fall of the apartheid regime in South  Africa. He said: Since the Natruf Oil Refinery was designed  based on the characteristics of Iran's oil and Iran cut off its  oil exports to South Africa after the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, the Natruf Refinery suffered losses that were such  that several years later the Government of Iran sold its shares  to the South African SASOL company to recover its losses and  prevent further losses. Nevertheless, if the South African  elections produce a democratic government, the Iranian  Government can resume its relations with this country.    These experts added: In addition, the former Iranian  regime's  oil cooperation with the apartheid government and South Africa  made Iran the Pretoria regime's second-largest trading partner  after Israel.    The governments of the time in Iran and South Africa  cooperated on mining matters and in the extraction of uranium.  Likewise, companies affiliated with the private sector in the  two countries were active importing and exporting and selling  Iran's dried fruits and South Africa's industrial materials.     "

A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry today said  Egypt's  decision to establish diplomatic relations with South Africa  conforms to Egypt's position, which supported all stages of the  democratic movement and the annihilation of apartheid in South  Africa. These movements began in 1989 and culminated with the  democratic nonracial elections in April 1994. In the election,  every citizen was able to exercise his right to chose his  representative within the context of freedom, equality, and  justice, thus ending the system of apartheid.     "

0,FT941-15081 ,"FT941-15081 _AN-EAQCKAEGFT 940117   FT  17 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets This Week: A growing trend towards Africa - The Emerging Investor      By PHILIP GAWITH   Will 1994 be Africa's year, the year in which international investors finally get the 'virgin' continent into their sights? Certainly there is a growing body of opinion, both in Africa and beyond, that believes this will be the case. Indeed, it can be argued that this trend is already under way. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange foreigners were prominent throughout 1993, initially in the gold and bond markets and later as buyers of industrial stocks too. Figures supplied by Barings Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthening in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. They have also been evident in Botswana, while foreign buying on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange between late June and December was enough to cause the Industrial index to more than double. Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, the London-based adviser to many of the world's largest emerging market funds, is one who believes that the continent's time has come. 'Looking at Africa is very much at the top of their (emerging market funds) agenda. There is a terrific willingness to believe in the African story.' This can be traced to three important structural changes. Clearly the catalytic event has been South Africa's rehabilitation as a respectable investment destination. This has caused great excitement in the US and the re-examination of the JSE has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of other regional markets. Without the JSE, it would be doubtful how much attention emerging market investors would devote to the other markets. Since Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, called for an end to financial sanctions against South Africa in September, there has been a veritable stampede of US visitors to Johannesburg. Significant investment flows have followed and the outlook for 1994 appears even more cheery. Mr Morland reckons that the first half of 1994 will see at least five South Africa or Southern Africa funds launched. Taken together with other African funds and country funds, he believes there will be at least 10 funds channelling money into South Africa next year. The second important change concerns Africa itself. If the 1960s saw the political winds of change blow through the continent, then the 1990s are witnessing some equivalent economic changes as governments increasingly embrace market economics after costly socialist experiments. The catalyst for these changes has been the end of the cold war, meaning no more eastern European bloc hand-outs, and the inexorable impoverishment of African economies through deteriorating terms of trade and poor economic management. Now, as Mr Morland comments, 'You either eat at the IMF's table, or you don't eat at all.' This has led to a huge shift in economic orientation, including a more favourable outlook towards equity markets. In 1983, for example, Mr Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwe finance minister, was able to extravagantly denounce the ZSE as 'the prostitute of the economy'. Ten years later the same Mr Chidzero used his budget to introduce reforms aimed at encouraging the development of the ZSE: foreign investors being allowed to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE; reductions in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The final change concerns the burgeoning emerging market movement, particularly in the US, with an increasing portion of assets earmarked for emerging markets and offshore investment. A November survey by the US firm Kleiman International Consultants found that international institutional investment in emerging markets had risen by 3 per cent to 13 per cent of international funds in 1993, with allocation over the past five years rising more than five-fold. Even within this trend, Africa has a lot of catching up to do. A recent survey by Micropal of global emerging market funds found that the 54 largest of these funds had invested only about Dollars 40m out of Dollars 11.5bn (0.35 per cent). Clearly, if Africa in general and South Africa in particular becomes a focus for emerging market funds, then this in itself will be good reason to be invested there. To this rosy scenario, however, some cautionary caveats about Africa must be entered. Firstly, even by emerging market standards, Africa is an unusual beast. On the one hand, the JSE with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 105bn is much larger than the Dollars 20-Dollars 60bn average for emerging markets. On the other hand, most of the other African markets - Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (with Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania all on the point of opening) - are minuscule. A recent survey by Mr Michel ZhuParris of Morgan Stanley Asset Management found that between them Africa's newly emerging markets had only 12 liquid stocks with market capitalisations greater than Dollars 100m (with seven of these trading in Morocco). Second, although Africa is fairly cheap compared with many world markets, it has been cheap for a long time and for good reason. A major factor here is that investors are, with the exception of the Botswana pula, investing in very weak, devaluing currencies. Another problem is that the markets are shallow, illiquid and small. Also, in some cases, not the JSE, there is a dearth of domestic investors to piggyback on which can cause liquidity problems. Mr Mark Tunmer, chairman of the ZSE, comments: 'Our big problem is that we've got all the demand but nothing to sell.' He reckons that if the ZSE had been able to satisfy demand, foreign flows would have been four to five times larger. This problem has also affected the JSE, where buyers have had to get used to the idea that fulfilling a big order can take more than a week. These liquidity problems should, however, ease over time. If markets do enjoy a bull run this will stimulate new issues and rights issues, thereby increasing the amount of stock in circulation. A further factor to consider is that African markets are much more dependent on commodity prices and politicians than many other emerging markets. Investors not fully aware of developments could well burn their fingers. On the commodity front, developments are good. Important commodities like gold, cocoa and coffee have broken out of long bear cycles. The politicians may be behaving better, but in some cases the depth of commitment to financial discipline and good government remains to be tested. In the final analysis, what happens in South Africa will probably determine the extent to which other regional markets flourish.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Friday      Week on week change Stock                    Country      close          Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)     Brazil       0.02           0.01     67.6 Eczacibasi Ilac           Turkey       1.11           0.38     53.2 Kordosa                   Turkey       0.98           0.32     49.3 Banco Itau (Pfd)          Brazil       0.30           0.09     47.4 Alarko Holding            Turkey       2.44           0.76     45.4 Eczacibasi Yatirim        Turkey       0.95           0.26     38.9 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)      Brazil       0.02           0.01     36.9 Arcelik                   Turkey       1.90           0.42     28.4 Turk Demir Dokum          Turkey       1.52           0.29     23.3 Brisa                     Turkey       2.22           0.41     22.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

[Begin Robaina recording] (?The fact that) it is a meeting  with the continent that most contributes a presence of  supporting votes in whatever international battle Cuba wages, I  think also gives it special significance.    I would say that it does not have as much significance --  regarding economic and trade possibilities -- as a tour of the  area in which we live might have, (?because of the great)  geographical distance that separates us; but I think that the  interests that we have in common with Africa have never been  tainted by purely commercial aspects, aspects of profitability  and business. Rather, all the contrary. I would say that it is a  tour that, above all, has a great deal to do with values and  traditions; and, of course, possibilities for exchanges are not  lacking, possibilities for compensated collaboration, a type of  exchange which already exists in several of those countries.[end  recording]    This tour is part of a diplomatic offensive for the purpose  of explaining Cuba's situation and its plans for overcoming the  current difficulties.

Mr. Reilly explained that as South Africa has the largest  population of the most productive ostriches left in Africa, it  has banned the export of its ostriches which are most wanted  overseas, in order to conserve and build up South Africa's  ostrich population. The fact that Namibia's ostrich industry has  been virtually brought to a standstill by uncontrolled exporting  and smuggling of the birds, and the ban on exporting (?the  birds) by South Africa, have increased the value and demand for  ostriches in overseas markets, prompting smugglers and  racketeers to move into the multimillion dollar industry.    Swaziland, however, said Mr. Reilly, does not want to be  used  in a racket which could damage its own ostrich industry, as well  as the protected ostrich industry of its neighbor, South Africa.

On the eve of his departure from Port Louis,  Qian Qichan discussed the situation in Africa and China's  African policy in an interview with XINHUA reporters.    Qian Qichen said: During the current African tour, he has  been deeply impressed by the African people's new sense of  awakening sparked by drastic changes in the international  situation. Many African countries, while seeking economic  development, have focused their attention on safeguarding  national stability and at the same time, strengthened regional  cooperation. Noting the establishment of security mechanisms by  OAU and the breakthrough achieved in peace in South Africa, he  pointed out that the struggle against foreign intervention and  for national independence and sovereignty is making headway. In  short, Africa is facing challenges as well as historic  opportunities and is not without hopes, he added.    He said: Under the new situation brought about by the end of  the Cold War, regions are interrelated in their endeavor for  peace and various countries have become more and more  interdependent on each other in economy. World peace is  inseparable from Africa's stability; and an underdeveloped  African economy is not conducive to the global economic  prosperity. For this reason, the international community should  show concern for Africa, and the developed nations are  duty-bound to help the African countries. Africa needs  attention, not indifference; it needs help, not intervention.    Discussing China's African policy, Qian Qichen emphasized:  To strengthen unity and cooperation with the African and other  developing countries is the basis of China's foreign policy.  China shares much common ground with the African countries as  far as the international and regional situations are concerned.  China wholly respects the social system and development mode  chosen by the African countries in light of their national  conditions, and firmly supports the African countries' struggle  to safeguard national independence and sovereignty. We support  the African countries' efforts to ensure internal unity, to  develop economy, and to improve the people's livelihood; and we  also support the series of rational proposals by African  countries for reducing and exempting debts, protecting economic  interests, and strengthening South-South cooperation and  South-North dialogue.    On China's economic and trade relations with African, Qian  Qichen said: China's economic cooperation with the African  countries symbolizes the spirit of mutual benefit and assistance  and common development. He added that although China's  assistance to African countries is limited, it is sincere and  without any political strings attached.    He pointed out: Amidst constant changes in the international  and African scenes, the friendship between China and Africa has  withstood tests of history and become more solid. China will  never forget Africa's profound sentiments of friendship in times  of needs. He reiterated that regardless of changes in the  international and African situations, China will never alter its  principle of developing unity and cooperation with the African  countries. We deeply believe that our friendship with Africa  will definitely continue to grow and strengthen in the days and  years to come; and the lasting, stable, and mutually  beneficially friendship and cooperation between China and Africa  will further solidify and develop.

As he was leaving  for South Africa to take part in the inauguration ceremony,  Buwayz clarified that Lebanon's relations with this country have  been normal and natural since it eliminated racism. However,  the application of this decision requires some time. We have  this report from our colleague Darwish 'Ammar from Beirut  airport:    [Begin recording] ['Ammar] Mr. Buwayz, you leave today for  South Africa to take part in President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration ceremony. What would you like to say on this  occasion with regard to Lebanon's participation in this ceremony?    [Buwayz] Of course, the election and inauguration of  President Mandela after the historic reforms in South Africa are  considered an international, nay, even historic event. This is  so because of the developments that have taken place there and  also because of the effects of this development on the political  and humanitarian level. By this I mean the cancellation of  racial discrimination and openness toward democracy and freedom.  There is no doubt that Lebanon should not stay away from this  event. It should not be kept away from the significance of this  event, both from the aspect of democracy, freedom, and  coexistence, and from the aspect of the extensive historic and  ancient Lebanese presence in South Africa, where there is a  large Lebanese community.    Proceeding from this, the visit on this occasion acquires a  special character. Therefore, Lebanon had to attend this  international celebration.    ['Ammar] When will the Arab League's resolution on ending  the boycott of South Africa come into effect in Lebanon?    [Buwayz] The resolution to cancel the boycott is a decision  that was made in the Arab League during the last session over a  month ago. The Lebanese Council of Ministers applied this  resolution in the session before last by canceling all aspects  of the political, economic, and trade boycott. Thus, relations  now between Lebanon and South Africa are natural and very normal.    ['Ammar] Will there be diplomatic representation between the  two countries?    [Buwayz] We now have a general consulate there. We have  made the decision to normalize diplomatic relations. Of course,  the implementation of this decision requires some material and  financial support which might not be available immediately.    ['Ammar] On the sidelines of the visit to South Africa, will  you hold meetings with the participants in the inauguration  ceremony such as representatives of various countries taking  part in the ceremony?    [Buwayz] As with every international meeting of this  caliber, the celebration will include a large number of heads of  state, prime ministers, and foreign ministers. This event might  provide the opportunity for side meetings with some officials.    ['Ammar] During your stopover in Paris, will you hold talks  and meetings in the French capital?

0,FT943-806 ,"FT943-806 _AN-EI0DNAGOFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (3): S Africa may emerge as rival - A new offshore business sector      By TONY HAWKINS   Abolition of exchange controls and the deregulation of the foreign exchange and money markets in the 1994 budget are crucial steps forward in the country's efforts to establish a strong offshore business sector. Most of the island's exchange controls were dismantled during the 1980s, but it was only in this year's budget that Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, sealed the process by lifting the remaining 5 per cent capital transfer tax and removing the final obstacle to full exchange rate convertibility. At the same time, he announced that the Bank of Mauritius would become a market player rather than the market maker in the foreign exchange market. In effect, this means that the central bank 'indicates' a central rate for the rupee each day, intervening in the market when necessary by buying and selling dollars. More important perhaps the liberalisation of the domestic money markets. Bank Rate, previously changed at intervals of one year or even longer, is now tied to the Treasury Bill rate - 1 per cent above the average bill auction rate. To increase competitiveness, the liquid assets ratio applied to commercial banks and the prescribed assets ratio for insurance companies are to be phased out. This means the government will have to compete for funds with private sector fundraisers and the parastatals. Mr Sithanen hopes that this will lead to an active secondary market for government paper, allowing the central bank to conduct open market operations more effectively. These measures have had two main impacts in the markets: interest rates have firmed in line with the minister's stated intention of tightening monetary policy to bring down inflation from 9.5 per cent in the 1993-94 fiscal year to 5 per cent next year. Portfolio management opportunities are changing, with financial institutions and individual investors offered a wider menu of increasingly market-determined options. Both developments will help the drive to establish Mauritius as an efficient offshore business centre. Mauritius needs to move quickly given the probable emergence of South Africa as a rival centre, as and when Pretoria eliminates its exchange controls. Already there is talk of Durban being developed as a free port, which would undermine the Mauritius initiative on that front, and while the South Africans are unlikely to push the offshore business option as such, the reality is that - political stability permitting - Johannesburg is set to become the regional business hub. Nonetheless, Mauritius does have regional competitive advantage. It is the only Indian Ocean offshore business centre; it has cultural and language advantages South Africa cannot match. An impressive battery of double-taxation agreements is encouraging financial and marketing companies to set up shop on the island. The double-taxation agreement with India means that companies investing there can do so via Mauritius, avoiding capital gains tax in the process. Where it owns at least 10 per cent of an Indian company, a Mauritian offshore company pays a withholding tax on dividends of only 5 per cent, instead of the normal 20 per cent. The offshore banking venture has done better than forecast. By mid-1994, seven banks - Barclays, Banque Nationale de Paris Internationale, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, Bank of Baroda, State Bank International, Edmond de Rothschild and Banque Internationale des Mascareignes - had assets of Dollars 400m. Growth slowed from Dollars 125m in 1992-93 to Dollars 75m in the past year. The two biggest players - on an asset basis - were Barclays and State Bank International, a joint venture between the government-owned State Commercial Bank and the State Bank of India. However, with no new participants on the horizon, some bankers detect a change of emphasis with offshore banking increasingly seen as an ancillary operation, feeding upon and contributing to the growth of a broader offshore business centre encompassing the freeport, international investment institutions and global warehousing. The growth record here is impressive, especially when set against sluggish growth on the part of the offshore banks. Two years ago, just 10 were registered offshore companies, increasing to 225 in mid-1993 and more than 1,000 by last month, including 21 investment funds with an asset base of more than Dollars 1.7bn. Three main factors explain this explosive growth. First, there are the attractive incentives offered to companies that qualify for offshore status  -zero taxation of profits earned in offshore operations, free profit repatriation, concessionary personal tax arrangements for expatriate staff at half normal tax rates, no withholding taxes on interest and dividends and no capital gains tax. The second factor is the liberalisation and deregulation of the Mauritian economy and especially its financial sector, while the third is liberalisation elsewhere, especially in India and China, but also in parts of Africa. Offshore business is unlikely to match the EPZ's role as an engine of growth for the rest of this century. But the fact that it has performed so impressively has bodes well for the future. But in taking this road, Mauritius will run into increasingly fierce competition from a first world that is anxious and determined to protect its jobs and earnings from such service activities.

In a statement issued after a meeting in London with President F W de Klerk, Mr Major said South Africa was 'firmly on the road towards full, non-racial democracy'. 'The progress made within South Africa has opened the way for her to take her place in the international community,' he said.

South Africa became a republic and withdrew from the Commonwealth in 1961. Mr de Klerk arrived in Britain earlier in the day from Washington, where he called for international financial aid and corporate investment to develop fully South Africa's natural resources and help move the country toward a multiracial democracy. Mr Major backed Mr de Klerk's call for investment, saying: 'We shall support lending by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to South Africa.

The way to unlock the potential of South Africa's complex multi-ethnic and linguistic society will be via a federal structure. We say such a federation must ensure strong regional freedoms, simply to survive, with power flowing from the bottom up, not from the top down. Bophuthatswana will play a key role. Your Johannesburg correspondent, Patti Waldmeir, gave a useful summary (February 2) of Bophuthatswana's prospects in the 'new South Africa'. Waldmeir points out that economic growth 'has exceeded that in almost every other independent African country', adding, 'on a continent which scarcely distinguishes itself by the quality of economic management, Bophuthatswana clearly excels'. Our inward investors like Pilkington, ICI, BMW, Siemens and a large active community of skilled foreigners speaks for itself. Standard and Poor's on Wall Street has given us its top three-star credit rating - a rare achievement in the developing world. Government revenues have doubled every six years, no less, with rates of taxation coming down. On the political front, President Mangope's elected government has insisted on the right of individuals to decide their own future at the ballot box and not to be coerced by intimidation into supporting ANC 'liberation' politics. The Tswanas have a lot to lose from reincorporation into South Africa, not only in material terms, as your correspondent observed, but quite possibly in political terms too. To them, 'freedom for the people' rhetoric has a hollow ring, since they've lived in their own non-racial democracy for over 15 years. Like their Tswana relatives in Botswana, this is one of the few true democratic societies in Africa. The ANC's none-too-subtle political agenda in Bophuthatswana has been equally clear: to destabilise all official institutions by means of intimidation, violence and arson. The objective: to bring the authorities 'to their knees' (in their words).

Over the last several decades, it has  successively invested several billion yuan in building,  renovating, and expanding a number of prison facilities,  enabling each inmate to occupy an average of more than 5 square  meters in cell floor space.    The food allowance of inmates across the country has  increased step by step, approaching the average living standards  of local residents. Despite the limited food allowance,  Shanghai prison prepares nutritious food for inmates and ensures  enough good food for them. Furthermore, prisons in various  localities have Muslim kitchens for Islamic inmates.    In China's prisons today, the inmates enjoy not only the  basic right of subsistence but also the right to education. The  reform- through-labor institutions educate inmates, with courses  ranging from literacy classes to junior middle school education.  To date, the reform-through-labor institutions across the  country have run more than 12,000 educational classes. Some  1.15 million inmates have graduated from those classes and  received diplomas. The institutions have also run job skill  training classes so that inmates can earn their own living after  leaving prison and return to society. So far, 810,000 inmates  have received job skill certificates.    A nationwide election for new leading bodies at county and  township levels was held in 1993. On 25 December, some 1,200  inmates in Wuhan city, Hubei, who have not been deprived of  political rights cast their votes according to the law during  those elections.

Fidel discussed possible Cuba-South Africa  ties, and Mandela's historic victory.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Earlier this  month,  an ANC [African National Congress] representative discussed the  preceding events, and explained that once Nelson Mandela was  inaugurated, South Africa would proceed to establish diplomatic  relations with Cuba. That is their intent. They even included  this in a document known as the New South Africa Foreign Policy  Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] [Words indistinct] of our relations with Mandela,  the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We have had  close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we are  family. Regarding foreign relations [words indistinct]  conditions, the closer our friendship with a country, the less  we ask to establish ties. We allow circumstances and the  appropriate moment to determine the establishment of ties to  occur. In the special case of South Africa at this time, we  could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son. We  have  not pressed the issue of formal ties, however. I believe that  perhaps tomorrow, it will be brought up in the talks with the  foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with the  foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps, he will bring this up and ties will be established  immediately. We will not bring it up however. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up like a demand or as a  request from us.    It seems something, however, [word indistinct] that those  ties will be established quickly because there are few countries  with whom we have stronger ties in common -- kinship and  fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I did not speak with  ministers from other countries. We talked like old relatives. I  am convinced all of them want the quick establishment of ties,  but out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    [Reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and South Africa  had great differences because of Angola. Did you ever think  then, or later, that you would be here today in the former  capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South African nations. We have  to return to its history. For specific reasons, strong clashes  took place. Now, however, there is a new South Africa in which  such clashes no longer exist, just peace, harmony, respect, and  affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. [Words indistinct] the independence of Angola. We were  in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning of intervention by  foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our support -- for 15  years. So many things happened. We did not have a strong  presence, but it was strong enough because we could not, nor did  it depend on us alone, to attain a position was the problem.  [sentence as heard]    In Angola, we fought with the greatest selflessness. The  rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would said that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted, difficult but not through our fault. Cuba fulfilled  its duty. Cuba contributed to solve the highly difficult  problems that arose. I do not want to criticize anyone. I  believe today is not a day to criticize. Perhaps history will  record this.

Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, said before his final meeting with the Russians yesterday that his department was 'very close' to an agreement on the issue, and that he hoped to have a package to offer President Clinton soon. Mr Bill Clinton and Russia's President Boris Yelstin will meet for a summit on April 4 and trade groups believe Mr Clinton will offer a solution to Russia's grain credits problems at that meeting. Mr Glenn Whiteman, deputy assistant administrator of the US Department of Agriculture's export credit programmes, said the solution would not include the resumption of commercial credits, which is what Russian officials have requested. Russia has defaulted on Dollars 415.5m in US-backed commercial grain loans, with Dollars 240.3m more due this month. US grain sales to Russia have stalled because of the credit problems. While Russia objects to the stigma attached to receiving food aid, Mr Whiteman said those were the programmes under consideration. However, any food donation programme tapped for Russia will require legislation to lift the Dollars 30m cap on what the USDA can pay to ship donated commodities in a single fiscal year. US humanitarian shipments of food to Africa and eastern Europe this year have already reached that level. Russia will either have to come up with hard currency to pay the freight for grain shipments, or the USDA will have to seek and exemption. Since US law requires 75 per cent of US food aid to be shipped on US-registered vessels, Russia would have to pay higher freight rates than on commercial shipments. Mr Dan Basse, a commodities analyst for the consulting group AgResouces, estimates that the cargo preference requirement would bring freight costs for shipping Dollars 1bn of US-donated grain to about Dollars 400m. Money to buy donated commodities is also running short. Two of the three funding sources for the 'food for progress' programme were nearly exhausted, Mr Whiteman said.

He added that Filipino businessmen can also use South Africa  as an entry point for exports to central African countries,  adding that Filipino exporters can already go into  oleochemicals, garments, electronics, and software.    South Africa can then ship in its exports of steel, coal,  phosphate rock, and capital equipment.    Moreover, the lifting of the trade embargo would also mean  the flow of South African investments into the country, said Mr.  Alcantara. [passage omitted]     "

The sources, with  whom AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT spoke in European capitals, say that Iraq  has sent secret missions to South Africa to achieve the  following five main objectives:    1. Purchase of blueprints of a new type of artillery shells  not yet produced worldwide. They are the 210-mm giant shells.  Dr. Gerald Paul (who was later assassinated) drew up the main  design of the shell and the Iraqi branch of Dr. Paul's company  coordinated with the company's branch in South Africa for that  purpose.    2. Reach agreement with an arms establishment in South  Africa to act as intermediary between Iraq and world companies  (mainly American and British) for the procurement of extremely  advanced equipment for checking missiles after they are filled  with explosives. Such missiles include the Scud missiles and  heavy artillery shells. British, American, and other companies  were not permitted to export such sophisticated devices to a  state like Iraq. It should be noted that the effectiveness of  missiles and projectiles depends basically on the use of that  kind of device. The sources said that Iraq did in fact get some  offers through South Africa for the purchase of missile testing  equipment.    3. The third aim of the Iraqi contacts with South Africa has  been fully achieved. Baghdad has been able to purchase a  complete factory for the manufacture of 130-155 mm artillery  shells.    4. The sources told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the fourth aim  has been the training of technicians and engineers. The sources  said that quite a few Iraqis have received training in South  Africa. Travel from Iraq to Johannesburg via Frankfurt and  London was under assumed names. According to the sources, the  visas were issued for ""the crescent state,"" the expression used  in official correspondence.    5. The fifth aim has been exploratory research on uranium in  South Africa [as published]. The sources said that Baghdad had  indeed received some offers in this connection.     "

That all state institutions, industrial, commercial,  financial, and transport enterprises, banks, and private  individuals under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation  shall proceed from the fact that the restrictions established as  of 1962 by the UN General Assembly on relations with the  Republic of South Africa in the political, economic, financial,  scientific and technological, cultural, sports, and other fields  are canceled.    2. That the abolition of the restrictions specified in  Clause  1 of this decree shall not extend to military and  military-technical cooperation prohibited by current decisions  of the UN Security Council.    [Signed] O. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation    [End box]    ""Russia, as distinct from the United States, where the 1986  Anti-Apartheid Act has been in operation, never adopted  independent decisions restricting trade relations between the  two countries--it subscribed to the sanctions imposed against  South Africa by the United Nations,"" was how Leonid Safonov,  chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry Africa Desk, commented to  KOMMERSANT on the title of the Council of Ministers' decree.  Nonetheless, it is well known that (aside from the sanctions)  trade with South Africa in Soviet times was held back by one  further essential factor--ideology: relations were maintained  merely with the ANC, the opposition at that time, and its  leader, Nelson Mandela.    Now both the ideological and economic restrictions have been  lifted. But Boris Kolokolov, deputy minister of foreign affairs  of Russia, specified in a conversation with a KOMMERSANT  correspondent that together with the restrictions on arms  supplies, the embargo on trade with South Africa in oil and  petroleum products imposed by the UN Security Council in 1977  remains in force also. It is expected that all restrictions will  be abolished only after the first free elections have been held  in South Africa, a black and white government of national trust  created, and a constitution adopted, that is, not before May  1994.    It should be observed for fairness' sake that trade between  Russia and South Africa, in spite of the international  sanctions, has been conducted, nonetheless, and particularly  actively in recent years. It is interesting here that the  information on the extent of bilateral trade made available to  KOMMERSANT by Russian and South African departments differs  considerably. According to data of the Russian side (the  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and the Trade and  Industry Chamber of Russia), commodity turnover in the past year  was not in excess of $800,000, with the significant  preponderance of Russian exports ($500,000), what is more. South  African statistics, meanwhile, put reciprocal commodity turnover  in the first half of 1993 alone at $100 million.    Russian specialists see as the reason for this disagreement  in the data the fact that South Africa's statistics record  contacts at all levels--as distinct from the Russian statistics,  which only take account in practice of deals between major  (primarily state-owned) companies. Indeed, ""unclassified  commodities"" in fact representing nothing other than small-scale  wholesale consignments of wine (of excellent quality, in  experts' estimation) and a variety of consumer goods, costly and  not so costly, and not necessarily manufactured in South Africa,  what is more, account in the South African statistical summary  for a large part of the trade turnover--$80 million.    In the trade in ""classified"" commodities, on the other hand,  imports into Russia of products of agriculture and food industry  (approximately $3.5 million), textiles and wool ($7 million) and  electronic equipment and precision instruments ($370,000)  accounted for the bulk of these. In addition, a pronounced place  in trade is occupied by products of chemical industry (imports  from South Africa, $290,000; exports, $80,000).    Civil servants from the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations of Russia and the South African Embassy believe that  the very modest amounts of commodity exchange do not correspond  to the two countries' possibilities and interests. As Leonid  Safonov put it, ""One has the impression that Russian  entrepreneurs' ideas of Africa are shaped on the basis of the  novels of Louis Boussenard."" Meanwhile, according to him, not so  much merchandise as unique technology could represent the main  interest in South Africa for the Russian side. The knowhow of  the Sasol firm, for example, permitting the production of liquid  fuel from coal. It is this technology that under the conditions  of the embargo on oil supplies has enabled South Africa to  provide for 70 percent of the country's liquid fuel  requirements. The technology of South African mining companies  permits mining operations in very deep mines--up to 5 km. Many  of South Africa's medical developments are assessed as being far  above those of America and Europe. As we know, it was in South  Africa that the world's first human heart transplant operation  was performed, almost entirely with local equipment, what is  more.    In turn, as specialists of the Russian Trade and Industry  Chamber believe, national entrepreneurs also have things to  offer contracting parties in South Africa. According to  information from the Trade and Industry Chamber, the well-known  South African firms Strategic Material Supplies, Balmoral,  Feninx Steel, and Development Resource Group have given the  Russian side their requests for structural and high-alloy  stainless steel, pig iron, hot-rolled sheet steel, and billets  for rolled products. The firms Ace, P.B. International, Latitude  Links, Plumb Contracts, and Bregowa are interested in supplies  from Russia (and, possibly, other CIS countries) of cathode  copper, tungsten, aluminum, zinc, titanium, magnesium, electric  cable, and wire. Through the mediation of the Trade and Industry  Chamber office in Pretoria, they have established direct  contacts with the Tsvetmeteksport and Sovkabel all-Russia  joint-stock companies, the Inferkom group, and the  Zarubezhtsvetmet VAP [expansion unknown], and, according to  KOMMERSANT information, precontract agreements have already been  concluded. Interest is being shown in South Africa in Russian  cement also.    In addition, the Trade and Industry Chamber office has  reached agreement on the sale via the Rusaf Trading, MANNCONN,  Cinofoto, and Midas firms of test consignments of motorcycles,  Krasnogorskiy Plant cameras, experimental Aviatika airplane  models, and Vikhr boat engines, and also 3 million meters of  viscose fabric. As the Trade and Industry Chamber observed, the  prospects of supplies to South Africa of aviation equipment on  leasing terms and the creation of a system of its maintenance  are considered quite good, and there are opportunities for the  joint creation of a system of passenger shuttle helicopter  routes.    Purchases of tropical fruit and animal husbandry products  (which are not inferior in terms of quality to their American  and Australian counterparts, but which are cheaper) could be of  interest in South Africa to Russian importers.    Specialists of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations  advise entrepreneurs to think seriously of consolidating on the  South African market to consider the quite complex domestic  political situation in this country. Despite the fact that  President De Klerk and the leaders of the ANC are endeavoring to  avoid civil war, both white and black extremism is a reality,  nonetheless. And even after the elections on 27 April 1994 and  the formation of a coalition government, racial conflicts cannot  be ruled out. It would thus be advisable to take account of the  political instability factor when concluding contracts--and,  accordingly, stipulating the parties' responsibility in the  event of drastic changes in the political situation.    In addition, it is essential to take account also of the  following fact. An agreement on trade and economic cooperation  has been concluded between Moscow and Pretoria which proclaims  the principle of most-favored-nation status in trade. It was  signed on 22 October, that is, before the Council of Ministers'  adoption even of the decree on measures in connection with the  abolition of sanctions in respect to South Africa. But the  cooperation agreement is of a framework nature, that is, it  describes merely the most general principles of mutual  relations. Two documents of fundamental importance for the  development of business--on the protection of investments and  the avoidance of dual taxation--have yet to be signed. Mutual  contacts at expert level on these matters continue, but owing to  the general situation in South Africa, these documents will not  be signed before the elections. Thus, prior to the conclusion of  these agreements, a favorable customs tariff will operate in  respect to the commodities imported into Russia from South  Africa, but taxes on the profits obtained from commercial  activity will be collected by both sides. The same thing applies  to the income tax for persons who are not public servants--if a  citizen of Russia receives his earnings in South Africa, he must  pay tax both in Russia and in South Africa.    Foreign citizens working in South Africa are taxed here,  according to this country's laws, on a par with ordinary  citizens of the country and are required to pay a progressive  income tax. True, the interest computed for foreign individuals  and companies (which are not managed and not controlled by South  Africa) has since 3 June 1993 been exempted from income tax.    KOMMERSANT NOTE: According to information of the  Embassy of South Africa, foreign shareholders are taxed at the  rate of 15 percent of the sum total of the dividend. The maximum  rate of income tax in South Africa is 43 percent, and the level  of income subject to the maximum tax depends on sex and family  situation. Thus, for married men this income has to be 80,000  rand (approximately $27,000) or higher, and for single men,  $56,000 rand ($18,600). Value-added tax is 14 percent. The rate  of profits tax is 40 percent.    To return to the question of how promising South African  technology is for Russian entrepreneurs, it is worth mentioning  that the purchase thereof would seem highly beneficial from the  taxation viewpoint. The point being that in accordance with  Russian legislation--even with the absence of an agreement  excluding dual taxation--Russian entrepreneurs are exempted from  the payment of VAT when purchasing rights to technology. Customs  duty, on the other hand, may be paid off in equal installments  over the whole of the period of which these rights are acquired  (and in practice such terms make it possible to reduce annual  payments to negligible amounts).    And, finally, it is essential to take account of the fact  that there is in South Africa the concept of ""white"" and ""black""  business, and even the interests of entrepreneurs of different  races are represented by particular associations--the Afrikaner  Businessman Institute of Commerce (AHI, represents the interests  of ""white"" business) and the National Federative South African  Trade and Industry Chamber (NAFKOK, the association of black  entrepreneurs). The commercial interests of Russian businessmen  in South Africa are protected by the Trade and Industry Chamber  of Russia office, which opened in Pretoria in the summer of  1992. In the year that it has been working in South Africa, the  Trade and Industry Chamber office has concluded an agreement on  cooperation with both the above-mentioned associations, and also  with the South African Chamber of Business (SACOB). In addition,  protocols on cooperation with the South African Foreign Trade  Organization (SAFTO) and the Mining Chamber have been signed.  All these organizations represent the interests of about 80,000  South African companies--practically all which are of more or  less note among the country's entrepreneurs. Inasmuch as trade  relations between Russia and South Africa are as yet of a  sporadic nature and Russian entrepreneurs lack, as a rule,  permanent partners in South Africa, the Trade and Industry  Chamber office could help them in their search.

The political turmoil and violence of recent years, coupled with strong French government backing for international sanctions against apartheid, had the effect of reducing France's share in foreign direct investment in South Africa from 8.6 per cent in 1980 to around 2 per cent today. Recent negotiation between South Africa and France of treaties on reciprocal protection of investment and avoidance of double taxation should encourage more French companies to dip their toes in South African waters. It is to help smaller French companies in the South Africa market that the French Patronat employers federation and the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa last year set up a joint organisation, aimed at modernising South African industry and developing higher value-added exports by South Africa. There has long been a traditional French interest in South African gold stocks. Several South African gold stocks are quoted on the Paris Bourse and, for example, a majority of the shares in East Rand Proprietary Mines (ERPM) are held by French individuals, according to one French banker. 'But this traditional interest in gold has not spread to other South African shares,' the banker says. The latter are relatively expensive, with a high price/earnings ratio, he says. This is due to the controls on capital movements which mean that South African investors have difficulty investing abroad. But the French investor's main worry says Mr Christian Graeff, leader of last week's Patronat delegation, is 'the current image of violence and the prospect that there will be no coherence in policy for some time to come'.

According to the State Statistics Bureau today, in 1993 some  246,000 contracts on technological transfers were signed,  involving transactions valued at 20.76 billion yuan, up 4.4 and  37.4 percent over the corresponding figures of 1992.    Establishment and development of technological markets  constitute a major target China strives to attain as part of its  economic reform program. This aims at instituting a mechanism  for competition, protecting intellectual property, and  commercializing scientific research results.    China's scientific and technological force grew in size last  year. Financial input into scientific and technical activities  was on the rise. The country gained 33,000 key research results  including 781 which received state prizes.    Patent offices in China received 77,000 domestic and foreign  patent applications. By the end of 1993, the state had approved  establishment of 52 state high- and new-tech industrial  development zones and 14,000 high- and new-tech enterprises.    In 1993, four more state laboratories of importance were  completed, the bureau said.    1993 was also marked by expanded general high education and  secondary vocational and technical education.    Progress was reported in implementing the country's  nine-year  compulsory education program. The enrollment rate of primary  school-age children (seven to eleven) was 97.7 percent.    Adult education also experienced good development. Some  5.482 million adults completed basic literacy courses in 1993.    In 1993, 154 films were made, and the number of art troupes  reached 2,723. There were 2.795 million hospital beds and 4.117  million full-time medical workers throughout China, including  1.832 million doctors.    In 1993, Chinese athletes won 103 world champions and broke  57 world records in major domestic and international sports  events.     "
0,FT942-16838 ,"FT942-16838 _AN-EDHDEABAFT 940408   FT  08 APR 94 / Rwanda PM and UN team die in rampage      By LESLIE CRAWFORD and Agencies      NAIROBI, KIGALI   A spate of murder and pillaging in Rwanda yesterday claimed the lives of Ms Agathe Uwilingiyimana, the prime minister, and at least 11 Belgian United Nations soldiers. Rampaging troops are also alleged to have killed 17 Jesuit priests at a religious centre, according to Radio France Internationale. The murders follow the death on Wednesday night of Gen Juvenal Habyarimana, president of the impoverished east African country, along with the president of neighbouring Burundi. Rwandan diplomats claim the two men were assassinated - their aircraft downed with rockets. Fierce fighting was going on in the Rwandan capital of Kigali yesterday, with the rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) joining the fray and possibly attempting to wrest power from the army. UN officials said Rwanda's woman premier was abducted by presidential guards shortly after she left her home in Kigali. The soldiers disarmed her UN guards and in the confusion she escaped and took refuge in a UN compound. The presidential guards broke into the compound and dragged her away. The UN was later informed she was dead. In Washington, President Clinton said Ms Uwilingiyamana had been 'sought out and murdered' by Rwandan security forces. A UN official said presidential guards earlier disarmed 13 Belgian peacekeepers sent to investigate the presidents' crash at the airport. 'We have now recovered 11 bodies. Two are still unaccounted for. They were dead from bullet wounds. You can call it an execution,' the UN spokesman said. It was not clear if the presidential guards were acting under orders from some authority or were rogue elements. The Belgian troops were part of the 2,500-strong, 20-nation UN mission. Three Rwandan cabinet ministers are believed to have been abducted, also by the presidential guard, and Radio France Internationale said at least one had been killed. Gen Habyarimana and President Cyprien Ntaryamira of Burundi died as they were flying back from regional peace talks in Tanzania. All on board their aircraft were killed, reportedly including two Burundi ministers, five senior Rwandan officials including the army chief of staff and the aircraft's French crew. For years both Rwanda and Burundi have seen brutal clashes between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The killing of the two presidents has immediately derailed Rwanda's UN-sponsored peace process, already under strain. A three-year civil war waged by the Tutsi-led RPF ended with a peace agreement last year. But President Habyarimana, a Hutu, who took power in a 1973 coup, has caused some anger by delaying formation of a national government under a power-sharing deal with the RPF. Even before Gen Habyarimana's assassination, Rwanda was tense. Two government ministers had been hacked to death. The bankrupt government was weighed down by a drought and by an influx of 400,000 refugees from tribal killings in Burundi. Gen Habyarimana's death has left a power vacuum in Rwanda. Army troops, presidential guards, gendarmes and rebels were all reported to be involved in violence in Kigali. In Nairobi, Mr Habi Mana, the Rwandan ambassador, blamed the death of the two presidents on the rebel RPF. 'The plane was blown up by a Soviet-made Sam-7 missile, which have been used by the RPF in the past,' he claimed. 'The Rwandese army has no Soviet military equipment.' But the RPF denied it was involved in the attack. 'The plane was shot down from the airport base, which is controlled by the gendarmerie. The area is heavily guarded and totally out of bounds to the RPF,' Mr Paul Dusaidi of RPF said in New York. Diplomats believe Gen Habyarimana may have been the victim of a power struggle between rival military factions. Belgium, the former colonial power in both Burundi abnd Rwanda, said after an emergency cabinet meeting last night it planned to protect its nationals in Rwanda, but gave no details. The UN Security Council last night denounced the violence in Rwanda, but took no decision on whether to leave UN peacekeepers in place.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Remote, populous and poor  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RWANDA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AREA AND PEOPLE 26,340 sq km (10,170 sq m) 8.2m population (1992), of which: About 85% are Hutu, a farming people, with rest mainly Tutsi, semi-nomadic herdsmen, plus some Twa, a group related to Pygmy people of Zaire 120,000 live in the capital Kigali.

Fifteen african countries were not party to any  drug-control treaty, according to the International Narcotics  Control Board (INCB) 1993 report.    It said the worldwide drug menace had outgrown its  traditional classification as a criminal and social issue to  penetrate international politics and economics.    Although the INCB recognised prevailing political, economic,  social and even climatic conditions that created obstacles for  African governments, it said limited law enforcement and weak  control over the pharmaceutical market had contributed to  increased drug abuse. Increased cultivation of dagga was  attributed to growing domestic demand and trafficking to  European markets. Supplies came from local cultivation and  regional trafficking, said the report, which annually reviews  the world drug scene and international compliance with three  major drug control treaties.    Heroin abuse, which a few years ago was a limited  phenomenon,  was increasing because African airports were being used to  smuggle the drug into mainly European markets. A similar trend  had been observed with cocaine, mainly in west Africa.    The current drug pattern in Africa showed how quickly abuse  and trafficking could spread in a region, notably central Africa  and most recently to southern Africa where the report  highlighted the illicit manufacture and distribution of  methaqualone (mandrax).    Established in 1968 as an independent and quasi-judicial  organ for the implementation of the United Nations drug  conventions, the INCB seeks to identify weaknesses in national  and international drug control.

0,FT944-618 ,"FT944-618 _AN-ELXAIADSFT 941224   FT  24 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (International Equity Markets): Players and stayers in a game of extremes - There was money to be made on global equity markets for those quick on their feet, but the unwary found a multitude of traps      By MICHAEL MORGAN   Is playing the markets worthwhile - or should you just get a broad spread and stay put? Anyone investing in the World Index in January would have seen little return from their initial stake. But an inspired trader could have done far better. Michael Morgan's hypothetical Foresight Fund shows how an international manager who made all the right switches would have trebled his money.  But don't get too excited: the equally hypothetical Hindsight Fund shows his accident-prone colleague losing almost 80 per cent of his initial capital. It has been the best of times, and the worst, in the world equities markets this year. Those able to read political runes, forecast currency movements and spot improving economic trends found there was money to be made. But sudden and aggressive shifts in asset allocations by some of the big global investors, and the recurrent theme of rising US interest rates, have hovered in the background to trap the unwary. The Foresight Fund has, however, lived up to its name: indeed, it could not have done better. The fund ignored the blandishments of those proffering bonds, cash and commodities as alternative investments and remained full-bloodedly in equities. Allocations were switched each month, with returns calculated in dollar terms, as measured by the FT-Actuaries world indices. The strategy has been, quite simply, to be invested fully in the month's best market. JANUARY: Finland, Europe's best performer in 1993, had more miles to run as a sharp slide in interest rates prompted a shift out of bank deposits and into mutual funds. Optimism grew about the economic outlook, and foreigners continued to buy as a strengthening local currency also increased substantially the market's attraction for the dollar investor. FEBRUARY: There was a switch to Malaysia, 1993's best market overall, as Kuala Lumpur put in a renewed spurt after the previous month's profit-taking. MARCH: Hopes of a political re-birth grew in Italy as media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi arrived on the scene ahead of the general election at the end of the month. Enthusiasm for Italian shares seemed unbounded, with some analysts talking in extravagant terms of the market's potential to rise. APRIL: South Africa came into focus, also on the election theme. European funds, which had begun flowing in after Nelson Mandela was released from prison, were augmented by American money around the turn of the year as the last of the US city, county and state restrictions on pension fund investment in South Africa were lifted. April's spurt accompanied the appearance of specialist funds for South African investment from several leading US money managers. MAY: Hong Kong was good value after the ravages of the early part of the year. Worries about the health of the senior Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, were put aside as US and European investors returned, cheered by US interest rate developments and plans to resume Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's airport. JUNE: Austria went to the polls to decide whether to join the European Union and the market rose strongly ahead of the result, anticipating (correctly) a 'yes' vote. JULY: Finland re-asserted its presence, powered higher by Nokia, the world's second largest maker of mobile phones, which accounts for more than a quarter of Helsinki's total FM180bn market capitalisation. Nokia's share price has more than doubled this year in response to booming sales and surging profits. AUGU Malaysia rallied after the declines in previous months on expectations of a good corporate profits outlook, take-over speculation, and moves by the central bank to spur investment, particularly by foreigners. SEPTEMBER: Singapore had its moment of glory on the prospect of new foreign money coming into the market in the form of Asian equity mutual funds. OCTOBER: Finland was again the best performer. NOVEMBER: Mexico's appearance at the top of the league table, as President Carlos Salinas de Gotari prepared to hand over power to President-elect Ernesto Zedillo after the election, was not so much a reflection of a strong run in the country as an indication of poor performance elsewhere. DECEMBER: Norway's vote against membership of the European Union at the end of November at least dispelled one important source of uncertainty and had been largely factored into the market already. The removal of remaining laws discriminating against foreign shareholders was another positive factor. Not a bad year overall, however, and as the chart (above/below) shows, each Dollars 100 invested in January has now grown to Dollars 305.22. Regrettably, the best that can be said for the Hindsight Fund is that it is easy to see now where it went wrong. It has, on a monthly basis, shown an unerring ability to select the world's worst-performing market. JANUARY: Kuala Lumpur was the world's best market in 1993, rising by 126 per cent. But it then fell prey to worries that it had risen too far, too fast. Comments to this effect by Daim Zainuddin, a former finance minister, were followed by central bank measures to sap liquidity and flush out hot money in the banking system. FEBRUARY: Hong Kong, the world's second-best performer in 1993, traditionally rallies into the lunar new year, and this seemed a safe bet again after the traumas of January when a number of US and Japanese banks and brokers advised clients to cut their holdings. But hopes were not fulfilled as US speculators played the futures market, destabilising the cash markets, and worries about higher US interest rates put a cap on the market's advances. MARCH: Renewed life in Kuala Lumpur during February raised hopes that it might be back on the upward path. The opposite proved true as the Pergau dam row with Britain erupted and foreign investors again took the opportunity to cash in some of their massive profits from 1993. APRIL: Hong Kong took another tumble over such worries as US interest rates, who might succeed Deng Xiaoping, the outlook for Sino-British relations, and US renewal of most-favoured nation status for China. MAY: Italy turned back from an eight-year high as election euphoria waned and protracted negotiations over the composition of the new government gave a hint of problems to come. JUNE: Political traumas as Mexico began to prepare for August's presidential election, on top of a sliding currency, took their toll. JULY: Foreign investors took advantage of the strength of the yen to take profits in Tokyo, while domestic Japanese investors worried about the depressing effect of the high currency on the country's exporters. AUGU A raft of disappointing corporate results, including the 85 per cent drop in pre-tax profits reported by Den Dansk Bank, Denmark's largest, took Copenhagen lower. SEPTEMBER: Weak German bonds, particularly in the second half, and the shadow of the coming Federal election, left Frankfurt wanting. OCTOBER: Re-evaluation of Mexico's political situation after the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary-general of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, unnerved the market early. Worse than expected third-quarter results from Telmex, the market bellwether, compounded the misery later. NOVEMBER: Hong Kong started the month with its biggest one-day rise in two months. But recurrent worries about the outlook for US interest rates, and asset re-allocations by a number of banks and brokers, took the colony back into negative territory. DECEMBER: Mexico was back in the frame as the financial crisis facing the new government intensified and the peso fell sharply, undermining the value of any attempt at a rally by the stock market. By Thursday night, Dollars 100 invested in January was down to just Dollars 21.47. So, what are the lessons to be learned from this year's experience? First, that past experience really is no guide to future performance. Second, perhaps, that while hindsight usually is beneficial, a little foresight can prove a great deal more profitable.  ----------------------------------------- YEAR'S BEST PERFORMING MARKETS (DOLLARS TERMS)  ----------------------------------------- Country                 Per cent  ----------------------------------------- Finland                   +43.88 South Africa              +23.96 Japan                     +18.89 Sweden                    +17.02 Norway                    +14.93  ----------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------- YEAR'S WORST PERFORMING MARKETS (DOLLARS TERMS)  ----------------------------------------- Country                 Per cent  ----------------------------------------- Mexico                    -40.28 Hong Kong                 -31.66 Malaysia                  -17.94 France                     -6.71 United Kingdom             -5.47  ----------------------------------------- Source: Datastream  -----------------------------------------   Countries:-  FIZ  Finland, West Europe.

0,FT932-10997 ,"FT932-10997 _AN-DEFCSAD7FT 930506   FT  06 MAY 93 / Letter: Africa needs new economic medicine      From Mr STEWART WALLIS   Sir, Your comment on our Africa: Make or Break report ('Diagnosing Africa's ills', April 29), is right to point to the past and present policy failures of some African governments. Misguided economic policies, autocracy, endemic corruption and armed conflict have been part of the lethal cocktail which threatens to consign the region's citizens to deepening poverty. This is why northern governments should encourage the moves towards democratisation, peace and economic policy realism now taking place in many African countries with a 'Marshall plan' for recovery. Seven years after the Group of Seven industrial countries grudgingly accepted the need for debt relief, the world's poorest region is being drained of Dollars 10bn annually. There can be no moral or economic justification for this, especially in the wake of the massive debt relief measures agreed for Russia. This is why Oxfam is calling on Britain to press for a new initiative on African debt at the G7 summit in July. Structural adjustment programmes (SAPs), implemented by African governments under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, have failed to create a platform for economic recovery and even more conspicuously to address the challenge of poverty alleviation. The World Bank's own most recent review confirmed that SAPs have a particularly bad record in terms of restoring investment, the yardstick against which recovery prospects must be measured. In part, this can be traced to the impact of deflationary monetary policies and sweeping trade liberalisation measures under SAPs. These have exposed fragile, but potentially competitive, manufacturing industries to increased competition in the face of spiralling interest rates and rising import costs. The predictable result has been disinvestment, de-industrialisation and mounting unemployment. Rather than apportion blame between doctor and patient, surely it is time to recognise that both are hooked on the wrong medicine. It is time for the World Bank and IMF to surrender their dogmatic attachment to an outmoded set of economic prescriptions. What is needed is a new approach to adjustment, based on redistribution policies, selective import liberalisation, more carefully phased market reforms and above all a commitment to increased investment in human capital.

Mr Nathan, director of the Cape-Town based Centre for  Conflict Resolution, said a number of arguments had been  presented in recent weeks for maintaining or increasing the  defence budget.    The argument that it was necessary to maintain a credible  defence capability was correct as a general principle, but its  application depended on circumstances. South Africa was  over-armed in the regional context as none of the Southern  Africa Development Community states was capable of posing a  military threat. There was no foreseeable military threat from  outside the region.    ""The potential in fact exists for a high level of political,  diplomatic and security co-operation in the post-apartheid  southern Africa,"" he said.    ""Disarmament in South Africa would facilitate disarmament  throughout the subcontinent, releasing resources for development  and potentially leading to greater internal stability.""    In South Africa the greatest threats to citizens' security  were non-military problems such as poverty, unemployment and a  lack of adequate social services.    ""The bottom line is that money spent on defence could  otherwise have been used for development programmes and welfare  services,"" Mr Nathan said.    To argue that South Africa's foreign policy, particularly in  southern Africa, would depend heavily on a military role was  dangerously close to South Africa's regional policy under  apartheid and would undermine regional confidence.    To claims that the defence budget, at 2.6 per cent of gross  national product, was not high by international standards, Mr  Nathan said the United Nations and World Bank considered two per  cent an acceptable figure for developing countries.    ""This benchmark should be regarded as a general guideline  rather than a fixed rule,"" he said. ""It may in fact be too high  in the case of South Africa since current defence spending is  several times greater than total military expenditure in the  rest of the region.""    Noting that in 1992/93 Armscor [Armaments Corporation of  South Africa] had made R110 million [rand] from domestic and  foreign sales and received a state subsidy of R10 million, he  said it was ""untenable"" to say ethical considerations should  play no part in the arms trade.    Weapons were not a neutral commodity and it was not ""overly  pious"" to ask whether South Africa wanted to boost its economy  through killings in other countries.    The defence establishment could not seek to maintain a large  budget on the grounds of international instability and  simultaneously contribute to that instability through arms  exports.    Mr Nathan said South Africa had to establish clear foreign  and national security policies and conduct a transparent  investigation of its arms industry before it could make rational  decisions about the defence budget.    It required a clear policy on arms exports and a way of  overseeing whatever criteria were laid down. Ways to cut the  defence budget should also be investigated.    All of these objectives should be open to public debate, he  said.     "

During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message  to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik  de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message  from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South  Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz  al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on  10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president.    The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the  abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation  laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing  equality for all citizens in accordance with the new  constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli  conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard,  the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just  and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict  based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council  resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian  Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon.    Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the  continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of  violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing  of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed  that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that  henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the  expense of its new relations with the Arabs.    The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future  prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after  the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab  and international embargo on dealing with South Africa.    The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual  concern about establishing good relations between the two  countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other  fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume  contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations  between them are established.    Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the  foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic  Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa  Department at the Foreign Ministry.

0,FT934-7739 ,"FT934-7739 _AN-DKRC7AGPFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (12): A game of wait and see - Germany      By DAVID WALLER   GERMAN businessmen are well aware of the potential of the South African market - but they are also acutely conscious of the risks. The attractions lie in the country's well developed industrial infrastructure, a cheap labour force and the market of 125m consumers in southern Africa. The downside is equally obvious and can be summed up in one word: instability. 'German companies will invest,' commented a German diplomat in South Africa earlier this year at a trade fair to promote trade between the two countries, 'but only when the framework is in place: that means stability, a market economy and the removal of the danger of nationalisation.' As the BDI, the Federal Association of German Industry, put it in a memorandum last month, the next government in South Africa will face massive challenges in restoring the country's economy. That government may indeed find itself on a collision course with the expectations of the black majority. For the moment German companies have less risky, highly attractive markets on their own doorsteps, in the countries of the former eastern block. China and other markets in the far east are growing so quickly that they form a central part of many Germany companies' medium-term expansion plans. That said, German investment in South Africa should not be underestimated: there are about 350 German businesses or subsidiaries of large German companies in the country, employing 50,000 people. German investors and trade-partners are well-liked in South Africa - not least because German companies adopted a pragmatic approach to sanctions. But that liking is unlikely to be reciprocated further until South Africa offers a degree of stability to investors.   Countries:-  DEZ  Germany, EC.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson is a syndicated columnist in  Washington.      As democracy emerges from the shell of tyranny all over the Earth, people of  good will look expectantly to South Africa. For if Vaclav Havel, a liberal  playwright, can become president of Czechoslovakia, if the people of Romania  can abolish the despised secret police, if Mikhail Gorbachev can suggest that  the Soviet Union will tolerate new political parties, then we have reason to  hope that the government of South Africa can drop the dehumanizing and brutal  system of apartheid.    As a new world is born, we pray that the 23 million blacks of South Africa will  be next to gain their freedom and find peace with justice in their land, which  is now run by a minority of 4.5 million whites.    I, for one, am hopeful of the prospect for peaceful social reconstruction in  South Africa. After 10 years of appeals, I have been granted a visa to go there  later this month at the invitation of the South African Council of Churches,  headed by Frank Chikane, and Walter and Albertina Sisulu of the African  National Congress. It is also significant that I have received an invitation  from the National Religious Broadcasters and the Dutch Reformed Church, to  which the majority of Afrikaners belong and which holds that apartheid is  heresy and ""cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds.""    Whenever the theological rationale for oppression is eroded, and the moral  foundations of domination begin to desolve, political change soon follows. If  it is morally wrong, it cannot be politically right.    My hope is that my visit will help further improve the climate of rebuilding,  conciliation and reconstruction in South Africa at this crucial moment.    There is so much damage to be undone. The apartheid system has brutalized and  degraded the black majority: no vote, no voice, no justice, no respect. These  are the realities of life for black people, our brothers and sisters, in South  Africa.    And yet they have never accepted their oppression. More than 2,000 peaceful  black demonstrators have lost their lives at the hands of South African police  since the most recent round of resistance and protest began in the early 1980s.  The courage of these martyrs focused the attention of the world on the brutal  state of emergency imposed by the government. Soon after, nations around the  globe imposed economic sanctions against South Africa. In October, 1986, the  U.S. Congress, over the objection of President Ronald Reagan, and led by Rep.  Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), passed a sanctions bill.    Today, this strategy bears fruit. According to a recent bank study, foreign  economic sanctions cost South Africa $32 billion to $40 billion between 1985  and 1989, including at least $11 billion in net capital outflow and $4 billion  in lost exports. South Africa's isolation during the 1980s has helped turn  around the thinking of its leaders, who now recognize that the course of  democratic change is irresistible and inevitable.    President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised and delivered on a number of modest  reforms. He has freed several political prisoners, effectively legalized many  formerly banned political organizations and desegregated many beaches and  public facilities.    We may finally be moving to a South Africa beyond fear and distrust, beyond  apartheid and the Group Areas Act, beyond pass laws and the cruel state of  emergency. We may finally see a South Africa that is no longer based on the  exploitation of one racial group by another.    When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was living in the throes of American apartheid,  and his people were being killed, he dreamed of a new society beyond apartheid.  We must now have such a dream for South Africa.    A new South Africa will be a place of hope, where those who have had the  advantage see the light and those who have been kept down finally share in the  bounty of the nation.    A new South Africa will profit from the tremendous leadership of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela (who may soon be released from prison),  Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev.

By JESSE JACKSON, The Rev. Jesse Jackson is a syndicated columnist in  Washington.      As democracy emerges from the shell of tyranny all over the Earth, people of  good will look expectantly to South Africa. For if Vaclav Havel, a liberal  playwright, can become president of Czechoslovakia, if the people of Romania  can abolish the despised secret police, if Mikhail Gorbachev can suggest that  the Soviet Union will tolerate new political parties, then we have reason to  hope that the government of South Africa can drop the dehumanizing and brutal  system of apartheid.    As a new world is born, we pray that the 23 million blacks of South Africa will  be next to gain their freedom and find peace with justice in their land, which  is now run by a minority of 4.5 million whites.    I, for one, am hopeful of the prospect for peaceful social reconstruction in  South Africa. After 10 years of appeals, I have been granted a visa to go there  later this month at the invitation of the South African Council of Churches,  headed by Frank Chikane, and Walter and Albertina Sisulu of the African  National Congress. It is also significant that I have received an invitation  from the National Religious Broadcasters and the Dutch Reformed Church, to  which the majority of Afrikaners belong and which holds that apartheid is  heresy and ""cannot be accepted on Christian ethical grounds.""    Whenever the theological rationale for oppression is eroded, and the moral  foundations of domination begin to desolve, political change soon follows. If  it is morally wrong, it cannot be politically right.    My hope is that my visit will help further improve the climate of rebuilding,  conciliation and reconstruction in South Africa at this crucial moment.    There is so much damage to be undone. The apartheid system has brutalized and  degraded the black majority: no vote, no voice, no justice, no respect. These  are the realities of life for black people, our brothers and sisters, in South  Africa.    And yet they have never accepted their oppression. More than 2,000 peaceful  black demonstrators have lost their lives at the hands of South African police  since the most recent round of resistance and protest began in the early 1980s.  The courage of these martyrs focused the attention of the world on the brutal  state of emergency imposed by the government. Soon after, nations around the  globe imposed economic sanctions against South Africa. In October, 1986, the  U.S. Congress, over the objection of President Ronald Reagan, and led by Rep.  Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), passed a sanctions bill.    Today, this strategy bears fruit. According to a recent bank study, foreign  economic sanctions cost South Africa $32 billion to $40 billion between 1985  and 1989, including at least $11 billion in net capital outflow and $4 billion  in lost exports. South Africa's isolation during the 1980s has helped turn  around the thinking of its leaders, who now recognize that the course of  democratic change is irresistible and inevitable.    President Frederik W. de Klerk has promised and delivered on a number of modest  reforms. He has freed several political prisoners, effectively legalized many  formerly banned political organizations and desegregated many beaches and  public facilities.    We may finally be moving to a South Africa beyond fear and distrust, beyond  apartheid and the Group Areas Act, beyond pass laws and the cruel state of  emergency. We may finally see a South Africa that is no longer based on the  exploitation of one racial group by another.    When Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was living in the throes of American apartheid,  and his people were being killed, he dreamed of a new society beyond apartheid.  We must now have such a dream for South Africa.    A new South Africa will be a place of hope, where those who have had the  advantage see the light and those who have been kept down finally share in the  bounty of the nation.    A new South Africa will profit from the tremendous leadership of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela (who may soon be released from prison),  Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak, the Sisulus. It will rejoice in  the splendor of all of its peoples, their creativity, passion and brilliance.  It will triumph not through violence and hatred but through peace and justice.  Democracy will replace tyranny in South Africa, and equality will take the  place of domination.    A new South Africa will be a thriving center of economic prosperity and growth  on the African continent. It will be a powerhouse and a beacon among countries.  It will not be isolated and vilified.

He made the  announcement at an ANC fundraising dinner in East London on  Saturday [19 March]. ""It is planned that the new president,  Nelson Mandela I think, will be installed, inaugurated on the  10th May, a big occasion in Pretoria."" It had to be in Pretoria  because Pretoria was the seat of power and government in the  country. ""For years we fought against the Pretoria regime. On  the 10th May we ought to be (talking of) the Pretoria  government.""    He said the ANC had been receiving numerous queries from  heads of state and of government in other countries asking  whether there would be victory celebrations after the April  election, or an inauguration of the new president. ""Everybody  wants to come,"" he said. The mayor of Pretoria and ""all sorts  of people"" were concerned about the prospect of having the  inauguration in the city. ""They are very worried not because  they don't want change,"" he said, to laughter from his audience,  ""but because they say Pretoria won't be able to handle the  volume of visitors that are going to come"".    Mr Mbeki said if South Africa failed to make the transition  to a peaceful and successful democracy, it would disappoint  millions of people across the globe. ""And that we can't do.  Too much has been invested by the rest of the world in ending  apartheid.""    There was a picture in many peoples' minds that Africans  were  incompetent, always holding out a begging bowl, had no respect  for democracy, were always at each others' throats and that  Africa was ""generally a disaster"". ""The rest of the continent  is expecting this new South Africa will change all that so the  rest of the world will see an African country that is a success  in terms of a political system, human rights, an absence of  conflict and prosperity...so the rest of the world can begin to  say our understanding of Africa was wrong.""    These expectations meant that in the end, South Africa had  to  make a success of the process of change. Other countries where  racism had raised its head, such as Sweden, France, Germany and  England, were hoping South Africa would provide the lessons that  would enable them to deal with their own problems. ""I'm saying  we've got to solve, we've got to succeed here in the interest of  making a better world for millions of people.""    He also said South Africa needed a strong ANC government to  ensure that the country's millions were all brought into the  settlement. If the ANC was too weak to do so, other people  would move into the vacuum. Some of them might preach revenge  against the whites who had oppressed them for three-and-a-half  centuries.    He said the country would also need a strong National Party  to bring white civil servants, the police and white business  into the settlement.     "

The committee, in a statement issued at the end of its  session, praised all parties to the peace process in South  Africa for the spirit of tolerance they showed, which  contributed to achieving this accomplishment.    In its final statement, the South African Committee  emphasized its overwhelming support for democratic process in  South Africa, which serves the great interests of whoever is  living there, regardless of any ethnic considerations. The  committee voiced its regret for the recent acts of violence in  South Africa and called on all parties to show tolerance and a  sincere spirit of reconciliation to put an end to the chaotic  massacres and provide the appropriate atmosphere for holding the  elections in the country. The committee paid tribute to the  urgent efforts exerted by the transitional executive council and  the Government of South Africa to contain the explosive  situation in Bophuthatswana.    The committee called on all political leaders in South  Africa  to take the necessary measures to safeguard and guarantee the  unity and territorial integrity of South Africa. It called on  the international community to continue its backing for the  process of democratic change in South Africa and reject any  attempt to partition the country.    On behalf of the OAU leaders, the committee expressed its  hope to welcome a ""new South Africa"" as a member in the  organization following the April elections and the formation of  a democratic government.    The following is the text of the statement:    The 10th session of the OAU's South African Committee of  heads of states and governments met in Harare, the capital of  Zimbabwe, on 19 March 1994 to review the developments in South  Africa on the eve of the first democratic and nonracial  elections in that country. Participating in the meeting were  Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, the current chairman  of OAU; President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, president of the  host country and head of the front-line states; Botswana's  President Ketumile Masire, Cape Verde's President Antonio  Mascarenhas, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi, Mozambique's  President Chissano, Namibian President Dr. Sam Nujoma, Tanzanian  President Ali Hassan Mwinyi, and Zambian President Frederick  Chiluba.    Also present at the meeting were Angolan Prime Minister  Marcolino Moco; Lieutenant General D. O. Diya, Nigerian Chief of  the General Staff and vice-chairman of the Federal Executive  Council; Benjamin Bounkoulou, Congolese minister of foreign  affairs and international cooperation; Ahmed Djebbar, Algerian  minister of national education; Osman Kamaza, Senegalese  ambassador to Zimbabwe [name and title as received]; OAU  Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim; Johnson Mlambo, chairman of  the Pan-Africanist Congress [PAC] of Azania; Alfred Nzo, member  of the African National Congress [ANC] Executive Council [name  and title as received]; and in the capacity of observer, Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, the UN secretary general's representative in South  Africa.    The committee examined a report prepared by the OAU  secretary  general following his visit to South Africa and his extensive  discussions with all concerned leaders there.    The committee listened to reports on the current situation  in  South Africa presented by the leaders of the PAC and ANC  delegations.    The committee referred to the Harare Declaration, which it  adopted on 21 August 1989 during its third regular session and  which included the principles and directions for the negotiating  process, and the program for ending apartheid and establishing a  united, democratic, and nonracial state in South Africa.    The committee welcomed the considerable progress achieved  since its last meeting and the splendid success achieved by the  multilateral negotiations, which produced historic agreements  providing for democratic elections in South Africa on 26, 27,  and 28 April 1994 and the establishment of transitional  structures to hold those elections.    The committee praised the spirit of tolerance shown by all  parties involved in the peace process and the flexible attitudes  which made the above achievement possible.    The committee voiced regret at the escalating violence in  the  country and grave concern at recent reports about the  involvement of senior officers in South Africa's security forces  in the continuing violence. The committee urged all parties in  South Africa to show tolerance and sincerely seek reconciliation  to put an end to the reckless massacres and prepare a suitable  climate to hold peaceful elections.    The committee welcomed the PAC's decision to halt armed  struggle unilaterally as of 16 April 1994. The committee termed  this decision a contribution toward free and honest elections.    The committee applauded South Africa's Transitional  Executive  Council and Government for their prompt efforts to contain the  explosive situation in Bophuthatswana and urged them to continue  their task of maintaining order, security, and law and  guaranteeing free political action throughout the country so  that the April elections can be held in an atmosphere free from  violence and threats.    The committee voiced support for the efforts to bring about  national accord within the framework of an all-embracing  process. Thanking all the leaders and parties involved in the  electoral process, including those who joined it recently, for  their sense of responsibility and perseverance, the committee  regrets the decision by some parties to boycott the upcoming  elections.    The committee commended the Transitional Executive Council,  which took firm measures to involve Bophuthatswana in the  electoral process.    The committee welcomed the meeting held recently between ANC  Chairman Nelson Mandela and Inkatha Freedom Party leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi and urged both leaders to continue the  course of dialogue and cooperation, not just between themselves,  but also with all the other political figures to end the  devastating wave of violence and to pave the way for elections  in a secure and peaceful atmosphere to build a new, democratic  South Africa.    The committee categorically rejected and candidly condemned  recent threats and acts of violence by those who deliberately  wish to wear down the people and prevent the majority of South  Africans from exercising their lawful right to choose their  leaders and turn the page on the tragic chapters of the past for  the first time. It appealed to the patriotic spirit of party  leaders boycotting the elections and threatening to obstruct and  dismantle the electoral process to reconsider their position and  refrain from depriving their people of the right to partake of  the biggest and most serious change in the history of South  Africa. It also appealed to them to do their utmost to  guarantee freedom of political activity all over the country and  to hold the elections in a safe, peaceful atmosphere.    In this context, the committee expressed its deep concern  over recent statements by kwaZulu leaders, statements that seek  to destroy the country's unity. The OAU had rejected all  attempts to partition the country, since they dramatically  threaten peace and stability in the southern part of the  continent and the entire region, and viewed these attempts as  absolutely unacceptable.    The committee invited the South African Government and all  political leaders in South Africa to take the necessary measures  to protect and guarantee South African territorial integrity.  The OAU called on the international community to maintain its  support for the democratic process in South Africa and to reject  any attempt to divide the country.    The committee reiterated its firm support for the democratic  process in and the unity of South Africa, the process that  serves and protects the greater interests of those living in the  country, regardless of ethnic, cultural, or religious  considerations. The committee is eager to see a new, democratic  South Africa join the OAU house to enhance the organization and  play its natural role in the greater international community.    It welcomed the participation of the international  community,  including the United Nations, the European Union, and the  British Commonwealth, in monitoring the elections. It urged all  South African parties to cooperate fully with the international  observers in their mission. In this context, the committee  expressed its appreciation of the OAU member states that pledged  to send observers to monitor the elections and urged those that  have not done so to do the same.    On behalf of all OAU member states, the heads of states and  the heads of delegations taking part in the 10th ordinary  session of the Southern African Committee welcome the new South  Africa as a member of the OAU after the April 1994 elections and  the establishment of a democratic government.    The heads of states and governments and delegation chairmen  expressed their deep appreciation and gratitude for His  Excellency President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe and the  government and people of Zimbabwe for their hospitality and the  excellent facilities they have provided to them during their  meeting.

""I didn't know that I couldn't read until my wife told me,"" he said. ""My wife  always filled out job applications for me and wrote out checks. I thought I  read enough to get by. I could write my name.""    But when the unemployed student from Jamaica tried to get a job as an  electrical assemblyman, he discovered from test scores that he was reading on a  first-grade level. The student, who asked that his name not be used, enrolled  in a reading class at one of San Diego Community College District's continuing  education centers.    But often, when adults enroll in a basic education class and find that their  skills are far below those of the other students in the class, they drop out,  said Nancy Hampson, coordinator of the Literacy Instruction Tutors in  Education, a program started in 1987 by the San Diego Community College  District to keep these students learning.    ""It takes great courage for people who can't read to enroll in a class, and  find that their skills are far below the other students in the class,"" Hampson  said. ""They feel embarrassed, frustrated and defeated. They drop out after a  few sessions with the impression that an adult education class is another place  of failure.""    The literacy volunteer program has become a safety net for those like the  Jamaican student, she said. The individualized instruction allows students to  improve basic reading, spelling, and math skills without feeling like outcasts  in a classroom of strangers. Most of the students were also high-school  dropouts.    The district started the LITE program with six volunteers. Today, there are  nearly 150 volunteers who serve about 318 students at eight of the 10  continuing adult education centers in the county.    LITE is the only adult tutoring program in the county. It is a branch of the  San Diego County Literacy Network, which is a coalition of 13 adult literacy  programs. LITE is funded by a three-year, $60,000 allocation from California  lottery funds.    Volunteers receive 12 hours of training. Afterward, they choose which students  they want to tutor, based on the students' learning capabilities. Some tutors  may meet with as many as five students a week.    ""I've obtained confidence from my teacher,"" said a 67-year-old student who also  asked that his name not be used. ""I took the driver's test and did good. I got  100. When I first came, I could read some but couldn't write unless I copied  it. I wanted to read some good books, to read recipes, so I could cook.""    He said he was promoted throughout grade school without learning how to read  and write. He was embarrassed and hid the fact that he could not read around  the other children because he thought he was too dumb to learn.    The retired janitor was also ""too embarrassed to marry or have children""  because he could not read or write.    For two years, he said, he kept applying for a janitor's position at San Diego  State University, where he eventually worked for 18 years.    ""The boss kept telling me, 'I told you I don't have anything,' and I kept  saying, 'You don't understand, I want a job.' I finally told him that if I  couldn't handle the job, then I would leave. I did everything but beg.""    Jenny Hartman, who tutors the ex-janitor, says helping people like him is what  makes the task worthwhile.    ""He's enthusiastic and wants to learn,"" Hartman said.

One of his students, 46-year-old Ar Mark, is learning survival English. She  came to the United States three years ago from Cambodia.

0,FT942-10481 ,"FT942-10481 _AN-EEJC9AGLFT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (3): The old guard can offer no alternative  -Economy / Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the doldrums, but reforms promise respectable growth      By TONY HAWKINS   If big-business sentiment is a reliable guide, the Kenyan economy has turned the corner and is poised to return to respectable growth rates in the latter half of the decade, though 1994 will be flat. Kenyan business is emerging from a traumatic period in the doldrums - 100 per cent inflation, 70 per cent devaluation, an epidemic of damaging financial scandals, record interest rates, drought, a freeze on donor funds and sudden, unpredictable shifts in macroeconomic policy. Yet such is the economy's resilience that GDP stayed fractionally ahead of the game, with real output rising 0.4 per cent in both 1992 and 1993 and forecast to grow by 2 to 3 per cent this year. But business sentiment is notoriously fragile and volatile. A leading businessman admits to 'a nervous feeling in the pit of my stomach' that at least some of the sweeping reforms of the past 12 months will be reversed. Another believes that the scales are so finely balanced between reform and a return to controls that the outcome is too close to call. The most immediate challenge is political. Clustered around President Daniel arap Moi is a clutch of old-guard politicians for whom structural adjustment, deregulation, privatisation, the World Bank and the IMF are dirty words. They are unlikely to acquiesce in the loss of privileged access to wealth and patronage at the behest of, and under duress from, the donor community. That said, this anti-reform group does not have much going for it, given the failure of its policies. However, it can point to falling living standards and the limp supply response to reform, other than exports. With a population growing at 3.4 per cent annually and stagnant GDP, real incomes have fallen some 8 per cent since 1990; unemployment has worsened and wage awards have fallen far behind inflation. Urban unemployment climbed from 16 per cent in 1986 to 23.5 per cent by 1991, and is now estimated to be in the region of 27 per cent, while rural unemployment is put at 12 per cent. The critics are on weak ground, however, when it comes to policy alternatives. The old guard has nothing to offer in its place. There is no constituency for a return to the bad old days of price and import controls, overvalued exchange rates and pervasive state intervention. With no elections due for almost four years, the reformers have a window of opportunity to get Kenya back on to a 5 per cent growth track  - fuelled, this time, by a structurally healthy economy, rather than one dependent on aid and volatile commodity prices than. A survey of multinationals by the East Africa Association finds that the majority of the 37 respondents (to date) have significant investment plans. Only one is disinvesting. The government's Investment Promotion Centre has had 120 investment inquiries so far this year, and about 20 per cent of them have been translated into firm project proposals. The country's first privately-owned industrial park and export processing Zone (EPZ) is fully subscribed, while officials claim good support for Athi River EPZ, due to come on stream later in the year. This - largely anecdotal - evidence suggests that there are at least the stirrings of an investment supply response, while exports have already responded significantly to devaluation and 100 per cent earnings retention. In dollar terms, exports surged 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn. Industrialists attribute increased exports of manufactures to devaluation, strengthening economies in (and improved trading ties with) Uganda and Tanzania, and some shift of commerce from informal to formal channels. Clothing, textile and footwear firms, some in the EPZ, or utilising the manufacturing-under-bond scheme, are penetrating European and North American markets Reform has done wonders for the financial sector, too - though not yet for insurance groups. Barclays Bank of Kenya doubled its profits last year, while share prices doubled on the Nairobi Stock Exchange in the first two months of 1994, though they have since fallen by a quarter. Business has also been encouraged by the opening up of constructive dialogue with the government, and especially with finance minister Musalia Mudavadi and central bank governor Micah Cheserem. Private enterprise played a leading role in staging the Nairobi investment conference last week, and will be prominent at the London investment conference scheduled for November, being organised with Confederation of British Industry. Not everyone is upbeat. The donor community, marching to a different drum, is stuck in wait-and-see mode. Its caution stems partly from its understandable preoccupation with political conditions, memories of having been misled by the Kenyans in the 1980s, and current concerns about macroeconomic management. The challenges here are formidable: per capita incomes will fall again this year for the fourth successive year; inflation, which had fallen to 16 per cent on a three-month moving average basis by December last year, from a peak of 101 per cent in mid-year, is back above 50 per cent; bank lending rates of 33 per cent are substantially negative in real terms and set to move higher; and the exchange rate, having overshot (it fell to a low of Ks70 to the dollar late last year), has now appreciated to the point where exporters are beginning to complain that their competitive edge is under threat. This year, too, the economy will pick up the tab for the fiscal and monetary expansion associated with the December 1992 elections and the subsequent banking and financial scams that cost the country literally hundreds of millions of dollars. The authorities managed to slow money supply growth to 26 per cent last year, from 33.6 per cent in 1992, by driving treasury bill yields above 70 per cent to drain liquidity from the system at enormous interest cost to the exchequer. The volume of bills outstanding more than quadrupled during 1993, to reach Ks59bn at the end of the year, and increased by a further 35 per cent in the first quarter to Ks80bn in early April. The high nominal interest rates used to mop up liquidity now threaten to destabilise the economy, fuelling rapid monetary growth as capital flight is reversed, resulting in a substantial 1993 current account balance of payments surplus and a firmer shilling. Managing the T-bill mountain will tax the authorities' ingenuity, forcing them to lengthen borrowing maturities, or incur a budgetary surplus to repay debt. The latter option is not on the cards. The budget deficit is forecast at 7 per cent of GDP this year (to June 30), due to heavy interest charges, external debt-restructuring notwithstanding. Interest costs account for 42 per cent of recurrent spending - 35 per cent domestic and 7 per cent foreign. It is clear that structural adjustment is not going to succeed without radical public sector reform. Civil service reform, in terms of freezing posts and retrenching staff, is on target, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. The real challenge is to improve accountability, transparency and efficiency right though the public sector, and especially the parastatals. Re-engineering the parastatal sector is arguably the most formidable challenge facing the government, since public enterprise inefficiency and infrastructural decay are both a heavy burden on the budget and major deterrents to new investment. Fiscal policy and the associated problems of monetary management and inflation top the policy agenda, and it is here that the scope for (and danger of) slippage is greatest, under pressure from big-spending ministers. The government is caught in a fiscal bind - stagnant revenue, reduced aid inflows, expenditure overruns, escalating interest costs, and the need to write off debt to clean up parastatal balance sheets. Over the next two years, the deficit must be trimmed to 2 per cent of GDP, implying both revenue enhancement and spending cuts. There are high hopes of the former, following the appointment of three pre-shipment import inspection agencies, whose prime task will be to monitor customs and VAT payments, thereby levelling the playing-field for local manufacturers facing competition from importers, paying bribes rather than duties to get their products into the country, while simultaneously boosting government revenue. Estimates suggest that anything for 25 to 50 per cent of taxes and duties are being evaded/ But it is impossible to reconcile heavy investment in the country's rundown and deteriorating infrastructure with fiscal stringency and domestic debt repayment, especially in a country forced to live with the withdrawal symptoms of reduced aid dependence. Traditionally, Kenya was able to rely on donor funding for development, with net disbursements of over Dollars 1bn annually in 1989-90. But those days have gone: Kenya's aid reliance ratio (aid as a percentage of GNP) fell from 13.7 per cent in 1989-90 to 7 per cent in 1991-92, when inflows declined to Dollars 780m. To achieve social stability, the economy must grow at 7 per cent annually into the next century, creating 165 000 new wage-sector jobs each year. This is a tall order, given declining rates of investment. The reforms of the past year have created a platform for self-sustaining growth, but there is a long way to go to overcome the political doubts of the recent past, to rehabilitate the public sector and create the enabling environment necessary for Asian-style growth rates. The jury is out on the sustainability of Kenyan reform, but with private enterprise markedly more bullish than before, the investment response lacking in so many parts of Africa may materialise in the latter half of the decade.

Giving the inaugural annual lecture at the South Bank Business School in London, he said: 'I foresee future new employment opportunities being accessible by fewer members of society with the rest either working at subsistence levels or unemployed. Those unemployed in the 21st century may well be unemployable.' He said he based this view on what he had already observed. Citing examples from his time in British industry, he said: 'At the most basic levels of functional literacy and numeracy society has a problem now.' He added: 'When broad employment criteria are for more, better and relevant education and skills, it is relevant that very significant percentages of society are not even qualified to the extent of the basics.' He said he did not know how society would deal with the large number of people unable to participate in the knowledge-based industries. 'Whether the cry will be for programme enhancement or the organisation of activities which can fill the time of those who will be unemployed, I cannot say.' Sir Graham was sceptical of government's ability to create jobs and scathing about the 'endless diatribe' about state-funded training, which he said was wholly ineffective if basic education was inadequate. 'From time to time governments mount major training initiatives. Invariably these are expensive, bureaucratic and of marginal impact.' He advocated shifting the training burden on to employers but also recommended penalties on those companies that did not comply. Sir Graham cited the Pounds 35m a year spent by Rover on everything from remedial education to doctoral degrees as a reason for its recent success.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0,FT941-11101 ,"FT941-11101 _AN-EBFAAAE0FT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: A life of foreign affairs - The skill and camaraderie of correspondents abroad      By JDF JONES   WHO STOLE THE NEWS? by Mort Rosenblum John Wiley Pounds 16.95, 299 pages BANANA SUNDAY by Chris Munnion Wm Waterman (Box 5091, Rivonia, 2128, S Africa) R70, 443 pages NEWS FROM THE FRONT by Sandy Gall Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 344 pages LAST OF THE PIRATES by Samantha Weinberg Jonathan Cape Pounds 16.99, 256 pages The trade of Foreign Correspondent has always sounded dashing and dangerous and romantic - as sometimes it is; certainly it used to be - but it also has its surprising aspects. For instance, you would expect it to be intensely competitive: yes, it is, but there can be no profession in which there is so intense a camaraderie, so much mutual support, such pride in the achievements of your supposed rival, such alacrity to help a colleague. That may be a consequence of the difficulties and the dangers, which may also help explain why it is a profession awash with laughter, jokes and nostalgic reminiscence, to go with the booze and the boredom, the airports and the expense account, the bullets and the dysentery, the affairs and the alimony bills. Mort Rosenblum's Who Stole The News? is about foreign news coverage and is infuriating because it is written for an exclusively American audience; its argument is therefore seriously unconvincing to Europeans. Rosenblum is a senior and extravagantly experienced correspondent for the Associated Press and he believes that the reporting of international news has deteriorated to a dangerous degree. He blames television: 'For all of its flash and promise, much of our coverage of news from beyond our borders is hardly better than it was in the days of Morse code. Television lets us watch the volcano erupt; it does not show the lava as it is overheating, while there is time to react . . . Most Americans are shown generalities, simplicities and vast empty spaces, a parody of the real world beyond their borders.' That may be true of the US land mass just as it is no doubt correct that two-thirds of Americans depend on TV for their news and more than one-third read no newspaper at all. Rosenblum describes himself as a dinosaur and is nostalgic for earlier, happier times. But this is polemic - very readably so  -and it infuriates because it admits no cosmopolitan dimension or corrective, which is surprising in an author who has been editor of the International Herald Tribune. The fact remains that people who need or wish to follow overseas affairs are still served by newspapers which have over the past generation developed a considerable range and depth of international news and analysis, even as the TV newscasts have become more domestic and banal and the local papers more parochial. Chris Munnion, the Telegraph's Africa correspondent for many years, is particularly good on the importance of peer-group camaraderie to foreign correspondents. It is easy to understand its function in Africa in the 20 years after de-colonisation for the men (and, slowly, the women) whose job was to fly from one disaster to another in constantly frustrating and often terrifying circumstances. In Banana Sunday Munnion is writing about the OAHs, the 'Old Africa Hands' - he finishes in 1980 - and makes proper acknowledgement to Evelyn Waugh's Scoop. He achieves the rare feat of describing a great deal of bloodshed while remaining very funny - the anecdotes never stop. Like Rosenblum, he is nostalgic for the old days of battered Remingtons and the absurdly abbreviated prose of cablese, and he is nervous of the new world of laptops and TV crews. My justification for reviewing a book not yet available internationally is that I might persuade a London publisher to take up this gem of the genre. Munnion is an irredeemable male chauvinist and his political attitudes make him a typical resident of the Transvaal (not to add a stalwart of the Telegraph). All the famous stories are here, and many that I had forgotten. As, for example, when the hacks challenged each other in their adolescent and well-lubricated way to get a by-line into a British national paper from Banana - a port on the Congo River - datelined 'Sunday'. It eventually appeared in the Daily Mail from Peter Younghusband, but was held over for a day - so it appeared as 'Banana, Monday'. Sandy Gall, that most laid-back of our TV newscasters, features in Munnion's pages and has himself produced another volume of memoirs, News From The Front. He takes up the tale in 1977 and focuses on Pakistan, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Gulf war and his personal obsession, Afghanistan. There is next to nothing about news-casting because he evidently rates his life as a correspondent much higher: it is smooth, urbane, not profound, but these are the qualities of a successful newscaster. The funniest page is a bitchy put-down of Kate Adie. For her first book, Last Of The Pirates, Samantha Weinberg ventures into an obscure backwater of the post-colonial world - the recent history of the Comoro Islands, scattered between Madagascar and the east coast of Africa, a French protectorate since the mid-19th century. Mercenaries seem to be out of fashion at present - except in Bosnia - but in the 1960s they were all over the front pages. In the Congo, Bob Denard was second in notoriety only to 'Mad Mike' Hoare. Denard finished up in the Comoros, where in the 1980s he ruled the roost and was responsible for two coups. Ms Weinberg has been investigating these years, in particular the matter of who shot President Abdallah in 1989; this required her to track down Denard in his enforced retirement near Johannesburg. Her task is readably and convincingly achieved and will gratify the tiny minority which has an interest in Indian Ocean islands, but one cannot resist the feeling that this is parish pump stuff. The French have followed this topic more closely than we, and this book is not going to tell them much. Here, then, are four foreign correspondents, of different age, sex, experience. It is said that several thousand of the breed are preparing to fly to South Africa for the April 27 elections. Two things are certain: the ANC is going to win, and some of those journalists are going to get themselves killed. But, as someone famously said of the profession, it is better than working.

The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in  1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained  three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other  countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he  underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the  existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record  also puts on display the level of corruption in the government  in the 1980s, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a  perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and  even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that  in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was ""prepared to  commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become  involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ...  he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to  lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his  evidence.""    Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the  trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the  development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on  three counts:     -  He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons  technology or material from another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never provided material to  another country.    -  He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with  another  country in this regard.       The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the ""in  camera""  case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw,  reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of  nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive  collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the  judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the  Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the  government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES  with an interdict if it printed it.    In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to  extort  mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he  was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that  Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of  the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between  South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all  charges.    After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as  a  go-between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In  1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council  involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and  asked to obtain South African ""yellow cake"" for Israel. Yellow  cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for  the production of nuclear weapons.    Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of  yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the  former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den  Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet  Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to  ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli  military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck  up a good relationship with Botha.    Said the judgment: ""Blaauw testified that there was, at that  stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South  African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of  military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of  `knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture  of weaponry.""    After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by  Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South  Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The  Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa --  enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered  two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and  500 [metric] tons, to Israel.    Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a  recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem,  which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among  developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha  slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by  a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was  at hand.    Said the judgment: ""The Israelis were interested in keeping  Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake  transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every  possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they  would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio.""    The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000  --  as a ""gift for what I had done for them."" With the money,  Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and  politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed  to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a  reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme,in  July 1979.    In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to  hand  over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's  illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals  in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after  the fall of Vorster in 1979.    In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he  announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's  nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: ""I wish to emphasise  that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons  technology or materials from another country, nor has it  provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another  country in this regard.""    When confronted with the court records by the international  London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke  the story, the office of the state president replied: ""South  Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another  country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear  explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by  South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa  has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for  some time and has procured this material from various sources in  the past.""    Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South  Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC  [African National Congress] science and technology head Roger  Jardine: ""They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but  have never given details of the programme. A senior official  once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the  Official Secrets Act.""     "

'It's just that I can't find the way to finance them.' Traditionally, multinationals used subsidiaries in France, Italy and other leading trading partners to tap the high levels of trade finance and export credit agency (ECA) cover available for Algeria. Now, concern over the scale of debt repayments, estimated at more than Dollars 9bn in 1993, has led many ECAs to reduce their cover. This has deprived Algiers of the medium-term credit which was for years the lifeblood of its business. 'Foreign loans are only available short-term - and then if we pay a sweetener - from banks who still say they believe in our future,' says Mr Abdelkader Belgherbi, a vice-governor of the central bank, Banque d'Algerie. 'This is a problem for an economy which depended on credit for 20 years.' Algeria has never rescheduled its debt - although that is now an option - and maintains a good repayments record. Exporters are suffering from the credit crunch. Some, such as Italian grain producers (with annual exports of Dollars 400m) and steel companies have lobbied governments to increase support. They are opposed by treasuries, concerned at the high levels of risk involved. Algeria is the single largest risk for the Italian ECA, Sezione Speciale per Assicuzione del Credito all'Esportazione (SACE), whose total exposure is about Dollars 6.5bn. Trade credits guaranteed by the Coface, French ECA, are also about Dollars 6bn. Exporters are having to secure financing by whatever route possible. With France limiting itself to a credit package of Fr6bn this year and Italy imposing new limits, companies are looking farther and wider for support. The rewards can be great. Big ticket contracts, especially for hydrocarbons schemes such as the estimated Dollars 2bn Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline, will continue to attract companies to Algeria. But the country's potential will remain unfulfilled while the credit crunch prevails. This process is working in reverse elsewhere in the region comprising Egypt and the five Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) members - Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Mauritania. Other markets are gaining from improved credit ratings. After the Gulf war of 1991, Egypt's debt programme, new credits and slow moves towards liberalisation have yielded dividends. A Dollars 2bn-plus current account surplus is forecast for 1993 and foreign exchange reserves stand at Dollars 16bn. Exporters to Egypt report that local banks, led by National Bank of Egypt (NBE), are using reserves to finance trade deals at advantageous rates. Morocco has seen ECA cover restored after the debt crisis of the 1980s. Italy, Belgium and the UK are among those using credit support to challenge France and Spain in one of their leading markets. In 1992, Morocco replaced Algeria as France's largest export market in the Maghreb region. As the region struggles with the populist challenge of radical Islam and rapidly rising populations (with Tunisia at under 2 per cent an exception), North Africa is not an easy region with which to do business. But an increasing number of analysts believe the region offers a new emerging market opportunity. They are looking towards Morocco, Tunisia and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. To others, it is a region in political turmoil where nation states have yet to come to terms with the challenge of radical Islam, a demographic time bomb or the need for solid institutions. Their worries centre on developments in Algeria, Libya and (also) Egypt. Arab North Africa offers trading partners a rich but frustrating blend of promise and problems. The EC has understood this, and will this autumn begin formal negotiations with Tunisia and Morocco to establish innovative free trade zones. Once concluded, these agreements linking North African states more closely to the European economy should substantially increase business opportunities  -on both flanks of the Mediterranean. Algeria is hungry for credit which cannot be supplied. To maintain debt repayments estimated at Dollars 9.1bn in 1993, when exports will not exceed Dollars 12bn, imports need to be held down. Reserves (minus gold stocks) had to be built to around Dollars 2bn by mid-1993, in spite of payments pressures. However, the market needs large-scale imports to stimulate higher industrial output or productive private enterprise. Algiers may now reschedule after years of resistance to such a strategy. The hydrocarbons sector will remain the focus of business activity. Egypt, the region's most populous country (59m), has gained from its 1991 debt accord with sovereign lenders to tie debt relief to progress on economic reforms, with a current account surplus capable of weathering the downturn in tourism and a build-up of foreign reserves giving increased scope for financing contracts. NBE now says it could finance larger schemes from its own resources. Private sector banks are emerging, notably Commercial International Bank, which is favoured by trade financiers. Reform has moved slowly, but privatisation is under way and full currency convertibility is expected. Substantial bilateral credits (especially from the US, France and Arab funds) and multilateral credits for projects (notably the power sector) are features of the market. Morocco is fast gaining support for the view that it can emerge as a Mediterranean investment and manufacturing centre. The dirham has been made convertible for current account transactions. An accelerating privatisation policy is stimulating new investment and interest from fund managers. In 1992, foreign investment (at Dollars 514m) for the first time exceeded the current account deficit. Trade flows have come under pressure from drought and a weak international phosphate market. Imports and exports are down in 1993. Drought meant that GDP fell by 2.9 per cent in 1992. But Morocco has emerged stronger from a decade of structural adjustment, and growth is reported in most sectors. Manufacturing exports are forecast to grow by 10 per cent in 1994. Reserves remain more than Dollars 3.5bn, sufficient to cover six months of imports. All leading ECAs now provide cover, although many have ceilings in place. Soft credits are often needed to secure larger orders. Tunisia is the country where everyone wants to do more business. Bankers and companies visit, admire the economy's positive points and creditworthiness - and then often leave empty-handed. All ECAs are fully on-cover. The government's strategy is based on investment-led growth, especially in technology-related industries. This is to maintain growth rates which rose to 8.6 per cent in 1992 and for Tunis to become 'the Singapore of the Mediterranean'. Growth is forecast at around 3 per cent in 1993. Inflation fell to 5.5 per cent in 1992, and birth rates are low. But the population (8.5m people) is too small to provide an important consumer market. Imports rose to a new high in 1992, but were less than Dollars 6bn. A few big industrial projects are under way, notably British Gas' Dollars 620m Miskar gasfield project. Tunisia is seen as a rare successful graduate of structural adjustment in Africa. In January the government introduced current account convertibility for imports andexports, leading to an unusual outburst from the visiting IMF managing-director Michel Camdessus who described it as 'the most beautiful present I have ever been given'. Mauritania is the smallest, most aid-dependent UMA market. Merchandise exports in 1991 were Dollars 230m and imports Dollars 211m. In December 1992, the IMF concluded a two-year enhanced structural adjustment facility. France dominates a market which has suffered recession in fishing and its few other industries. Libya is affected by sanctions, imposed as a consequence of the Lockerbie affair. Payments arrears can be endemic for all but priority projects. But the market continues to attract exporters in line with Libya's status as an Opec oil producer with a relatively small population (around 5m) and high imports (around Dollars 8bn). Libya remains the UK's largest UMA market, with exports worth Pounds 228m in 1992. Annual oil exports are Dollars 9 to Dollars 10bn. Tightening sanctions to include hydrocarbons and financial reserves would hurt. Libya is estimated to hold up to Dollars 17bn in liquid foreign assets and some Dollars 4bn fixed assets. Payments can be a problem. Contractors, including German and South Korean companies, often use long-term letters of credit to finance deals.   Countries:-  DZZ  Algeria, Africa.

The court records of the trial of Brigadier Johann Blaauw in  1989 show that De Klerk's statement to parliament contained  three direct lies about South Africa's collaboration with other  countries in the nuclear programme. It also indicates that he  underplayed the extent of the programme when he told of the  existence of no more than six crude atomic bombs. The record  also puts on display the level of corruption in the government  in the 1980's, allowing former minister of mines Fanie Botha, a  perpetual insolvent, to sit in parliament and the cabinet and  even serve as leader of the House. Judge J. Friedman said that  in order to hide his state of affairs Botha was ""prepared to  commit perjury, fraud and deceit; he was prepared to become  involved in political chicanery of the most despicable kind ...  he was prepared to lie to the prosecutor ... he was prepared to  lie deliberately under oath ... no reliance can be placed on his  evidence.""    Botha was later jailed for one year. Transcripts of the  trial confirm South Africa and Israel collaborated on the  development of nuclear weapons -- and prove De Klerk lied on  three counts:    -- He stated South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons  technology or material from another country.    -- He stated that South Africa had never provided material  to  another country.    -- He stated that South Africa had never co-operated with  another country in this regard.    The September 1989 Supreme Court judgment, in the ""in  camera""  case of former South African Air Force [SAAF] Brigadier Blaauw,  reveals startling details of South African-Israeli swaps of  nuclear weapon technology and material and extensive  collaboration between the two. Until now reporting on the  judgment has been banned under the Nuclear Energy Act and the  Criminal Procedure Act. As recently as last week, the  government tried to block the story threatening the SUNDAY TIMES  with an interdict if it printed it.    In October 1987, Blaauw was charged with attempting to  extort  mining concessions from Botha, by threatening to reveal that he  was financially bankrupt. During the trail it emerged that  Blaauw had in fact shored up Botha's finances with the help of  the Israelis and brokered many of the key nuclear deals between  South Africa and Israel. Blaauw was found not guilty on all  charges.    After his retirement from the SAAF in 1975, Blaauw acted as  a  go- between for Israel and South Africa on military matters. In  1976, he was approached by a member of an Israeli council  involved in the clandestine purchase of nuclear materials and  asked to obtain South African ""yellow cake"" for Israel. Yellow  cake is an uranium oxide which, when enriched, can be used for  the production of nuclear weapons.    Blaauw got agreement for the sale of 50 [metric] tons of  yellow cake from the then prime minister B.J. Vorster, and the  former head of the Bureau of State security, Hendrik van den  Bergh, despite resistance from the then minister of mines, Piet  Koornhof. Koornhof was replaced by Botha who was instructed to  ensure the deal went through. Blaauw arranged a tour of Israeli  military installations for Botha and the Israelis quickly struck  up a good relationship with Botha.    Said the judgment: ""Blaauw testified that there was, at that  stage, a high degree of confidence developing between the South  African and Israeli governments which involved the exchange of  military technology, joint aeronautic ventures and the supply of  `knowhow' by Israel to South Africa in regard to the manufacture  of weaponry.""    After the yellow cake deal went through, Blaauw was asked by  Van den Bergh to see if Israel would supply tritium to South  Africa. Tritium boosts the explosion of a nuclear bomb. The  Israelis agreed to supply 30g of tritium to South Africa --  enough for 12 atomic bombs. In exchange, South Africa delivered  two more consignments of yellow cake, of 50 [metric] tons and  500 [metric] tons, to Israel.    Details of the transactions are recorded in CRITICAL MASS, a  recently published book by William Burrows and Robert Windrem,  which investigates the proliferation of nuclear weapons among  developing countries. While the deals were going through, Botha  slid into bankruptcy and his political career was threatened by  a R[rand]1.7-million overdraft he owed Volkskas. But help was  at hand.    Said the judgment: ""The Israelis were interested in keeping  Botha in the portfolio of mines because the yellow cake  transactions had not yet fully materialised. There was every  possibility of Botha becoming the minister of defence and they  would have preferred Botha to hold that portfolio.""    The Israelis gave Blaauw $1-million -- then worth R800,000  --  as a ""gift for what I had done for them."" With the money,  Blaauw gave Botha cash transfusions and kept him financially and  politically alive. Blaauw and Botha fell out after Botha failed  to deliver valuable mining concessions promised to Blaauw as a  reward for his services to South Africa's nuclear programme, in  July 1979.    In court, Botha alleged Blaauw attempted to force him to  hand  over the concessions by threatening to reveal details of Botha's  illegal attempts to get evidence of corruption from his rivals  in the struggle for the leadership of the National Party, after  the fall of Vorster in 1979.    In his speech to parliament in March last year, when he  announced he had ordered the dismantling of South Africa's  nuclear arsenal, De Klerk baldly stated: ""I wish to emphasise  that at no time did South Africa acquire nuclear weapons  technology or materials from another country, nor has it  provided any to any other country, or co-operated with another  country in this regard.""    When confronted with the court records by the international  London based magazine, AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, which first broke  the story, the office of the state president replied: ""South  Africa did not acquire nuclear weapons technology from another  country. Although tritium many be used in initiators of nuclear  explosive devices, (although not in the devices produced by  South Africa) it has many other commercial uses. South Africa  has been active in the commercial exploitation of tritium for  some time and has procured this material from various sources in  the past.""    Despite De Klerk's 1993 announcement, details of South  Africa's nuclear programme remain shrouded in secrecy. Said ANC  [African National Congress] science and technology head Roger  Jardine: ""They are prepared to give a tour of the complex but  have never given details of the programme. A senior official  once offered to tell me everything -- but only if I signed the  Official Secrets Act.""     "

KCET station manager and programming chief Stephen Kulczycki, who last week  decided to drop the program, said Thursday that he stands by his original  objection that the program was slanted in favor of the African National  Congress but that he will monitor it in coming weeks to see if it becomes more  balanced.    ""We will continue to monitor the series on the satellite feeds and try to get  some sense of whether the concerns we've expressed might show up in the  program,"" Kulczycki said. ""If (the producers) address the concerns we have  talked about, we might reconsider the choices we have made.""    ""South Africa Now"" producer Danny Schechter said that he was pleased Kulczycki  had opened the door to reconsideration but that he will not do anything  differently because he feels the program has always been fair.    ""If he's going to monitor, he'll find that the same program he rejected will  have a balanced presentation of what's going on in South Africa,"" Schechter  said.    For now, however, ""South Africa Now"" remains scheduled to leave KCET after the  last installment of the current 13-week batch runs Sunday at 9 a.m.    KCET's decision not to renew the program has enraged members of the Los Angeles  African-American community and anti-apartheid groups, who have threatened to  picket the station.    Several brought their complaints to the regularly scheduled meeting of KCET's  Community Advisory Board on Wednesday, and the board, whose volunteer members  are appointed to provide community feedback to station management, took up the  cause.

0,FT922-4428 ,"FT922-4428 _AN-CFEA9AD0FT 920605   FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (15): New market beckons for banks - Complicated merger streamlines financial services sector      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE South African financial services sector is in healthier shape than it was a year ago, and the man most responsible for this is Mr Piet Badenhorst, the formidable chief executive of Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa). Driven by a healthy ego and massive determination, he is a feared and respected figure in the banking community. Last year, he was the driving force behind the complicated merger which brought the United Building Society (UBS), Volkskas, Allied and part of the Sage group together to form Absa. This year he took the process a stage further by swallowing up Bankorp, the weakest of the big five banks in South Africa, in the process making Absa by far the largest bank in the country in terms of assets (the Standard Bank group remains largest by market capitalisation). Absa have a lot of digesting to do, and not all of it will be pleasant. 'Merger business is hell on wheels', in Mr Badenhorst's own graphic phrase. Apart from having to effect a very high number of retrenchments, Absa also have to come to terms with the rotten apples which constitute part of Bankorp's inheritance. As one senior banker notes: 'The last bite of the cherry may not be so sweet as the first."" While Absa, for some time yet, will remain preoccupied with putting its own house in order, the impacts of the shake-up in the sector promise to be far-reaching. Mr Badenhorst believes the formation of Absa will have two main effects: 'maverick marketing', the product of too many institutions competing for the same business, and epitomised by 'ridiculous rates of interest being paid and credit being offered without proper screening', will cease with four institutions now under the same umbrella. Second, with less competition for employees, terms of employment will become more realistic as, in Mr Badenhorst's words, the 'artificial scarcity of skills' disappears. 'The employment market is shifting to the employer,' he says. The significance of the Absa merger is that the operational savings are large enough to give the group a fundamental advantage in terms of providing a low-cost banking service. South Africa has a very sophisticated financial services sector, but it is very much oriented towards the needs of the white, essentially First World, community. The challenge of the future is to address the needs of the developing market - largely black, and Third World in nature. Mr Louis Shill, chairman of the Sage group and also chairman of the Life Offices Association (LOA), believes that the challenge facing all providers of financial services in South Africa is to 'get down our unit costs to provide mass market products'. The challenge to be overcome is that it is very difficult to be profitable with below-average sized products, whether they be bank accounts or life policies. Mr Shill believes that addressing the needs of the new market will require new structures. 'We can't take our company that is aimed at the very upper end of the market and adapt it to a completely different market. There's a world of difference between Harrods and Pick 'n Pay (a South African supermarket), though they both supply food.' New products will also be required and intensive education of staff and clients. Mr Shill notes, for example, that at the lower end of the market, life policies are primarily seen as savings devices, and it is not always appreciated that the money is not available on call. At the moment, addressing the needs of the black market tends to take the form of the large groups setting up satellite operations, such as Liberty's Charter Life and Southern's African Life, in the insurance field, and First National Bank's Future Bank initiative. Mr Badenhorst, however, argues that the process must go one stage further. He says there is a perception and a need in the black community that they need their own institutions. He envisages these developing, probably with the assistance of existing banks, initially at the lower end of the housing finance spectrum. Although the jockeying for position in the developing market is driven by a keen sense of where new business is going to come from, it goes further than this. Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, comments: 'The conflict between poverty and democracy is South Africa's greatest dilemma. If we want to survive in a democratic society we First World institutions must get involved.' He notes that the commercial banks play more of a role in the urban areas where their activities are centred. Addressing the financial and developmental needs of the rural communities is a burden, he suggests, which will have to be carried more by parastatal bodies. Other than addressing the developing market, the main strategic challenge facing the local banking industry is their re-integration into the world community. On the one hand, this involves setting up offices abroad. Local banks are anxious to 'follow the flag' and set up offices abroad so they can provide services, primarily trade finance and foreign exchange advice. On the other hand, banks are facing the prospect of foreign competition on the home front. The areas where this is most likely to come is in the 'blue-chip' corporate market and project finance. Foreign banks can set up representative offices, unrestrained by local capital requirements, and offer off-shore credit lines at lower rates than local banks. Their experience in project finance will probably also allow them to obtain a share of the business if significant capital projects such as the Columbus stainless steel venture get the go-ahead. Foreign banks will not attempt to compete with high-street banks and local merchant banks are also considered to have a strong hold on mergers and acquisitions business. The main day-to-day challenge for the banks is maintaining profitability in an inflationary environment. Although the impact of a protracted recession is evident in the sharply higher provisions for bad debts at the large banks, these have been more than offset by the comfortable interest margins of about 4 per cent that are being enjoyed. Recent results from the Standard Bank group, First National Bank and Nedcor saw earnings per share rise by 20 per cent in the case of the first two and 13 per cent in the case of Nedcor. Although all the banks are anxious to put assets on their books, demand for credit is low and banks themselves are lending very selectively. South Africa's main banks are all adequately capitalised, though it is difficult to maintain this position through retentions alone given the high inflation rate. This explains Standard's offering of a scrip dividend option and the recent rights offer by First National Bank, taking advantage of a favourable market rating.

0,FT941-17370 ,"FT941-17370 _AN-EAECPABLFT 940105   FT  05 JAN 94 / Peasant army embarrasses Mexico: The insurrection in Chiapas may alter government policy      By DAMIAN FRASER   The attack by up to a thousand armed peasants on four Mexican towns in the southern state of Chiapas presents the government of President Carlos Salinas with an acute political problem. Despite the negligible military threat from the rebels, who were last night reported to be retreating, the uprising comes at a time when the government is keen to project Mexico as a peaceful and stable country ready to become a member of the first world of rich nations. The insurrection offers a very different image, and underscores the social and political difficulties ahead as Mexico joins the North American Free Trade Agreement. The troubles coincide with the beginning of the campaign to elect Mr Salinas's successor this August. If the violence continues, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's candidate, may have to go further in making social development rather than economic reform the key element of his political platform. The uprising has already led to nearly 90 deaths, and countless more victims have been wounded. The rebels have ceded control of three of the four towns seized on New Year's Day - San Cristobal, Las Margaritas and Ococingo - while reporters visiting Altamirano, which had been held until early yesterday, said they saw no sign of them. Known as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the guerrillas declared war on the government on behalf of the country's indigenous people. They said they timed the New Year's Day insurrection to coincide with the formal enactment of Nafta, a treaty they said would be a death sentence for natives. Their fight was for 'work, land, housing, food, health care, education, independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace'. Most of the rebels are poor Maya natives from the region, although some of the leaders are reported to be from the centre of the country. They appear well-financed and organised, suggesting perhaps links with drug or arms smugglers. The government quickly painted them as radical groups with little popular base or support, and bent on violence at no cost. An official said they were supported by Guatemalan guerrillas and other Central Americans, and had ties to the leftist clergy in the state. However, government critics see the violence as the product of the extreme poverty and repression afflicting Chiapas for centuries. It is by some measures Mexico's poorest state, with lowest levels of installed electricity, literacy and school attendance rates in the country. The state is dominated by political bosses who belong to the PRI, and has one of the worst records of human rights abuses by the police and army. Disputes over land have turned into violent clashes between poor peasants and the rich landowners who control the economy of the state. Last year the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, an independent US organisation, accused Mexico's military of torturing indigenous peoples in the state. Other reports by Amnesty International and Americas Watch have catalogued similar abuses. The Minnesota report concluded: 'The lawless practices of the Mexican military have been increasingly tolerated at the highest levels of Mexican government.' The charges were denied by the government-controlled Human Rights Commission, but have long been made by the local Catholic Church, which actively supports the rights of natives. While Mr Salinas's economic reforms have made many Mexicans better off, they have yet to improve the lot of the rural poor, most of whom are found in southern states such as Chiapas. According to the government statistics institute and the United Nations, the number of people living in extreme poverty in rural areas increased from 6.7m in 1984 to 8.4m in 1989 and 8.8m in 1992. During the past four years the government has poured billions of dollars into the Solidarity anti-poverty programme, of which Chiapas has been the biggest recipient. However, this programme has not been able to offset the impact of the removal of agricultural and other subsidies, and the decline in prices of products such as coffee. The opposition to Nafta reflects a widely held view that the south of Mexico is unlikely to benefit as much as the north or the centre. Many Chiapas workers live off corn they produce, or on coffee farms. Under Nafta, Mexico will gradually open up to corn imports, and demand for farm labour is expected by most economists to fall sharply. The government's immediate response to such problems is to pour more money into the state. The social development minister said on Monday the government would establish new programmes to address the problems of the region. It remains to be seen whether such spending will be sufficient, or if a broader political solution to the rights of indigenous peoples is necessary.                        *      *      *  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                               CHIAPAS STATE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It is one of Mexico's least-developed and most violence-prone  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- It has only 4 per cent of the nation's population but 25 per cent of its land disputes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- About 30 per cent of its 3.2m residents are illiterate; one in four speaks an indigenous language but not Spanish  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- About 20 per cent of children do not attend school, partly because not enough teachers speak both Spanish and indigenous languages; roads are scarce and bad  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The state has been made even poorer and less stable by thousands of undocumented central American refugees trying to reach the US  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Success in winning converts by both Roman Catholics and Protestants, the latter of whom were encouraged by the authorities in the 1940s to counter Catholic power, has exacerbated tensions: village leaders have expelled thousands of converts, accusing them of undermining Mayan traditions  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Associated Press  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  MXZ  Mexico.

0,FT933-1422 ,"FT933-1422 _AN-DIXCIABDFT 930924   FT  24 SEP 93 / Reform 'failing' in African states      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and PETER NORMAN      LONDON, WASHINGTON   ECONOMIC reform is failing in sub-Saharan Africa and its crisis will deepen unless finance ministers at the IMF/World Bank meeting in Washington help resolve the region's 'crushing' external debt burden, officials of Oxfam, the international aid agency, warned yesterday. 'After a decade of structural adjustment programmes implemented under the tutelage of the World Bank and the IMF, Africa remains trapped in a downward spiral of economic and social decline and poverty is increasing,' the agency said in London. 'There is now overwhelming evidence that existing adjustment policies have failed in two ways,' it said. 'They have not created a platform for sustainable recovery and have not addressed the central challenge, correctly identified by the World Bank, of alleviating poverty.' However, the Bank's policies 'suffer from inappropriate design, inadequate funding and poor implementation', the statement continues. Some of the sharpest criticism is reserved for the IMF, whose role in Africa should be reviewed by an international committee reporting to the United Nations, Oxfam said. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, strongly defended its role in Africa against Oxfam's charges, while admitting that the situation in Africa was 'a matter of immense concern'. But he said there were countries in Africa that were growing - ones that had followed IMF economic reform programmes that had allowed increased output and exports. Countries such as Mozambique, Uganda, Ghana and Ethiopia were all benefiting from IMF-inspired policies. More could be done, he added. There was scope for greater regional integration in Africa. Those countries which had not embarked on structural adjustment programmes must put their macro-economic policies in order. Mr Camdessus said there was much that industrialised countries could do to improve the situation. Africa would benefit most from early conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Oxfam says the speed at which IMF programmes require governments to reduce budget deficits is 'totally unrealistic and destructive'. The statement calls for longer time frames and 'more selective introduction of trade liberalisation measures.' Debt servicing takes up a quarter of the region's exports, although only half of scheduled payments are being met. Arrears currently exceed Dollars 11bn and are building up at an alarming rate. Oxfam called on the IMF to create a special fund to write off part of Africa's debt through the sale of gold stocks.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

0,FT943-13738 ,"FT943-13738 _AN-EGRD8AE1FT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (5): East Asian 'miracle' is needed - Economic policy must deliver stable growth and jobs      By TONY HAWKINS   No matter how one crunches the numbers, it is obvious that the fate of the new South Africa lies in the hands of foreign investors, bankers and fund managers. This is little more than a statement of the obvious in an increasingly integrated global economy, but also a result of a capital outflow of some Dollars 25bn since the mid-1980s. Reversing this capital outflow is the top priority, since foreign capital is likely to make all the difference between sluggish growth of 2.5-3 per cent annually and expansion of at least 5 per cent a year. Recognition of this unpalatable reality has bred a new consensus within the African National Congress to accept the inevitable trade-off between fiscal and monetary discipline on one hand and social upliftment spending programmes on the other. That consensus remains firm, despite the unwelcome news that Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, has decided to resign, from October. He leaves behind an overtly pro-business, supplyside budget that will do little for populist expectations in the short term; and an economic team which gives every sign of carrying on his policies without him. At the same time, the foreign capital issue is splitting the country into two camps, with many in the business establishment urging the new administration to lift at least some exchange controls and abolish the financial rand. 'With a sound conservative budget behind us, commodity prices improving and massive world support and sympathy, there will never be a better time for dropping the finrand,' says one banker who also warned: 'The climate for exchange control liberalisation is not going to get any better'. 'The cute money' he adds, 'is waiting for the second shoe to drop, for the inevitable decline in the commercial rand, before taking the plunge.' The danger is that this could turn out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy as foreign investors watch and wait for exchange controls to be loosened. Having achieved the seemingly impossible on the political front, President Mandela's new government now needs an economic miracle. South Africa must become the first non-Asian country to replicate the East Asian miracle of growth with equity. The numbers in this year's United Nations Human Development Report underscore the challenge. South Africa, with a gross domestic product of Dollars 120bn and one of the world's 25 biggest economies, ranks 93 in terms of human development, and sixtieth in terms of income a head. The UN says that if white South Africa were treated as a separate country, it would rank 24th in the world, just below Spain, while if the same were done for black South Africa, it would rank 123rd, just above Congo and behind Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Vietnam. The sheer unsustainability of such comparisons, now that the black majority is in the driving seat, highlights the formidable nature of the economic challenge. It is not just a matter of jerking the economy back on to the relatively high growth path of the 1950s and 60s - 5 per cent annually - which will be difficult enough, but of restructuring it to ensure substantially greater participation for those marginalised for the past 300 years. East Asian experience shows this can be done although whether South Africa is ready for the sacrifices this will involve is another matter. With the commodity cycle having passed its trough, the global economy on the mend and South Africa's investment climate looking better than at any time for at least 40 years, the economy is poised for a period of sustained growth. Even so, few economists believe that growth of more than 2.5-3.5 per cent is on the cards for the next two years, while for the rest of the century, a battery of constraints - the cumulative legacies of apartheid, the balance of payments, unsustainable levels of domestic debt, the shortage of skills and the need to restructure manufacturing - will keep expansion below 5 per cent annually. At issue is the new government's capacity to impose restructuring while simultaneously delivering on the social front. In the first post-apartheid budget last month, Mr Keys set a near-perfect example. Given the constraints on fiscal expansion - a budget deficit of 6.6 per cent of GDP at a time when the country is teetering on the edge of a domestic debt trap - the minister focused on reallocating public spending rather than raising taxes to fund social upliftment programmes. He managed to find R2.5bn (Dollars 700m) in savings from normal departmental votes to finance the ANC's Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), while leaving unscathed those earning less than R50,000 (Dollars 14,000) annually. The RDP is the instrument designed to redress the ills of apartheid - the yawning chasm between white and black living standards. The government has 'pencilled in' RDP spending of R37.5bn over the next five years on health, education, housing and land. The plan is that government's contribution will be leveraged by private sector contributions, especially in housing, by the parastatals - high-density township electrification and telecommunications - and by foreign donors. The Keys rubric - avidly shared by others in the government's economic team  -is that spending overruns on normal departmental votes will erode the 'pot of money' available for such social programmes. While initial market response to the budget was favourable, it was not long before second-thoughts surfaced. Some of this had more to do with global developments than the budget, but in the words of one government adviser: 'The markets don't trust us . . . Because there is no track record, we have a credibility problem.' But while the confidence factor is certainly critical at this stage, there is more to it than that. Almost everyone wants to see exchange controls and the financial rand abolished, but while many in the business community believe this can - indeed must - be done soon, ministers and their advisers are much more cautious. The central bank governor Dr Chris Stals, has set three conditions for financial rand abolition: that the discount on the investment currency falls below 10 per cent; a substantial reduction in financial rand balances, estimated at R4.5bn, held with the banks; and, most important of all, a build-up in the country's foreign reserves, which in May had fallen to R7.2bn, some five weeks import cover. These three conditions are unlikely to be satisfied this year and possibly not until mid-1995, or even beyond. However, the critics warn that an overly cautious administration will always find reasons to delay. Their argument stands and falls on the assumption that the end of the financial rand would spark huge capital inflows, without which the economy will remain stuck in the slow lane. Government economists, question whether now is the time for a 'leap over the cliff' that could end in tears with interest rates of 30-40 per cent, the commercial rand down a further 20 per cent and the government's credibility in tatters. Countries such as Kenya, Uganda and Zimbabwe have all shown that exchange control liberalisation can result in exchange rate appreciation and a rapid increase in reserves. But Mr Keys believes South Africa is different, with wealthy individuals, cash-rich corporates and institutional investors just waiting for the opportunity to invest offshore. Officials point out that South Africa is not as under-borrowed as often suggested, noting that while foreign debt is only a modest 14 per cent of GDP, if foreign holdings of equities, and fixed interest securities, are added in, the ratio doubles. Dr Stals questions whether South Africa is ready for 'the burden of convertibility' - the impact that premature exchange control abolition might have on the exchange rate, inflation, wages and interest rates. It is ironic that the private sector, so insistent that now is the time for 'an economic leap of faith like the constitutional agreement', is more pessimistic about the economic fundamentals - inflation, growth and the new administration's capacity to impose fiscal discipline, than the government. Private sector economists believe not just that the trough of the inflationary cycle has passed but that inflation, which touched a 21-year low of 7.1 per cent in April, edging fractionally higher to 7.2 per cent in May, could be back in double-digit figures before the end of 1995. There are real reservations, too, about the fiscal strategy. The 1994 budget is a stop-gap affair; the really tough decisions will come next March when the new minister will have to act on the advice of the recently-appointed Tax Commission, on such issues as zero-rated valued added tax for basic foods, equal tax treatment for women and inflation-adjustment taxation to minimise fiscal drag. All are very worthy causes in their own right, but each one comes with a price tag at a time when the RDP is certain to bulk large on the spending side of the ledger. All of this suggests that the markets will have to live with the uncertainty surrounding the future of the financial rand for least another nine months. In the meantime, after a poor first six months, the economy is picking up, but with growth of little more than 5-5.5 per cent over the next 18 months, unemployment is set to worsen while living standards stagnate. 'It all comes back to track records,' says an industrialist. 'If the government gets the next budget as right as this one, and exchange controls go early next year, we could be on our way. . .' President Mandela's problem is that he doesn't have a year or two in which to await meaningful results. Its not that expectations are excessive but that the new administration must deliver soon in the fields of township electrification, housing, more school places and improved social services, but also on the key issue of jobs. The World Bank estimates that half the country's black workforce is without formal sector employment. Optimistic as ever, the Bank believes that given appropriate policies, including wage restraint and fiscal discipline, this ratio could halve within 10 years. If President Mandela can deliver jobs on this scale, he will indeed have performed a remarkable double-whammy - an economic as well as a political miracle. But in the 1990s world of jobless growth this has the ring of mission impossible.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

In Washington yesterday, Mr Trevor Manuel, South African trade and industry minister, said that the US and South African governments are working on various bilateral initiatives, including an investment pact, a double taxation treaty, and a conference in Atlanta to start tomorrow. South Africa plans to hold its largest trade exposition ever, on September 20-23 in New York City's convention centre. This will feature 150 South African businesses from a broad range of industries, including clothing, textile, furniture, domestic appliances, base materials, agricultural and industrial equipment, banking and financial services. Mr Manuel said the new government expects companies doing business in South Africa to adhere voluntarily to affirmative action plans for women and black people. The US commerce department, believing South Africa to be the key to trade in all of southern Africa, has marked the country for special attention by putting it on its list of 10 Emerging Markets, where it expects exports to grow the most. Also, the US Overseas Private Investment Corporation is increasing its investment insurance in South Africa to Dollars 50m (Pounds 33m). The US Export-Import Bank last year lifted conditions imposed because of apartheid. US exports to South Africa stand at Dollars 2.2bn, with South African exports to the US at nearly Dollars 2bn.

0,FT932-477 ,"FT932-477 _AN-DF2CGABKFT 930629   FT  29 JUN 93 / South Africa and EC begin reconciliation: The shaping of post-sanctions relations      By PHILIP GAWITH   AS South Africa moves into the post-sanctions era, aid, trade and political relations are being shaped with a crucial partner - the European Community. At a conference under way in Brussels both the European Commission and the South African government are laying out their stalls. Notwithstanding the tortuous progress of constitutional negotiations, Community officials accept that a new South Africa is emerging, and they are determined to be an important player in the post-apartheid process. There is already a substantial base of trade and investment relations to build on. Figures from the department of customs and excise show that in 1992 38.5 per cent, R46bn (Pounds 9.5bn) of a total R119.4bn visible trade, was with Europe. This compares with 34 per cent in 1985, before sanctions were implemented in earnest. European countries also account for most of the foreign investment in South Africa. The most recent available figures from the Reserve Bank (end 1988) show that of the cumulative R70bn foreign investment in the country by individuals and corporations, about 50 per cent came from Europe. The EC is also a significant donor to South Africa. The 1993 EC aid budget to South Africa is Ecu90m (Pounds 70.7m), its largest budget in Africa. Diplomatic links between South Africa and the EC are less developed. There is no formal diplomatic treaty and the EC is not formally present in Pretoria other than to administer its aid programme. Upgrading these links is important to South Africa, however, as the imprimatur of full diplomatic relations will improve the climate for trade and investment. Recent years have seen increasing efforts at diversification, mostly eastwards, of South Africa's trading links. Thus 20 per cent of South Africa's total trade in 1992 was with Asia, compared with 14.7 per cent in 1985. Taiwan has risen from nowhere to be one of South Africa's top 10 trading partners. Among South Africa's priorities in talks with Brussels will be what sort of trade preferences it should seek from the EC, which could affect 20 per cent of exports, most notably those from labour-intensive agriculture. The extent of preferences will depend on what sort of trading status South Africa is granted. Although a per capita annual income of about Dollars 2,300 ranks it as an upper middle-income developing country, other indicators - such as infant mortality, literacy, and reliance on a few commodity exports - are associated more with developing countries. At the conference yesterday Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve (central) Bank, said South Africa should consider seeking developing country status. 'I do not think that will decrease our credibility, but it will help us to develop the country much faster,' he said. His remarks, which were made in a personal capacity, echo the view on this issue held among others by Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress president. At recent Gatt discussions in Geneva, however, Japan and the US gave notice that they would not support South Africa being given developing country status. It was advised to seek 'economy in transition' status, such as has been given to various east European countries, which affords similar benefits granted to developing countries, but on a less permanent basis. Given this background, South Africa will probably try to negotiate some specially tailored package of preferences with the EC rather than try to join the Lome Convention, a trade concession deal between a grouping of developing countries and industrialised countries. The latter route would cause all sorts of complications, as Lome's existing 80 members, all of whom are smaller and less developed than South Africa, would understandably oppose granting benefits to South Africa which, to some extent, would come at their expense. Included in this group are all of South Africa's neighbours. The EC has already made clear that its policy towards South Africa will be premised on viewing South Africa as part of the southern Africa region. Although there are growing ties between South Africa and its neighbours, the issue of how to integrate it into regional structures, such as the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) is fraught with excessive expectations of what South Africa can do for the rest of the region and fears that it will dominate the others. South Africa accounts for about 75 per cent of regional gross domestic product. Although the shape of future South Africa/EC relations lies mostly in the hands of Brussels - where the extent of any concessions will be decided - their success will be determined in Pretoria. For South Africa's future will ultimately turn on whether its politicians can create a favourable climate for investment. If they fail in that, the rest will count for little.

Mr Jacques Diouf, who promised to make Africa his priority when elected head of the UN's main food agency last year, will detail a worsening hunger situation when he opens the meeting. 'Fifteen countries in the region are currently facing exceptional food emergencies and half of these countries are also being affected by civil strife,' the report said. Rwanda and Burundi were listed as being extreme cases, and in need of continued international aid and 'extreme agricultural rehabilitation'. The report also said famine conditions were emerging in several parts of the Horn of Africa including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, Somalia and Sudan.

SUMMARY:     Pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act, notice is hereby given that the Department of State will on a case-by-case basis consider licenses and approvals for (1) marketing proposals to sell United States Munitions List items to South Africa and for (2) export of the minimum basic operational and maintenance data necessary to support such proposals. However, exports of defense articles and services subject to the United Nations arms embargo on South Africa will not be approved while the embargo remains in force.            EFFECTIVE DATE:     March 24, 1994.            FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:      John Clarkson, Political-Military Affairs Officer, Office of Export Control Policy, Defence Trade Policy, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State (202) 6474231.            SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     South Africa is currently under a mandatory arms export embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council, and is a proscribed destination for exports of defense articles and services pursuant to 22 CFR 126.1. However, it is contemplated that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider, on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes. The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services (other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided for in 126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force.           Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country referred to in 126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Effective immediately, this requirement no longer applies to South Africa. However, the obligation to inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls of actual sales or transfers to South Africa remains in place.     The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include proposals, within the meaning of 22 CFR 126.1(e), to sell or transfer defense articles and services. This policy also covers licenses and approvals to export the minimum basic technical data in the form of operations and maintenance information related to a defense article or service which is necessary to support a sales proposal. For this purpose, a proposal is defined as the communication of information in sufficient detail to permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. This would include a presentation which describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery. This policy does not cover technical data which discloses the details of design, development, production or manufacture of any defense item. Nor does it permit the use, with respect to articles originating in or for export to South Africa, of any exemptions except those already permitted by 126.1 (i.e., 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13)). Furthermore, the requirements of 126.8, regarding proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment, remain in place.     This action has been taken pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and 126.7 of the ITAR in furtherance of the foreign policy of the United States.

However, it is contemplated that the embargo may end once certain events take place. Because of this, the Department of State will now consider, on a case-by-case basis, granting licenses and approvals for proposals to sell defense articles and defense services to South Africa and to export the minimum amount of basic operations and maintenance technical data necessary to support such proposals, so long as assurances are received that this data will be used in support of such proposals and for no other purpose. Approvals for the export of the aforementioned technical data will only be granted if the Director, Office of Defense Trade Controls, receives reliable assurances from the foreign end-user that it will only use the technical data for evaluation and informational purposes related to the proposed sale, and not for any other purposes. The Department of State will not grant licenses for the actual sale or export of defense articles and defense services (other than for the aforementioned technical data and for exceptions in accordance with current policy as provided for in 126.1(c)) while the U.N. arms embargo against South Africa and U.S. regulations prohibiting the export to South Africa of defense articles and services are in force.           Section 126.1(e) also provides that any person who knows or has reason to know of a proposal to sell or transfer to a country referred to in 126.1, or to any person acting on its behalf, any defense articles, defense services or technical data subject to the ITAR must immediately inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls. Effective immediately, this requirement no longer applies to South Africa. However, the obligation to inform the Office of Defense Trade Controls of actual sales or transfers to South Africa remains in place.     The licenses and approvals subject to this policy include proposals, within the meaning of 22 CFR 126.1(e), to sell or transfer defense articles and services. This policy also covers licenses and approvals to export the minimum basic technical data in the form of operations and maintenance information related to a defense article or service which is necessary to support a sales proposal. For this purpose, a proposal is defined as the communication of information in sufficient detail to permit an intended purchaser to decide either to acquire the particular equipment in question or to enter into a manufacturing license agreement or technical assistance agreement. This would include a presentation which describes the equipment's performance characteristics, price, and probable availability for delivery. This policy does not cover technical data which discloses the details of design, development, production or manufacture of any defense item. Nor does it permit the use, with respect to articles originating in or for export to South Africa, of any exemptions except those already permitted by 126.1 (i.e., 123.17 and 125.4(b)(13)). Furthermore, the requirements of 126.8, regarding proposals to foreign persons relating to significant military equipment, remain in place.     This action has been taken pursuant to section 38 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778) and 126.7 of the ITAR in furtherance of the foreign policy of the United States.              Dated: March 14, 1994.         Robert L. Gallucci,         Assistant Secretary, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Department of State.

0,FT944-9002 ,"FT944-9002 _AN-EKQEIAD9FT 941117   FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Complacency about escalation of debt      From Ms ANN PETTIFOR   Sir, Barry Riley (Weekend Money, November 12/13) is a little too complacent about the indebtedness of poor countries. 'Most of such countries,' he says, 'have been allowed to renege on the bulk of their debts and are now at various stages of a third world economic boom.' This is unfair and untrue. Because of what Keynes called 'the magic of compound interest', because of high real rates of interest, and because of unfavourable exchange rate movements, every single month between 1982 and 1990 - every month not year - the poor of the south paid the rich north Dollars 12.5bn. This is as much as the entire third world spends on health and education combined. Interest arrears on long-term debt owed to official creditors has risen from Dollars 126m at the beginning of the 1980s to more than Dollars 10bn today, and more than half of the debt owed by poor countries to the Paris Club now consists of capitalised interest. Over the period 1993-1996 poor countries are scheduled to pay an average of USDollars 41bn a year to their creditors - most of them rich OECD governments. This is two to five times as much as they were able to pay in 1992. Of growing concern is the stock of debt owed by developing countries to the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, which has risen faster than any other type of debt. It tripled from Dollars 98bn in 1982 to Dollars 304bn in 1992. Furthermore, there is no mechanism for the rescheduling or reduction of this debt. Translated into ability to pay, Africa is more debt-distressed than any other developing region. Its debt has spiralled from Dollars 8.4bn in 1980 to just under Dollars 200bn now. This is equivalent to 110 per cent of Africa's entire income. The Debt Crisis Network, an alliance of 40 organisations working in, or linked to, developing countries, has welcomed the chancellor's recognition of 'the unsustainable debt burden' of the poorest countries. We only wish that his concern was shared by columnists on your newspaper, so that your readers may not all be rudely jolted out of complacency by the next debt crisis.

By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Keith Diepraam was 20 years old in 1964 when he competed in his first Davis Cup  tennis match. Norway was playing host to South Africa. There had been some  trouble with anti-apartheid protesters before the South African team arrived,  but no one had any idea the situation would get so out of hand.    The security around the competition site was massive, but so was the group of  anti-South African protesters. Spectators had to walk through a hail of  leaflets to get into the stadium. It didn't stop inside -- the protesters had  bought tickets, too.    Diepraam was warming up for his match on center court when he heard a whistle.  Suddenly, there was a rush of people around him. In moments, anti-apartheid  activists were sitting all over the tennis court, forming a sea of protesters  through which Diepraam and his Norwegian opponent appeared to be be wading.    Diepraam still has a news photograph taken at the time. In it, he is looking at  all the people and laughing, with a slightly bewildered look.    Twenty-six years later, tennis officials in South Africa are still bewildered,  but they are no longer laughing. Some believe they have been betrayed by their  international federation, abandoned by professional tennis players and  manipulated by sports administrators with an agenda heavy on politics and  personal ambition.    Tennis in South Africa is an interesting study of the before and after of  international sanctions. While other sports, primarily those in the Olympic  Games, faced elaborate bans and boycotts, South African tennis players at one  time were free to travel the world to compete. And although there were some  protests, they were mainly restricted to Davis Cup competition, in which  players represented their countries.    So, in a nation of sports isolation, South African tennis and its professional  players happily globetrotted while other athletes stayed home. In fact, given  South Africa's mild climate, tennis thrived. South Africa has produced such  stars as Frew McMillan, Bob Hewitt, Ray Moore, Kevin Curren, Johan Kriek, Cliff  Drysdale, Ros Fairbank and Christo van Rensburg.    That was the before. The after began last January, when the International  Olympic Committee ruled that any tennis player who played in South Africa would  not be eligible to compete in the Olympics. Tennis became a medal sport in  1988.    The ruling has forced many of the world's tennis players to make a difficult  decision. South African tennis tournaments have not only tradition and  hospitality but also very competitive purses. Also, in the past, the South  African Grand Prix tournaments were important to players because they award  points that go toward determining who will play in the men's year-ending  Masters tournament, in which only the top eight singles players in the world  compete.    American Brad Gilbert came under fire in 1987 for playing in a tournament at  Johannesburg two weeks before the Masters, to earn enough points to qualify for  the latter event. American Tim Mayotte was battling Gilbert for the eighth and  final spot but chose not to play in South Africa. And because of previous  commitments, Mayotte could not play in another tournament the next week, the  last week to earn points, thereby failing to qualify for the Masters.    These very different decisions were subjected to intense scrutiny.    Mayotte chose not to play in South Africa because he had already drawn the ire  of anti-apartheid groups when he played there several years previously. For  that, Mayotte had been placed on a United Nations blacklist, but he was not  alone. Some of tennis' brightest stars have at some point been on it, including  Chris Evert and Boris Becker.    Gilbert argued that his decision to play in South Africa had nothing to do with  politics, but everything to do with his job.    ""I'm a tennis player and not a politician,"" he said in an interview in New York  in 1987. ""I don't think sports and politics should be mixed. I went to  Johannesburg because I needed points to qualify for the Masters. I'd have gone  to the moon to get here. If I hadn't gone to Johannesburg, I'd be sitting on  the sidelines now.""    South African tennis did not have a good year in 1989. First, the revamped  Assn. of Tennis Professionals, the men's pro tour now run by the players,  scheduled two stops in South Africa for the following year. Then the ATP  canceled the tournaments for ""moral and practical reasons,"" according to ATP  President Vijay Amritraj.    The ATP's player council was widely criticized for scheduling the events and in  August held a five-hour discussion on the subject. Leading the group arguing to  remove the tournaments from the 1990 schedule was former Wimbledon champion  Arthur Ashe.    After the decision to pull out, Amritraj said: ""For the last six or eight  months, we had this question asked of us everywhere, all around the world. It  overshadowed everything we had done with the tour. These two events were  canceled for the good of the tour. The Olympics are a major factor, so is the  United Nations boycott, and the fact that South Africa is not a respected  member of the world sports community.""    Meanwhile, satellite events in South Africa, lesser tournaments for which  players receive points in the ATP rankings, continue.    About a month after the ATP decision, the International Tennis Federation  suspended South Africa as an associate member until the country dismantles  apartheid.    When tennis joined the Olympic family, it also got its rules. Ray Moore, a  former touring pro from South Africa and a former chairman of the Men's  International Professional Tennis Council, said the day tennis entered the  Olympics was the day South African tennis was dealt a deadly blow.    ""There are a lot of negative things that have come down on our heads directly  because of tennis getting into the Olympics,"" Moore said. He lives in Palm  Springs and was back in South Africa for a brief meeting with the South African  Tennis Union regarding a junior program he is coordinating.    ""We certainly didn't need it. We were going along quite nicely. Yes, our  players overseas were restricted from playing in some countries. They weren't  happy about it, but they were grateful. They could play in half of Western  Europe. They could compete in 50-60 tournaments a year. They could accept that.    ""We've been lucky in our sport. We've escaped the wrath of SANROC (South  African Non Racial Olympic Committee, a London-based anti-apartheid lobby) and  the other organizations that have tried to stop international sport in this  country. Now, that's changed. Tennis is in the Olympics, and all of a sudden,  professional tennis in this country comes under the microscope of the Olympic  Charter. I have very, very strong views about that. I think it's steeped in  hypocrisy. What the ITF has done is hypocritical in the extreme.""    Moore believes that ITF President Phillipe Chatrier worked with Juan Antonio  Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, to get tennis into  the Games because Samaranch loves tennis. He had promised to help Chatrier  become an IOC representative. So, the personal agenda of these two men changed  tennis forever.    South Africa was a founding member of the ITF in 1913 and has been in Davis Cup  competition since its inception. Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

Yet since apartheid was installed in South  Africa in 1948, there has continually been some form of protest in the tennis  community. The only time South Africa won the Davis Cup was in 1974, by  default, the only default in the finals in the Cup's 90-year history.    India refused to play South Africa in protest against apartheid. Four years  later, South Africa voluntarily withdrew from Davis Cup competition.    American Davis Cup stalwart John McEnroe has been a consistently strong critic  of apartheid, having once turned down $1 million to play an exhibition in South  Africa.    McEnroe also told Ashe, a former U.S. Davis Cup captain, that he would never  play on a Davis Cup team with Curren or Kriek, both former South Africans who  have U.S. citizenship.    Some countries are stepping up the pressure, too. Israel played India in the  Davis Cup quarterfinals in 1987. In order to gain visas for India, Israeli  players Amos Mansdorf and Shlomo Glickstein signed statements denouncing  apartheid and pledging not to play in South Africa.    A few months later, Mansdorf competed in the South African Open and said he  didn't feel in any way bound by the pledge.    The campaign against South African tennis players has been stepped up recently.  Sam Ramsamy, leader of SANROC, singled out South African tennis players as  targets of a new campaign to isolate South Africa. Ramsamy said his group had  worked out a ""secret strategy"" to do this.    The strategy may be secret, but it certainly appears to be little more than a  combination of increased vigilance and louder protests.    The Australian Open in January was an example of the intensified pressure.    Officials permitted the Australian Anti-Apartheid Movement to hang banners on  center court and distribute leaflets. South African players in the tournament  were picketed. Trade unions threatened to disrupt the event. At least one South  African, Van Rensburg, had to be escorted to and from his matches by a security  guard.    There was even some speculation that this year's Australian Open might have  been the last for South African tennis players. The Australian government has a  policy of barring teams representing South Africa, but admitting individuals.  There is a good chance that the policy may be changed to exclude all South  African athletes.    ""We must get them to tournaments; the way to improve at tennis is you must have  competition,"" Moore said. ""If you don't have competition, you will stagnate. A  good example of that is Russia. In 1974, Russia decided they would no longer  send their players on the international tennis tour because of South Africa's  participation in international tennis events.    ""They stopped sending players. They continued to play (in the Soviet Union).  They had money, they had facilities, they had trainers. And they produced  nobody. They played in the Davis Cup only and they routinely lost in the first  round. It was self-imposed isolation for 10 years. Then they changed their  minds around 1984-85 and they decided to get back into international tennis.  From that time forward, they have produced players.""    South African tennis officials speak about their sport as being non-racial.    By this, they mean that SATU-affiliated tournaments may not bar non-whites from  playing, as they did in the past. Tennis officials say the sport is popular  among blacks, yet the expense of equipment and facilities puts the game  financially out of reach for most black South Africans.    Interestingly, South African tennis officials speak proudly of what the SATU  has done to promote the sport among blacks. However, the gap between rhetoric  and reality is vast.    Soweto, the sprawling black township west of Johannesburg, has a population of  2.5 million and a total of 16 tennis courts.    The Arthur Ashe Tennis Center is in the Shangoville section of Soweto.  Construction began in 1978. Phase I is not finished.    In fact, today the courts are abandoned, the nets are long since blown away,  and what remain of the fences around the courts hang and droop like shrugged  shoulders.    A few children play near the courts but not on them. One boy sits high in a  wooden umpire's chair, seeming to enjoy the view.    But in tennis terms, there's not much to see. Despite SATU officials' claims  that they pour millions of rands into township tennis programs, there is little  evidence of their expenditure. Johannesburg's largest townships, Soweto and  Alexandra, have tennis courts, but all are in disrepair.    ""They tell us that blacks cannot play tennis, that we do not know how,"" said  Kapi Tkwana, who is on a youth sports committee in Alexandra. He waved a hand  at a cracked and peeling court. ""Not even Boris Becker could play tennis on  that.""    Moore's frustrations pour out. Politics, money, delicate negotiations and  coping with sanctions take their toll.    He says the time has come to lift sanctions and reduce the pressure.    ""It's like you have a naughty child,"" he said. ""You have a naughty child and  you spank him and you spank him and you spank him. Finally, there comes a time  when you must stop spanking the child, otherwise you are going to end up with a  monster. We are in that situation now. You guys have been spanking us and  spanking us. When are you going to give us a little encouragement? We've done  everything possible in tennis. We fly in the face of government opinion. We've  come out publicly against apartheid. What more is there for us to do?""    Organizers of non-white tennis here say there's plenty to be done, beginning  with providing facilities in the townships, not busing black children to tennis  courts in white areas.    They also say all foreign tennis players should stay out of South Africa until  apartheid is gone. The influx of professional players at tournaments in white  areas only further segregates the sport, they say.    All sides agree on one thing: There is little that is fair about the current  situation.    ""South Africa violates human rights, let's accept that,"" Moore said. ""I'm not  proud of it. It's a fact of life. But if you go to Amnesty International, which  I have done, and you'll see they have an A category and a B and a C category,  and South Africa is not in the A category of the worst violators of human  rights. But in the A category, you are going to find many, many countries that  are respected members of the IOC and that play Davis Cup -- Iran, Syria, Libya  to start with. These are known terrorist countries. They blow airliners out of  the sky.    ""Iran is playing in Davis Cup this year. They will be in the Olympics. The U.S.  will send an American Davis Cup team and an American Olympic team to play in  those two competitions, and you still say, 'South Africa, pariah nation, no  way, terrible country, you can't play with them.' How can you do that?""      Photo, Keith Diepraam (right) and Norway's Fin Dag Jagge watch anti-apartheid  protest at 1964 Davis Cup match at Oslo.

0,FT943-14820 ,"FT943-14820 _AN-EGMDEAA1FT 940713   FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: UK seeks to recoup South Africa ground      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   Britain's trade and industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, and 60 businessmen are in South Africa this week to try to recoup lost ground in what was once a leading trade partnership. Partly as a result of the UK Conservative party's resistance to sanctions during the apartheid era, British relations with the new government are weaker than with the old. At the same time the UK finds itself fourth in South Africa's trading league behind the US, Germany and Japan. Mr Heseltine's visit follows ones by US commerce secretary Ron Brown and French president Francois Mitterrand which have been seen as part of a drive to reap possible commercial rewards for those countries' support for sanctions during the anti-apartheid struggle. 'South Africa is now perceived as a country with which to do business,' says Mr John Doble, British consul-general in Johannesburg, who says British companies have made more than 60 investments since 1990. On the investment side, the UK has for more than a century remained unchallenged as South Africa's single biggest foreign investor with about R50bn (Pounds 8.8bn) in stock and assets. South Africans hold about R35bn in Britain. Two-way trade between the UK and South Africa amounted to R10.25bn in 1993 slightly in the UK's favour. Britain's imports are primarily of raw materials and food and vegetable products. It exports mostly pharmaceuticals, machinery and, more recently, telecommunications equipment. The UK Export Credits Guarantee Department already has Pounds 1.3bn in export credits outstanding in South Africa, the agency's fourth-biggest commitment. In the first four months of this year British exports to South Africa grew by 20.2 per cent. Imports from South Africa increased only 2.3 per cent, although some sectors, such as fruit and wine, are expected to grow by about 30 per cent for the year. In the defence sector, South Africa is known to be in the market for up to six navy corvettes worth about Pounds 1bn, and if Britain could secure the contract it might help save the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside. At the same time Britain is considering buying South African Rooivalk attack helicopters as part of a total order for 90 helicopters costing about Pounds 2bn and there is speculation that a reciprocal arrangement could be worked out. Mr Heseltine discussed the issue yesterday with Mr Joe Modise, South African defence minister, and an announcement may be made before the end of the week. 'We're cautiously optimistic that something will be achieved,' said a British defence official.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

How would you sum it up?    [Chissano] Well, you know, we started the struggle together.  Actually, I must say that the ANC inspired the struggle for the  liberation of the whole of Africa when it was created in 1912.  We in Mozambique were also inspired by that although our  liberation movement started much later, but not to go far back  in history I would say -- speak to you about the years ... the  '60s. In '61 we started organizing our liberation movements  with the support of all the freedom fighters of the region,  including South Africa. Around '63 we were training together  with South Africans, Mozambicans, Angolans, Ghanaians, in  Algeria, when all these countries came to the conclusion that  the racist regimes in South Africa and Zimbabwe and the  Portuguese colonies didn't want peaceful change towards freedom  and independence, so our contribution for the eradication of  apartheid starts from that cooperation of the liberation  movements.    We got independence before South Africa and we continued to  offer our support, to struggle together. We made analysis on  the forms of the struggle, the tactics to be applied as times  were changing and we came to certain conclusions which led us in  Mozambique to be in contact with the regime, to confront the  regime directly here in South Africa, while the ANC and the  other liberation movements were continuing to press -- put  pressure through the armed struggle and other forms of struggle,  but we continued together in the diplomatic field and political  field, both individually and through the Frontline States, and  in multilateral organizations like OAU and Non-Aligned Movement.  We were very much active. We ... the ANC didn't have to be  present in order to put forward the case of South Africa. We  were always there and we put always, as a first priority, the  liberation of South Africa -- well, I'm speaking after the  independence of Zimbabwe because before it was Zimbabwe,  Namibia, and South Africa.    [Mashokwe] Is there a feeling of achievement? Is there a  feeling in your heart as president of Mozambique that you have  contributed to a worthy cause?    [Chissano] Yes, in my heart, as a person I have no doubt  that  I have given all my best, because when I speak about  coordination during the arms struggle I am one who was lucky to  be together with my Comrade Modise, in the offices of the ANC in  Lusaka, or elsewhere, and to coordinate and to plan, even to see  how could smuggle in weapons and so forth with Modise.    [Mashokwe] These are stories in the old South African terms.    [Chissano] In the old South African terms and Portuguese  terms, but we ... it was a challenging aspect, and also it  happened that I was the first prime minister in Mozambique at  transition period and I had to deal, at that time of transition  with the racist regimes, both in South Africa and in Rhodesia.  Then I became foreign minister. As a foreign minister my task,  primary task, was to support international forums -- the cause  of liberation -- whether its OAU -- in many occasions I had to  forget about the problems of Mozambique, to concentrate on this,  because we did not feel free in Mozambique without the freedom  of South Africa -- or there to offer Zimbabwe, in fact  Mozambique has suffered the most ruthless destabilization and  destruction by direct invasions from the South African forces  and also the Rhodesian forces and later by the utilization of  Mozambican artificially created movements. And we had a lot of  destruction, so it was very much logical that we should be keen  to work for the freedom of our brothers in South Africa and in  Rhodesia.    [Mashokwe] What do you expect, Mr. President, from a free  and  a democratic South Africa? What do you expect that South Africa  to do to small Mozambique, in terms of economic power?    [Chissano] To say the truth we expect the same thing -- that  we join hands and we cooperate the same way. We plan knowing  that the success of one is the success of the other, and we  should wish to bring success to the other. Who can more, should  help, who can less as we have done in the past. [sentence as  heard] So, we hope that South Africa will be a spokesman, not  only for South Africa but also for the other countries in the  region, so that we have, will fulfill our plan of creating a  region which cooperates towards integration, which brings a  harmonious growth of the economies of the countries in benefit  of all in the country.    We will not demand that the countries which are more  advanced  should slow the pace, but we will demand that those who are more  developed help give a hand to the others and help them to grow  until we can reach a certain balance, which is a necessary thing  to create an internal market in the region, so that we, from  that point, we become competitive as a region in the world and  we assume our rightful place in the world -- a rightful place  which is given to us, is there for us, because we have a big  potential of resources.    Our resources pooled together make of our region one of the  richest regions in the world, and therefore, we must know how to  coordinate. This is why we expected that South Africa is going  to join SADC [Southern African Development Community]. Already  we are cooperating with South Africa within SADC -- with this  constructive spirit, without the aim of competition but with the  spirit of complimentarity. [sentence as heard]    [Mashokwe] Would you be surprised if it was the South  African Government, Mr. President, that would have wanted to  kill President Samora Machel then?    [Chissano] I would be surprised if it was the South African  Government, but I would not be surprised if it were anyone in  the armed forces of South Africa. The reason for me to say this  is because when the war came to an end in Zimbabwe, for  instance, we had a talk with Mr. Peter Ells and with Mr. Ken  Flower, and we agreed on certain issues, and one of the issues  was that the Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] people who  were serving there should not be allowed to cross the border  into Mozambique, and that they should be handed over to us with  an agreement that we would not ill treat them, and we also would  not smuggle in weapons for ZANU [Zimbabwe African National  Union] into Mozambique. But what Peter Ells did was to bring  these people into South Africa and to reorganize their fight  from here, and together with the South African officers who paid  the Renamo people -- so the Renamo fight was led actually by  officers from the South African defense forces. And there are  some who did not believe in change even after the change of  government here. There are some who continued giving headaches  to De Klerk and his friends, therefore whether it was condemned  by government or not, the possibility of having South African  security forces -- whether they or the intelligence services,  this is a strong possibility.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion, Mr. President, was it worthwhile  to  have signed the Nkomati Accord?    [Chissano] Yes, I think it was worthwhile, because first of  all it has decreased the direct participation of the South  African defense forces in the war in Mozambique. Secondly, it  has created a new atmosphere in the region, including in the  minds of the whites in South Africa themselves. They started  thinking about change in South Africa and thinking about  business with the neighbors. There was a conflict created  within the white community in South Africa because they had to  judge the validity of the Nkomati Accord. That's when they  started thinking about how to deal with the people in prison and  Robben Island, and all this -- the Nkomati Accord was a ferment  for us for many things. There was a big discussion in the  world, and the fact that there was a big discussion about that  in the world, even in the ranks of the ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] and so forth, our friends and so forth, it was good  because it was focussed more and more on the struggle in South  Africa and the measures to be taken both by the Western  countries, the Eastern countries, and it came at a time when the  Eastern countries, who were the backbone of the support to the  struggle for independence and freedom, were becoming weakened,  because they were weakened. And so the tactics of struggle had  to change, and so the Nkomati Accord was a culmination of the  change of tactics of struggle against apartheid.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, thanks for talking to us, and  thanks for giving us your time.    [Chissano] Thank you. You are welcome.    [Mashokwe] The bandits in your area, as they are termed,  have wrecked everything. Do you have hope that that will be  corrected and how will that be corrected?    [Chissano] Well, we have started already the work. We have a  program of national reconstruction which is aimed at rebuilding  all what have been destroyed, starting from the social services,  health centers, hospitals, schools, and coming to the commercial  network, shops, and going to roads, in order to facilitate the  life of the citizens, especially in the countryside, in the  rural areas, then we also ... we will pay attention to the  reconstruction of factories, like sugar factories, tea  factories, which were destroyed and the reopening of mines which  were closed during the war, gold mines, marble mines, graphite  mines which are being reopened, and other ... other activities.    We are also reopening the traffic through the railroads  towards the interland countries like South Africa, which is  somehow an interland country in some regions, Zimbabwe, Zambia,  Malawi, and also we are serving a bit of Botswana, and Swaziland  and Lesotho. So we are going to call for investments. We are  calling for investments, for internal investments of nationals,  trying to create conditions so that we create new businessmen,  which is African, black businessmen in Mozambique and other  Mozambicans who are not black, because even those who are not  black -- and not many who were businessmen in Mozambique in the  past, but we are also going to attract as we are doing already,  the foreign investment, and through all this process we are  going to create jobs for the lots of unemployed people.    As you know we have more than 1 million people who were  refugees outside the country and more than 3.5 million people  who were displaced inside the country, therefore, these people  have got no jobs -- about 4-5 million people who are ... have no  real jobs. So we aim at creating conditions for self-employment  in some projects but also through these investments we are going  to create jobs. The process of national reconstruction itself  will create some jobs, but most important thing will be the  training of personnel. The human resources development program  is very important. The integration of the demobilized soldiers  in the civil life is very important and again here it's about  creating jobs or self-employment by helping them to start their  own projects, their own initiatives.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, there is no peace yet -- total  peace in Mozambique. We know of efforts, we know your  government's position, but why should a South African business  person go and invest in an unstable area now?    [Chissano] To say the truth, we have peace. There are some  acts of criminality which are here and there, the same way as  they exist in London or in Chicago or in Washington, or even in  South Africa, Johannesburg, but we cannot speak about war. We  cannot speak about the same amount of instability.    In fact, three weeks ago, I have inaugurated these graphite  mines in which there is a South African company which is  participating, and that graphite mine is placed in area which  was dangerous in the past. We had started work. We had to put  a battalion to protect the area but now that battalion is not  there. We don't have soldiers there. We have taken them all  away and so the mine is operating without need of special  security. It has got the normal security which all mines have  and there is a factory there. The people are living in the  area, the workers and ... it's very active -- we have started  exporting now this graphite, so it means that we have peace  since October 1992.    We have peace so small incidents of criminal nature, of  course, these exist, but we have a program. After we finish  demobilization we will concentrate on the process of collecting  unlawful weapons which are enabling these hooligans to create  some trouble here and there. This is a process which we are  going to undertake in cooperation with South Africa because in  South Africa you have the same problem. You have too much  weapons in the hands of people, but we cannot speak now of war.    I can say there is peace and economic activity has started  and many investors, Americans, and Ireland investors are there  with big projects. Some other British have investments. South  Africans themselves have in tourism and many other aspects, so  investments are already there.    [Mashokwe] Is it the old Lorenco Marques that South Africans  used to know or this the Maputo -- the new Lorenco Marques?    [Chissano] No, Maputo is not the new Lorenco Marques because  Lorenco Marques was a time of apartheid without the name of  apartheid. I may say even that it was worse than apartheid  because the Portuguese used to say that they didn't have  racialism and discrimination and so forth, but in fact it was  worse, because as far as I was informed, apartheid meant  separate development, but in Mozambique blacks didn't have  development. [60-second advertising break]    [Chissano, in progress] ... and our government informed the  other parties that the government was not satisfied and the  government wanted that this question and the other questions  which were not answered that they should be addressed,  therefore, that inquiry would give us just a lead to proceed the  inquiry, and we hope that if there is still possibility that the  inquiry can be made. Not that we want to accuse someone but we  want to be satisfied that the inquiry has been concluded and  that questions have been answered. If we find that was it  someone outside South Africa we will be glad.     "
0,FT922-466 ,"FT922-466 _AN-CF0AFAB7FT 920627   FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance  the Family: Not just a black and white choice - Investing in . . . South Africa      By JOHN AUTHERS   SOUTH AFRICA forces a personal investor to face a unique dilemma. Any decision you make will not just be based on investment merits, for in the past two decades the climate of world opinion about the country has ensured that any such move must involve ethical and political judgments as well. Even those who had no qualms about investing in a nation governed by apartheid still had to assess the stability of the regime. The effect of sanctions imposed on the nation's economy also remains to be weighed. The ideal scenario is for South Africa to transfer peacefully to a regime which the rest of the world can stomach. This would leave the strengths of the nation's economy intact and, by allowing sanctions to be lifted, allow greater economic vigour. Optimism that this could happen has grown since the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, in early 1990. However, it remains only a vague sentiment as far as big UK investors are concerned. Trustees of charity funds have slowly begun to warm towards South Africa - for example, David Edwards, of the charity investment management service at Henderson Crosthwaite, says: 'What has tended to happen over the last year is that trustees have become less averse to the inclusion of South Africa, and that mirrors the sentiment of the average private client.' However, this mood has not translated into active investment. Edwards continues: 'Now that trustees are relaxing their attitude to South Africa, investment fundamentals come back in. And I don't think many fund managers have put money into South Africa because it hasn't looked right, even though the political situation looks better.' Stuart Bell, of Pensions Investment Research Consultants, surveyed UK pension funds in 1990 and found that about half had some restriction on investment in South Africa. Nothing much has happened since then - the only local authority pension fund to change its policy was that of the London borough of Brent, following loss of control by the Labour party. 'Basically, it's still a political football,' says Bell. 'From the commercial outlook, there has been no reason for them to amend their views anyway.' As a legacy of South Africa's pariah status, there are few ways to buy direct exposure to the country in the UK. Unit trusts are authorised by the Securities and Investments Board to invest up to 100 per cent of their funds in the Johannesburg stock exchange, but there are no 'South Africa' unit trusts. Funds in a commodities or gold unit trust, however, must almost inevitably have a considerable stake in the country. MG's Gold  General fund, for example, has a holding of 32.8 per cent. But the commodity and energy sector is not one of the unit trust industry's stars. Over the year to June, the average trust in the sector lost 11.4 per cent, according to Finstat. Over two years this figure was 22.6 per cent, and over five years, 33 per cent. Mary d'Eon, manager of Providence Capitol's Gold unit trust, views the current situation as a long-term negative, but adds: 'Any sort of strife in South Africa may make the gold price rise, which is good for the companies as well. I have a holding of 20 per cent in the major companies, and I will not be selling it.' A less risky route is to gain exposure via companies quoted in the UK. Even 'ethical' investors are now prepared to do this. The Merlin Ecology unit trust polled its unitholders and found a large majority against direct investment in South Africa until a 'one man, one vote' system has been achieved. However, they were prepared to invest in a company which did more than its competitors to introduce good employment practices, and so the fund has invested in Reckitt  Coleman. Reinvestment in South Africa has only just started, which may explain the market's muted reaction to the massacre in Boipatong last weekend. Mandela's subsequent decision to withdraw from talks on democracy with the government seemed to confirm the worst fears of the watching world, but the Johannesburg Stock Exchange index fell a modest 42 points to 3,639, while companies with overseas assets, such as Lonrho and Minorco, actually rose. So, ethical arguments aside, is this the time to buy into South Africa? The answer must be: definitely not. Jonathan Martin Smith, of the South Africa and mining department of stockbrokers Williams De Broe, is positive about the country, but says: 'You have a deep recession in South Africa and the timetable for recovery is put back by this violence. I'm not saying it's not at the bottom. I'm just saying it's wise to wait.' For the longer term he remains confident: 'The will is there on both sides to make this succeed. We are not entering into a civil war situation. Violence will not disappear. But the government and the ANC are powerful enough to control it.' South African exchange controls are another reason for staying put. There is a separate currency for external investors, the financial rand, which is usually at a substantial discount to the main commercial rand. Foreign investors thus have a strong disincentive to sell, particularly in troubled times, when the discount grows - it went up to 27 per cent following the news of Boipatong. So, South Africa needs to be watched.

The Foreign Office described the decision as ""a gold letter  day for the Commonwealth and for South Africa.""    The Queen sent a message of congratulation to South African  President Nelson Mandela immediately the announcement was made,  and John Major sent best wishes from the Government.    South Africa's official return to the 50-nation community  was  announced in London by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka  Anyaoku, who told a news conference: ""It is with a special sense  of joy that I announce that South Africa will from tomorrow  return to full Commonwealth membership after a break of 33  years.""    Mr Mandela said immediately after South Africa's recent  general election that he would be seeking the country's  re-admittance to the Commonwealth, which it quit in 1961 amid  international criticism of apartheid.    The Foreign Office said it was hoped that South African  athletes would take part in the Commonwealth Games in Canada in  August, and that it looked forward to its contribution within  the organisation.

The decision was announced in a joint  communique which was released on Friday.    The two countries' decision about the resumption of  political  ties, which came following talks between officials of the South  African Foreign Ministry and members of the office protecting  the interests of the Islamic Republic of Iran in that country,  brings to an end a 15-year-old complete rupture of Iran's ties  with South Africa.    Iran's ties with South Africa were severed following the  victory of the Islamic revolution and in protest against that  country's racist policies.    The Islamic Republic of Iran cut off all economic and  political ties with that country placing on top of its foreign  policy priorities its support for the struggle of the South  African nation for achieving independence.    The long and difficult struggle of the South African nation  has finally brought to an end the more than three-century-old  white domination over that country.    The Islamic Republic of Iran, while welcoming the trend of  return of peace, together with independence and restoration of  the rights of the black majority, considers the recent  developments in South Africa as being to the removal of  obstacles in the way of establishing political and economic ties  with that country and has announced its willingness for the  resumption of full diplomatic ties with South Africa. [passage  as received]    From a political point of view, the recent developments in  South Africa, which have provided the ground for all the races  to have direct and active participation in running the country's  affairs and making political and economic decisions, are  significant in that they can have positive impact and  consequences within the foreign policy and regional framework  for South Africa's future ties with other countries.    In this connection, the resumption of Islamic Republic of  Iran's economic and political ties with South Africa, the  groundwork of which was prepared during Mr. Mandela's visit to  Tehran last January, is an appropriate response to the victory  of the black majority in that country, and is a confirmation of  the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always and will  continue to support the will of the nations in deciding about  the own fate.    As the rupturing of ties with the South African apartheid  regime 15 years ago and the resumption of ties with South Africa  now indicate, Iran does not have the slightest doubt in making  political decisions in this regard.

0,FT934-6162 ,"FT934-6162 _AN-DKZCOABAFT 931126   FT  26 NOV 93 / World Trade News: S Africa mission marks change in US stance      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, arrives in South Africa tomorrow for a visit which signals the opening of a more constructive era in economic relations between the two countries. His trip comes only days after President Bill Clinton signed the South Africa Democratic Transition Support Act, formally bringing to an end the era of federal US sanctions aimed at ending apartheid. Although Mr Brown's visit will probably have limited practical impact in the short term, it conveys a powerful symbolic message. Mr Princeton Lyman, US ambassador in South Africa, comments: 'It signifies a very basic change from a negative to a positive relationship with South Africa. The whole tone shifts.' This shift from isolation to engagement was confirmed on Tuesday by Mr Clinton. He noted that removing sanctions was not enough. 'Americans who have been so active in toppling apartheid must remain committed to building South Africa's non-racial market democracy.' 'The visit confirms a real interest in South Africa's potential as a viable trading partner and bulwark of economic strength and stability in the region and on the continent,' said Mr Brown. Despite the impact of sanctions, there is a substantial base upon which to develop US-South Africa trade relations. South Africa is only the US's 34th largest export market, but it remains the largest in Africa, a continent where, Mr Lyman concedes, 'the US has not done very well'. The US recently surpassed Germany as South Africa's largest trade partner. Mr Lyman estimates bilateral trade now to be in the region of Dollars 5bn. Commerce Department figures show that in 1992 US exports to South Africa totalled Dollars 2.4bn, 14 per cent of South Africa's total import market, with US imports from South Africa of Dollars 1.7bn. The US has fared less well in terms of investment. Figures from the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) show that as of September only 135 US companies had employees or direct investment in South Africa, compared to 267 in May 1986. The stock of US investment in South Africa is put at about Dollars 1bn. Certainly, however, the trend has started to turn. The past two months have seen food manufacturers Pillsbury and CPC International enter the market, following such other companies as Mars, Microsoft and Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM has recently confirmed it will probably be returning, Procter  Gamble is known to be taking a close look and McDonald's, Anheuser-Busch and Hyatt are all expected to establish a presence. A focus of Mr Brown's visit - his 50-member delegation contains representatives of many large US companies - will be an attempt to establish links between US companies and the emerging black business community in South Africa. Another issue sure to be discussed is South Africa's offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay round of trade talks. Aspects of the offer - particularly the high protection, and longer phasing-in period for tariff reductions for the clothing and textiles, motor and electronics industries - did not meet with approval from South Africa's trading partners.

Preliminary election results show that the ANC, led by  Nelson  Mandela, has built an insurmountable lead, which indicates that  South Africa will form a new government of national unity  centered around the ANC.    The election has provided South African black people their  first chance to exercise democratic rights in the history of  South Africa, the spokesman noted.    The birth of a new South Africa where all races are equal  marks a new epoch in the country, he said.    The victory is the result of the hard, long-time struggle of  the South African people, supported by the international  community. The ANC and other black liberation organizations  have played a crucial role in propelling South Africa toward  this historic change, he said.    ""We appreciate the positive contributions made by the  National Party led by F.W. de Klerk, in moving with the tides  and implementing reforms,"" he said.    The Chinese Government and people sincerely hope that under  the leadership of the government of national unity, all parties  there will strengthen unity and cooperation and make joint  efforts in the building up of a new South Africa enjoying racial  equality, stability, democracy and prosperity, he said.    The Chinese Government and people have firmly supported the  just struggle of the South African people against apartheid and  are proud of the historic victory of the South African people,  he noted.    ""China is willing to establish and develop friendly ties of  cooperation with the new South African Government on the basis  of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence,"" he stated.    He expressed the belief that the traditional friendship of  the Chinese and South African peoples will be consolidated and  developed on a new basis.     "

By SHAWN POGATCHNIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER      WASHINGTON      Legislation that would make closed-captioning technology a required part of  most new televisions sold in America is winning support in and out of Congress.    That's good news for the estimated 24 million deaf or hearing-impaired U.S.  citizens, who now must rely on costly closed-caption decoding devices or, as is  more common, view their favorite programs hearing only muted mumbles or nothing  at all.    Installing decoding circuitry would allow television sets to display captions  without separate decoders. The bill calls for closed-caption decoding chips to  be installed in all new TVs sold in the United States with 13-inch screens or  larger, beginning Oct. 15. That is the minimum recommended size for viewers to  read closed captions, which run along the bottom of the screen in the manner of  a subtitled foreign film.    But the electronics industry is fighting the legislation with a ""read my lips""  rationale, arguing that the bill's mandatory standard for all TVs would impose  a ""regressive excise tax"" on everyone who wants to buy a television.    The measure comes at a time when the Bush Administration and Congress are  acting on several fronts to increase rights and access for disabled Americans.    In March, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered sweeping redesign of  future commercial airliners to make it easier for handicapped people to fly.  Last Tuesday, the House approved landmark civil-rights legislation aimed in  part at gaining disabled Americans equal access to jobs, public transportation  and restaurant service.    Until now, however, disabled activists' calls for built-in decoders as standard  TV technology have largely been ignored.    In the closed-caption technology, first marketed to consumers in 1980, the  subtitles are contained in a portion of the television signal that does not  appear on the TV screen unless called up by a special decoding device. The most  recent model of decoder, the TeleCaption 4000, retails for about $175 and can  be purchased by telephone via the AT&T Special Needs Center, or at Sears,  J.C. Penney, Highland Superstores and other chains.    But due to a combination of limited availability, spotty marketing and cost,  the National Captioning Institute estimates that only about 300,000 of the  machines have been sold in the last 10 years, with a roughly estimated  viewership of 1 million.    This suggests that only about 1 in 25 deaf or hearing-impaired people is now  able to watch closed-captioned shows -- not much market incentive for networks  and local affiliates to increase the hours in which they provide closed-caption  broadcasts, the bill's advocates contend.    ""The audience for captioned programs must be enlarged,"" said Rep. Edward Markey  (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's  telecommunications subcommittee. He called the bill, introduced earlier this  month by Rep. Major Owens (D-N.Y.), ""an essential tool for increasing the use  of captioning.""    Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), the Senate sponsor of the measure, is expected to  push for its endorsement in a June 20 Commerce Committee hearing.    The legislative mandate would come with a price tag, although each side of the  debate offers different figures. Some proponents contend that the built-in  decoding equipment might boost costs only $3 to $5 per TV set; the bill's most  vocal opponent, the Washington-based Electronic Industries Assn., asserts that  prices could rise by as much as $20 per set.    Regardless of how much it might be, the electronics group objects to any cost  hike applied across the board to all citizens.    In testimony this month before Markey's subcommittee, the EIA's vice president  for its consumer electronics group, Thomas P. Friel, argued that while existing  closed-caption decoders are too expensive, forcing everyone to pay for  standardized in-set decoding chips is not fair.    ""We do not . . . believe it is fair to impose what amounts to a regressive  excise tax on all purchasers of television sets in order to benefit a small,  albeit deserving, minority,"" Friel told congressmen.    Friel said the potential impact of the legislation is being exaggerated because  those people who now can't afford decoder boxes certainly couldn't afford new  TVs.    ""We feel very strongly that we should try to help the hearing-impaired, but  raising the cost of all televisions sets is not the answer,"" said Cynthia  Upson, EIA's director of communications. ""This is unprecedented legislation to  have this cost mandated to every television user. This country is based on  letting consumers have choices.""    For the deaf community, ""choice"" is the central issue as well.    ""This is not a mere luxury feature for deaf Americans,"" Larry Goldberg,  director of the Caption Center at PBS affiliate WGBH in Boston, said. ""Right  now they have no options about how they can enjoy television.    ""Captions are there, through at least 390 hours of broadcast, cable and home  videos each week,"" said Goldberg, whose nonprofit group is the second-largest  supplier of captioning services to network programs in the nation. ""Television  manufacturers wouldn't think of making TVs that are, say, unable to receive  Channel 2 or Channel 4, and yet they feel comfortable manufacturing TVs that  are unable to receive . . . closed-captioning information.""    Supporters of the legislation -- who include the National Parent Teachers  Assn., International Reading Assn., National Education Assn. and American Assn.  of Retired Persons -- foresee benefits from standardized closed-captioning  beyond its service to the deaf.    Sy DuBow, legal director of the National Assn. of the Deaf Legal Defense Fund,  points out that captioned programs can aid people trying to improve English  reading skills -- whether they are among the estimated 27 million adult  Americans with literacy problems, the millions of immigrants learning English  as a second language, or children learning to read.    ""Studies have shown that closed captioning has improved literacy skills,"" DuBow  said. ""It doesn't matter if you're 4 or 40: It can help.""

After averaging Dollars 1bn annually during the first half of the 1980s - of which three quarters went to oil exporting countries - FDI accelerated during the 1987-91 period averaging Dollars 1.7bn. Almost half (Dollars 830m) went to Nigeria, and another Dollars 190m to other oil exporters. The region's stock of foreign investment was estimated by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at some Dollars 11bn, with South Africa accounting for a further Dollars 11bn. Zimbabwe and Nigeria each account for 19 per cent, with Gabon in third place (13 per cent), followed by Liberia with 12.5 per cent and Cote d'Ivoire with just under 10 per cent. Between them, these five countries accounted for three quarters of the region's foreign-owned capital stock. Not only is the region's foreign-owned capital stock small and highly concentrated, but it has also been falling. Excluding South Africa, the inward stock of foreign capital fell 45 per cent in the 1980s, mainly reflecting currency devaluation. In 1980, the sub-Saharan share of global inward investment was 4.5 per cent, but 10 years later it was 0.7 per cent. Inward investment declined from 7.5 per cent of the third world total during the 1981-86 period to 5.5 per cent, two thirds of which was oil sector investment. One reason is Africa's failure to broaden its investment base. While FDI flows to other continents have diversified into manufacturing and services away from resource-intensive activity, Africa's chief attraction remains its energy and mining potential. Sluggish economic growth, poor returns, a shortage of skills and small markets continue to deter investment. The key to attracting foreign inflows is the availability of relatively cheap skilled, technical and supervisory labour, crucial to meeting quality standards that are increasingly important in global marketing. Africa is also at a serious disadvantage in terms of both location and infrastructure. But the greatest deterrent to FDI inflows has been government hostility towards multinationals. That is changing, but the results - outside the energy sector - have been disappointing. Hardly surprising, for in the late 1980s, the return on capital was lower than anywhere else in the third world, except Latin America. But Africa's politicians now realise multinationals may not bring in substantial foreign capital but will provide the technology, expertise and market access Africa needs.  ---------------------------------- Efficiency of Investment 1988-92  ---------------------------------- All developing countries     18.2% Asia                         22.0% Middle East and Europe       20.0% Africa                       11.5% Latin America                 7.7%  ----------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

The deal marks the biggest re-investment in South Africa since the lifting of American sanctions. It follows the return of a number of US companies to South Africa this year, including International Business Machines and Kodak. Pilsbury, a rival US foods group, set up a partnership with local producer FoodCorp last year, and Heinz is understood to be investigating a South African partnership, possibly with the Premier Group. CPC has exercised its option to buy a 50 per cent stake in Tongaat's consumer foods division. The option was part of a licensing and technology agreement signed by the companies in October 1993. The new company - CPC Tongaat Foods - will invest R10m in a new dry foods plant. The deal is complicated by CPC's disinvestment from South Africa in 1987, when it sold the rights to a number of its brands - including Knorr, Hellmann's and Marmite - to Hunt Leuchars  Hepburn, a local foods supplier. CPC Tongaat Foods will be restricted to marketing these brands outside South Africa, Namibia and Botswana. However, it plans to introduce and produce the rest of CPC's product range in South Africa for the local and sub-Saharan export markets. Mr Mohammed Wahby, vice-president of CPC Europe Consumer Foods, admitted South Africa and many neighbouring countries faced severe political troubles. However, he said: 'One should not wait for a solution to all political problems before launching a sound business proposal.' Mr Cedric Savage, managing director of Tongaat, said it was vital for South Africans to establish joint ventures with international companies.   Companies:-  CPC International.

The  spate of violence and vandalism in the latest so-called  ""peaceful"" protest is ""unacceptable and inexcusable under any  circumstances. Such behavior should not be tolerated.""  According to the editorial, the organization claiming to  represent the prisoners, the South African Prisoners  Organization for Human Rights, ""has this time either overplayed  its hand, or it has no control over its members....The decision  by the government to give all prisoners a six months' remission  is a mistake.""

At the recent World  Economic Congress in Cape Town he assured African countries that  South Africa did not intend to dominate them, but as a  copartner, wanted to play a role in trying to reconstruct and  develop Africa south of the Sahara. The editorial goes on to  suggest: ""If South Africa could help its neighbors in creating  jobs for themselves, for instance, its own problem with illegal  immigrants could be minimized.""

0,FT933-453 ,"FT933-453 _AN-DI2CRAB7FT 930929   FT  29 SEP 93 / Businesses seek education changes      By JOHN AUTHERS   LEADING business people yesterday called for sweeping changes in the way schools are run, in return for greater investment in education by private companies. Mr Michael Ashcroft, chairman of the new Education In Industry group of business leaders, said changes might include the provision of full education courses by companies for children over 14, longer school days and the introduction of a five-term year. Mr Ashcroft, who chairs the security and vehicle auctions group ADT, added that lengthening the school day and increasing the number of terms would help parents working part-time or flexitime, and allow pupils to spend more time on vocational education. Companies would also provide marketing, promotional and fundraising activities. The group will also lobby for industrialists' views on education. Mr Ashcroft said school-leavers were not adequately prepared for employment. 'Unless we can systematically improve educational standards, this nation, its businesses and prosperity are at risk.' He listed measures required by industrialists, including: Minimum standards in literacy and numeracy. New targets that require a second foreign language, computer skills, technology and vocational training. Employer-provided approved education courses for pupils aged 14 and over. Lengthening the school day. A five-term year. Compulsory industrial work experience for all trainee teachers. Mr Ashcroft said the focus of secondary education should move from age 16 to move in line with practice on the Continent, because this would allow more concentration on vocational courses at an earlier stage. The new group has full government backing. Its launch was attended by Mr John Patten, education secretary, and three education ministers. It signalled strong support for the government's proposal this week to channel funds towards schools which specialise in technology. However, the trust intends to remain non-partisan and will not receive any public funds. Founder trustees include the the directors of the Institute of Management and the Institute of Personnel Management, and the heads of Norwich Union, George Wimpey, Vauxhall Motors, Cable  Wireless, Dixons, Burton Group, and the British Railways Board.

AFRICA;    BOTH POLITICS AND ECONOMICS CITED BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., one of the largest U.S. companies in South  Africa, today announced that it is pulling out of the country after 42 years  and selling its assets to a South African company.    A combination of economic and political factors was responsible for Goodyear's  decision to divest itself of its Uitenhage, South Africa, tire and general  products manufacturing operation.    The business will be sold to Consol Ltd., an industrial subsidiary of Anglovaal  Ltd., a South African financial, industrial and mining group.    Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, president and chief executive officer,  said the company regrets leaving South Africa after providing jobs there for  more than four decades.    But, he said in an announcement of the sale, ""it is becoming increasingly  difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on investments  there.""    Barrett said the reasons for Goodyear's disinvestment included U.S. sanctions  against South Africa, double U.S. taxation of South African earnings and the  likelihood of a continuing decline in the value of the South African rand  against major currencies.      Tax Credit Eliminated    Congress in late 1987 enacted legislation that eliminates a tax credit for U.S.  companies that allowed them to deduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes  owed to the U.S. government.    The former Reagan Administration opposed the amendment and considered fighting  to have it repealed, but it remains the law.    Former State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said at the time the bill  was passed that ""the most likely effect will be to accelerate the takeover of  U.S. assets by South African firms at bargain prices.""    Barrett said Anglovaal Ltd. is a responsible group that has demonstrated  concern for human rights in the workplace and has expressed intentions to  retain the current work force of 2,400 people, the majority of whom are black  and colored.    Mike McNamara, chairman and managing director of Goodyear's South African  business, said the company will continue to operate under the same management.    ""We have always taken great pride in our people, and our management team and  employees have vast knowledge of the local tire and rubber industry,"" McNamara  said.

AFRICA;    BOTH POLITICS AND ECONOMICS CITED BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE      From Associated Press      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., one of the largest U.S. companies in South  Africa, today announced that it is pulling out of the country after 42 years  and selling its assets to a South African company.    A combination of economic and political factors was responsible for Goodyear's  decision to divest itself of its Uitenhage, South Africa, tire and general  products manufacturing operation.    The business will be sold to Consol Ltd., an industrial subsidiary of Anglovaal  Ltd., a South African financial, industrial and mining group.    Tom H. Barrett, Goodyear's chairman, president and chief executive officer,  said the company regrets leaving South Africa after providing jobs there for  more than four decades.    But, he said in an announcement of the sale, ""it is becoming increasingly  difficult for American companies to obtain adequate returns on investments  there.""    Barrett said the reasons for Goodyear's disinvestment included U.S. sanctions  against South Africa, double U.S. taxation of South African earnings and the  likelihood of a continuing decline in the value of the South African rand  against major currencies.      Tax Credit Eliminated    Congress in late 1987 enacted legislation that eliminates a tax credit for U.S.  companies that allowed them to deduct taxes paid to South Africa against taxes  owed to the U.S. government.    The former Reagan Administration opposed the amendment and considered fighting  to have it repealed, but it remains the law.    Former State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said at the time the bill  was passed that ""the most likely effect will be to accelerate the takeover of  U.S. assets by South African firms at bargain prices.""    Barrett said Anglovaal Ltd. is a responsible group that has demonstrated  concern for human rights in the workplace and has expressed intentions to  retain the current work force of 2,400 people, the majority of whom are black  and colored.    Mike McNamara, chairman and managing director of Goodyear's South African  business, said the company will continue to operate under the same management.    ""We have always taken great pride in our people, and our management team and  employees have vast knowledge of the local tire and rubber industry,"" McNamara  said. ""For them, we will continue to operate under present employment policies,  practices and benefits, and all existing agreements and arrangements with our  two trade unions remain unaltered.""

The supplement should be compulsory reading for the western finance ministers attending this month's IMF/World Bank annual meeting in Washington. A potential African recovery hangs by a thread. The meeting has the power to throw Africa either a lifeline or a noose. The last G7 summit in Tokyo failed to act on Africa's crushing debt. Africa cannot afford a similar response from the IMF/World Bank meeting. The issue is simple: if world leaders want to lead, then they have to deal decisively with world problems.

His statement revives hopes in Asia that Japan will provide financial compensation for victims (or their descendants) in territory occupied before 1945. At a ceremony in Tokyo on the 49th anniversary of Japan's surrender to the allies, Mr Murayama did not elaborate on the unresolved issues but went slightly further than his predecessors in atoning for the actions of the imperial army. The prime minister spoke of 'tragic sacrifices beyond description' inflicted on a large number of people in Asia and elsewhere. He offered 'heartfelt condolences to them with a deep repentance'. Officials said Mr Murayama, aged 70 and a life-long socialist and pacifist, had chosen the remorseful phrases himself to insert into a prepared speech. A year ago, the then premier, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, raised hopes of financial redress after acknowledging the forces' misdeeds. Japan insists the issue of reparations was resolved in the San Francisco peace treaty with the US, but the possibility of setting up a substantial fund to provide benefits over 10 years is said to be under discussion ahead of the 50th anniversary next year. Japanese are suspected in Asia of insufficiently recognising the consequences of their country's wartime aggression and mourning only their own 3m war dead, the actual purpose of yesterday's government-sponsored service. A separate and more controversial gathering at the Yasukuni Shrine, where war criminals are among those commemorated, drew seven cabinet ministers, despite a request from Mr Murayama that they stay away. Six of the ministers were from the Liberal Democratic party and one from the New Harbinger party, partners of Mr Murayama's Social Democratic party in the six-week-old coalition. On Sunday, an LDP minister resigned after suggesting the Japanese occupation benefited parts of Asia, bringing independence from European powers, an increased literacy rate and resultant economic success. Mr Shin Sakurai was replaced as head of the Environment Agency by Mr Sohei Miyashita, also from the LDP.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

0,FT944-17034 ,"FT944-17034 _AN-EJKDGAA9FT 941011   FT  11 OCT 94 / World Trade News: South Africa and EU agree on closer ties      By MARK SUZMAN      PRETORIA   The European Union and South Africa yesterday signed a co-operation agreement, laying the foundation for closer political and economic ties and marking the conclusion of a four-day visit to South Africa by Sir Leon Brittan, the external economic relations commissioner. The agreement, which was signed in a ceremony at Pretoria by Sir Leon and Mr Thabo Mbeki, South African deputy president, is primarily concerned with boosting co-operation in trade and development, although it also deals with questions of human rights and democracy. It will also allow the European Investment Bank, which currently has Ecu300m (Pounds 236m) earmarked for South Africa, to begin lending activities in the country as well as setting the legal basis for the expansion of EU-South African economic links. Both the agreement and Sir Leon's visit testify to the growing prominence of the EU in South Africa as an institution separate from its member states. More importantly, they lay the groundwork for the negotiation of a formal trade agreement between the EU and South Africa. The EU is currently South Africa's biggest trading partner and receives more than 40 per cent of South African exports, while providing 33 per cent of the country's total imports. Two-way annual trade amounts to R63bn (Pounds 11.5bn). Although South Africa was admitted to the Generalised System of Preferences in September, there is currently a debate over whether the country should also seek accession to the Lome Agreement, which provides 69 developing countries with preferential access to EU markets, or whether it should instead draw up a separate agreement with the EU. Speaking at the signing, Mr Mbeki said he hoped that the resolution of this question could be reached as 'quickly as possible' but warned that any final deal would first require consultation with other states in the region. Sir Leon echoed these sentiments and said that he hoped that the EU also hoped to contribute to broader regional development. However, he warned that urgent action first needed to be taken by South Africa to dismantle its existing trade barriers if it wished to become an attractive market for European investment. 'Such a protectionist system (as South Africa's) makes no sense today,' he said. 'I have stressed that further liberalisation is essential for both trade and investment.' Earlier on his trip, Sir Leon announced plans to form a joint EU/South Africa Business Council to help promote business ties and trade links. Meanwhile, on the aid front, the EU has long been South Africa's largest single donor of unattached grant assistance for development, having spent R1.2bn since 1986. It plans to spend a further R440m a year on various development programmes, especially in education and health.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Early this morning, the Cuban leader visited Mandela at his  official residence where they held talks behind closed doors.    In statements made yesterday to the press, Fidel Castro  pointed out that the rise to power of the African National  Congress (ANC) opens new possibilities of cooperation between  the two countries. ""Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples,"" Castro said.    After meeting with Mandela, the Cuban head of state granted  an exclusive interview to SBC (South Africa Broadcasting  Company), the local television network, at the Arcadia Hotel  where he is staying with the rest of the high-level delegation  that accompanied him.    Concerning his first visit to this southern African nation,  whose Army clashed with Cuban troops in the struggle for  independence of Angola and Namibia, Fidel Castro said: ""There  are two South Africas and two periods in the history of South  Africa. There was a period of strong confrontation, but now  there is a new South Africa where there is peace, respect, and  affection for Cuba.""    The statesman confirmed he has been treated very  respectfully  by all sectors of society, not just the ANC, during his visit  here that began last Monday. We should all contribute to  harmony and peace in South Africa, he said, so that the results  of efforts and sacrifices will make this country a model for the  entire world.    He also appeared very emotional at Mandela's inaugural  ceremony which brought together more than 5,000 people in the  Union Building's amphitheater, where there were heads of state  and heads of government from approximately 40 countries.    Today, Fidel Castro ends his visit to South Africa, where he  also met with more than 20 leaders and representatives from  Africa and the Middle East.     "

Druing the meeting, Qian Qichen experssed his  appreciation for Prime Minister Ravony's efforts to develop  friendly relations between China and Madagascar. Qian Qichen  believed that the economic exchanges and cooperation between the  two countries could be even more comprehensive and diversified.  Ravony said that Qian Qichen's concept for bilateral economic  cooperation is very attractive, and the Malagasy government  would promote and support direct cooperation between Malagasy  entrepreneurs and Chinese entrepreneurs.    On the Taiwan question, Ravony said that Madagascar  recognizes one China only; namely, the People's Republic of  China, and Taiwan is a part of China. Qian Qichen expressed his  appreciation for Ravony's statement.    On the situation in Africa, Ravony said: Great changes have  taken place in world situation. Further cooperation between  Africa and China is conducive to world peace and development.    In the afternoon, Qian Qichen held talks with Malagasy  foreign minister Sylla. The two sides exchanged views on the  African situation of common concern, and on how to further  develop friendly relations and cooperation between China and  Madagascar. The two sides reached a common understanding on a  wide range of issues, expressed satisfaction on the development  of Sino-Malagasy friendly and cooperative relations, and hoped  that the bilateral relations would enter a new stage with the  concerted efforts of the governments of the two countries.

Conagra likewise believes that the Proposed Rule will make it possible for shippers with complementary traffic to present a carrier with a more attractive traffic profile than each could present separately. It contends that to the extent such traffic can be handled more efficiently, the carrier's handling costs will be reduced. Conagra suggests that concerns about the lawfulness of the proposal are without merit and that it raises no valid antitrust concerns.

0,FT934-7734 ,"FT934-7734 _AN-DKRC7AGUFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (18): Continental launchpad - A look at the industrial potential      By TONY HAWKINS   SOUTH AFRICA'S return to legitimacy coincides with the growing regionalisation of foreign investment decisions. As multinationals rationalise and integrate their foreign operations to secure scale economies and improve co-ordination, so they are looking more carefully at regional, rather than national, markets. Invariably this means consolidating operations at one, or a few, locations to serve a regional market, especially where trade flows are being liberalised. By any yardstick, South Africa is the logical launchpad for penetrating the sub-Saharan market, worth some Dollars 250bn, of which South Africa itself accounts for more than Dollars 100bn or more than 40 per cent. The South African market, although small by global standards, is the only African market large enough to justify a broad range of manufacturing activities. The next largest is Nigeria, worth Dollars 34bn and set to shrink in foreign currency with devaluation next year. While few companies have yet rationalised their operations with the establishment of regional headquarters in South Africa, this is likely to be a pervasive trend, once the violence subsides and business confidence returns. BP is one company that will establish a regional headquarters in South Africa, while a number of manufacturing companies, such as Nissan, are known to be actively considering developing their South African factories as the platform for exporting into the region. The reasons are obvious; South Africa has the best infrastructure on the continent with first-world service industry back-up in banking, insurance, capital markets, hotels and information technology. It has spare capacity in energy and transport, a vast pool of unskilled labour, a rich natural resource base, a better skills endowment that anywhere else in Africa - though way behind Asian levels - and a large enough domestic market to justify most industrial investments. By African standards the environment is investor-friendly and there are few African locations that can match South Africa's quality of life. The disadvantages are essentially socio-political - political and criminal violence, allied with the worry that, even if they are papered over in 1993/4, ethnic tensions will re-surface later in the decade. Labour relations are also a possible reason for steering clear of South Africa given the high cost of labour relative to that elsewhere in the region and far higher levels of unionisation. Against that is the relentless decline in the relative importance of direct labour costs in most business activities, with raw materials, capital and transport costs assuming far greater significance. These costs are likely to be lower in South Africa than elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. International business is likely to adopt one of two main strategies for serving the African market in the 1990s: It will export into the region from offshore using agents, licensees or franchisees as a vehicle; or It will use South Africa as the mode of entry, manufacturing or assembling in the country primarily for domestic consumption while exporting residual amounts to the region. Clearly, neither strategy will work if African countries maintain tariffs and other barriers against imports. But with the march of economic reform, regional economies are being liberalised, thereby encouraging foreign firms to sell into the usually-tiny markets from outside rather than setting up shop behind high tariff barriers as was the pattern in the 1950s and 60s. There are two polar views of how trade and investment flows will evolve in Southern Africa. On the one hand, the locomotive theory holds that South Africa will become the region's economic dynamo that helps turn the sub-Saharan economy around. The alternative school holds that South Africa, certainly for the immediate future, has more than enough on its domestic plate to make much of a contribution to the regional turnround. Indeed, there are even those in Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe who predict that relocation will, in fact, go the other way, with firms emigrating from South Africa to escape political violence and industrial relations unrest, and exploiting more tranquil labour market conditions - and lower costs - elsewhere. This is an unlikely scenario given the growing tendency for manufacturers to locate as close as possible to their main markets. The more likely scenario is one in which South Africa becomes the platform for exploiting market opportunities in east, central and southern Africa. South African business is well placed, too, to participate in rebuilding the region's physical infrastructure, on which massive amounts - much of it aid money - will be spent. South Africa aside, there is little indigenous capacity in the region to handle major physical infrastructural projects. South African businesses will have the edge, too, in some African privatisation programmes - their investment banks and mining houses are already active in countries such as Mozambique and Zambia where privatisation moves are gathering speed. African leaders will be perturbed less at the prospect of growing South African participation in their economies, than with the potentially one-way traffic that this implies. Few countries in the region have much to sell to Pretoria other than raw materials (oil, copper, coffee, cocoa, tobacco) and tourism. The saving grace - though this will depend on close links with multinationals, often with regional headquarters in South Africa - could be the development of sub-contracting and components manufacture for final assembly in the south. This would turn launchpad South Africa into a positive sum game in which there are winners all round.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

They aim to put European Union [EU] trading nations firmly  in  the front line in the threecornered fight between Europe, the  United States and the Far East over access to the resources-rich  nation.    The EU delegation will be made up of representatives from  several major directorates-general and will be in South Africa  from 27 June to 2 July. Trade, investment and tariffs are to be  discussed in depth as part of a comprehensive package earlier  agreed by the Council of Ministers.    Britain's trade and economics group, which will be at least  60-strong, will be headed by board of trade president Michael  Heseltine and is believed to be one of the largest delegations  to leave the UK this year.    During the visit -- from 10 to 15 July -- the British group  will meet business people and politician; in Johannesburg,  Durban and Cape Town. Britain has already pledged a $150  million loan the largest amount from any European country.    The EU delegation will arrive in Cape Town for talks with  Trevor Manuel, South Africa's minister for trade and industry  and other senior ministers, before going on to Pretoria and  Johannesburg. Apart from wider issues, the talks are crucial  because South Africa's status as a trading partner and as a  suitable investment prospect has to be clarified.    If firm future trade links are to be set up, a bilateral  agreement between Brussels and Pretoria is seen as a matter of  urgency. So far, the EU has left it to member states to enter  into investment protection, double taxation and bilateral trade  agreements with South Africa, but has now accelerated the pace  at which it feels agreement must be reached with South Africa in  the face of American initiatives.    With the total U.S. commitment of $420m in loans towards  economic and social regeneration in South Africa both from  public and private sectors, the pledges of $179m this year from  the EU and member countries apart from the UK may look small in  comparison. However, EU contributions will be grants, without  strings attached.    In April, the EU foreign affairs council finalised its  policy  on a joint trade and aid measures programme and following the  South African elections, this is a priority issue on the  delegation menu.    The visit is seen as the first of a two-phase thrust to  establish future relations. The second phase will begin with a  conference in the EU with delegates from all southern African  countries. Mandela has already agreed in principle to the  creation of a Southern African Economic Community and this will  be actively pursued.    The EU wants to prepare the way for other areas of  cooperation in education and training, industry and commerce,  telecommunications science and technology.     "

While Peace Day marchers nationwide sang the country's two national anthems, the release of worse-than-expected inflation figures caused bond yields to soar over 17 per cent, effectively ending the possibility of any further interest rate cuts. In response, economists downgraded growth estimates for the year to between 2-2.5 per cent from the previously-expected 3-4 per cent. All this puts further pressure on President Nelson Mandela and his African National Congress-led goverment. With nearly half the potential workforce unemployed and 7m people out of 40m without proper homes, they desperately want to provide tangible evidence of the fall of apartheid to their constituents in the form of jobs and housing. But they are constrained by the need to maintain economic credibility in the eyes of the global financial community so as to attract new foreign loans and investment to the country. In his June budget, Mr Derek Keys, outgoing finance minister, restricted the allocation to the government's centrepiece Reconstruction and Development Programme to only R2.5bn (Pounds 696m), to keep to his commitment of lowering the budget deficit. Despite this, as signalled by last week's collapse in bonds, the markets still believe a degree of overspending is inevitable, given the wide range of demands on state resources, particularly as the new network of local and regional governments is established during the year. But, damaging though this might be, the biggest problems faced by the South African economy are structural and not susceptible to short-term monetary or fiscal panaceas. A legacy of economic problems from the previous government (at least before Mr Keys was appointed two years ago) has left the new administration with a very limited set of policy options. During the 1980s, growth stagnated but government spending rose relentlessly. In consequence, the budget deficit rose from next to nothing to more than 8 per cent of Gross Domestic Product in 1992. Although that figure has now been brought below 7 per cent, and is budgeted at 6.6 per cent for 1994-5, government spending still takes up an exorbitant 21 per cent of GDP, well above international norms. Given the high personal tax levels already in place, the only viable way of reducing this is through real cuts in government spending and a willingness to jettison controversial policies such as the maintenance of high tariffs for a largely uncompetitive manufacturing industry. In delivering his annual report last month, Mr Chris Stals, Reserve Bank Governor, pulled no punches in driving home this point. He emphasised that unless deep-seated problems such as excessive protectionism, high labour costs, widespread labour unrest and persistently high inflationary expectations were tackled immediately, the longer-term growth potential of the economy would be seriously damaged. Formidable though these obstacles might be, the outlook is not one of unrelieved gloom. Inflation may be on the rise again, but even its current 8.2 per cent is well down on the 15-16 per cent reached only a few years ago; overall inflation for the year is expected to remain in single digits. While the wave of labour unrest may be damaging, total strike action remains below levels seen as recently as 1991. Many analysts believe this year's disputes are artificially exacerbated by the heightened expectations resulting from the election and the inexperience of a new wave of labour leaders. Next year's wage talks are expected to be markedly calmer. Even more encouragingly, the government is publicly committed to a strategy of pursuing export-led growth and reducing protection for industry in line with the new Gatt arrangements. In recent weeks, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has warned manufacturers the goverment intends to reduce protection even below Gatt-required levels in some over-protected industries such as textiles and the motor industry. Fixed investment and private savings have both turned around after years of decline and are rising, while business confidence is at a five-year high. Exports, in both commodities and manufactured goods, have been expanding steadily. Foreign reserves remain at pitifully low levels, barely able to cover five weeks' imports, but indications are that the huge capital outflows which bled South Africa over the past few years have now largely ceased. With total foreign currency-denominated debt at only Dollars 16.7bn (Pounds 11.1bn) and interest payments accounting for just 7 per cent of exports in 1993, South Africa has some scope for new borrowing. While foreign investment has so far been largely restricted to shorter-term investments in the bond and equity markets, deterred in part by the maintenance of the country's two-tier currency, many foreigners remain remarkably sanguine about the country's prospects. 'I've been very impressed with the sophistication of the infrastructure and the quality of the people,' notes Mr Steve Walsh, chief executive officer of the US-based group Pillsbury International, which has just embarked on a R152m joint venture with the South African food-processor Foodcorp. 'I think this country has a lot of potential,' he says. The problems are immense, and the country is far from being able to achieve the Asian 'tiger'-type growth rates it so desperately desires, but the fact remains that South Africa's overall economic outlook is better than for decades. As a report on the country to be released this week by the Union Bank of Switzerland concludes: 'South Africa has the main ingredients required to place the country firmly on the high road to development.' It will be a long hard climb, but South Africans will be hoping that soon, national celebrations of the country's economic success will be held to complement this year's political ones.

Mr John Major is expected to announce the provision of more nursery places for children aged four in his keynote address to the conference today. Late last year the prime minister called for nursery education to be provided for all children, but acknowledged that there was a short-term funding barrier. It is understood that in spite of the stringency of this year's public spending round the Treasury has approved Department for Education plans to introduce such a scheme in the next two to three years. Yesterday Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, announced tougher standards for teaching in primary and secondary schools in England and Wales. Mrs Shephard told Tory representatives at Bournemouth that a tougher curriculum for English language teaching would be introduced next year, amid widespread concern that standards of literacy have slipped sharply in recent years. She also launched an initiative to raise public consciousness about the need for good communication skills, inviting leaders of business and industry to tell the government about their experience in this area. She said: 'I want to put together a national campaign, inviting politicians, industry, the media and business to raise awareness about the need for clear communication. It is very important that people in business understand the importance of communicating clearly with the customer.' Mrs Shephard assured representatives that the government would impose a period of stability in primary and secondary education in the next few years to allow its recent reforms to take root. She made clear that the workload on teachers imposed by the national curriculum would be sharply reduced following the implementation of a report by Sir Ron Dearing. Announcing that she would accept Sir Ron's report in full, Mrs Shephard told journalists that 20 per cent of the timetable for primary school teachers would be flexible and 40 per cent for secondary schools.

With the growing number of ODA recipients, it  has become increasingly difficult for Japan to undertake  assistance alone due to linguistic or technical problems. Japan  will, therefore, aim at more effective aid through joint  international ODA projects. It will discuss new joint projects  in African and Asian countries with Canada, Sweden, South  Africa, Israel, and the EC Commission, while also increasing  existing joint international ODA efforts with the United States,  Britain, and other countries.    Japan's ODA has again surpassed the United States in 1993,  becoming the world's top aid donor for three consecutive years.  While ODA from the Western nations has leveled off, Japan's ODA  has been increasing not only in Asia, but also in Africa and  Latin America, where it used to give minimal assistance. Plans  for ODA in East Europe and the Central Asian states of the  former USSR have also come up for consideration since 1993.    However, there are problems such as the shortage of Japanese  technicians who can speak the local languages. Japan will  attempt to solve these problems by cooperating with other  advanced nations. Furthermore, this will also ensure more  efficient management of ODA, the appropriations for which have  not been increased as expected due to Japan's financial  difficulties.    Japan is considering a joint aid program with South Africa  for the economic reconstruction of Mozambique, Lesotho, and  other neighboring countries of South Africa. Such a joint aid  program with South Africa will also express the Japanese  Government's approval of the democratization efforts in South  Africa, which has succeeded in instituting a general election  with black participation for the first time in history.    Joint ODA efforts in Africa are also being considered with  Sweden and Canada, while joint projects will be implemented in  Africa or Vietnam with Canada. Sweden and Canada are advanced  nations in terms of ODA. Japan also hopes to acquire ODA  knowhow from these countries.    Cooperative efforts in the area of refugee relief in the  Philippines, and agricultural development in Thailand have  already been undertaken with the United States. Japan wants to  cooperate with the United States in a wildlife conservation  program in Indonesia.     "

But SA [South African] Foreign  Minister Alfred Nzo says membership is part of South Africa's  strategy to end its international isolation.    Speaking in Cairo on the eve of a four-day NAM conference,  Mr  Nzo said international networking was critical for the success  of his government's internal development policy: ""The contact  we have trade-wise and economic-wise with various countries of  the world is bound to assist our process (of restructuring).""    According to Mr Nzo, South Africa is expecting to be  accepted  as an NAM member on Tuesday. He said that joining the  108-member organisation was also a ""natural development"", since  the movement had supported the anti-apartheid struggle and had  given SA ""liberation movements"" observer status.    Mr Nzo is attending the summit in Cairo at a critical moment  in the movement's history. The NAM was created in the 1960's to  help developing nations assert their independence from the  United states and Soviet superpowers. Now that the Cold War is  over it is trying to recast itself as a pressure group fighting  for third world interests.    The future of the movement is one of the items members are  scheduled to discuss this week. They are expected to advocate  focussing on ""more of an economic role"".    South Africa has also just been accepted into the  Organisation of African Unity and Mr Nzo said it hoped to join  the United Nations in the coming months.    The end of isolation means South Africa will be expected to  get involved in efforts to contain regional conflicts, like that  in Rwanda. Mr Nzo said that for now however his government  would stick to humanitarian aid while it got its own military  house in order. ""We are engaged in the process of rebuilding a  new army in our country...and we can't therefore be expected  before that process is completed, to let our soldiers march (in  peacekeeping operations).""    The Cold War superpowers, particularly the US, have  traditionally barred NAM countries from developing nuclear  weapons. Mr Nzo said South Africa would not use its nuclear  capacity to equalise the imbalance in the nuclear equation but  would ""certainly participate in the peaceful uses of nuclear  energy"".     "

ACTION:     Notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and Other rquirements for grants to be made in Fiscal Year 1995.              SUMMARY:     The Secretary proposes priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994 under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary intends to invite applications that, within the absolute priority of correctional education, incorporate one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) Advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also proposes to impose requirements related to the priorities and other matters, and to use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only.           DATES:     Comments must be received on or before May 6, 1994.           ADDRESSES:     All comments concerning these proposed priorities should be addressed to Gail M. Schwartz, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 4529, Switzer Building, Washington, DC 202027242.           FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Gail M. Schwartz or Christopher Koch, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, room 4529, Switzer Building, Washington, DC 202027242. Telephone: (202)-2055621. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Dual Party Relay Service at 18008778339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers, labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.       The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population. The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows:          About seven in ten prisoners *** are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.vi).          Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success'' published in the Journal of Correctional Education, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker,     et al    ., 1990).     Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees since the majority of the Nation's criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. There were about 4.5 million individuals under correctional supervision in the United States by the end of 1991, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of these, 3.3 million, or approximately 73 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.   Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills, and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.

ACTION:     Notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and Other rquirements for grants to be made in Fiscal Year 1995.              SUMMARY:     The Secretary proposes priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994 under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the proposed absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary intends to invite applications that, within the absolute priority of correctional education, incorporate one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) Advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also proposes to impose requirements related to the priorities and other matters, and to use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only.           DATES:     Comments must be received on or before May 6, 1994.           ADDRESSES:     All comments concerning these proposed priorities should be addressed to Gail M. Schwartz, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., room 4529, Switzer Building, Washington, DC 202027242.           FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:     Gail M. Schwartz or Christopher Koch, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, room 4529, Switzer Building, Washington, DC 202027242. Telephone: (202)-2055621. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Dual Party Relay Service at 18008778339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday.             SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:       The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers, labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals. Specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.       The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population. The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows:          About seven in ten prisoners *** are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p.vi).          Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success'' published in the Journal of Correctional Education, found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker,     et al    ., 1990).     Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees since the majority of the Nation's criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. There were about 4.5 million individuals under correctional supervision in the United States by the end of 1991, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Of these, 3.3 million, or approximately 73 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.   Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills, and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.

A survey by the British Chambers of Commerce and the business finance specialist Alex Lawrie says as many as 39 per cent claim to be suffering from a 'skills gap', with two-thirds citing the literacy of recruits as their main problem. More than half said recruits suffered from poor numeracy. The survey included 487 companies, each employing fewer than 50 people. Just more than a third of respondents said the cost of recruiting and training staff was a barrier to their company's employment prospects. Two-thirds said they had trouble in finding staff of the required calibre. The survey found the single most important barrier to employment was 'low or unpredictable demand in the economy', with 54 per cent citing this as their most important difficulty. Small companies said the most difficult jobs to fill were in production/engineering (39 per cent), followed by marketing and sales (38 per cent). One in five reported difficulties in recruiting managerial or secretarial staff. Mr Richard Brown, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said yesterday: 'The basic skills base has long been the Achilles heel of long-term industrial success. If the government is looking to small firms to hire people - and they are right to do so - it will be seriously disappointed while so many barriers remain.' Many small companies complained about the lack of flexibility and adaptability among their employees as well as 'a scarcity of creativity and imagination'. Only 13 per cent found that their local training and enterprise council 'had been useful in identifying and meeting skills needs'. More than half the sample said the poverty trap was a barrier to employment, with recruits being better off living on social security than with the kind of pay package offered by small employers. Just under 40 per cent cited direct wage costs as a barrier to job creation. British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SWI 3QB. Pounds 60.00.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

But the ""Cape route"" for  shipping and the 3,000 km of South African coastline are still  of prime geostrategic importance and a major economic asset.  Located at the confluence of major commercial routes, the  country has port, road, and rail infrastructure that is both a  gateway to the rest of the African continent and a natural  outlet for southern African countries that have no direct access  to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.    Despite--or perhaps because of--the relative international  isolation forced upon it as a result of its policy of ""separate  development,"" South Africa also has become a true regional  economic power. Sitting on a vast heap of gold (the country has  50 percent of global reserves) and diamonds (25 percent), it  furnishes 52 percent of the electricity, 83 percent of the  steel, and 97 percent of coal products for the whole continent,  and provides half its industrial production.    Now that the country is committed to the path of  democratizing its institutions and opening up to the outside  world, the wealth that was built on a foundation of racial  inequality and discrimination is both seductive and worrisome to  its neighbors, who are frightened at the hegemonic tendencies  that might emerge in the ""new South Africa.""    The international community, deaf to misgivings frequently  articulated by experts on the region--""Southern Africa stands to  South Africa in the same relationship that Europe would stand to  Germany, if Germany were all Europe had""--is trying once again  to evoke that ""Afro-optimism,"" which so often miscarried in the  past as one African country after the next fell into insolvency.  And it dares to hope that this ""politico-socio-economic  laboratory"" with its eyes turned (at least for the moment)  toward Europe, its principal trading partner--a laboratory  situated midway between two high-growth zones, Asia Pacific and  Latin America, whose future seems assured at least for a  generation---will be the engine of economic development that  sub-Saharan Africa so desperately needs. ""Nigeria and South  Africa are the only big economic powers capable of stabilizing  the African continent,"" says one observer familiar with these  countries.    It is an observed fact that South Africa's trade with its  neighbors comprises only a very small part (less than 7 percent)  of its total external commerce--the country's inward looking  orientation was deplored by the African Development Bank in a  recent report prepared at the request of Egypt's Husni Mubarak.  All the more reason to expect, now that South Africa has turned  over a new ideological leaf and the former so-called frontline  states opposed to apartheid have done the same, that trade will  expand among the southern African countries with their combined  population of 115 million inhabitants--who represent 115 million  potential consumers--however slowly the economic capacity of  their respective countries might grow.    Regional Integration    The next phase should be real regional integration, in  stages, by means of economic cooperation instruments whose role  now needs to be reexamined. This is the working hypothesis  advanced by Alan Hirsch, assistant director and economics  instructor at Cape University, one of the architects of South  Africa's future commercial policy, which was drawn up for  Mandela's ANC.    ""Our neighbors have no reason to fear economic domination  from our side. On the contrary, it is in our interest to help  them expand their own economies,"" he says. This white official,  head of Cape's development policy research unit, developed the  theory at the meeting in Gaborone (Botswana) last February, in  collaboration with the ANC's ""external trade relations"" team and  representatives of the southern African countries.    This regional miniconference afforded an opportunity to see  the extremely cautious approach taken by both sides. While the  other countries in the region may favor increased cooperation  with Pretoria, they realize very clearly that in many product  areas, competition is likely to prevail over complementarity.  ""There is such a gulf between South Africa and its neighbors  that there is a risk of killing embryonic industries in Namibia,  Botswana, and Zimbabwe,"" one expert confirmed.    On the South African side, the ""Mandela team,"" and hence the  future government of national union, although describing itself  as intensely interested in relations with its neighbors, does  not intend to be diverted from the top priority of the hour,  amelioration of the country's domestic situation. However,, the  ANC has not ruled out consideration of other partners. ""We do  want access to other markets besides Europe and southern  Africa,"" says Mr. Hirsch, adding that ANC already has made  contacts with the United States to ask for most favored nation  [MFN] status. The big lesson learned from the Gaborone meeting  was that if integration is going to happen, the panoply of  regional accords now in force will have to be revised.    These agreements come in several different forms, from  simple  free trade area to customs union, and even the beginnings of  what might evolve into a regional common market--""our own  version of the European Union,"" as President de Klerk puts it.  Already the region has a Common Monetary Area (CMA); a monetary  union comprising South Africa, Botswana, and Swaziland; and a  South African Customs Union (SACU) that includes South Africa,  Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia (since its independence in 1990), and  Swaziland.    In addition to these monetary and customs institutions,  there  are economic cooperation agreements. The most important of these  is the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) that encompasses 18 central  and east African countries but until now has excluded South  Africa. The Southern Africa Development and Coordination  Conference (SADCC) composed of Angola, Botswana, Lesotho,  Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe  has set its sights higher. Revamped in 1993 as the South African  Development Community (SADC), it intends to put its political  past behind it.    Immigration Issue    In all likelihood, the future integration of the region,  with  Pretoria as catalyst, will be grafted onto PTA and SADC. But do  not forget: It is not going to happen in the immediate future.  ""Hopes of seeing South Africa play a major role in the region  are probably exaggerated,"" says the Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) in a study on the country's  future that appeared in the house magazine, OBSERVER. ""The  private sector is clearly less committed to investing in the  region than was hoped, if only in terms of the small volume of  investments in South Africa itself,"" add the authors of the  article, underscoring the country's need to resolve its own  internal problems before anything else.    One of these is the increasing volume of immigration from  neighboring countries, which certainly will add new  complications to future commercial or economic negotiations  among the southern African countries. Mandela warned some time  ago that South Africa could not afford to become ""the job market  for the entire region."" More bluntly, his entourage has openly  admitted it will be necessary to ""deport 2 million undesirables""  hailing from such places as Zaire and Mozambique. The future  government of national union may adopt legislation to this end.    Meanwhile, an ANC delegation visited France early this year  for talks with Interior Minister Charles Pasqua. No doubt  Pasqua's lieutenants provided the ANC representatives with some  ""tried-and-true"" prescriptions in this domain.     "

The foreign secretary said he would be discussing how the aid could be best used when attending the inauguration of Mr Nelson Mandela as president on May 10. The Pounds 100m will be made available by the Overseas Development Administration from its existing budget.

The Queen's English Society found that 38 per cent of the 248 companies it surveyed had had to spend money to bring their recruits' literacy up to required standard. Others said they wished to do so, but did not have enough funds. Most recruits were 'poor' at writing reports, memoranda and minutes, and giving presentations, according to the responses. There were particular problems with application forms, with some applicants unable to spell the titles of their GCSEs. Many recruits were unable to spell words such as 'business' and 'separate'. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said that if the survey's findings were true, even in part, 'the 16 to 18-year-olds referred to in this survey have spent their entire school life under a Conservative government'. Mr Bernard Lamb, a lecturer in the biology department at Imperial College, London, who compiled the report, called for more conservative teaching methods, such as correcting errors in spoken English. However, the working group of academics which is redrafting the English national curriculum for England and Wales, has ruled this out. Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said: 'Employers have always complained about standards of school leavers since state education was introduced. In 1861 the Newcastle Commission complained of low standards and payment by results was introduced. Apparently, that did not succeed.' The Confederation of British Industry said that other countries were in a similar position, and that employers' needs had changed with 70 per cent of recruits requiring 'cerebral' skills compared with only 30 per cent in 1950. A shortage of good science and technology teachers is predicted today by the independent National Commission on Education. It has found in a survey that only 10 per cent of students expecting to earn a first-class degree had applied for jobs in teaching, against 27 per cent in line for a third.

Mr John Major, the British prime minister, said the UK wanted to work with South Africa and other African countries to 'turn the tide' against violence and war on the continent. Mr Major announced the initiative during an historic address to an informal joint sitting of parliament at the beginning of the first official visit to South Africa by a British prime minister since 1960. Earlier, he met South African President Nelson Mandela for talks on rebuilding the two countries' traditionally close relationship, which was weakened during South Africa's international isolation under the former whites-only government. Officials said the talks were conducted in 'an atmosphere of great warmth', suggesting that the ANC-led government of national unity has forgiven Britain for its less than enthusiastic endorsement of sanctions against the former regime. Mr Major urged South Africa to join the international community in bringing prosperity to the whole of Africa by helping to pre-empt outbreaks of violence, rather than trying to limit trouble after it had started. 'An entirely new effort at preventive diplomacy is long overdue. With our friends in Africa . . . Britain wants to develop new mechanisms to head off conflicts before they become unstoppable,' he said. 'We have in mind, for example, setting up regional peacekeeping cells. We need more people trained to mediate and act as peace brokers. We would not need a cumbersome bureaucracy, but a tight and properly resourced infrastructure in Africa.' The British proposals will be spelled out in more detail to the United Nations next week by Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, who has long sought a bigger role for pre-emptive mediation in international peacekeeping efforts. However, officials said the plan was intended to build on a recent resolution by the Organisation of African Unity calling for better conflict resolution procedures on the continent. They said the initiative was not intended to involve large numbers of troops, although the final shape of the peacekeeping force was likely to be determined by the UN and the OAU.

After years of  sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro  arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it  was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South  Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an  extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization,  nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have  spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and  the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony  and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have  expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by  the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized  that what has taken place over the past few days was without  doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for  the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I  was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take  with me when I return to Cuba.    [Theron] How do you see future relations between South  Africa  and Cuba?    [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends.  We are like family. A family does not discuss formal  relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba  and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My  visit has also provided the opportunity for even better  relations between the two countries in the future. This could  be of mutual benefit.    [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what  has Cuba got to offer South Africa?    [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products  which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as  we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost  anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced  technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce  everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our  two countries. South Africa will play an important role in  Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many  years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value  for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great  experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to  succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in  serious conflicts in many places.    [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and  Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you  think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took  place in South Africa?    [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices.  But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's  knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It  was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being  defeated.    [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is  still the right system for Cuba?    [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own  creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed  in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle  against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather,  it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a  great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the  things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we  overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved  that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own.  This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point,  without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops  almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong  nation driven by certain principles.    [Theron] Will the future system of government still be  communism for Cuba?    [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but  we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and  technology, which we now need in order to develop our country.  So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in  many areas. There is a process of change under way in our  country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the  world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]     "

All of Africa seems  to be spread out below as the plane zigzags its way to Johannesburg on a  curious route. The plane must burrow through endless clouds, for although its  presence in African airspace may be tolerated, the plane may not land unless  invited.    Mt. Kilimanjaro, snow-capped and majestic, juts abruptly from the desert floor,  rising like a kingdom in the clouds. Miles later, the outline of Nairobi's  airport comes into view. Landing there, the jumbo jet spits out streams of  khaki-clad tourists with a clattering of cameras.    After spending a long night on the plane, passengers continuing their journey  are eager to get out and stretch their legs during the two-hour layover. But an  announcement from the captain puts an end to that glad possibility. Those  passengers bound for Johannesburg, South Africa, the captain said, are asked to  remain on board, at the request of the Kenyan authorities.    Viewed from the plane's window, the Tarmac shimmers in the summer heat. The  plane bound for South Africa sits alone on the runway, like an unwelcome  insect.    In a very real way, getting to South Africa is a metaphor for being there.  International sanctions do not make it easy. It can be circuitous. If you are  going to South Africa, for whatever reason, there are places where you no  longer will be welcome. The country's own consulate advises against having a  South African stamp on your passport. It can be infinitely complicated.    Having gotten there, through the tsk-tsking of international opinion, it  doesn't take long to sense the isolation. The world does not want to come here,  and people here aren't free to move about the world. In a sports sense, it is  as if South Africa is a nation of children, possessing a beautiful playground  and wondrous toys, but no friends come to play. And every day they watch and  wait.    But South Africa has grown weary of waiting. Three generations of athletes have  stood by and watched. Now they want to play. After decades of boycotts --  economic, diplomatic, cultural and sporting -- this nation says it deserves the  right to play with the rest of the world.      APARTHEID: ""A Terrible Dream""    The root of South Africa's isolation is apartheid -- the country's legislated  and systematic policy of racial separation that has been the law of the land  since 1948. And, although some reform has occurred in 42 years, the basic  tenets of apartheid are still firmly in place. The world's response to  apartheid has been to punish and shun South Africa through a series of measures  aimed at disrupting the country's status quo.    The longest, and to some the hardest hitting, of all sanctions has been South  Africa's sports isolation. It began, perhaps, in 1956, when the International  Table Tennis Federation expelled the South African Table Tennis Union, and for  the past 30 years, South Africa has been the pariah of sporting nations.    No country has been subject to anything remotely like the sports isolation  South Africa has experienced. South African athletes have not been allowed to  compete in the Olympic Games since 1960. There is an international ban that  forbids any athlete in any Olympic sport from competing in South Africa. There  is an international ""contamination rule"" that forbids competition against a  South African athlete anywhere in the world. South African citizens who wanted  to watch the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea were told to leave. South  African journalists wanting to cover the Games were denied credentials.    The state-run South African Broadcasting Co. is not permitted to buy the  broadcast rights to many of the world's premier sporting events.    South African society has helped fashion its own noose, however. Three decades  of isolation has come solely because of what has been called ""a terrible dream""  -- apartheid. Apartheid is the mechanism that has kept South Africa's nonwhite  athletes from an opportunity for comparable competition, training, coaching and  facilities within the country. Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into  four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East  Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white.    The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27  million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian --  has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding  sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact,  the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on  this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union  line up in complete agreement?    Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and  leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours --  athletes from ""outside"" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much  the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for  $2 million a night.    There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of  1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction  of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to  South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to  encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation.    Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South  African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions.  Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the  country.    So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object  when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most  athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years  from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South  Africa.    The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency:  South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough  money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are  bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will  allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams  forward.    South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for  athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using  false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad.    Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different  from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there  is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which  is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of  endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy.    Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a  spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and  difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others  note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in  education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth.      SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly'    The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when  they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural  boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South  Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the  country's own film industry is thriving.    The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and  writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition  must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of  facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on  paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain  sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform.  There is talent here, but there is also stagnation.    The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called  ""South Africa's soft underbelly,"" for sports are the embodiment of South  African pride and culture.    Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: ""Denying South  Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the  medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives.""    In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for  granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail  to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa,  sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria. While keeping one  eye on her charges before a meet one night recently, she listed the  difficulties of coaching athletes who can never go anywhere to compete.    ""To keep them going and motivated is really hard,"" she said. ""They never have  any competition. My attitude is to never run them against anyone in practice,  only (against) the watch. That way they can learn to push themselves.    ""I must tell you, whenever I get an athlete who can make it, really make it, I  have two feelings at once. First, I am excited, because this is what a coach  works for. Then, I am sad. I know they will never get the competition, they can  never go to the Olympics. They are not allowed. This is the way we have in  South Africa. It is the hard way.""    The frustration is evident in nearly every athlete and coach. Myrtle Bothma,  ranked No. 1 in the world this season in the 400-meter hurdles, has still not  quietly accepted her plight. Bothma, who is white, echoes the popular sentiment  from athletes -- why hold us responsible for a political system we can do  nothing about?    ""I don't see how hurting me, not allowing me to run against the best 400-meter  hurdlers in the world, is going to help anything,"" she said. ""If they don't  want the white sportsmen to take part, why don't they take the black man? We  would love to see it.    ""You get a feeling, a kind of anger towards people who sit around a table in  their little suits and look at a little bit of paper and say, 'South Africa,  no.' They don't know what it's like to be a sportsman, to struggle, to work.  They can decide my future.    ""One day, I wish I was a fly with a sting. I could sit in that boardroom with  the (International Olympic Committee) in their meeting. When they decide not to  let South Africa compete, I would give them one sting, to make them think what  are they doing. I think they see the issue as something on a piece of paper,  not people.""

All of Africa seems  to be spread out below as the plane zigzags its way to Johannesburg on a  curious route. The plane must burrow through endless clouds, for although its  presence in African airspace may be tolerated, the plane may not land unless  invited.    Mt. Kilimanjaro, snow-capped and majestic, juts abruptly from the desert floor,  rising like a kingdom in the clouds. Miles later, the outline of Nairobi's  airport comes into view. Landing there, the jumbo jet spits out streams of  khaki-clad tourists with a clattering of cameras.    After spending a long night on the plane, passengers continuing their journey  are eager to get out and stretch their legs during the two-hour layover. But an  announcement from the captain puts an end to that glad possibility. Those  passengers bound for Johannesburg, South Africa, the captain said, are asked to  remain on board, at the request of the Kenyan authorities.    Viewed from the plane's window, the Tarmac shimmers in the summer heat. The  plane bound for South Africa sits alone on the runway, like an unwelcome  insect.    In a very real way, getting to South Africa is a metaphor for being there.  International sanctions do not make it easy. It can be circuitous. If you are  going to South Africa, for whatever reason, there are places where you no  longer will be welcome. The country's own consulate advises against having a  South African stamp on your passport. It can be infinitely complicated.    Having gotten there, through the tsk-tsking of international opinion, it  doesn't take long to sense the isolation. The world does not want to come here,  and people here aren't free to move about the world. In a sports sense, it is  as if South Africa is a nation of children, possessing a beautiful playground  and wondrous toys, but no friends come to play. And every day they watch and  wait.    But South Africa has grown weary of waiting. Three generations of athletes have  stood by and watched. Now they want to play. After decades of boycotts --  economic, diplomatic, cultural and sporting -- this nation says it deserves the  right to play with the rest of the world.      APARTHEID: ""A Terrible Dream""    The root of South Africa's isolation is apartheid -- the country's legislated  and systematic policy of racial separation that has been the law of the land  since 1948. And, although some reform has occurred in 42 years, the basic  tenets of apartheid are still firmly in place. The world's response to  apartheid has been to punish and shun South Africa through a series of measures  aimed at disrupting the country's status quo.    The longest, and to some the hardest hitting, of all sanctions has been South  Africa's sports isolation. It began, perhaps, in 1956, when the International  Table Tennis Federation expelled the South African Table Tennis Union, and for  the past 30 years, South Africa has been the pariah of sporting nations.    No country has been subject to anything remotely like the sports isolation  South Africa has experienced. South African athletes have not been allowed to  compete in the Olympic Games since 1960. There is an international ban that  forbids any athlete in any Olympic sport from competing in South Africa. There  is an international ""contamination rule"" that forbids competition against a  South African athlete anywhere in the world. South African citizens who wanted  to watch the 1988 Seoul Olympics in South Korea were told to leave. South  African journalists wanting to cover the Games were denied credentials.    The state-run South African Broadcasting Co. is not permitted to buy the  broadcast rights to many of the world's premier sporting events.    South African society has helped fashion its own noose, however. Three decades  of isolation has come solely because of what has been called ""a terrible dream""  -- apartheid. Apartheid is the mechanism that has kept South Africa's nonwhite  athletes from an opportunity for comparable competition, training, coaching and  facilities within the country. Apartheid classifies South Africa's people into  four strict groups -- African for the black population, Asian for the East  Indian population, colored for the mixed-race, and white.    The open oppression of the majority -- of South Africa's 36 million people, 27  million are black, 5 million white, 3 million colored and 1 million Asian --  has been enough to keep the world away. The international bans forbidding  sporting contact with South Africa have been thorough and steadfast. In fact,  the solidarity that members of the international sporting community display on  this issue makes it unique. Where else can the United States and Soviet Union  line up in complete agreement?    Officially, South Africa's isolation is complete. However, sports officials and  leaders in the private sector occasionally finance so-called rebel tours --  athletes from ""outside"" are brought in at tremendous expense to perform in much  the same way as entertainers such as Frank Sinatra sing in nearby Sun City for  $2 million a night.    There is incentive for the promoters, too. The Income Tax Allowance Bill of  1986 allows a promoter of an international sporting event a maximum deduction  of 180%. The law asks that qualifying events must show a material advantage to  South Africa. The government views this tax break as a small price to pay to  encourage international visitors and ease the sense of isolation.    Companies are lining up to take advantage. In 1988, it was estimated that South  African businesses spent $120 million in sports sponsorships and promotions.  Sports-related advertising accounted for about 15% of the total ad sales in the  country.    So starved are South Africans for contact that money is seemingly no object  when it comes to luring athletes. Money has to be the incentive, because most  athletes who defy the bans and compete here are themselves banned for years  from their sports, thus ironically completing their solidarity with South  Africa.    The system of pay-for-play is an interesting example of market efficiency:  South Africa creates a market for foreign athletes by offering them enough  money to compensate for bans or suspensions. Once banned, the athletes are  bonded to South Africa because there is no other place in the world that will  allow them to compete. So, they return year after year, and the system steams  forward.    South African sports leaders have been creative in providing incentive for  athletes to stay here, because there are methods for South Africans -- using  false passports and names -- to travel and compete abroad.    Money has been an effective motivator. In this, South Africa is no different  from any other nation. For top athletes, especially top white athletes, there  is a lot of money to be made in amateur sports. Aside from prize money, which  is awarded at even the smallest competition, there is a large pool of  endorsement dollars available to the athlete who markets himself with savvy.    Large South African companies are looking for a black athlete to use as a  spokesman, too, but corporate executives say too often a poor education and  difficulty with the language limit the opportunities for black athletes. Others  note the irony here, since it is precisely limited opportunities, especially in  education, that keep blacks from sharing in South Africa's wealth.      SPORTS: South Africa's 'Soft Underbelly'    The various international sports organizations knew what they were doing when  they cut off South Africa. The nation has weathered the economic and cultural  boycotts with some hardship, but with ingenuity and an inward turn. South  Africans aren't allowed to see Woody Allen or Spike Lee films, but the  country's own film industry is thriving.    The problem for sports is more complicated. Whereas South African artists and  writers, for example, have flourished, athletes -- who almost by definition  must compete -- have been retarded in their growth. Athletes become weary of  facing the same competition before the same spectators, able to compare only on  paper their abilities against foreign athletes, and then only in certain  sports. They long to see new faces or even the colors of a different uniform.  There is talent here, but there is also stagnation.    The international sports boycotts have hit at what one official here called  ""South Africa's soft underbelly,"" for sports are the embodiment of South  African pride and culture.    Observed David Tothill, South Africa's ambassador to Australia: ""Denying South  Africans the means of expressing their own feelings of nationalism through the  medium of sport is probably one of the sports boycott's hidden objectives.""    In the rest of the world, where participation in the Olympic Games is taken for  granted, sports surely have their place in society, but a jaded public may fail  to be impressed with Olympic medals in colors other than gold. In South Africa,  sports are held on a higher plane. Perhaps the very act of denying this nation  the right to compete with the rest of the world has created in South Africans a  heightened regard for the things they cannot have.    What they do have, at every turn, is the back of sports' hand.    ""Since 1960, total isolation; there was disappointment in South Africa as you  have never seen before,"" said Johan Du Plessis, President of the South African  National Olympic Committee. ""Because of our climate and because of our  inheritance, we are so sports-inclined. Sport is part and parcel of the daily  life of a South African.    ""You must remember that all over South Africa, international competition is the  motivation behind everything. The ability and the possibility of a tour to the  outside world is something that stimulates a sport and it grows. This is  applicable not only to white people, but also to the blacks, Indian and the  colored.""    At first, sports officials scrambled to offer athletes something to compensate  for what they were missing. They organized the South African Games -- a  multi-sport, multinational competition -- on the theory that if South Africa  couldn't go to the world, the world could be brought to South Africa. The last  South African Games, in 1973, marked the last time the country has played host  to an international multisport competition.      SPORTS AND POLITICS: An Intimate Relationship    It is popular to speak of ""the marriage of sports and politics"" in the context  of contemporary international sports. Adolf Hitler and Jimmy Carter surely had  political agendas in mind that eventually affected the Olympic Games of 1936  and 1980. And so it has been, almost since the Games' inception. Recent history  shows, however, that the world learned many of these lessons at South Africa's  knee.    ""The people who married sports and politics were South Africans,"" said Jannie  Momberg, a member of Parliament from the liberal Democratic party and a former  official in South Africa's track and field federation. ""This country has banned  Japanese jockeys because they were nonwhite. We have a long, long list of  government and politics and sport being placed together here. We are the last  to complain.""    South Africa has meddled time and again in another nation's business when it  came to the preservation of the racial purity of South African sports. South  African sports officials have demanded rosters of visiting teams to root out  unwelcome nonwhite players. South African sports officials have told teams they  must not bring black athletes, even classifying an entire Brazilian soccer team  as mixed-race and therefore unacceptable.    The popular expression here among anti-government organizers is this: No normal  sport in an abnormal society.    The hard-liners require from athletes a strict sacrifice for the cause: No  participation in any government-sponsored event or program.    Given the extent of government presence in almost any endeavor in South Africa,  that places off-limits nearly every sporting opportunity, including school  sports and club sports, unless they are non-racial.    And since the anti-apartheid movement here can ill afford to organize and  provide alternative equipment, coaches, facilities and transportation of their  own, the children are left with nothing. Sometimes the athlete who decides to  compete anyway is given a harsh lesson in the realpolitik of sports in South  Africa.    Mark Plaatjes, the former South African marathon champion, was twice threatened  with necklacing, a brutal form of township punishment reserved for  ""collaborators"" in which a tire is placed around the victim's neck, doused with  gasoline and set afire.    Plaatjes, who is colored, was singled out because he was a high-profile  nonwhite and because he wanted to run. To do so in South Africa meant competing  for the South African Amateur Athletic Assn., the only body sponsoring track  and field.    ""What I object to is, they don't offer any alternative,"" Plaatjes said of the  anti-apartheid sports groups. Because of the increased threats against him and  his family, Plaatjes sought political asylum in the United States and has  applied for citizenship.    ""They tell athletes they must not compete because that will be seen as  supporting the government,"" Plaatjes said. ""Fine, but they offer no form of  competition themselves. Athletes want to express themselves and they have a  finite time to do so. These people say, 'Wait until things are better.' I think  that is harmful to nonwhite athletes in South Africa. Why not compete and show  the whites how good we are?""    An underlying philosophy of the boycott is that sports offer diversion from the  drudgery of daily life, a brief escape from reality. The sports boycott seeks  to force the white South Africans to face the reality in their country. Another  way to view boycotts is to understand that the majority of South Africans are  boycotted daily by their own government.    Apartheid's grand scheme of ""separateness"" of races has been realized to such a  degree that any joining together has at times seemed impossible.    However, in South Africa, the love of sport has often taken precedence over the  rule of law.    Harsh and restrictive apartheid laws were often ignored when applied to  sportsmen. Parliament has amended some laws to allow mixing in sport. For  example, black athletes arriving from overseas would normally be subject to  laws restricting their freedom to move about the country and stay where they  wish. That was circumvented by the granting of ""honorary white"" status to  nonwhite athletes for the duration of their stay.    A solution to the problem of housing foreign athletes was to designate certain  hotels as ""international hotels,"" where whites and nonwhites would be allowed  to mix. This solution eased tension among foreign business travelers, too.    The Group Areas Act, which separated the country into racial zones, was amended  to allow mixing not only on the field at an athletic event, but also among  spectators, which had been forbidden by law.    Before the Pass Laws were rescinded, nonwhites were required to carry at all  times a passport-sized booklet that contained the proper papers permitting them  to be in an all-white area. During that time, if blacks ran in a marathon whose  course went through an all-white area, the black runner was required to pin a  photocopied page of his pass to his running uniform or be subject to arrest.    Even with the changes announced by President Frederik W. de Klerk in February,  apartheid remains and prevents nonwhite South Africans from having access to  some public facilities. The Separate Amenities Act has legislated the strict  segregation of buses, theaters and libraries, for example. Sports and  recreation facilities are common sites for segregation.    Recently, most public beaches were opened to blacks. Previously, a black was  allowed to be on a white beach only as a nursemaid to a white child. The  Separate Amenities Act was the law the Dutch Reformed Church used to permit  blacks to enter its churches to clean them, but not to pray in them.    Not all public pools are integrated. In Pretoria, the seat of the national  government, the city only two months ago allowed nonwhites to fish for the  first time at Rietvlei Dam. Even that decision was met with vigorous  opposition.    Since the release in February of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, the  political climate in South Africa has been highly charged. So, too, has been  the climate for negotiations in sports. The recent political changes have made  all the issues more urgent, and sports officials here believe that they, at  last, may have some momentum. However, never before has the situation been so  delicate.      THE ISSUE: People, not Pawns    Bessie Windell coaches a track and field team in Pretoria.

0,FT933-5766 ,"FT933-5766 _AN-DIAB3AGEFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (5): In need of investment - Ghana      By EDWARD BALLS   GHANA'S achievements since its Economic Recovery Programme began in 1983 shows that adjustment works, say its proponents. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. World Bank officials argue that Ghana shows that adjustment, if properly pursued, need not mean greater poverty or fiscal austerity. The share of tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. And the sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has shifted resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. Nor can this growth record be explained by aid flows alone. Ghana remains heavily dependent on gross aid flow, totalling 8 per cent of GDP a year. But, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses, the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared with a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. There is another factor in Ghana's success, which World Bank officials prefer not to talk about: politics. Ghana's former military government has consistently tried to align its interests with the rural poor. The government also built an impressive record, over 10 years, before putting its popularity to the test at last autumn's elections. Ghana's record does seem to show that structural adjustment is necessary for an acceleration in economic growth. But it also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an accelerated growth and a rapid fall in poverty. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take 20 years for Ghana to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. The government plans to accelerate its growth rate to 8 per cent a year over the next decade, but it lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, and the civil service is weak. Meanwhile, the domestic economy remains heavily dependent on a narrow commodity base for export earnings, manufacturing exports are tiny, foreign investment minimal. Private investment amounted to only 8 per cent of GDP in Ghana in 1990, compared with 18 per cent in all developing countries and 32 per cent in Thailand. Success will be assured only when, and if, this investment starts to flow. Failure would be a serious blow to adjustment in Africa.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

While the African continent traversed some of the most  difficult times in the last year, it also witnessed moments of  triumph and hope.    The Cairo Declaration adopted by the OAU in June last year  on  the establishment of the mechanism to resolve African disputes  peacefully represented a landmark achievement of the  organization in the political sphere.    The treaty establishing the African Economic Community, that  came into effect last month, was the first step Africa has taken  toward economic integration and it is expected to have a  significant impact on the revitalization of the African economy.    The summit also acquires its special significance as it  comes  in the wake of the first all-race elections in South Africa, and  the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as its president.    Reforms to end apartheid in Pretoria have brought about  world  acceptance and South Africa was formally welcomed as the newest  member of the OAU on May 25.    But there are new challenges that the African continent is  still facing.    Despite the political and economic progress in the past  year,  some African countries are still suffering from war and domestic  disputes.    The conflict in Rwanda has shocked the world by its scale,  brutality and savagery, which is expected to call urgent  attention of the African leaders.    Besides, the accumulated crucial economic and social  problems  are hindering development of the African countries.    Over the recent years, African countries suffered greatly  from the low prices of primary commodities in the international  markets. The 53 OAU member states are struggling with growing  foreign debts, which in 1993 amounted to 302 billion U.S.  dollars, or three times the figure in 1980.    The unfavorable trade balance in 1993 reached as high as 1.6  billion U.S. dollars. In Africa alone, 33 belong to the 47  least developed countries in the world.    Perhaps more devastating are Africa's exploding population,  which now totals nearly 700 million. According to OAU  estimates, at the region's current average annual growth rate of  3.1 percent, Africa's population will reach approximately 1  billion by the year 2005.    In the early years of the decade of the 1990s, the annual  average growth rate of the GDP (gross domestic product) has been  a mere 1.5 percent. This is barely half of the African  population growing the trend of continuing decline in per capita  income and a further slide into poverty in Africa.    It is evident that the most pressing issue is the resolution  of ethnic tension and conflict throughout the African continent.  And the second most important problem is finding ways and means  of combating the rising tide of economic problems.    African conflicts and economic development will top the list  of concern on the agenda of the OAU summit from June 13 to 15.    Given the changing international situation, it has become  increasingly important for African countries to maintain  political stability for the benefit of economic development.    In that light, the issue of assuring security for economic  development will appear to be the main theme of the African  summit.     "
0,FT923-1945 ,"FT923-1945 _AN-CIUDDAABFT 920921   FT  21 SEP 92 / World Economy and Business Review (14): A continent drifts into crisis - Natural and man-made disasters, disease and debt are racking Africa / Poverty and Hunger      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   'THE challenge facing Africa is exceptional . . . the cost of failure would be appalling,' warned the World Bank nearly three years ago. The challenge - to reverse the economic decline of the region - turned out to be overwhelming, and the cost of failure is proving catastrophic. Without a combination of further debt relief, additional resources assisted by better management, and an upturn in the world economy, recovery in the foreseeable future is out of reach. Today sub-Saharan Africa, home to more than 500m people, is racked by natural and man-made disasters, disease and the burden of foreign debt exceeding Dollars 175bn. From Somalia to Zaire, from Mozambique to Sudan, economies and social structures are collapsing, symptoms of the continent's seemingly irreversible decline. In its seminal analysis of the continent's plight - Sub-Saharan Africa: From Crisis to Sustainable Growth - the bank said that 'overall, Africans are almost as poor today (1989) as they were 30 years ago'. To register 'a modest improvement in living standards', the report calculated, 'sub-Saharan economies must grow by at least 4 to 5 per cent annually'. Highly ambitious, given the region's past performance, the report's authors acknowledged, 'but we believe it can be achieved'. Nothing like that target has been reached, and nor does the bank's own forecast of growth in the 1990s suggest that it will be attained in the years to come. Aggregate GDP for sub-Saharan Africa rose by 1.3 per cent in 1990, and around 2.4 per cent in 1991: 'Not sufficient, in the context of Africa's high population growth rate (3.2 per cent),' observes the bank's 1992 annual report, 'to prevent per capita income from falling 0.6 per cent.' Earlier this year the bank was expecting growth of 3.4 per cent in 1992  - now being revised downward as the full affects of drought and a weak international economy are taken into account - and projected an average annual growth for the period 1990-2000 of 3.5 per cent. 'By 2,000, per capita gain in real income will be minimal for the region as a whole', warned the bank in its report, Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries, 'and may be negative in some countries.' 'Although relief can be expected from real increases in commodity prices and debt and debt service reduction measures,' the report continued, sub-Saharan Africa's limited stock of capital in equipment, infrastructure, and human resources precludes any sharp improvements in living standards.' Behind this detached analysis lies a tragedy of a dimension only partly revealed by some of the grim statistics carried in the bank's annual report. It calculates the number of poor at 228m - more than half sub-Saharan Africa's population. Per capita income of Dollars 340 in 1990 is 'exceeded by all the world's regions except South Asia'. For many of the poor, their hold on life is tenuous. War and drought have left 21m people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa. In southern Africa, enduring its worst drought this century, some 19m people need food aid. But what the statistics conceal is the extent to which the infrastructures and institutions have been disintegrating, leaving a generation of Africans without the resources to implement blueprints for recovery. With few exceptions, civil services are inefficient, schools and universities ill-equipped, and management weak. Whether the existing levels of aid can be sustained in the 1990s is open to doubt. Africa's worries that concessional assistance might be diverted to eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, are valid, acknowledges the bank: 'Unless donors' aid budgets are increased,' it warns, 'other developing countries may be affected.' No significant help is likely in the form of external investment. One of the most telling yardsticks of the loss of confidence in sub-Saharan Africa is the flow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Official figures show that non-oil exporting countries in sub-Saharan Africa received on average less than Dollars 0.5bn a year during the second half of the 1980s - 'roughly what Papua New Guinea alone attracted during the same period', a UN report wryly notes, and concludes: 'The low levels of FDI flowing to Africa underline the increasing marginalisation of the region.' Meanwhile, the spectre of Aids hangs over a continent already debilitated by malaria, bilharzia, guinea worm and other parasitic diseases. Estimates of the impact of Aids vary, but a conference last December in the Senegalese capital Dakar was told that even at the most conservative official estimates of the infection rate, at least 25 per cent of Africa's workforce could be affected by 2010. One in every 40 adults in Africa is already infected with the HIV virus that causes Aids. These victims are part of Africa's economic engine - 15 to 49-year-old farmers, mine workers, even the educated elite. Research presented at the conference on Aids in Africa found that the labour-intensive agricultural and mining industries, the two pillars of the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, are already suffering the impacts of Aids. Some economists warn that the Aids pandemic poses a threat of unprecedented economic disruption as the disease takes its toll. Some experts forecast that Aids will kill 5m or more adults in the next eight years. African officials argue that the world has a stake in helping their countries stem a disease that could, they fear, cripple the key economic sectors of the continent. 'Africa must not be abandoned,' says Dr Kekoura Kourouma, head of Guinea's national Aids programme. 'Remember, a sick population will not be able to work, will not be able to pay its debts.' Whether such an appeal to self-interest in the west will have a greater impact than humanitarian appeals remains to be seen. What seems certain is that the worst of Africa's anguish may be yet to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GROWTH OF REAL PER CAPITA INCOME IN HIGH INCOME AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (average annual percentage change of real per capita GDP)                    1960-70   1970-80   1980-90   1990    1991  1990-2000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All developing    countries           3.3       3.0       1.2   -0.2    -0.2       2.9 Sub-Saharan Africa     0.6       0.9      -0.9   -2.0    -1.0       0.3 East Asia              3.6       4.6       6.3    4.6     5.6       5.7 South Asia             1.4       1.1       3.1    2.6     1.5       3.1 Latin America          2.5       3.1      -0.5   -2.4     0.6       2.2 Middle East and     North Africa       6.0       3.1      -2.5   -1.9    -4.6       1.6 Eastern Europe         5.2       5.4       0.9   -8.3   -14.2       1.6 All high income   countries            4.1       2.4       2.4    2.1     0.7       2.1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: The former Soviet Union is not included in the totals  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank data  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page XIV  "

In reply to a question as to what led Iran to decide to  establish ties with South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""It should noted  that diplomatic ties have not been established with South  Africa. After the elections in April 1994, when the deprived  and suffering people of South Africa have attained their rights  and taken over the management of the country, we will, God  willing, establish diplomatic ties with South Africa. But what  was recently approved in the country and brought to the  attention of the people was the lifting of the restrictions we  had on our economic ties with South Africa.""    Mahdavi then comments on the events leading to the  forthcoming free elections and abrogation of apartheid in South  Africa.    On the reason for Iran's decision, he says: ""What led us to  decide to establish economic ties with South Africa was, first,  the recent events in South Africa and, second, the direct  request of the combative groups in South Africa, who wrote to us  and asked us to lift the restrictions on trade with South  Africa. However, we have deferred the establishment of  diplomatic ties, which will be the main basis of relations  between our country and South Africa, until after the elections,  when every black person has attained his rights there.""    Asked about Western media propaganda about Iran's u-turn in  its policy on Israel and South Africa, Mahdavi says: ""They,  themselves, know that they are not being truthful and that what  they are saying is not correct. We have declared our stance on  these two from the start. About South Africa, we said that when  racism is abolished there and the oppressed and innocent people  of South Africa take over power -- on the basis of one man one  vote -- we would establish diplomatic and economic ties with  that country. And we are moving in that direction now.  However, our stance on the Zionist regime has been clear from  the start. His holiness the imam said that the Zionist regime  must be destroyed. Yes, when the Zionist regime is destroyed  and the people of Palestine take over power, our relations with  the people of Palestine -- which is now occupied, but will then  be free -- will be established.""

Armed conflicts, which  have a destructive effect on international stability, social and  ethnic upheavals, massive famine and pandemic diseases,  terrorism and the narcotics business, are threats on a global  scale and objectively cannot but affect the interests and  security of other regions and states, Russia included.    The contemporary world, and above all the  industrially-developed countries, are faced with the growing  realization that one can hardly isolate oneself from the  problems of the African continent, which are already leading to  an increase in the influx of emigrants from Africa to Europe and  other regions: such as, the growth of Islamic extremism; and the  spread of diseases, including AIDS. It is no coincidence that in  this connection Prime Minister of France Balladour stated, that  the interests of his country ""are suffering greatly from African  crises, whether it is a question of development of trade,  reliable supply of raw materials, the dangers of uncontrolled  emigration, or conflicts which threaten to upset the balance of  power on the entire continent.""[.sup]1[/]    Obviously, for these same reasons, Russia too cannot wall  herself off from Africa behind the palisades of her own  difficulties. The moreso since, while acting judiciously and  with knowledge of affairs; and while structuring relationships  with the African states on a genuine, mutually advantageous  basis, with equal rights, without the previous distortions in  the ideological and military sphere--it is possible that  cooperation with Africa, which is still a rich and independent  region despite its severe crisis, can be put to use in  overcoming our own specific problems.    At the very same time, if we withdraw from Africa, we are  then in essence acknowledging our inability to engage in  positive, constructive cooperation, and we are confirming the  opinion which is still heard from time to time, that our policy  in Africa was founded merely on the negative values of the ""cold  war.""    The warm breeze of change, which is breaking up the ice of  many years of confrontation in the world, is blowing over Africa  as well. Many countries on this continent have set about making  democratic transformations: elections have been held on a  multi-party basis, fundamental rights of citizens have been  proclaimed, and more attention is being devoted to human rights.  The changes taking place in the world, and in African states as  well, along with those transformations which are being carried  out in Russia, force us to look anew at the development of  Russo-African relations as well. A thorough ""inventory"" must be  made of the experience of our over 30 years of ties, singling  out all that is of value and useful, and decisively rejecting  the approaches which were dictated by the market conditions and  ideological considerations of the past.    At the same time one can properly set the priorities in our  relations with Africa, discover the most promising areas for  cooperation, and determine the circle of reliable partners, only  on the basis of precise analysis and forecasting of the economic  and political development of African countries, taking into  consideration those factors which have decisive influence on the  formation of a political and economic climate both for the  African continent as a whole, and for the individual  countries.[passage omitted]    I believe that it is also in the Russian interest,  especially  in the economic plane, not to lose sight of the potential of  Africa as our partner, the more so since we have already  established a firm foundation for cooperation in our relations  with many African countries.    For the most part, future Russo-African relations are seen  precisely in all-round development of mutually-advantageous  economic ties; however, it will hardly be possible to achieve  this until military-political stability is assured on the  African continent, and until the prerequisites are established  for stable socio-economic development. Orienting herself on the  prospects which lie in the plane of economic and trade  relations, Russia, employing political means, will strive to  support the processes of democratization in Africa, and will  take part in settling existing conflicts and forestalling  potential conflict.    Within the framework of the given approach, we should  obviously focus special attention on activating political ties  with this continent. At the same time, it is necessary to pay  attention to its specific nature, when quite often cooperation  in all other sectors depend upon the level of political  relations and with establishing contacts with the leadership of  a country. We cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the ruling  circles of many African states still take a cautious attitude  toward the political processes and reforms in Russia, lack  confidence in their successful outcome, and doubt that our  country, at the present stage, is capable of playing a  definitive role in the international arena.    African leaders, as practical experience shows, apart from  discussing questions of bilateral relations, are prepared for  dialogue with us on a broad range of problems associated with  strengthening international peace and security, and primarily  among those who are either directly influencing the situation on  their continent, or who are promoting the acceleration of  positive global transformations. From this point of view certain  directions in Russo-African interaction are seen to be  promising, such as certain aspects of disarmament, creation of  nuclear-free zones, formation of regional security systems,  strengthening international mechanisms for forestalling and  settling conflicts, and formation of an international economic  climate that is beneficial for Russia and Africa as well.    The political assistance of Russia to settlement of the  basic  ""hot spots"" of Africa, to include support in the UN Security  Council, is directed toward fulfilling the global mission of  assuring a more secure world. We also consider this assistance  an important part of our political partnership with the African  countries, which strengthens the basis for mutually-advantageous  cooperation with them.    Russia is taking a most active part in the Angolan  settlement, and together with the United States and Portugal is  joining a ""troika"" of observers over the process of carrying out  the Bisesskiy (Lisbon) Agreements (May, 1991). Russian military  and civilian observers have been sent under UN auspices to a  number of other conflict zones in Africa (Mozambique, Liberia,  Somalia and Rwanda).    On the whole it is obvious that in analyses of the prospects  for stabilization of the situation in the ""hot spots"" of Africa  and around them, one should avoid excess optimism. In this  connection, Russian proposals made at the 48th Session of the UN  General Assembly are considered timely ones. The essence of  these proposals is--to establish within a United Nations  framework additional mechanisms which will permit significantly  increasing the success rate for peacemaking operations, to  include the African continent as well.    Experience in operations in support of peace implemented by  the international community on the African continent is  important for us, for application to Russia's own efforts on the  territory of the former USSR.    At the same time, while cooperating with the West on the  African continent, one should proceed from the fact that the  commonality of approaches noted for a number of problems does  not at all signify that they are completely identical. Russia  must operate above all in consideration of her own national  interests, as well as the reality of the multipolar world that  is taking shape.    In spite of a certain slump in the sphere of trade and  economic relations, prospects for developing cooperation with  Africa exist, and above all in the extraction of minerals; in  geology; and in construction, fisheries, woodworking and  agriculture. Constructing and utilizing major new  facilities--such as the bauxite extraction complex in Dian-Dian  (Guinea); expanding the scale of independent activities of state  and commercial structures; setting up joint enterprises;  establishing new zones for trade and economic activities, for  example, in Namibia and the South African Republic--can  genuinely raise the overall qualitative level and scale of  Russia's economic ties with Africa.    The interests of Russia are served not only by maintaining,  but also by expanding existing ties. It is at the same time  necessary to purposefully and consistently place them on a new  basis: to establish multi-level forms of cooperation with the  countries which remain, chiefly for ideological motives, beyond  the sphere of our attention. At the same time we should above  all examine the possibilities for developing relations with  those states which represent a promising market for acquiring  Russian products, or suppliers of the goods and raw materials  which we need.    Intensification of Russo-African interaction will to a large  extent also depend upon transition to new forms and methods of  cooperation--granting of licenses and know-how, rental of  machinery and equipment, collaboration between industrial  sectors, and scientific-production cooperation.    In recent years, while overcoming significant difficulties,  the processes of integration have intensified in Africa. One may  quite confidently assume that in the future, inter-African  economic cooperation, aimed at the creation of an African  economic community and regional economic structures, will become  more significant. Such intentions have already appeared very  vividly in a number of regions on the continent.    Russian foreign economic structures could also take  advantage  of trends for integration in Africa for increasing her own  exports to the corresponding markets, which will apparently be  expanding as a result of the aforementioned trends. Our  participation is possible at the level of enterprises,  investment banks, and in the form of joint ventures.    In resolving African problems of development, for the  continent as a whole, for subregions and countries, Russia is  devoting significant attention to the role of the UN Economic  Commission for Africa [ECA] and, in particular, to the fact that  ECA could stimulate and attribute a truly international  character to its programs in such areas as transportation, power  engineering, development of natural resources, and environmental  protection, as well as support of small and mid-level  entrepreneurship.    Russian organizations are completely capable of  participation  in implementing projects within the framework of the second  decade of industrial development in Africa and the second decade  of transport and communication of the UN's ECA. It would appear  that Russo-African cooperation, taking into consideration the  peculiarities of the continent, could promote the solution of  problems of employment and the development of facilities in the  infrastructure; and could have as its ultimate goal the  involvement to the fullest of African countries in the system of  international division of labor on a fair basis.    An important element of bilateral relations between Russia  and countries of Africa, which requires a weighty and  well-thought-out approach, is the problem of their obligations  for credits issued by the former USSR. In terms of state credits  alone, the volume of indebtedness of sub-Saharan African  countries amounts to nearly $14 billion. The situation is  aggravated by the fact that the domestic political situation in  many of the countries which are the principal debtors is  unstable, and the economy is in a state of crisis. Therefore,  the task consists of finding ways and means of restoring the  debts, without straining political relations, and without  breaking existing mutually-advantageous ties.    It is most important to proceed from the fact that the  search  for solution of this problem must not rest on narrow  departmental considerations. It is necessary to take into  account all aspects of political and commercial-economic  relations with each country, individually. The question of  indebtedness should be examined comprehensively, employing  various strategies: partial payment in freely-convertible  currency and local currency, compensation for debt by deliveries  of goods, or reinvestment; taking things one step at a time,  using part of the debt for covering the expenses of Russian  missions, and so on.    The sphere of military-technical cooperation remains an  important link in Russia's foreign policy and economic ties with  Africa. This form of interaction appears to be quite promising  in the context of increasing its profitability and placing it on  an exclusively commercial basis. A number of African states have  an appropriate degree of interest in this.    One must not fail to consider that a prolonged pause in the  given sphere of relations with Africa can have a negative effect  on Russian interests; since the vacuum formed as a result of  breaking military-technical ties with the Soviet Union, and then  with Russia as well, is being energetically filled by other  countries--including those which produce weapons under Russian  licenses, of greatly inferior quality than that which Russia  herself could offer. It is evident, incidentally, that Russian  arms deliveries should not appear in regions of existing and  potential armed conflicts, nor in countries with openly  dictatorial regimes.    Apart from solving the urgent problems cited above,  developing stable relations with African countries demands  long-term humanitarian and political investment in the future of  our ties. In this context one should, obviously, be thinking  about the possibility of continuing, in modern conditions, the  training of African national cadres in the VUZ's of our country.  Such a practice provides its own positive results. It is another  matter, that this cooperation should be for the most part placed  on a compensatory basis. At the same time it should remain  advantageous and attractive for our African partners as well.    The question of future Russo-African relations continues to  attract the attention of the Russian and world community. Today,  it is true, few people doubt whether or not we need Africa in  general. On this account, it would appear that at last a  more-or-less unified point of view is taking shape--Yes, it is  necessary, since Russia, even with her present difficulties,  cannot allow herself the luxury of turning her back on Africa,  nor to all the other regions of our planet. Russia must assure  herself a fitting role in the world balance of influence, and in  the multilateral processes for regulating the world economy and  international relations.    By preserving all that is rational in bilateral political,  economic and cultural ties with Africa; applying to them content  appropriate to the realities of today; and by developing  cooperation in new directions, to include those countries which  previously lay beyond the bounds of our active policy, Russia  will support her own state interests, and will obtain greater  freedom in the choice of foreign policy alternatives. In this  manner the prerequisites will be laid down for more solid  positions for our country, not only on the African continent,  but in the world arena as a whole.  Footnotes    1.

He was tied up  with representatives from the German government's development  wing, and then another man, Mr Gopichand Hinduja, who also  appeared to have lots of money, an aide explained. The new  deputy foreign minister's willingness to make time for wealthy  and influential people like Mr Hinduja -- said to be the  10th-richest man in the world -- became clear as he explained  the new government's pragmatic and interest-driven foreign  policy.    Simply put, it entailed being very nice to the rich and  powerful, nice to the potentially rich and powerful and kind to  old friends who were neither. Although Mr Pahad would blanche  at such a crude assessment, he agreed that gone were the days of  making friends for friends' sake to further partisan objectives.    It is a whole new game for a man who spent a good part of  his  ANC career trying to isolate South Africa, and a department  which devoted itself to sanctions-busting and forming ties with  everyone that would have it.    Like all the other ministries under the new government,  South  Africa's foreign policy priorities are dictated by the need to  ensure the Reconstruction and Development Programme's [RDP]  success.    ""Our priority is making sure that the country has a  sustainable, growing economy, otherwise the Reconstruction and  Development Programme will remain an empty theoretical concept,""  Mr Pahad said.    The job of the Foreign Affairs department was to promote and  sell this programme abroad to secure foreign resources as  swiftly as possible.    Mr Pahad firmly ruled out the sale of grand embassies and  art  works as mooted by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo. The  resources he speaks of are investment, favourable trading terms,  development aid and soft loans.    Given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the focus will  be to increase favourable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union. But, Mr Pahad said, South Africa would also be  looking beyond traditional partners to expand economic relations  with, among others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India,  the People's Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored was the Middle  East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.    There were also important new friends to consolidate  politically in the context of being the new government. These  would include China, which was sympathetic to the ANC as a  liberation movement, and Russia, whose relationship with the ANC  changed with the collapse of communism at the turn of the  decade. Both these countries are permanent members of the UN  Security Council.    As there were scores of other developing countries on the  lookout for favourable relations with the most important  economic and political blocs -- the EU, NAFTA and the  Association of South East Asian Nations -- SA [South Africa] had  to capitalise on the enormous goodwill that existed since the  successful elections, and keep it going, said Mr Pahad.    South Africa had two aces to play in this regard. The first  was its moral status in the world. The second, its position in  an increasingly marginalised continent.    Despite all gloomy predictions, South Africa became the  example of the ""best miracle of the century"". ""We have captured  the moral high ground in non-racialism, democracy and conflict  resolution to become the world leader in this arena.""    But, more importantly, it had become imperative for the rest  of the world that this success story continued. For if South  Africa were to fail -- and its success depended on consolidating  democracy with economic growth -- there would be serious  consequences for other countries' internal policies on democracy  and racism.    ""They see our success as a godsend to a more healthy  approach  to politics. They want us to succeed."" Another ace was South  Africa's position in the continent of Africa. ""If we don't  sink, they see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the  region doesn't sink they see some hope of a breakthrough in the  development of other parts of Africa.""    This brings him to South Africa's second foreign policy  priority -- its relationship with the southern African region,  which, he says, is fundamental to South Africa's broader  interests.    President Nelson Mandela's reception at the OAU summit this  week as the messiah of the continent highlighted the important  role that South Africa could play in the continent. However,  South Africa will have to be careful to straddle the demands and  expectations of the rest of Africa with pragmatic policies.    Mr Pahad once again has a realistic attitude towards  relations with Africa. ""Unless we can achieve mutually  beneficial development in our region, we will not be able to  tackle effectively our international or regional challenges,"" he  said.    This translates into developing regional co-operation by  joining the SADC [South African Development Community] and  rationalising the many regional institutions like the SA Customs  Union and the Preferential Trade Agreement.    He stops at integration. This was a long-term vision and  would be dictated by the process of co-operation. It would  also be in South Africa's interests to ensure stability in both  the region and the continent. A lot of time would be spent  strengthening OAU mechanisms for conflict resolution.    Mr Pahad sees regional cooperation extending not only to  areas of economic development but to basic issues like  gun-smuggling, drug-peddling, refugees and illegal immigrants.    He distinguished between illegal immigrants and refugees,  the latter which South Africa would deal with according to  internationally accepted conventions. ""But we cannot turn a  blind eye to illegal immigrants. We are going to have to deal  with this in a way that protects the interests of our country.  We must have an effective immigration policy and apply it  justly and humanely.""    It was in this context that regional development became a  priority for SA. ""If you don't have mutually advantageous  regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South  Africa. And, given that our borders are so big, we will not be  able to prevent it"".    On the question of the country's role in the OAU, Mr Pahad  said that with its expertise in many fields South Africa could  help the organisation become a more effective body on the  continent and in the United Nations.    Implicit in this is South Africa's desire to be the first  African country to take a permanent seat on the UN Security  Council.    The government's policy of making new friends and extending  South Africa's profile into uncharted territories would not mean  establishing diplomatic missions everywhere in the world, he  said. This would be dictated by the budget and the national  interest and would entail downscaling some embassies, having one  diplomatic representatives serving several countries, upgrading  priority areas and establishing links with countries with  perceived potential.    One example under debate was the policy towards the People's  Republic of China and Taiwan. He pointed out that, should South  Africa establish diplomatic ties with the PRC, it would have to  forego long-established diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The PRC  was important for South Africa not only because of the enormous  trade potential, but also because it was a permanent member of  the UN Security Council. Taiwan was however, one of South  Africa's largest trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our own interests and international precedents.""    Mr Pahad stressed that foreign policy would not be dictated  only by South Africa's interests.    However, establishing friendships and coming to the rescue  of  friends did not necessitate establishing embassies in these  countries. ""There are other forms of interaction and  co-operation.""

Qian told a reception marking the 31st anniversary of  African  Liberation Day hosted by heads of African diplomatic missions in  Beijing that this year's celebration of liberation day has a  special significance, for a new South Africa led by President  Nelson Mandela has just been born. ""It is a victory not only for  the people of South Africa, but also for the peoples in the  whole of Africa,"" he said.    The birth of the new South Africa signifies that the African  people have finally broken the yoke of apartheid and racial  discrimination, and its significance and impact have gone far  beyond the borders of South Africa and the African Continent,  said Qian. ""It is an epoch-making event in the history of human  civilization,"" he added.    Qian expressed his hope that under the leadership of the  South African Government of national unity, the various  political forces in South Africa will strengthen their unity and  cooperation, join hands in building a stable, democratic,  strong, prosperous and racially equal new South Africa, and make  their own contributions to maintaining political independence  and achieving economic revitalization in Africa.    The Chinese foreign minister also extended his  congratulations on the achievements that the African countries  have made in the past 31 years in promoting the process of  economic integration in the continent and in other fields, under  the banner of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).    He praised the OAU for its increasingly important role in  maintaining peace and stability and in settling conflicts and  disputes at regional or national level by good offices of the  OAU.

0,FT943-5083 ,"FT943-5083 _AN-EIFD0ACZFT 940906   FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Ill-health linked to low status      By ANDREW DERRINGTON   Low social status rather than the impact of poverty is the main reason poor people do not live as long as the rich and become ill more often, the association was told yesterday. Professor Robert Evans, a health economist from the University of British Columbia, used studies of monkeys living in captivity, free-living baboons in East Africa and Whitehall civil servants to support his argument that ill-health is caused by the stresses of social interaction between people - or baboons - of different status. Civil servants were divided into four categories of increasing social status. Those in the upper echelons had longer life expectancy and lower incidence of disease than those in the categories beneath them. The baboons of the Serengeti showed a similar difference in health status correlated with their position in the pecking order. Reasons for the difference also emerged from measurements of stress-related hormones (glucocorticoids) and low-density lipoproteins (LDL) in blood samples taken at different times after social contacts between males of different status, he said. Glucocorticoid levels were higher in males of low social status. Levels in both groups peaked after encounters in which dominant males yawned at low-status males - to show their teeth - while the low-status males were eating or mating. The higher glucocorticoid level in submissive baboons persisted long after the encounter. Long-term glucocorticoid elevation also caused increases in LDL, a risk factor for heart attacks. High LDL levels were found in the blood of low-status but not high-status males. To measure glucocorticoid levels it was necessary to shoot the baboons with anaesthetic darts to take blood. Although this could not be done with the civil servants - nor is it likely that their superiors yawn at them while they are mating - the measurement of their disease rates left little doubt that the results would have been similar. Prof Evans was speaking in a session on the challenges facing the National Health Service. He argued that changes to the NHS could not remove the inequality between rich and poor, because that difference does not result from differences in treatment. The results from the civil servants established that the inequality was not simply a difference between the well off and the destitute. Other speakers discussed how the internal market could improve healthcare in the UK. The correlation between health and socio-economic status was first systematically described 15 years ago in a report by Sir Douglas Black.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

After the first democratic elections in South Africa, it is  not a matter of if, but when and how South Africa will sever  ties with its trading partner Taiwan and establish diplomatic  relations with China, Greg Mills said.    The article said South Africa's ties with Taiwan began in  1977 when Pretoria sought new allies and trading partners in the  wake of the Soweto uprisings and the United Nations arms embargo.    The article said: `In the throes of its own deepening  isolation, Taiwan, on the other hand, saw the opportunity as  providing a further anti-communist ally as well as an expansion  of trade.'    `South Africa's trade with China grew by 170 percent between  1992-93, and it is expected to double again this year. Also the  People's Republic of China is alleged to have been one of the  major gold buyers in recent times with about 25 percent of the  world's total (population),' the article added.    `Simply put, given the political and economic realities of  the situation, South Africa does not have any options.'    The article further stated dual recognition was a  non-starter.    `The need to make alternative arrangements with Taiwan  should  not delay a decision on the central political issue. Any  unnecessary delays or crude attempts to devise unique solutions  will only temporarily avoid the inevitable and anger Beijing,'  Greg Mills said.     "

In a move aimed at bringing the country back into the mainstream of the world energy markets, Pretoria solicited bids for licences to explore virtually all the country's coastal areas, divided into 18 blocks. Mr Pik Botha, the former foreign minister, who is now minister of mines and energy, told a launch seminar attended by oil and gas companies in London that his government 'sees this licensing round as a major step forward in exploring our offshore potential. 'We cannot guarantee that you will discover gas or oil or both,' he said. 'But we are setting in motion an intensive - and extensive - process of exploration never undertaken before'. Bids for licences have to be submitted by April next year, and Mr Botha said he hoped to have the allocation process complete by November 1995. Exploration programmes will have to be for a minimum of three years and a maximum of seven. International oil companies were active in South Africa until the early 1970s when most of them withdrew for political reasons. Since then, there has only been a small amount of exploration, mainly by Soekor, the state oil company. South Africa produces a third of its liquid hydrocarbons artificially from coal, and imports certain amounts of oil, mainly from Iran. Mr Botha said yesterday that the tariff protection given to the local oil and gas industry would continue because of its important contribution in saving foreign exchange. But he said South Africa was keen to widen its trade relations with energy-producing nations, and deals were pending with various OPEC countries which he declined to name. So far, 19 companies - 17 of them from abroad - had asked for information packs about the blocks on offer. Mr Botha said he was 'very encouraged' by the attendance at yesterday's seminar, which included many of the world's major oil companies. Asked whether South Africa was more secure than other new energy markets that are opening up, such as Central Asia, Mr Botha said: 'As secure, if not better' because of the well-developed state of South Africa's mining technology and infrastructure. 'I can assure you,' he added, 'that the rules are not only reasonable but will also be stable.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P1311 Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas.

United States Vice-President Al Gore,  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, Palestinian Liberation  Organisation Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, Tanzanian founding  President Julius Nyerere and more than 80 other leaders arrived  to heap praise on South Africa and its people.    Heading a 65-strong U.S. delegation, the most senior to  visit  South Africa, Mr Gore said the moment was historic not only for  South Africa but for all mankind. The inauguration of African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela marked a transition in  the history of the world, he said. The U.S. civil rights  movement and the struggle for democracy in South Africa were  historically intertwined with both countries sharing the spirit  of the fight for full democracy. ""And so the people of the  United States rejoice with the people of South Africa. We look  forward towards starting a new and more vigorous relationship.  We see the inauguration tomorrow (Tuesday) of Mr Mandela as the  beginning of a partnership between our two countries."" Included  in the us delegation was first lady Hilary Clinton, Mr Gore's  wife Tipper, the Rev Jesse Jackson and U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ron Brown.    On his arrival, Mr Hurd said there has been a huge upsurge  in  British business interest in South Africa. He said he was in  the country to show Britain's support for a new South Africa and  was going directly from the airport to visit British-aided  projects in the East Rand townships.    Croatian Prime Minister Mr Nikica Valentic said South Africa  had shown it was possible to satisfy diverse interests in a  positive way. ""We are a country that has emerged from war. The  message (from South Africa) is political solutions have to be  sought by peaceful means,"" he said.    Former British prime minister Lord James Callaghan said  South  Africa would be an example to the rest of Africa. Asked if he  had a message for this country, Lord Callaghan said: ""South  Africa is going to work out its own destiny.""    Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the struggle  against apartheid had few parallels in modern history. ""We are  confident that under Mr Mandela's sagacious leadership the scars  of the past will soon heal and the goal of peace and development  will be achieved.""    The diminutive Mr Arafat, wearing his traditional black and  white keffiyeh, said he brought greetings from the Palestinian  people ""and best wishes for my brother and friend President  Mandela...and Mr (F W) de Klerk"". He was greeted by ANC  representative Stanley Mabisela who held the PLO leader's hand  as the large delegation strode into the airport building.    Mr Nyerere, once a crusader against colonialism and a  long-time enemy of Pretoria, said he had always wanted to come  to a free South Africa. ""I never believed it would come. But  here it is.""    Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A S M Rahman, who was asked if  his country would be investing in South Africa, said Bangladesh  had no money to invest ""but we will share our knowledge"".    On his arrival, Danish Prime Minister Poul Rasmussen praised  the demise of apartheid as ""a victory for humanity"" and pledged  R375 million [rand] in aid for South Africa's transition. He  said he hoped the two countries would exchange ""experiences"",  expecially in the labour market, and he extended a formal  invitation to Mr Mandela to visit Denmark. The Danish national  soccer team, European champions in 1992, were scheduled to visit  South Africa in 1995, Mr Rasmussen announced. ""This is a most  happy moment in Danish international politics. (It) is the fall  of the Berlin Wall...in human terms...a victory for humanity.""    From Syria to the Bahamas, Italy, Slovakia, Georgia, Malta,  Iran, Malaysia, the Philippines and Romania they continued to  pour into Jan Smuts from dawn and into the night. Other  notables included the Irish President Mary Robinson, Greek King  Constantine and Mr Abdul Rahman Taib who is the Industry  Minister of Brunei, the richest country per capita in the world.  Also among them were European Union Chairman T Pangalos,  Portuguese president Dr Mario Soares, French first lady  Danniella Mitterand, Spanish heir apparent Prince Asturias and  Finland President Mr Martii Ahtisaari [name and title as  received] who is credited with brokering Namibian independence.  The presidents of Zambia, Angola, Mozambique and Namibia, as  well as Lesotho King Letsie III, were due to arrive later in the  night.    The prize for the biggest present went to the Philippines --  a four-foot square box in colourful wrapping paper and ribbon  reportedly containing shoes for Mr Mandela.    By 6PM there was still no news of the expected appearance of  Libyan Chief Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi or Cuban leader Fidel Castro.  A Cuban aircraft arrived early on Monday but apparently it was  carrying only cigars.    On his arrival, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said:  ""Africa has been decolonised and is in the process of  democratisation -- that is the challenge.""     "

Qhobela,  foreign minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, here this afternoon.    During the talks, Qian and Qhobela exchanged views on  bilateral relations and on the international situation.    Qian congratulated the Basutoland Congress Party on its  success in last year's general election and the consequent  establishment of the new government of Lesotho, and wished the  new government well in making new achievements in maintaining  domestic peace and in the construction of the country.    Qian said that the resumption of diplomatic relations  between  China and Lesotho laid a foundation for the development of  bilateral relations, adding that he was confident that the  current visit to China by Qhobela would further promote  bilateral relations and cooperation.    Touching on the situation in the Southern African region,  Qian noted that the first general election without racial  discrimination is to be held in South Africa on April 27, and  that a new South Africa of racial equality is to be set up.    This was the result of the long-term struggles of the South  African nations and peoples, said Qian, and China supports the  peace process in South Africa.    The Chinese vice-premier noted that China is willing to  develop cooperative relations with the new South Africa in  various fields, on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence.    Qhobela said that the restoration of diplomatic relations  between Lesotho and China will inject new strength into the  promotion of bilateral relations.    Qhobela invited Qian to visit Lesotho again at his  convenience.    Qhobela and his party arrived here on April 10 as Qian's  guests.     "

The estimated $20 billion project will be completed in  15 years. Guo Xuyan, president of the Three Gorges project, will  arrive in Brazil next month to visit Itaipu and hold talks with  construction companies and capital goods suppliers (turbines and  electricity generators).    The Brazilian trade offensive is being prepared by the  Itamaraty Trade Promotion Department in reply to the Asian  countries' interest in increasing trade with Brazil. At least  two official Chinese trade missions have visited Brazil in the  past six months, contacting government officials and business  leaders. Currently a mission of 30 Brazilian businessmen is  touring Singapore, Vietnam, and Malaysia looking for business  deals and partnerships. In May, a business delegation will  accompany President Itamar Franco to the PRC, and in September  another business mission will travel to China, South Korea, and  Indonesia.    Priority    Southeast Asia is one of Itamaraty's priorities. ""It is the  fastest growing region in the world, and China is the largest  country in the region,"" a diplomat said. In the past few years,  trade with China has been increasing at 20 percent annually, and  trade between the two countries surpassed $1 billion in 1993.    Brazil's main interest is to participate in hydroelectric,  mining, and telecommunication projects, as well as in  pharmaceutical industry, software [preceding word in English],  and satellite launching and manufacturing technology deals. Some  deals already are well under way. A Brazilian company will  supply the Chinese Government with digital centrals for rural  telephone systems -- a contract whose negotiations started in  November 1993.    A Sao Paulo enterprise will sell banking automation  equipment  to the PRC. The CBPO, Mendes Junior, Andrade Gutierrez, and Vale  do Rio Doce construction and mining companies already have set  up offices in Beijing. This year Brazil and the PRC will  commemorate 20 years since the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations between the two countries. ""Businesses tend to  increase given the large size of the two countries in the  international context,"" an Itamaraty source said.    South Africa    Another market in which Brazil is interested is South  Africa,  which intends to invest nearly $5 billion in a reconstruction  and development project. A Brazilian business delegation visited  South Africa and returned very optimistic about future business  opportunities. South Africa is a rich country with considerably  developed technology, which is concentrated mainly on the white  minority.    Elections will be held there on 27 April, and African  National Congress leader Nelson Mandela is expected to win and  introduce a deep transformation in the country.    A Brazilian company closed a deal to export tow trucks, and  other Brazilian companies will participate in the duplication of  telephone circuits, thus expanding telecommunications routes  between the two countries.    According to a diplomatic source, the South African  Government is particularly interested in obtaining intermediary  technology in the fields of steel mills, mining, electricity,  petrochemical, and agribusiness.    Some Brazilian construction companies will be able to  participate in a project to build 1 million low-income houses.  ""In the mid-term, 20 million people, mainly blacks, must become  consumers,"" a diplomat said. In 1993, trade between Brazil and  South Africa was $280 million.     "

WE MUST MAKE BLACK LIVES WORTH AS MUCH AS WHITE EUROPEAN LIVES.      By JESSE JACKSON, Jesse Jackson writes a syndicated column from Washington.      The dirty and unspoken secret of American foreign policy is the ""R"" word. It is  not uttered in polite society, but nothing else can explain our government's  often cruel and contradictory policies. Racism disregards black lives, and  black lives are being lost daily in southern Africa because of callous policy  decisions made by the Bush Administration.    The United States and South Africa have contributed weapons, money and other  resources to Renamo, the right-wing rebels in Mozambique, and to UNITA, a rebel  organization in Angola. Both are terrorist groups that have caused not only  widespread death and misery in those countries but also an extraordinary $40  billion in property damage over the past 10 years, according to a recent United  Nations report. The price of American and South African foreign policy is the  blood and the lives of black Africans.    While we seem to have money for war, we give no money for peace. For the coming  year, eight African nations -- Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi,  Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- are expected to get a pitiful total  of about $50 million in American foreign-development aid. These countries,  which are part of the Southern Africa Development Coordination Conference,  contain 76 million people, most of them poor, many of them starving or losing  their lives to disease, many more of them dying in U.S.- and South  African-supported violence.    All over southern Africa, hundreds of thousands of children die every year from  malaria, yellow fever, influenza, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases.  In Tanzania alone, 250,000 children die every year of sicknesses that in the  Western world have been effectively abolished. Hunger and starvation are  rampant in these countries. The health-care systems are overburdened to the  point of collapse.    Not all of the causes of misery in southern Africa are found in nature. The  apartheid government in South Africa has engaged over the past several years in  a systematic campaign of terrorist aggression, destabilization and sabotage  against neighboring countries. In the past decade, this strategy for regional  military dominance has caused the deaths of 1.5 million people in southern  Africa, more than half of them children under 5 years old.    A senior State Department official told a United Nations Conference on  Mozambique in early 1988 that the Renamo campaign was ""a systematic and brutal  war of terror against innocent civilians through forced labor, starvation,  physical abuse and wanton killing.""    According to UNICEF, 494,000 children under age 5 in Mozambique died from  war-related causes between 1980 and 1988, and 331,000 Angolan children under 5  lost their lives to UNITA's war.    According to testimony during a congressional hearing last year, the United  States sends the bandits of UNITA an estimated $80 million a year in covert aid  to wage their unpopular and futile war of death and destruction.    Thus, we Americans spend more of our money causing bloodshed in Angola than we  do on promoting development in the states of the Southern Africa Development  Coordination Conference, nations that are all struggling to create democracy  and diversify their economies. If we can support important processes of  liberalization and economic reconstruction in Europe, why not in Africa? What  is the difference?    Opponents of aid to Africa assert that Africa has less ""strategic"" importance  to us than Europe. Then, it must be asked, why have we spent hundreds of  millions of dollars supporting South Africa's dubious foreign policy by  encouraging destruction and terror in the region? What justifies our  participation in these guerrilla wars?    The aftermath of the invasion of Panama and the end of the Cold War in Europe  show us how quickly America can mobilize to give foreign aid to a people in  need. It only took Congress days after the shake-up in Eastern Europe to  authorize more than $900 million in development aid for Poland and Hungary over  the next three years.    The swift passage of aid to these countries was morally right. We have an  obligation to help the people of Panama recover from the damage caused by our  invasion and the Noriega dictatorship. Similarly, the whole world is cheering  for democracy and freedom in Europe.    But if we can help white people in Europe to improve their quality of life and  their political system, we can do the same for black people in Africa. If we  can contemplate a second Marshall Plan for the relatively wealthy nations of  Europe, we can develop a first Marshall Plan for the impoverished nations of  Africa.    The fact is, now that we have helped to create so much misery and chaos in  southern Africa, we have an obligation to help the people of the region find  their way to economic development, freedom from starvation and political  democracy.    At this brilliant juncture in the history of humanity, the people of America  must reevaluate and re-create our foreign policy. It is time to bring the ""R""  word out into the open and then banish it once and for all from the conduct of  our foreign policy.

The decision eliminates all economic sanctions against South  Africa with the exception of a blanket ban on the export of  weapons to all countries.    The decision, effective from January 28, will release for  export a range of previously restricted products including  computers and four-wheel-drive vehicles for use by the South  African military and police forces.    The government has already lifted bans on flights between  Japan and South Africa and on investment in that country.    A new South African Constitution, drawn up after two years  of  negotiations, guarantees a formal end to the legalized system of  racial discrimination known as apartheid following the nation's  first all-race elections on April 27.

""Individual governments have to increase their input and  intensify community involvement in the vaccination programmes,""  said Kebba Jobe, a Gambian participant, said. Speaking before  the start of the seminar Jobe, who manages his country's  expanded programme on immunization, said the Gambia had attained  69 percent immunisation for children aged below one year. He  said donors must continue supporting Gambia to reduce the cost  of vaccines and thereby increase the percentage of immunisation.    A Mauritanian delegate, Dr. Pradbodh Munbodh, said managers  of immunisation programmes in Africa should adopt private sector  working methods to reduce bureaucracy. He told delegates from  South Africa that by 1992, Mauritania had attained vaccination  of between 75 and 80 percent of all pregnant women, 85 percent  of children against measles and 90 percent against diphteria,  whooping cough and tetanus. ""Since you face an enourmous  vaccination task in your country, the best thing is to motivate  the paramedical personnel directly involved in the field,"" he  told Ray Mabope, the African National Congress' (ANC) national  chair on vaccination and immunisation and Bonginkosi Mhlanga of  the Pan-Africanist Congress' (PAC) health directorate. Mabope  said that with its three vaccine manufacturing institutions,  South Africa should be able to vaccinate all its children within  the next few years and become a vaccine supplier to countries in  the southern African development community.    This, he said, would entail rationalising the activities of  the South African Institute for Medical Research, the State  Vaccine Institute and the National Institute of Virology ""to cut  down wastage.""    Mhlanga said that although the South African Government  claimed it had achieved 80 percent immunisation of its children,  ""we have to unify the country first before analysing the  situation in South Africa, especially in the homelands, where  the situation is not clear."" South Africa is due to form its  first democratic government after the country's first non-racial  elections on 26-28 April.    The four-day seminar, which has attracted vaccination  experts  from Africa, Europe and the United States, is to be opened later  today by Cote d'Ivoire's health minister, Maurice Guikahue. The  theme is: ""To build a durable partnership for immunisations for  Africa."" It is the fourth of its kind, after those of Bamako in  1974, Dakar in 1981 and Niamey in 1987.    South Africa, which is taking part for the first time, is  represented by an eight-person multiracial delegation, including  representatives of government and the former liberation  movements -- ANC and PAC.

But his lofty assertion that the newly formed Freedom Alliance's leaders (Inkatha, Conservative party, Afrikaner Volksfront, Bophuthatswana and Ciskei) have poor credentials as demo-crats cannot pass without comment. I will not attempt to claim that Africa produces state-of-the-art, western-style democrats. But as many well-informed South Africa correspondents, human rights campaigners (including Helen Suzman) and political commentators have observed, the two most blatantly undemocratic organisations in South Africa are the ANC-South African Communist party alliance and the ruling National party. It is difficult to determine which of them has the more shameful human rights record or which, in the past, had the firmer resolve to squash free speech or criticism. Many now feel the ANC-SACP alliance is the greater offender, since left-wing 'censorship' is now so virulent. Either way, one wonders what on earth Joe Rogaly is trying to say. He cannot be implying that Nelson Mandela's or President F W de Klerk's democratic credentials are impressive, can he? They are both good public relations men, not democrats.

Mr John Patten, education secretary, said the findings revealed 'worrying levels of illiteracy'. He said they justified the government's policy of compulsory testing of 14-year-olds, which he confirmed would be extended to the subjects English and technology in England and Wales this summer. In a move designed to divide opposition to the compulsory English tests, Mr Patten announced that the results of the first year's tests would not be published in school league tables. However, national totals will be compiled, allowing parents to compare their children's performance with the national average. Teachers' unions had claimed that the tests, to be taken for the first time in June, had been inadequately prepared and that material for them had arrived at schools too late. The two largest unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, said they would continue balloting members over boycotting the tests. Other teachers' unions welcomed the announcement. Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers described the decision as 'statesmanlike'. He said it was evidence that Mr Patten had heeded fears expressed over the tests in a meeting with teachers' unions earlier this week. Mr Patten also published consultation documents setting out the government's plans for this year's performance tables for schools and colleges. The league tables will cover 4,000 state secondary schools and 19,000 primary schools. For the first time, they will also cover 2,000 independent schools, and 470 sixth-form and further-education colleges. The tables will include national curriculum test results; GCSE, A-level and AS-level examination results; and truancy rates. In a concession to independent schools, schools will be able to include GCSE exam results taken up to three years before the age of 16. Last year, only results in the previous two years could be included, which meant that some schools which entered pupils very early for GCSEs appeared have fewer pupils with five or more passes at grade C and above.

Speaking on his arrival at  Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport on Monday [9 May] morning, Mr  Hurd said he was in the country to show Britain's support for a  new South Africa, which will be launched symbolically on Tuesday  with the presidential inauguration of Nelson Mandela. He told  reporters he would visit British-aided projects in the East Rand  townships on Monday. Future British Government support would  continue to focus on South Africa's needs, he said.

Next year the country will get 30  million guilders in financial aid, twice the amount from last  year. The priority for the aid will be the democratization  process, education, ""marginalized"" youth and employment.    This was stated in a document sent to Parliament yesterday  by  Foreign Minister Kooijmans, Development Cooperation Minister  Pronk, and Economic Affairs State Secretary Van Rooy. The  Netherlands will normalize its relations with South Africa when  a new government has been formed on the basis of the  parliamentary elections of 26, 27, and 28 April.    The ministers' document covers political relations, economic  relations, development cooperation, and cultural relations with  South Africa. The ministers stressed that the precise form  would depend above all on developments in the near future. They  have full confidence that a normal relation could be built up  with the country because the Netherlands ""has historical and  cultural links [with South Africa] and has built up good  contacts with future leaders by its active attitude in the fight  against apartheid.""    The Netherlands will also enter a development relationship  with South Africa. To date, aid was passed only through private  organizations. The cabinet said that it would be necessary  before the end of the year to consult the new South African  Government about the policies. South Africa is classed as a  country in transition, and consequently will receive no  large-scale or long-term aid.    Netherlands companies will be encouraged to invest in the  ""South African economy, which in principle is very promising.""  Among the options are the exchange of trade and investment  delegations and -- ""when the time is ripe"" -- more flexible  policies on export credit insurance.     "

Keith Kendall asked Marques Rodriques, councillor at  the Cuban Foreign Ministry and presently in Pretoria, why the  announcement was so late.    [Begin recording] [Rodriques] Well, I mean that depends on  the schedule of President Castro. You know that Cuba is a very  far country and the president of course has a lot of engagements  to attend, and that's why it's a normal procedure.    [Kendall] This was not for security reasons?    [Rodriques] Well, it's part of the procedures for the  president. (?They) take into consideration the distance between  Cuba and South Africa, and the engagements of the president.    [Kendall] How important for Cuba are ties with the new South  Africa?    [Rodriques] I think this is very important for Cuba. There  have been long historical relations between Cuba and the  patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this  victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great  importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy  towards President Mandela and his post.    [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa  following the inauguration of President Mandela?    [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our  government to keep very close ties with the new Government of  South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field,  and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from  the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view,  and many other fields. We feel very optimistic that this kind  of relations will become greater. [passage omitted] [end  recording]     "

These remarks were made by Vice President Victor Hugo  Cardenas during a telephone interview with FIDES NEWS AGENCY's  central offices at Government House. The vice president is  heading a national delegation in Cape Town. The mission  participated in Nelson Mandela's inauguration together with 150  other missions and nearly 5,000 world rulers and personalities.    ""What we are doing in Bolivia, (the reforms), through much  pain and sacrifice, is very important for the future. The  entire world, not just Bolivia, is working to build  multicultural democracies where different ethnic groups,  cultures, and customs form part of the fabric of democracy,""  Cardenas said.    During his two-day visit to South Africa, Cardenas held  short  meetings with representatives of various countries. He met with  U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Hilary Clinton. He also met  with Cuban President Fidel Castro Ruz, PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat,  and Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize  winner.    ""The central issue of all dialogues with these important  world leaders was the outcome of South African democracy and  improving relations with that nation,"" the vice president  explained.    ""Bolivians must think very seriously about normalizing  relations with South Africa and opening a Bolivian special  mission in this country,"" Cardenas said, stressing the  importance for Bolivia of the changes that are being experienced  by one of the African continent's more powerful nations.    At 2000 (Bolivian time) on 18 May, Victor Hugo Cardenas will  have ""an exclusive meeting"" with President Nelson Mandela to  discuss issues relative to the democratic process and the ethnic  factor in both nations.    Cardenas said there is full awareness that the change  process  in South Africa was very painful and full of sacrifice, ""but  there is also the fact that Bolivia can participate in the  construction of a multiethnical and multicultural democracy,  that this is no longer a dream.""    Cardenas said some South African countries ""are interested  in  details of the recent reforms introduced by Bolivia through laws  on popular participation, capitalization, and education reform.  They are very interested in the Bolivian case, a country where  people from many ethnical backgrounds have integrated.""    The vice president said that during his short meeting with  Cuba's President Fidel Castro, the two leaders recalled the  outstanding moments of the Cuban participation in Sanchez de  Lozada's inauguration last August. ""Castro again thanked the  Bolivian people for their affection and warmth during his  historic visit.""    Cardenas said that during his meeting with Vice President Al  Gore, the U.S. official said he felt gratitude and happiness  over his visit to Bolivia last March. ""The wife of the U.S.  president, Hilary Clinton, told us that Mr. and Mrs. Gore are  really happy, particularly after visiting Lake Titicaca and the  adjacent settlements.""    The vice president said: ""Bolivia is remembered by these  distinguished friends. They asked about the capitalization  project, education reform, and people's participation.""    ""South Africa is building a multiethnic, multicultural, and  multilingual democracy, just as Bolivia. These are common  aspects from which Bolivians can learn a lot. We must be  grateful because the process of change has not left as many  victims in Bolivia as in South Africa where the wounds are still  fresh,"" the vice president said.     "

Issue No. 1 includes information on reactions to the African  National Congress's (ANC) economic policies, the budget deficit,  foreign investment prospects, and economic indicators.      Mixed Reactions to ANC's Interventionist Economic Policies      Addressing thefirst Pretoria/Witwatersrand (PWV) ""people's forum""  at the Johannesburg College of Education, which attracted a mixed  audience of about 500, including some high-profile business leaders,  Nelson Mandela appealed for support for the ANC's reconstruction and  development program.  Mandela indicated that this would require  greatly increased government expenditure and intervention in the  economy.  He called upon white businessmen not to emigrate but to  contribute to economic reconstruction and join the ""democratic  forces in building a new South Africa.""  However, his repeated  message to whites, ""Stay, we need you,"" has not removed skepticism  over the policies the ANC intends to pursue once in power.  According to Johannesburg daily THE STAR, ""Mandela's acknowledgment  that there had to be massive growth in government spending also sent  shivers down many a spine."" (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY 26 Nov 93;  Johannesburg THE STAR 29 Nov 93)      BUSINESS DAY Comments on ANC Economic Policies      ""Nelson Mandela's regular appeals to skilled white South Africans  not to emigrate, and to business to invest for a better future,  should be heeded. Most importantly, they should be heeded by ANC  economic planners, whose policies will have more influence than a  million fine words or appeals."" (29 Nov 93)      ""If we decide to reinvent the wheel of central planning or of  excessive government regulation of the economy, foreign investors  will not only turn their backs on our foolishness but are likely to  tar our neighbors with the same brush... .Expedient promises by  representatives of parties likely to hold power could cause immense  damage to our investment prospects."" (2 Dec 93)      ""At present, economic expectations are high--many underprivileged  people have been led to believe that April 27 will be followed by  plentiful jobs, housing and economic opportunities.  It is almost  inevitable that these expectations will be fueled by political  speeches in the run-up to election.      Growth that will lead to strong consumer spending and the belief  that the new order is delivering benefits cannot be conjured up that  quickly ... We should recall that we need an annual real growth rate  of about 5 percent if the formal sector of the economy is merely to  find jobs for school leavers, and 8 percent if formal sector  employment is to reduce unemployment levels. These levels will be  achieved only through a national economic consensus that there can  be no room for arcane economic experiments; that we have to be  conventional and in step with other successful nations. .. .The ANC  is not so politically naive as to believe the regime of  nationalization and socialism being proposed by some of its left-  wing economic advisors can work in today's world.""  (19 Nov 93)      Opinion Survey Measures Views on Nationalization      ""Naive"" or not, supporters of the ANC/South African Communist  Party (SACP) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) continue to find the  nationalization of basic goods and services desirable.  An opinion  survey undertaken between July and mid-October 1993 by the Center  for International and Comparative Politics at Stellenbosch  University found 50 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 80 percent of  PAC supporters in favor of such nationalization. Furthermore:      The majority of PAC (64 percent) and ANC (62 percent) supporters  agreed companies had a duty to fill top positions with blacks.      46 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 63 percent of PAC  supporters were against limiting the state's role in the economy.      100 percent of PAC supporters, 64 percent of ANC/SACP supporters  and 57 percent of Inkatha Freedom Party supporters were in favor of  price controls.  Conservative Party (CP) supporters were equally  divided, while the majority of Democratic Party (DP) and National  Party (NP) supporters were opposed.      The majority of ANC/SACP and PAC supporters were against limiting  the power of trade unions but CP, NP, and Inkatha supporters were  for it.      The majority of DP, NP, and CP supporters found minimum wages  undesirable, while ANC/SACP supporters (74 percent) and PAC  supporters (72 percent) were in favor. Inkatha supporters were  divided.      The majority of respondents of all parties supported linking  wage and productivity increases, and maximum business, labor and  state consensus.      Supporters of the PAC (72 percent), Inkatha (66 percent) and  ANC/SACP (58 percent) expected an increase in free enterprise.  CP  supporters anticipated a decrease, NP supporters were ambivalent,  and DP supporters undecided.

Kevin Davie, in the 28 November  edition of the SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES, reported the following  Chapter Eight of the final draft of the Merg report, a chapter on  banking and finance:      ""Here we shudder as we read that 'instead of becoming  increasingly independent, the Reserve Bank should be more firmly  under political control.'  Having sweated blood to get the inflation  rate below 10 percent, we take note that 'a target band around 12  percent a year should be considered initially.'  There may be  grounds for nationalizing some banks, 'but normal regulation of  banking activities (which should be increased) can often be obtained  without it.'  While elsewhere in the report it is recommended that  the new Government should not introduce a wealth tax, chapter eight  says a general wealth tax should be introduced.  A changed JSE  (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) is also envisaged.  'The JSE  illustrates that the market-orientation approach to meeting capital  needs is inappropriate.'  There is no case for abolishing marketable  securities tax (partly responsible for the JSE's poor liquidity):  'Indeed there are grounds for increasing it.'  Measures will be  taken to establish compulsory funds that are able to purchase  majority or controlling stakes in quoted companies including mining  finance houses, mine and financial institutions.  The development  and venture capital boards should be strengthened along with  measures to encourage 'the issue of new securities (with minimum  returns partly guaranteed).'  A Capital Issues Commission will be  established under the Ministry of Finance to consider company plans  for new issues and to authorize them, to 'prevent excess demand for  capital creating disorderly market conditions and generating  excessive interest charges.' The commission will also 'ensure that  companies raising capital conform with national policy on ethnic and  gender employment practice and other policies.  Capital institutions  should be subject to prescribed asset requirements under which a  percentage of their assets have to be placed in eligible  securities.'  This 'will enable the government to raise funds  through domestic bond issues at relatively low interest rates.'  Chapter eight has all the hallmarks of an author who thinks the  authorities know better than markets.  Could it be that Mr. Pillay,  an advisor to Beijing's Bank of China, is too schooled in  authoritarianism to trust democratic market forces?""  (Johannesburg  SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES 20 Nov 93)      Budget Deficit:  Below Year-End Forecast      According to a report in BUSINESS DAY, the ""government looks set  to end the fiscal year with the deficit below budget, after final  spending figures were tabled in Parliament.  The small overrun on  budgeted spending--less than 1 billion Rand (R1bn)--would be offset  by the extra R1bn in revenue, officials said.  This suggested the  deficit would be lower than the budgeted R25.3bn.  Earlier this year  economists predicted a deficit of R30bn.  The total estimated  expenditure in the Budget was R114.2bn while the revised expenditure  would be R115.2bn.  The increase in expenditure was due to funds  being made available for capital projects associated with the sale  of state land (R50mn), the sale of strategic oil reserves to finance  drought relief and job creation (R724mn), and R451 mm in  overexpenditure.  From this total of R1.2bn should be subtracted  expenditure which had not materialized, mainly the R224mn in  unrealized retrenchment costs.  The R451 mm overexpenditure was  mainly the result of the South African Police increasing staff by  7,500 members to combat violence (R249mn) and the re-employment of  health service personnel (R144mn).""  (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY 1  Dec 93)      Debt to Increase Next Year      ""Government's debt will be pushed closer to the danger level of  60 percent of GDP next year when homeland debts are taken onto the  books and pension funds are topped up by issuing stock.  In terms of  the interim constitution, all debts and liabilities other than those  linked to property ""shall vest in the national government.""  This  means that the state debt will rise by billions at a stroke--with  the last estimate of homelands' (including Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda, and Ciskei states) debt put at R14bn.  Adding to the debt  mountain will be stock issued to address pension fund deficits.  It  is understood that almost R7bn in stock will be issued to state  pension funds to bring funding to a more acceptable level.  Sources  said government had placed a limit of R8bn for its guarantees on the  homeland overdrafts, and speculation was that the level was fast  being approached.  Government's interest bill, at R22bn for the  present fiscal year, amounted to more than 26 percent of the Budget  from about 15 percent in 1992/93.  By contrast, total capital  expenditure was less than 8 percent of the Budget.""

The IRRC counts a total of 717  multinationals with direct investment or employees in South Africa,  168 of them German and 164 British.  The IRRC distinguishes between  these companies which have a direct investment in South Africa and  those which have ""non-equity"" links, such as licensing and  distribution agreements, with South African companies.  The increase  in U.S. companies with equity links has been much greater over the  last year, 189 more companies bring the present total to 445.  Among  non-U.S. companies, the net increase has been 126 over the last  year, bringing the total to 429.  The greater increase in non-equity  involvement reflects ""wariness"" about South Africa.  The IRRC notes  that many U.S. companies not in South Africa have shown an interest  in the country but remain wary because of the political situation.

Brown listed 11 developments that  would begin the process of revitalizing South Africa's economy and  speeding up black economic empowerment:      The signing of an Overseas Private Investment Corporation  agreement to encourage and support US investment in South Africa.      An Economic Cooperation Initiative focusing on South Africa.      Work by Exim Bank on a Nedcor Bank request for $63 million to  purchase Boeing aircraft, which if approved would bring Exim's total  investment in South Africa since February 1992 to $253 million.      The opening of an International Business Advocacy Center.      A U.S. National Export strategy to reduce controls in key high-  tech sectors, plus the creation of one-stop shops to house key  government agencies under one roof whose expertise would be  available to South Africa.      A promise to review tax and tariff barriers to U.S. goods.      A promise to match up U.S. and South African companies eager to  do business with each other.      A promise to discuss a bilateral tax treaty with the South  African government.      A promise to encourage emerging black-owned businesses.

Central Statistical Service  figures show the index of physical manufacturing production up 3.6  percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months to August  compared to the same period last year.  This was an improvement on  the second quarter when output volumes eased 1.9 percent.  Economists said production in most of the 28 major manufacturing  groups appeared to be returning to more normal levels after output  was hampered in the previous quarter by stayaways in the wake of the  assassination of SACP leader Chris Hani.  The strongest recovery  occurred in wood and wood products; printing and publishing;  petroleum and coal; electrical machinery; motor vehicles, parts and  accessories and professional and scientific equipment Econometrix  economist Tony Twine said a turnaround in manufacturing in the  second half was expected due to an improvement in third quarter GDP  figures.  The GDP data indicated the manufacturing sector grew at a  seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.5 percent in the three  months to September after slumping 0.2 percent in the second  quarter.  He warned the current recovery was weaker than it appeared  since it was coming off a very low 1992 base where second-half  production had fallen after the breakdown in Codesa and the  Boipatong massacre.""

Factors  cited for the improvement in retail sales included reductions in  interest rates on mortgages; the upsurge in the gold price, which  had restored confidence in the gold mining industry and made people  more willing to spend; and the good rains, which have put the  agricultural sector back on its feet.""  (Johannesburg THE STAR 2 Dec  93)      Fixed Investment      ""Economists said there would be a small real increase of 0.5  percent for the year as a whole after a pickup in the second half  neutralized declines in the first half.  Expectations were that real  fixed investment would rise to more than R11.2bn in the first six  months of 1994.  Finance Department director general Estian Calitz  said real gross domestic investment had increased in the third  quarter for the first time in three and a half years.  Econometrix  economist Azar Jammine said it was unlikely a recovery in investment  had occurred in the building, mining and construction industries.  A  good indicator of investment in these sectors was heavy commercial  vehicle sales which were still weak, he said.

The commission will also 'ensure that  companies raising capital conform with national policy on ethnic and  gender employment practice and other policies.  Capital institutions  should be subject to prescribed asset requirements under which a  percentage of their assets have to be placed in eligible  securities.'

(Johannesburg  SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES 20 Nov 93)      Budget Deficit:  Below Year-End Forecast      According to a report in BUSINESS DAY, the ""government looks set  to end the fiscal year with the deficit below budget, after final  spending figures were tabled in Parliament.  The small overrun on  budgeted spending--less than 1 billion Rand (R1bn)--would be offset  by the extra R1bn in revenue, officials said.  This suggested the  deficit would be lower than the budgeted R25.3bn.  Earlier this year  economists predicted a deficit of R30bn.  The total estimated  expenditure in the Budget was R114.2bn while the revised expenditure  would be R115.2bn.  The increase in expenditure was due to funds  being made available for capital projects associated with the sale  of state land (R50mn), the sale of strategic oil reserves to finance  drought relief and job creation (R724mn), and R451 mm in  overexpenditure.  From this total of R1.2bn should be subtracted  expenditure which had not materialized, mainly the R224mn in  unrealized retrenchment costs.  The R451 mm overexpenditure was  mainly the result of the South African Police increasing staff by  7,500 members to combat violence (R249mn) and the re-employment of  health service personnel (R144mn).""  (Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY 1  Dec 93)      Debt to Increase Next Year      ""Government's debt will be pushed closer to the danger level of  60 percent of GDP next year when homeland debts are taken onto the  books and pension funds are topped up by issuing stock.  In terms of  the interim constitution, all debts and liabilities other than those  linked to property ""shall vest in the national government.""  This  means that the state debt will rise by billions at a stroke--with  the last estimate of homelands' (including Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda, and Ciskei states) debt put at R14bn.  Adding to the debt  mountain will be stock issued to address pension fund deficits.  It  is understood that almost R7bn in stock will be issued to state  pension funds to bring funding to a more acceptable level.  Sources  said government had placed a limit of R8bn for its guarantees on the  homeland overdrafts, and speculation was that the level was fast  being approached.  Government's interest bill, at R22bn for the  present fiscal year, amounted to more than 26 percent of the Budget  from about 15 percent in 1992/93.  By contrast, total capital  expenditure was less than 8 percent of the Budget.""  (Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY 29 Nov 93)      Foreign Investment: Number of Western Firms Up      According to the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC)  based in Washington, there are now 28 more American and 70 non-  American multinational companies with direct investment or employees  in South Africa than a year ago.  The IRRC counts a total of 717  multinationals with direct investment or employees in South Africa,  168 of them German and 164 British.  The IRRC distinguishes between  these companies which have a direct investment in South Africa and  those which have ""non-equity"" links, such as licensing and  distribution agreements, with South African companies.  The increase  in U.S. companies with equity links has been much greater over the  last year, 189 more companies bring the present total to 445.  Among  non-U.S. companies, the net increase has been 126 over the last  year, bringing the total to 429.  The greater increase in non-equity  involvement reflects ""wariness"" about South Africa.  The IRRC notes  that many U.S. companies not in South Africa have shown an interest  in the country but remain wary because of the political situation.

Central Statistical Service  figures show the index of physical manufacturing production up 3.6  percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months to August  compared to the same period last year.  This was an improvement on  the second quarter when output volumes eased 1.9 percent.  Economists said production in most of the 28 major manufacturing  groups appeared to be returning to more normal levels after output  was hampered in the previous quarter by stayaways in the wake of the  assassination of SACP leader Chris Hani.  The strongest recovery  occurred in wood and wood products; printing and publishing;  petroleum and coal; electrical machinery; motor vehicles, parts and  accessories and professional and scientific equipment Econometrix  economist Tony Twine said a turnaround in manufacturing in the  second half was expected due to an improvement in third quarter GDP  figures.  The GDP data indicated the manufacturing sector grew at a  seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.5 percent in the three  months to September after slumping 0.2 percent in the second  quarter.

Issue No. 1 includes information on reactions to the African  National Congress's (ANC) economic policies, the budget deficit,  foreign investment prospects, and economic indicators.      Mixed Reactions to ANC's Interventionist Economic Policies      Addressing thefirst Pretoria/Witwatersrand (PWV) ""people's forum""  at the Johannesburg College of Education, which attracted a mixed  audience of about 500, including some high-profile business leaders,  Nelson Mandela appealed for support for the ANC's reconstruction and  development program.  Mandela indicated that this would require  greatly increased government expenditure and intervention in the  economy.  He called upon white businessmen not to emigrate but to  contribute to economic reconstruction and join the ""democratic  forces in building a new South Africa.""  However, his repeated  message to whites, ""Stay, we need you,"" has not removed skepticism  over the policies the ANC intends to pursue once in power.  According to Johannesburg daily THE STAR, ""Mandela's acknowledgment  that there had to be massive growth in government spending also sent  shivers down many a spine.""

(2 Dec 93)      ""At present, economic expectations are high--many underprivileged  people have been led to believe that April 27 will be followed by  plentiful jobs, housing and economic opportunities.  It is almost  inevitable that these expectations will be fueled by political  speeches in the run-up to election.      Growth that will lead to strong consumer spending and the belief  that the new order is delivering benefits cannot be conjured up that  quickly ... We should recall that we need an annual real growth rate  of about 5 percent if the formal sector of the economy is merely to  find jobs for school leavers, and 8 percent if formal sector  employment is to reduce unemployment levels. These levels will be  achieved only through a national economic consensus that there can  be no room for arcane economic experiments; that we have to be  conventional and in step with other successful nations. .. .The ANC  is not so politically naive as to believe the regime of  nationalization and socialism being proposed by some of its left-  wing economic advisors can work in today's world.""

An opinion  survey undertaken between July and mid-October 1993 by the Center  for International and Comparative Politics at Stellenbosch  University found 50 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 80 percent of  PAC supporters in favor of such nationalization. Furthermore:      The majority of PAC (64 percent) and ANC (62 percent) supporters  agreed companies had a duty to fill top positions with blacks.      46 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 63 percent of PAC  supporters were against limiting the state's role in the economy.      100 percent of PAC supporters, 64 percent of ANC/SACP supporters  and 57 percent of Inkatha Freedom Party supporters were in favor of  price controls.  Conservative Party (CP) supporters were equally  divided, while the majority of Democratic Party (DP) and National  Party (NP) supporters were opposed.      The majority of ANC/SACP and PAC supporters were against limiting  the power of trade unions but CP, NP, and Inkatha supporters were  for it.      The majority of DP, NP, and CP supporters found minimum wages  undesirable, while ANC/SACP supporters (74 percent) and PAC  supporters (72 percent) were in favor. Inkatha supporters were  divided.      The majority of respondents of all parties supported linking  wage and productivity increases, and maximum business, labor and  state consensus.      Supporters of the PAC (72 percent), Inkatha (66 percent) and  ANC/SACP (58 percent) expected an increase in free enterprise.  CP  supporters anticipated a decrease, NP supporters were ambivalent,  and DP supporters undecided.

Kevin Davie, in the 28 November  edition of the SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES, reported the following  Chapter Eight of the final draft of the Merg report, a chapter on  banking and finance:      ""Here we shudder as we read that 'instead of becoming  increasingly independent, the Reserve Bank should be more firmly  under political control.'  Having sweated blood to get the inflation  rate below 10 percent, we take note that 'a target band around 12  percent a year should be considered initially.'  There may be  grounds for nationalizing some banks, 'but normal regulation of  banking activities (which should be increased) can often be obtained  without it.'  While elsewhere in the report it is recommended that  the new Government should not introduce a wealth tax, chapter eight  says a general wealth tax should be introduced.  A changed JSE  (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) is also envisaged.  'The JSE  illustrates that the market-orientation approach to meeting capital  needs is inappropriate.'  There is no case for abolishing marketable  securities tax (partly responsible for the JSE's poor liquidity):  'Indeed there are grounds for increasing it.'  Measures will be  taken to establish compulsory funds that are able to purchase  majority or controlling stakes in quoted companies including mining  finance houses, mine and financial institutions.  The development  and venture capital boards should be strengthened along with  measures to encourage 'the issue of new securities (with minimum  returns partly guaranteed).'  A Capital Issues Commission will be  established under the Ministry of Finance to consider company plans  for new issues and to authorize them, to 'prevent excess demand for  capital creating disorderly market conditions and generating  excessive interest charges.' The commission will also 'ensure that  companies raising capital conform with national policy on ethnic and  gender employment practice and other policies.

We should recall that we need an annual real growth rate  of about 5 percent if the formal sector of the economy is merely to  find jobs for school leavers, and 8 percent if formal sector  employment is to reduce unemployment levels. These levels will be  achieved only through a national economic consensus that there can  be no room for arcane economic experiments; that we have to be  conventional and in step with other successful nations. .. .The ANC  is not so politically naive as to believe the regime of  nationalization and socialism being proposed by some of its left-  wing economic advisors can work in today's world.""  (19 Nov 93)      Opinion Survey Measures Views on Nationalization      ""Naive"" or not, supporters of the ANC/South African Communist  Party (SACP) and Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) continue to find the  nationalization of basic goods and services desirable.  An opinion  survey undertaken between July and mid-October 1993 by the Center  for International and Comparative Politics at Stellenbosch  University found 50 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 80 percent of  PAC supporters in favor of such nationalization. Furthermore:      The majority of PAC (64 percent) and ANC (62 percent) supporters  agreed companies had a duty to fill top positions with blacks.      46 percent of ANC/SACP supporters and 63 percent of PAC  supporters were against limiting the state's role in the economy.      100 percent of PAC supporters, 64 percent of ANC/SACP supporters  and 57 percent of Inkatha Freedom Party supporters were in favor of  price controls.  Conservative Party (CP) supporters were equally  divided, while the majority of Democratic Party (DP) and National  Party (NP) supporters were opposed.      The majority of ANC/SACP and PAC supporters were against limiting  the power of trade unions but CP, NP, and Inkatha supporters were  for it.      The majority of DP, NP, and CP supporters found minimum wages  undesirable, while ANC/SACP supporters (74 percent) and PAC  supporters (72 percent) were in favor. Inkatha supporters were  divided.      The majority of respondents of all parties supported linking  wage and productivity increases, and maximum business, labor and  state consensus.      Supporters of the PAC (72 percent), Inkatha (66 percent) and  ANC/SACP (58 percent) expected an increase in free enterprise.  CP  supporters anticipated a decrease, NP supporters were ambivalent,  and DP supporters undecided.

Kevin Davie, in the 28 November  edition of the SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES, reported the following  Chapter Eight of the final draft of the Merg report, a chapter on  banking and finance:      ""Here we shudder as we read that 'instead of becoming  increasingly independent, the Reserve Bank should be more firmly  under political control.'  Having sweated blood to get the inflation  rate below 10 percent, we take note that 'a target band around 12  percent a year should be considered initially.'  There may be  grounds for nationalizing some banks, 'but normal regulation of  banking activities (which should be increased) can often be obtained  without it.'  While elsewhere in the report it is recommended that  the new Government should not introduce a wealth tax, chapter eight  says a general wealth tax should be introduced.  A changed JSE  (Johannesburg Stock Exchange) is also envisaged.  'The JSE  illustrates that the market-orientation approach to meeting capital  needs is inappropriate.'  There is no case for abolishing marketable  securities tax (partly responsible for the JSE's poor liquidity):  'Indeed there are grounds for increasing it.'  Measures will be  taken to establish compulsory funds that are able to purchase  majority or controlling stakes in quoted companies including mining  finance houses, mine and financial institutions.  The development  and venture capital boards should be strengthened along with  measures to encourage 'the issue of new securities (with minimum  returns partly guaranteed).'  A Capital Issues Commission will be  established under the Ministry of Finance to consider company plans  for new issues and to authorize them, to 'prevent excess demand for  capital creating disorderly market conditions and generating  excessive interest charges.' The commission will also 'ensure that  companies raising capital conform with national policy on ethnic and  gender employment practice and other policies.  Capital institutions  should be subject to prescribed asset requirements under which a  percentage of their assets have to be placed in eligible  securities.'  This 'will enable the government to raise funds  through domestic bond issues at relatively low interest rates.'  Chapter eight has all the hallmarks of an author who thinks the  authorities know better than markets.  Could it be that Mr. Pillay,  an advisor to Beijing's Bank of China, is too schooled in  authoritarianism to trust democratic market forces?""  (Johannesburg  SUNDAY TIMES-BUSINESS TIMES 20 Nov 93)      Budget Deficit:  Below Year-End Forecast      According to a report in BUSINESS DAY, the ""government looks set  to end the fiscal year with the deficit below budget, after final  spending figures were tabled in Parliament.  The small overrun on  budgeted spending--less than 1 billion Rand (R1bn)--would be offset  by the extra R1bn in revenue, officials said.  This suggested the  deficit would be lower than the budgeted R25.3bn.  Earlier this year  economists predicted a deficit of R30bn.  The total estimated  expenditure in the Budget was R114.2bn while the revised expenditure  would be R115.2bn.  The increase in expenditure was due to funds  being made available for capital projects associated with the sale  of state land (R50mn), the sale of strategic oil reserves to finance  drought relief and job creation (R724mn), and R451 mm in  overexpenditure.  From this total of R1.2bn should be subtracted  expenditure which had not materialized, mainly the R224mn in  unrealized retrenchment costs.  The R451 mm overexpenditure was  mainly the result of the South African Police increasing staff by  7,500 members to combat violence (R249mn) and the re-employment of  health service personnel (R144mn).""

This  means that the state debt will rise by billions at a stroke--with  the last estimate of homelands' (including Transkei, Bophuthatswana,  Venda, and Ciskei states) debt put at R14bn.  Adding to the debt  mountain will be stock issued to address pension fund deficits.  It  is understood that almost R7bn in stock will be issued to state  pension funds to bring funding to a more acceptable level.  Sources  said government had placed a limit of R8bn for its guarantees on the  homeland overdrafts, and speculation was that the level was fast  being approached.  Government's interest bill, at R22bn for the  present fiscal year, amounted to more than 26 percent of the Budget  from about 15 percent in 1992/93.  By contrast, total capital  expenditure was less than 8 percent of the Budget.""

The IRRC counts a total of 717  multinationals with direct investment or employees in South Africa,  168 of them German and 164 British.  The IRRC distinguishes between  these companies which have a direct investment in South Africa and  those which have ""non-equity"" links, such as licensing and  distribution agreements, with South African companies.  The increase  in U.S. companies with equity links has been much greater over the  last year, 189 more companies bring the present total to 445.  Among  non-U.S. companies, the net increase has been 126 over the last  year, bringing the total to 429.  The greater increase in non-equity  involvement reflects ""wariness"" about South Africa.

Central Statistical Service  figures show the index of physical manufacturing production up 3.6  percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months to August  compared to the same period last year.  This was an improvement on  the second quarter when output volumes eased 1.9 percent.  Economists said production in most of the 28 major manufacturing  groups appeared to be returning to more normal levels after output  was hampered in the previous quarter by stayaways in the wake of the  assassination of SACP leader Chris Hani.  The strongest recovery  occurred in wood and wood products; printing and publishing;  petroleum and coal; electrical machinery; motor vehicles, parts and  accessories and professional and scientific equipment Econometrix  economist Tony Twine said a turnaround in manufacturing in the  second half was expected due to an improvement in third quarter GDP  figures.  The GDP data indicated the manufacturing sector grew at a  seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 5.5 percent in the three  months to September after slumping 0.2 percent in the second  quarter.

These diplomatic activities show relations between  Vietnam and countries in Africa and the Middle East are  developing positively. Here is our comments on these events:    Due to geographic difficulties, relations between Vietnam  and  countries in Africa and the Middle East have not developed,  though the peoples in that region offered support towards the  national liberation struggle of the Vietnamese people in the  past as well as in national construction at present. Those  geographical obstacles are now less difficult. Many countries  in that region have invited Vietnamese leaders to pay working  visits. In response to their warm sentiments, in March Vice  President Nguyen Thi Binh led a Vietnamese delegation to visit  Algeria, Guinea, and Mali. Vietnam signed with those three  countries agreements on economic, cultural, scientific and  technological, and trade cooperation. At the end of last week,  Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh left for South Africa to attend  the swearing-in ceremony of President Nelson Mandela. There,  she met leaders of African countries and affirmed Vietnam's  determination to strengthen cooperative ties with them,  particularly with the new South Africa.    In the Middle East, with the current visit by Vice Premier  Nguyen Khanh to Syria and Egypt, new prospects in cooperation  have been opened up. Trade agreements have been signed between  Vietnam and Syria and Egypt. Vietnam now has expanded its  relations with all regions in the world.

0,FT934-5466 ,"FT934-5466 _AN-DLACFAB9FT 931130   FT  30 NOV 93 / Watchdog attacks 'flaws' in GCSE marking      By JOHN AUTHERS   This year's GCSE exams, which showed an improvement in standards, were more rigorously marked than last year's but still showed 'serious flaws', it was announced yesterday. Mr John Patten welcomed the findings by Ofsted, the education watchdog, but called for a 'back to basics' change to the marking scheme for exams next year to ensure consistent marking for spelling, punctuation and grammar. He said: 'We must ensure that a consistent system is in place before the next round of GCSE examinations.' The Schools Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the education department quango chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, has been charged with introducing the new system. Sir Ron echoed Mr Patten's call: 'We will work with the examining boards to eradicate remaining weaknesses in the GCSE including, in particular, the way that the basic skills of spelling, punctuation and grammar are assessed.' Inspectors found that criteria for assessing basic literacy skills were flawed, with some candidates being penalised for spelling mistakes when they were attempting to use complicated vocabulary. In science exams some candidates were marked down for poor spelling and grammar even though their exam scripts provided little evidence of this. Inspectors were also concerned that the correct balance was not being struck between exams and coursework, both of which count towards the GCSE qualification - the principal examination for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. They said levels of attainment were 'worryingly uneven' across the whole syllabus, while there was a danger that some more demanding parts of a syllabus 'will be given insufficient attention in the classroom'. In English, coursework was strongly presented and organised but 'let down by an inability to rise to the challenge of a timed, formal examination'. Last year the inspectors delivered a damning report on the GCSE results, saying they had 'little confidence' that standards were being maintained. The GCSE was introduced in 1988. Mr Patten welcomed the inspectors' latest finding that the exams had been marked more rigorously than in 1992. This followed the introduction of a new code of practice by the examining boards after Mr Patten had said that apparent improvements in results were due to lower standards, rather than improved performance by pupils.

Nedcor Bank, a subsidiary of Nedcor, has entered into a strategic alliance with Societe Financiere pour les Pays d'Outre-Mer (SFOM), to combine forces in Africa. SFOM, a Swiss-based holding company, has major shareholdings in banks in 14 countries in Africa with a strong presence in West and Central Africa. It is owned by Banque Nationale de Paris, Dresdner Bank and Banque Bruxelles Lambert. Nedcor Bank and SFOM have also agreed, with effect from October 1 1993, to combine forces in Namibia by merging Namibian Banking Corporation and Commercial Bank of Namibia. The merged bank will be jointly managed by the two partners, which hold an 88 per cent stake, and will be known as The Commercial Bank of Namibia. It will be the third largest bank in Namibia with total assets of R725m (Dollars 166m). Nedcor Bank has also agreed to acquire an effective 16 per cent strategic stake in the Merchant Bank of Central Africa, one of Zimbabwe's premier banks, in partnership with other major shareholders including SFOM, NM Rothschild and Hill Samuel. Nedcor Bank said that, given South Africa's inexperience in the rest of the continent, it had been decided to forge relationships with other banks that had greater experience in the region.

0,FT943-4802 ,"FT943-4802 _AN-EIGDVADJFT 940907   FT  07 SEP 94 / False alarm in Cairo: Women's education, not ideology, is key to population control      By EDWARD MORTIMER   While doing voluntary service as a teenager in French-speaking Africa, I shocked a Senegalese friend, a primary school teacher, by urging on him the virtues of contraception. 'Faut pas empecher les gosses de naitre, wai],' he expostulated: You mustn't stop kids being born. (Wai], an all-purpose vernacular exclamation, added emphasis to his statement.) A Moslem, though by no means a fundamentalist, my friend had unwittingly given a succinct summary of Catholic doctrine. I had trouble with it then, and I have trouble with it now. I've always thought the Catholic Church has a better case on abortion than most liberals and feminists are willing to allow: it hardly makes one an irrational fanatic to describe the deliberate destruction of an embryo human being as the 'taking of human life'. But the Church weakens its case enormously by pushing it back before conception. At that stage there is no individual human life to be taken: only a myriad potential combinations, almost all of which nature will rule out anyway. Nor is it obvious that the methods of avoiding conception which the church recommends are any more 'natural' than those it condemns. At the Cairo conference on population and development, Vatican delegates are struggling to remove 'pregnancy termination' from the list of things covered by 'reproductive healthcare' in the UN draft document and to salvage a phrase about 'taking appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which in no case should be presented as a method of family planning'. Vatican delegates have wisely avoided taking a stand on the contraception issue. They are not helped by TV footage from the Philippines, where last month Catholics, led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, demonstrated against the conference and their government's family planning policy, with banners proclaiming: 'Contraception = abortion = murder.' Similarly the conference's organisers must have been less than pleased with newspaper headlines yesterday suggesting that Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Norwegian prime minister, won a standing ovation by calling for abortion to be legalised worldwide. They have taken pains to establish that this is not the conference's agenda. Mrs Brundtland herself complained that the agenda had been misrepresented, suggesting that the term 'reproductive healthcare' could not 'possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family planning'. But she clearly meant to take on the Vatican with two of her statements: that 'morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering or dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and unwanted children'; and that morality cannot 'only be a question of controlling sexuality and protecting unborn life'. It is a false quarrel about a false alarm. A false quarrel, because each side is attacking the other for a position which, in this conference at least, it is not attempting to defend. And a false alarm because the current prospect for world population growth is less catastrophic than the headlines suggest. In an essay just published in the New York Review of Books, Prof Amartya Sen, a leading expert on the economics of famine, reminds us that the rate of world population growth has fallen in the last two decades from 2.2 to 1.7 per cent, and 'is expected to go steadily down until the size of the world's population becomes nearly stationary'. The number at which it will eventually stabilise, around 10bn, still sounds alarmingly high. It is, but not - as many imagine - because most of those people will be hungry and poor: per capita incomes are rising and food is getting cheaper in those parts of the world where most of them are being born. The danger is the opposite: sooner or later most of them will be able to afford western lifestyles and consumption patterns, putting an unsustainable strain on the world environment. That problem will not be solved by population control alone, but anything we can do to accelerate the fall in the birth rate should help to make it more manageable. But Prof Sen makes a strong case that coercive or 'override' methods - those in which 'the family's personal decisions are overridden by some agency outside the family' - are unnecessary and perhaps ineffective, as well as being inhumane. The fall in China's birth rate since 1979 may, he suggests, be due less to the authoritarian one-child policy than to 'more collaborative and participatory' policies which have made education and jobs outside the home available to many Chinese women. The Indian state of Kerala, with 29m people, has reduced its birth and fertility rates below those of China without any state coercion. It is among the poorer Indian states (so economic growth is not in itself the solution, as is sometimes argued), but it resembles China in having 'high levels of basic education, healthcare and so on'. Most strikingly, it has higher rural literacy rates, male and female, than any Chinese province. China and Kerala have the advantage of being neither Moslem nor Catholic. But the birth rate is also falling rapidly in Iran (where there is good basic healthcare, and the authorities came round to family planning in 1988) and in most of South America. The Tablet, the British Catholic magazine, even claimed last month, with a certain chutzpah, that because it favours women's education 'the Catholic Church should be regarded as one of the most effective organisations in the world for reducing the rate of population growth'. In other words, the Pope should be congratulated for educating his female followers to the point where they can ignore his advice.   Countries:-  EGZ  Egypt, Africa.     XAZ  World.

0,FT944-12720 ,"FT944-12720 _AN-EJ4DUAEWFT 941031   FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: Africa's stock markets aim high - The Emerging Investor      By MARK SUZMAN   As with so much else on the continent, Africa's stock exchanges tend to be bypassed by international investors who are convinced that anything preceded by the word African must be a hopeless economic basket case. Indeed, even among emerging markets specialists, few are aware of the existence of any African stock markets outside of South Africa - and even in that country genuine international interest is a relatively recent occurrence. Last week, however, at the annual general meeting of the African Stock Exchanges Association (ASEA) in Johannesburg, representatives from bourses across the region served notice that Africa is determined to put itself back on the international investment map. In particular, now that a politically rehabilitated South Africa is rapidly becoming integrated with the rest of the continent and is poised to act as its economic leader, hopes are running high that the continent's various exchanges are about to embark on an unprecedented growth path. 'The situation is looking better now for Africa than at any time in the past 30 years, and there's real potential for growth,' observes one analyst who recently started assessing African stocks. While such glib predictions litter Africa's modern economic history, ASEA officials are adamant that this is no longer a pipe-dream, pointing out that there are currently no fewer than 14 operative African stock markets, with a combined market capitalisation of Dollars 256bn (Pounds 162bn). Of these, South Africa is by far the most important player, accounting for Dollars 240bn compared with Dollars 7bn in North Africa (Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco); Dollars 8bn in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Namibia, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Ivory Coast, Swaziland and Uganda) and a further Dollars 1bn coming from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. Even more striking is the fact that many exchanges already offer impressive returns. As a group the African markets rose by an average 30 per cent last year and only two exchanges, Botswana and Nigeria, fell. Zimbabwe, meanwhile, had the fourth best performing market in the world, rising by an astonishing 123 per cent in dollar terms (albeit off a low base) and the Mauritian index rose 51 per cent. Taking note of these figures, some of the bigger investment banks and securities houses have started to investigate African markets more seriously. Morgan Stanley, for example, has included several non-South African stocks in its Africa Fund and is distinctly upbeat on the continent's prospects. 'In spite of past problems, Africa's potential is unmistakeable. The world's second largest continent, with 11m square miles, is three times the size of the US and has twice the population, 600m strong, and is rich in natural resources and agriculture,' its assessment concludes. Similarly, in another recent report, Barings predicts that African exchanges should be able to expand from their current 2.2 per cent share of world market capitalisation to 3 per cent by 2010 on the back of anticipated cross-border equity flows of between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.6bn. The sub-Saharan markets on their own, the report predicts, could expand by a factor of five or six times. Nevertheless, if the continent is to achieve this, analysts agree that further structural reforms are desperately needed. In particular, the markets need to boost liquidity substantially: South Africa, with annual turnover amounting to only 7.4 per cent of market capitalisation, is currently the most liquid of all sub-Saharan markets and even in the north, only Morocco's 21.7 per cent exceeds it. In large part, this is due to currency controls, which are still in place in nearly all African countries and need to be removed to allow the free movement of capital. At the same time, however, the markets need to launch some international stock offerings to help raise the continent's profile. These points are largely accepted by the markets, which have started actively lobbying their respective governments for action on both fronts. 'Only by removing the major stumbling block of exchange controls and by providing new shares through privatisation issues can we attract the foreign capital we so dearly need to develop our countries,' observes Mr Jimnah Mbaru, ASEA chairman. The first leg of this process has already begun. Several countries have implemented currency reforms as part of IMF-imposed structural adjustment programmes. South Africa is also likely to jettison its own confusing financial rand system for foreign investors some time early next year, which should provide further impetus for the deregulation process. At the same time, moreover, many states are considering privatising companies in sectors such as mining, telecommunications and transport. As Ghana's highly successful recent Dollars 450m flotation of its Ashanti gold mine, of which 87 per cent was sold internationally, indicates, given the proper conditions global investors are more than willing to take a chance on Africa. In the meantime, the continent's stockbroking fraternity is continuing to grow: two more markets, in Tanzania and Malawi, are expected to open over the coming year.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             Friday  Week on week change Stock                             Country  28/10/94   Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bagfas                             Turkey   0.2106    0.0422     25.07 Shinhan Bank                     S.

Mesfin said the relations between the two countries are very  good, adding that Ethiopia has had a lot of support from and  cooperation with China in achieving national unity and economic  development.    He hailed the economic development in China as a great  success, which he said will be a great encouragement to Ethiopia.    Qian Qichen, who is also Chinese vice-premier, said China  treasures the friendship between the two countries and is  willing to strengthen the cooperation on the basis of the five  principles of peaceful coexistence.    Qian said, the realization of peace in Ethiopia after 30  years of civil war shows what can be achieved by Ethiopia can  also be attained by other similar African countries, so long  clue efforts are made [as received].    The Chinese vice-premier said Ethiopian national economy  grows very fast, with a growth rate of 7.9 percent in 1992-93  fiscal year.    Qian Qichen said at a time when Africa is facing many  challenges and new difficulties, there have been varied  approaches to the continent, some think human rights is the most  important for Africa and others think it is the democratization.  In the light of the practice of China, we hold that the most  important tasks for Africa at present are: firstly to keep  political and social stability which is the primary condition  for the development of economy, secondly to develop economy  which is the central task and fundamental goal of all work.  Thirdly reform, only by which can all construction make  progress. Stability is the condition, reform is the motive  force, while development is the central task.    The Ethiopian foreign minister agreed with the analysis of  the Chinese vice-premier, believing that stability and  development is inseparable.    Qian Qichen also praised highly Ethiopia's policy of good  neighborliness and regional peace.    He said Somali question is the most important one in Africa.  China is paying great attention to the development in Somalia  and sympathizing with the sufferings of the Somali people.    He said, the Somali issue can only be solved by the Somali  people themselves, adding that the key to the peaceful solution  of the Somali problem is to achieve a broad national  reconciliation in Somalia.    However, Qian noted that the international community should  help the Somali people to resolve the Somali issue, but should  not do everything in their stead.    He also expressed the hope that all Somali factions could  iron out the differences through discussions and dialogues and  the Organization of African Unity and countries in the horn of  Africa can play an important role in seeking a solution to the  Somali issue.

0,FT941-75 ,"FT941-75 _AN-EC4C0AEZFT 940331   FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Benefits of streamlined management lift Ocean      By DAVID BLACKWELL   The benefits of streamlining the management structure and the dollar exchange rate helped Ocean Group, the freight, environmental and marine services combine, to achieve pre-tax profits of Pounds 44.1m for 1993. This was sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 16m, struck after a Pounds 16m loss on the Panocean disposal and a charge of Pounds 8.4m for the management restructuring. The latest figure represents a 9 per cent rise on 1992's underlying profits of Pounds 40.4m. Group turnover rose from Pounds 875m to Pounds 964m, including Pounds 10.7m from discontinued operations. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the management changes had contributed about Pounds 5m to profits, and movements in the exchange rate a further Pounds 4m. He described the markets for most of the group's services as tough. 'In these conditions the growth in our results was encouraging,' he said. Operating profits from the freight and distribution division, which operates on fine margins, eased from Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 14.7m on turnover ahead from Pounds 644m to Pounds 748m. The profits fall was mainly due to Hull Blyth, which was seriously affected by the war in Angola. Profits at MSAS, the air freight brokerage company, were 15 per cent ahead on exchange gains and the benefits of a new computer system. Large new clients included Eastman Kodak. The marine services division, which contributes the bulk of profits, also benefited from exchange rates which countered lower oil prices. They rose by 25 per cent from Pounds 24.1m to Pounds 30.1m on turnover of Pounds 132m (Pounds 122m). The group succeeded in moving its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed North Sea to areas of strength in west Africa and south-east Asia. Profits from environmental services rose from Pounds 4m to Pounds 4.4m on turnover of Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m). The UK domestic waste business had a good year. Earnings per share were up to 20.3p (1.4p). An unchanged final dividend of 9.62p is proposed giving an unchanged total for the year of 14.33p. COMMENT Ocean has been running hard to stand still. The benefits from the restructuring and exchange rate movements have saved it from a flat year or worse. Most of the profits come from the marine services area, where low prices are curbing oil exploration budgets. Overall there appears to be nothing to get excited about from the rather mixed bag of activities. However, there is a further Pounds 3m benefit to come from the restructuring, and the balance sheet is strong, with gearing down from 35 per cent to 17 per cent. A yield of 6.6 per cent makes the shares worth holding.   Companies:-  Ocean Group.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.   Industries:-  P4412 Deep Sea Foreign Transportation of Freight.

""The people of Namibia have waited long years for this day, and it is the eve  of an era: an era of all of the people of Namibia,"" Martti Ahtisaari, the  U.N.'s special representative to Namibia, said Friday as he arrived to monitor  the transition from African colony to nationhood.    ""Namibia has truly been a wound in the side of Africa,"" Ahtisaari told a news  conference at Windhoek's airport. ""But it also has a special place in the  hearts and minds of the whole world.""    Thousands of cheering Namibians came by train, bus and even on horseback across  the scrubby desert to line the airport road and welcome the U.N. official, who  arrived on a South African Airways flight from Frankfurt, West Germany.    The throng, bedecked in traditional African dress and the bright colors of some  of the territory's 40 political parties, carried signs reading: ""No Government  Based on Ethnicity,"" ""No to a One-Party System"" and ""Welcome Martti."" Women in  braided hair ululated and danced while political organizers with bullhorns  called out slogans to their faithful.      'We Want an Election'    ""We're here to show these U.N. people how much we want an election,"" said  Katjimuini Veii, who was wearing a T-shirt expressing his support for the  Namibian Patriotic Front, a coalition of political parties.    Ahtisaari's arrival was eagerly awaited here because it signaled the start of  an 11-year-old U.N. plan to free Namibia, a rugged land of only 1.5 million  people on the southwestern coast of Africa.    South Africa, itself then a self-governing British possession, captured the  colony from Germany in World War I. After the war, the League of Nations gave  South Africa the mandate to govern the territory. South Africa became fully  independent of Britain in 1934 and after World War II, the league's successor  organization, the United Nations, refused to allow it to annex the territory.  In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly terminated South Africa's mandate in  Namibia.    Pretoria has defiantly occupied Namibia for more than 20 years. Since the  mid-1970s, it had cited the presence of Cuban troops in Angola, Namibia's  northern neighbor. But in December, it agreed to bring its troops out, in  return for a promise that Cuba would pull its troops out of Angola.      Test of Commitment    The independence process is considered an important test of South Africa's  commitment to peace in southern Africa. South Africa also hopes a smooth  transition for Namibia will improve Pretoria's image abroad and help reduce its  international economic and political isolation.    ""We are leaving Namibia with a feeling that we have fulfilled our commitments  here with dignity,"" Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister,  said Friday at a news conference in Windhoek. Describing South Africa's  contributions to Namibia's infrastructure over the years, Botha added, ""I  cannot imagine a country that has a better hope of making a success of  independence than this one.""    The U.N.'s Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG), which will cost $416 million,  includes a multinational force of 4,650 troops and, at its height, 2,500  additional monitors, administrators and local staff. About 1,000 troops already  have arrived and are stationed throughout the territory to monitor the election  campaign and voting.    Under the U.N. transition, Namibia will be governed until independence by South  Africa's administrator general ""to the satisfaction of"" the U.N.'s Ahtisaari,  according to the U.N. resolution.    Ahtisaari, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar's personal envoy in  Namibia, said the joint U.N.-South Africa effort marked ""a unique and  pioneering vision."" If successful, he added, ""the prospect for a peaceful  settlement of even the (world's) most intractable problems will have taken a  giant stride forward.""    ""We'd like to see these elections be really free and fair, free of the scourge  of violence and intimidation,"" the South African administrator, Louis Pienaar,  said in pledging his country's impartiality. ""We would like to prove that  democratic elections can be held in this part of the world.""      Cease-Fire in Effect    A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West  Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war  for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had  informally observed a cease-fire since December.    Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the  country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia.    About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army  against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and  uniforms.    Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all  discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners  and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July  to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of  about 30,000.    Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went  into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United  Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them  in southern Angola.    Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the  territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole  process is expected to be concluded by this time next year.    SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous  region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an  election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design  the constitution by itself.    Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one  of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one  U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be  covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia ""the most complicated  mission we have ever put on,"" according to Cedric Thornberry, the  second-ranking U.N. official here.    Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north,  where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the  total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses.    Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence  here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more  moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of  preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory.    Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional  government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over  legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba.

Cease-Fire in Effect    A formal U.N.-negotiated cease-fire between South Africa and the South-West  Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), which has waged a 23-year guerrilla war  for independence, went into effect at dawn today although the two sides had  informally observed a cease-fire since December.    Also beginning today, South Africa's troops are confined to two bases in the  country, and SWAPO's soldiers must remain in their bases in Angola and Zambia.    About 24,000 black Namibians who have fought with the South African army  against SWAPO are being disbanded and ordered to surrender their weapons and  uniforms.    Namibia's independence is guided by a strict timetable. By mid-May, all  discriminatory laws must be repealed, and by early June all political prisoners  and detainees held by both sides must be released. South Africa has until July  to reduce its troop strength in Namibia to 1,500, from a high last year of  about 30,000.    Namibians who fled the country to escape the war and SWAPO members who went  into exile are expected to begin returning in the coming weeks. The United  Nations estimates that about 58,000 Namibians are living in exile, most of them  in southern Angola.    Namibia's election campaign begins in July and, in early November, the  territory will elect an assembly to draw up a new constitution. The whole  process is expected to be concluded by this time next year.    SWAPO, with its strong base of support in the north, Namibia's most populous  region, is regarded by many political analysts as the likely winner in an  election. But few believe it will gain the two-thirds majority needed to design  the constitution by itself.    Namibia, a mostly desert land with mines producing diamonds and uranium, is one  of the world's least-populous regions. In fact, the territory will have one  U.N. soldier for every 200 Namibians. But because of the large distances to be  covered, the world body considers its mission in Namibia ""the most complicated  mission we have ever put on,"" according to Cedric Thornberry, the  second-ranking U.N. official here.    Most of Namibia's inhabitants are black and 60% of them live in the north,  where SWAPO draws most of its support. Only 80,000 Namibians, about 6% of the  total population, are white. But they control many of the businesses.    Most of Namibia's whites, including those who strongly oppose the U.N. presence  here, have decided to remain at least until the November elections. Many more  moderate whites have decided to actively contest the election in the hope of  preventing a sweeping SWAPO victory.    Before today, Namibia had been governed by a multiracial transitional  government, but South Africa's administrator retained veto power over  legislation. Although apartheid was formally abolished several years ago,  segregated second-tier governmental bodies kept such institutions as schools  and hospitals racially separate.    But the government has been abolished and, until independence, Pienaar, South  Africa's administrator, will be in control of the country. On matters relating  to the upcoming elections, however, his actions must meet with the approval of  the United Nations.      NAMIBIA NEARS INDEPENDENCE (Southland Edition)    Today marks the beginning of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by South Africa (which has administered the huge,  sparsely populated territory since World War I), Angola and Cuba. Provisions of  the plan:    April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of the 7,000-member  U.N. Transition Assistance Group who will oversee the transition. South African  troops in Namibia and guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization  (SWAPO), based in neighboring Angola, are confined to their bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is disbanded; South Africa reduces its  forces to 12,000 troops. South African administrator Louis Pienaar publishes  election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners freed; Namibian exiles return.    July 1 -- Pretoria's forces cut to 1,500; election campaigning begins.    Oct. 31 -- 25,000 Cuban troops have left Angola, rest withdraw north of 13th  Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered to  approve constitution for independent Namibia, the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate in Namibia ends; Cubans have  removed 33,000 troops from Angola.

""We are against any form  of dual recognition,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.    In a major policy switch, Taiwan said Tuesday that it would  not seek to cut official ties with South Africa if Pretoria  switches diplomatic recognition to Beijing.    The announcement by Foreign Minister Frederick Chan marked  the first time Taiwan had indicated it would be prepared to  tolerate dual recognition with China. However, the Chinese  spokesman was adamant such an arrangement would be unacceptable  to Beijing. ""We firmly oppose any attempt aimed at creating two  Chinas, or one China one Taiwan,"" he said.    China refuses to permit countries with which it has  diplomatic relations to recognise Taiwan, which it has regarded  as a renegade province ever since Nationalist forces fled to the  island in 1949 after losing a civil war to the communists on the  mainland. Similarly, Taipei has previously broken ties with any  country which switches formal recognition to Beijing.    Beijing and South Africa's new government of national unity  are widely expected to establish diplomatic relations later this  year. China, a long-time supporter of the black majority's  struggle for political rights in South Africa, had previously  refused to establish ties with the white government in Pretoria  until the country's apartheid system had been completely  dismantled. ""We believe that relations between China and the  new South Africa will enjoy all-round development in the  future,"" the spokesman said.    In October last year, China resumed economic and trade links  with South Africa which were suspended in 1960.    Taiwan currently maintains official ties with only 29  countries, including South Africa, but has in recent years  launched a diplomatic offensive -- especially in Southeast Asia  -- to cement ties with other governments.

0,FT943-10555 ,"FT943-10555 _AN-EHDDVAC7FT 940804   FT  04 AUG 94 / UNloved, UNwanted: A fitting fate for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   You may have missed it, but 1980 to 1990 was the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. It had no impact whatsoever on the continent the first time round, but the perpetrator of this exercise in wishful thinking, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), appears to work on the principle that Pooh Bear applied to his Hums. Pooh, it will be recalled, managed the first line of Hum without difficulty: 'Sing Ho] for the life of a bear.' It sounded splendid, but what came next? Pooh got stuck, until he had a brain wave. He would sing it very fast, in the hope the second line would just pop out. So will you please welcome the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa. There is not quite the same ring to it, for Unido seems to have been caught napping. The second decade runs from 1993 to 2002. Enough is enough. It is time to abolish a body whose demise would distress only its 1,200 employees and the hundreds of experts and consultants who feed from its Dollars 100m-a-year trough. Unido was introduced to the world on January 1 1967 through General Assembly resolution 2152 (XXI) of November 17 1966. From the start it had ideas above its station, claiming that it had a 'mandate to act as the central co-ordinating body for industrial activities within the UN system'. Like many organisations spawned by the United Nations, Unido has been sustained by pompous jargon and an overriding belief in its own importance. The concept of an Industrial Decade, whatever that means, is given spurious authenticity through the language signalling its creation. The general assembly, we are told, in Resolution 35/668 of December 5 1980, proclaimed the 1980s as the Industrial Development Decade for Africa 'thus giving worldwide recognition to the decade'. Of course, it did nothing of the sort, except for UN bureaucrats. A welter of documents sustained their fantasies, products of seminars and special sessions where the delegates draw their per diems and build nothing more substantial than castles in the air. By 1983 Unido had produced a slim volume of pensees entitled A Programme for the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. The reader is warned that this handbook 'differs in many respects from previous practice, and calls for a firm rejection of isolated piecemeal planning of the past and a clear shift away from over-occupation (sic) with foreign exchange problems external to the region'. So much for Africa's overvalued exchange rates of the era, the single most serious feature of the already evident economic crisis that was destroying the continent. 'The new approach,' the guidelines reveal, 'is also predicated on a decisive move towards the integrated development of the human resources, institutional mechanisms and technological capacities required to assess and utilise the natural resources and raw material endowments of the region, expand local markets, enlarge the range of complementarities and strengthen links between industry and other sectors of the economy.' Of course, these banal exhortations did Africa no service. What they did do was to alert consultants and experts worldwide that here was another UN gravy train. Like the 1970s, the 1980s saw a series of Unido country reports, stupefyingly bland in their analysis, out of date in their statistics, and deferential to autocratic governments and kleptocratic regimes. Like all UN organisations, Unido selects its officers more for their country of origin than their expertise. Thus places were found for assorted econometricians, agronomists and economists, most with dubious credentials. They usually owed their jobs to political patronage, and lived in a world of diplomatic privileges, duty free facilities and hardship allowances. Unlike the World Bank, no one subjects Unido to scrutiny. If anyone cared to assess its policies and proposals over the 1970s and the 1980s, the organisation would emerge deeply discredited. Today Unido has the chutzpah to claim that it 'assists both governments and the public and private sector through technical and investment promotion services, and with policy advice'. The suggestion that this ineffectual agency might assist the private sector, or have any insight into investment, is risible. To be fair, Unido should not be blamed for Africa's crisis. True, it bears the responsibility that attaches to those who stay silent when they should be sounding the alarm. But no one took much notice of Unido and its experts. And that is why no one will miss it.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.  The Financial Times   London Page 15  "

In a talk with visiting Foreign Minister of the Republic of  Angola Venacio da Silva Moura, Qian said that the peoples of  China and Angola have enjoyed traditional friendship, adding  that China is willing to further enhance cooperative relations  with Angola.    Qian said that China has been paying close attention to  Angola's peace process and sincerely hopes that the talks in  Angola will reach final agreement at an early date and realize  domestic peace and stability.    He noted that China has never interfered in the internal  affairs of African countries and has dedicated itself to  contributing to the development of Africa as much as possible.  China hopes that African countries enjoy peace and stability  and develop good-neighborly ties of friendship, Qian said.    Qian pointed out that big countries, instead of interfering  in the internal affairs of African countries, should let African  nations build their countries according to their own situations.    If big powers really care about Africa, they should not  write  out a prescription and force Africa to accept it, Qian said.  They should offer aid to Africa to promote the development of  African economies.    Moura briefed Qian on the current situation in Angola. He  expressed thanks for China's long-term political and economic  support of his country.    He noted that in Angola's struggle for national  independence,  the peoples of Angola and China stood on one side. After  drastic changes in the international situation, the two peoples  still stood together.    The Angolan foreign minister reaffirmed that his country  firmly insists on a ""one-China"" policy and will not develop any  official ties with Taiwan.    He expressed the belief that economic and trade relations  between the two countries will be further enhanced after Angola  realizes internal peace.     "
0,FT932-5529 ,"FT932-5529 _AN-DFCCOADUFT 930603   FT  03 JUN 93 / Personal View: Quality control is here to stay      By JOHN PATTEN   It is sometimes the fate of education secretaries and general secretaries of teacher associations and unions to have to shout to make themselves heard above the din. All very different from the quiet discussions I have had in many classrooms and staff rooms during visits to schools. Parents will be first to applaud if we now enter a phase of quiet and constructive dialogue after the great educational debate of this spring. I hope we never again see industrial action in our classrooms. As I have always said, my overriding objective is to raise standards. So is ours, say Peter Smith and David Hart in their interesting article in the FT ('The ABCs of a sensible testing policy', May 13). The purpose of testing is, they write, principally to provide 'confident information about how children are performing . . .' I agree. I am all the more sad, therefore, that some now seem to want to conceal information. The performances of the health service, the police and local government are all carefully measured. It cannot be right that education should be left - uniquely - as the public service for which there is no freely available information on performance. Taxpayers, who contribute billions of pounds every year to education, have a right to know if that money is producing good results, and about which schools are performing well. Tests and the publication of results are an important part of the process of ratcheting up standards. The premise for any dialogue must be the success of the national curriculum. We cannot raise standards unless we first raise our expectations of what children can, and should, achieve. The national curriculum does that by setting challenging national targets for all pupils across a broad and balanced curriculum. I long ago concluded that the need for such information is greatest in the basics of English, mathematics and science. This is an ambitious reform. Unlike our main competitors, we have never set ourselves clear national standards. That is one of the reasons - perhaps the most important - why the achievements of our pupils, particularly in the middle and lower ability ranges, lag behind those in France, Germany and Japan. The government is determined that we should catch up. The counterpart of setting demanding standards is measuring whether you reach them; in other words, good educational quality control. Only those who are indifferent to success eschew the opportunity to gauge how close or how far we are from achieving it. That is where tests come in. National tests are here to stay. They are integral to the national curriculum. Without tests, the standards set out in the national curriculum have no real meaning or force. Some of the critics of the testing arrangements often forget this umbilical link with the national curriculum. Tests are designed both to provide diagnostic information for teachers and a measure of children's progress for parents. They do this because they are anchored by the standards prescribed in the national curriculum. The tests enable teachers to diagnose where pupils are falling short of expected standards and to remedy shortcomings. Of course the quality of education is as high in some of our schools as anywhere in the world, but the urgent need for diagnosis is manifest in the large numbers of young people who leave school without the literacy and numeracy skills needed to make the best of further education or employment. The cost to business of poor skills in literacy and numeracy is now put at Pounds 5bn a year. The published test results also show how pupils, individually and collectively, are measuring up to national standards and how those standards are moving over time. Disengage the tests from the curriculum targets and they will cease to act as an effective measure. Parents and others would be denied an important opportunity to gauge whether or not a school was improving on past performance. Last year's tests for 14-year-olds in mathematics and science went well. In fact a great deal of time and effort - three years of trials in the case of this summer's tests for 14-year-olds - has gone into writing tests which are a fair reflection of what pupils have been taught. The government and Sir Ron Dearing (chairman of the new School Curriculum and Assessment Authority) both take the view that the tests should go ahead in order to learn lessons for the future as well; one year's tests are always a staging post on the way to the next. Meanwhile I have asked Sir Ron to review the curriculum and assessment framework to see how its overall manageability for teachers can be improved. Teachers have worked hard since the national curriculum was introduced to put it into place. The review will consider whether the current curriculum can be focused more sharply so that teachers are clearer about their objectives. It will consider how the arrangements for assessing children's progress against those targets can be streamlined without loss of rigour, but to the benefit of manageability. What is the best balance between tests and teachers' own assessments of school work? How can we minimise the administration of the tests? Will external marking provide a solution? Our aim is to create a broad and effective evolutionary framework within which teachers, governors and parents can act in the best interests of their schools. That brings me back to the need for a continuing national dialogue and debate. Higher standards in our schools are vital to our national well-being  -education is one of Britain's most important enterprises.

Doubts remain over the latest Russian offer to open up the banking sector, and how to deal with export of Russian nuclear fuels. But ministers hope to have an agreement ready to sign at the European summit in Corfu next month. Ministers will also discuss latest diplomatic efforts to end the fighting in Bosnia, and are expected to approve a Ecu32m (Dollars 36m) plan for the EU to take over the administration of the Bosnian town of Mostar. Separately, the Council will consider a European Commission proposal to send Ecu100m of food aid to Ukraine, as part of a broader strategy to Russia's neighbour. Dominican poll: Election day in the Dominican Republic sees President Joaqun Balaguer, 87, seeking his seventh term at the head of the Caribbean nation. But it will be a close-run thing since he is trailing in the polls to Mr Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the social democratic Dominican Revolutionary Party. The last time Mr Balaguer won, in May 1990, his main opponent charged him with fraud. Ecofin: European Union finance and economy ministers, meeting in Brussels, will review the economies of member states and discuss the Commission's white paper on growth, competitiveness and jobs. Financial assistance to eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics is also on the agenda, and the ministers will turn their attention to the Union's anti-fraud strategy. Japan's taxpayers: A list of the 100 highest taxpayers in Japan is to be released. The tax list, prepared by the national tax office, is a mixture of honest and less honest millionaires. It is also an interesting economic indicator. Last year, for example, the survey showed a decline to 125,000 people paying more than Y10m in tax, down from 175,000 in the previous survey. Top of last year's taxpayer league was Hiromasa Ezoe, former president of Recruit, the employment agency, on trial over the 1988-1989 Recruit shares for favours scandal. He paid Y3.96bn in tax in 1992. Platinum survey: Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum marketing group, publishes its highly regarded annual survey of the world platinum market. It is likely to make depressing reading for the producers by suggesting the market remains in surplus and that, unless there is market-disturbing news from either of the two biggest producers - South Africa and Russia - prices will remain relatively low.

TUESDAY 17 US rates likely to rise Many economists expect the US Federal Reserve to announce another rise in short-term interest rates following today's meeting of the policy-making open market committee. A quarter- or half-point increase in the federal funds rate to 4 per cent or 4.25 per cent is widely seen as necessary to bolster the dollar and slow the pace of domestic growth. If the Fed wants to send a strong signal it will also 'ring the gong' - raise the discount rate, at which it lends to banks. So far the discount rate has stayed unchanged at 3 per cent despite three increases to 3.75 per cent in the Fed funds rate. Malawi goes to the polls: Presidential and parliamentary elections will give voters a choice of candidates for the first time since 1964. The multi-party elections follow last year's referendum in which Malawians rejected President Hastings Kamuzu Banda's one-party state. Mr Banda (above), who has ruled since independence, is standing for re-election despite his advancing years. Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, will report its fourth consecutive year of losses. Forecasters agree the loss will be about Pounds 2.5bn, compared with Pounds 2.9bn in 1990 and Pounds 2.1bn in 1989. The market, which reports its results three years in arrears, will soften the blow on Names, whose assets have traditionally supported the market, by stripping out the so-called 'double count'. This occurs when claims produce losses for the syndicate underwriting an original policy, as well as for those underwriting errors and omissions, stop-loss or estate protection insurance. Names will also be allowed to borrow against part of the profits expected for the current year. Trading conditions at Lloyd's have improved over the past two years, with steep rises in insurance rates in some sectors. Bulgaria's largest trade union bloc has called a general strike to push for higher wages for state sector employees. Prices have risen sharply this year because of the introduction of VAT and the sharp devaluation of the Lev.

WEDNESDAY 18 Derivatives report appears The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the US Congress, publishes a study of financial derivatives, such as options and interest rate swaps. The study was prompted by a nightmare scenario of a collapsing world financial system, as overexposed institutions were forced to default on their obligations. The report is expected to propose increased regulation of the multi-billion dollar business, both of those issuing and trading these financial instruments and the companies that use them. The industry, and some policy makers, are against hasty legislation, arguing that existing procedures are working well. Israel is due to complete its military withdrawal from the occupied Gaza Strip, placing 850,000 Palestinians under PLO control. Bulgaria's debt: Deutsche Bank and 300 other London Club banks have until today to indicate their terms to the banking committee handling the rescheduling of Bulgaria's USDollars 9.3bn foreign commercial debt. The two sides, which agreed to reduce the debt by about 50 per cent last November, have set a June 30 deadline for completion of the rescheduling deal. Bulgaria, which unilaterally defaulted on its foreign debt in 1990, is the last of central Europe's former communist states to reschedule its foreign commercial debt. UK economy: April's retail price index will be scrutinised for any sign that inflation may be gathering pace, after the Bank of England's warning last week about inflationary pressures. The market expects the figures to show monthly inflation to have risen to 1.3 per cent, up from 0.3 per cent the previous month, largely as a result of rising council tax bills and the introduction of VAT on fuel. Saleroom: This week both Sotheby's and Christie's sell expensive jewels and works of art in Geneva.

ACP officials admit that it will not be easy for many of their economies to disengage from Lome, with its guaranteed markets for commodity exports and development finance. The EU, on its side, wants to move away from a system based on old colonial ties to a more rational foundation for its trade arrangements. UK economy: Retail sales figures for April are expected to show that the rate of consumer spending has slowed slightly, following recent downbeat evidence from big retailers and the Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey. Month on month, sales are expected to show no growth, after a 0.8 per cent rise in March. But with some economists predicting there could even be a fall of 0.5 per cent in retail spending, the result seems set to provoke further debate about how far April's tax rises have dented consumer confidence.

African  Election Process""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 22 (XINHUA) -- With the  announcement of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) participation in  next week's non-racial election in South Africa, it is expected  the poll will proceed in an atmosphere of goodwill and  reconciliation.    The April 26-28 election is historically important to South  Africa as it is the result of the 300-year struggle of the South  African people, the blacks in particular.    Since the Dutch invaded the South African continent in 1652,  the black people have gradually become the slaves of the white  settlers.    Before the implementation of the 1993 interim constitution,  South Africa was the only country in the world which had  legalized the apartheid system.    The current election in South Africa symbolizes the end of  the inhuman apartheid system in the human history.    On April 19, or one week before the election, the Inkatha  Freedom Party -- the second biggest black party in South Africa  -- announced its participation in the election.    The South African press described the IFP's participation in  the election as ""a miracle.""    In reality, this is a natural result for the IFP after an  international mediation failed in the previous week.    If the IFP does not want to be a guerilla movement in a new  South Africa after the election, it has no other choice but to  participate in the election.    The IFP stands for a federal or confederate state in a  future  South Africa. It asked the international mediation over the  constitutional dispute between the IFP and its rival, the  African National Congress (ANC), so that the 1993 interim  constitution is amended and the election postponed.    The IFP can only become an opposition party if it does not  participate in the election after the failure of the  itnernational mediation.    IFP's decision to participate in the election has greatly  changed the political situation in South Africa.    The three major political players in South Africa, namely  the  ruling National Party, the ANC and the IFP, will all participate  in the election. They are expected to obtain 85 percent votes  of all the voters in the country.    On April 19, South African President F.W. de Klerk, ANC  president Nelson Mandela and IFP president Mangosuthu Buthelezi  signed an agreement and a joint statement in Pretoria.    The agreement said the three parties reject violence and are  committed to realize reconciliation and peace in South Africa.    The joint statement appealed to the South African people to  end violence, exercise maximum restraint and pursue their  objectives by peaceful means.    The agreement and the joint statement will create  circumstances conducive to the holding of a free, fair and  peaceful election in South Africa.    Buthelezi said his party will accept the election result so  long as the international community regards it free and fair.    After the IFP decision was declared, many Zulu people  expressed their ardent wish to participate in the election.    Buthelezi was given a hero's welcome and support when he  returned to Ulundi, capital of the Kwazulu homeland, on April 19  after the signing of the agreement and the joint statement.    Definitely, violence will greatly be reduced as the root  cause of the political conflicts between the IFP and the ANC  have been removed.    An amendment on the 1993 interim constitution was tabled in  the parliament on April 21.    The bill will be debated and approved at a special session  of  the parliament on April 25.    The bill makes provisions for the institution, role,  authority and status of the Zulu monarch, King Goodwill  Zwelithini.    This is the result of a reconciliation among the ruling  national party, the ANC and the IFP.    Where will the seven million Zulu people go? it is important  to the result of the April 26-28 election.     "

At talks in Brussels with Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, and Mr Manuel Marin, EC development commissioner, Mr Mandela is understood to have expressed a preference for accession to the Lome accord, rather than other options for EC-South African relations. The ANC president won EC pledges to help build a new civil service, army and police force, and Community support to prepare voters for multiracial elections next April. Mr Mandela said that while South African membership of Lome was under discussion, the republic's mixture of pockets of wealth surrounded by backwardness meant it should be regarded as an economy in transition, rather like the central European economies. The EC has progressive market access and substantial aid agreements with east and central Europe. But current thinking in Brussels favours a relationship with South Africa as part of a more integrated bloc of nations in southern Africa. This is based on the premise that Pretoria would join the Southern Africa Development Community, which South Africa already dominates economically by the strength of its trade and industrial links. EC officials are uncomfortable with the idea that South Africa, with comparative advantages in areas such as agriculture, a developed financial system, industrial capacity, and advanced transport and communications infrastructure, should be slotted into a format such as Lome designed to aid much less developed former colonies. Meanwhile in New York, the UN General Assembly yesterday agreed to end most economic sanctions against South Africa, two weeks after Mr Mandela, in an address to the world body, proposed lifting the restrictions However, the oil embargo will remain in place until the Transitional Executive Council agreed last month becomes operational, probably around the end of the year. In South Africa the government was yesterday criticised by the ANC and the Pan Africanist Congress for an early morning raid on a home in Umtata, Transkei in which five people died. The PAC denied that the house was used by its military wing. Meanwhile, conservatives have formed the Freedom Alliance, grouping former members of the Concerned South Africans Group (Cosag) - Bophutatswana, Ciskei, Inkatha, the Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront. At the same time, Bophutatswana and Ciskei withdrew from the negotiating council - the forum for multi-party talks - and ended all meetings with the government and ANC. The Alliance's short-term aim is to present a single, united negotiating team which will seek concessions on federalism from the ANC. In the longer term, it seeks to displace the National Party as the country's second largest political group behind the ANC.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT943-6379 ,"FT943-6379 _AN-EH3EIAA1FT 940830   FT  30 AUG 94 / Southern Africa harnesses SADC as engine for growth      By MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa's Deputy President Thabo Mbeki yesterday handed over the country's new flag to Southern Africa Development Conference chairman Sir Ketumile Masire in Gaberone, Botswana, in a gesture that marked the start of a new era for the entire region. The formal accession of South Africa to the now 11-member SADC means that the organisation, originally devoted to reducing its members' links to their southern neighbour, is now regarded as the vehicle with the best chance of driving the region towards growth. The shift follows years during which SADC has been politically opposed to, but dependent on, South Africa. This spirit of co-operation between South Africa and SADC was by no means guaranteed. While most of the world rejoiced at the success of South Africa's elections earlier this year, the broader southern African community viewed the transition to democracy with mixed feelings. Although justifiably proud at their contribution to the overthrow of apartheid, many in the region feared that the African National Congress, once in power, might forget its debts, while South Africa's re-emergence on the global stage would divert much-needed aid and investment from its poorer neighbours. But, despite such concerns, the new South African government has placed regional co-operation at the forefront of its emerging foreign policy. In parliament two weeks ago, Mr Alfred Nzo, foreign minister, made clear that promoting good relations with other southern African states would be a priority. 'South Africa will actively encourage the movement to create a new form of political and economic interaction in southern Africa,' he said, while stressing his support for a new regional security mechanism that would complement SADC's economic activities. The new approach is a marked contrast to South Africa's previous policies. As the unquestioned regional superpower under former President PW Botha, the South African regime unabashedly used its economic and military might to prevent its black-run neighbours from successfully uniting in opposition to South Africa or helping to provide aid to the liberation movement. By helping to foment civil wars in Angola and Mozambique and showing little hesitation in launching cross-border military strikes to try to destroy ANC bases in other countries, South Africa garnered a well-deserved reputation as regional bully. It was in response to such activities that South Africa's neighbours formed SADC's precursor, the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC), in 1980. Despite its admirable aims, however, SADCC proved unable to meet its objective of reducing its members' trade with South Africa. Not only did nearly all its members actually expand their economic relationship with South Africa over the past decade; few of the organisation's initiatives to improve regional infrastructure yielded any fruit. Now, however, the situation has changed drastically. Recognising the wider impact of political change in South Africa, the body renamed itself SADC in 1992, changing its primary focus from opposition to South Africa to economic development. And, with South Africa now a fully integrated member, the organisation is optimistic that it will finally be able to succeed in its goals. Yesterday's SADC summit was preceded by a two-day meeting of regional trade ministers and it is through trade that the main thrust of economic development is planned. Recognising the need to establish competitive, export-oriented industries, SADC intends to devote itself to the establishment of a regional trade treaty which will ultimately allow the free movement of goods, services and capital across all member states. However, most of the region's economies maintain complex trade and tariff regulations which will take a long time to dismantle. In addition, the relative size of South Africa - it contributes over 75 per cent to a regional GDP of around Dollars 125bn (Pounds 80.6bn) - makes other countries nervous of being flooded with cheaper South African goods should all restrictions be removed. Thus many observers feel that any short-term benefits flowing from a restructured SADC are likely to be political rather than economic. 'I can't see SADC successfully turning itself into a free trade area in the immediate future, but there is significant potential for the grouping, under South African leadership, to play the role of regional peacemaker,' says Mr Chris Landsberg, a foreign policy specialist at Johannesburg's Centre for Policy Studies. Acknowledging this possibility, the Frontline States organisation (a political grouping comprising all SADC members except Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland and also originally designed to thwart South Africa) has decided to restructure itself into the political and security wing of SADC. It to play the role of mediator in regional conflicts. The scope for such activities has been demonstrated over the past week as SADC members have taken a stand to try to restore democracy to Lesotho after its king illegally dismissed the elected government. South African President Nelson Mandela has also played a role in helping to resolve remaining disagreements ahead of the planned Mozambican elections. Whether any of these initiatives, political or economic, prove successful remains to be seen. However the fact remains that, for the first time since most of SADC's members achieved independence, there is hope that, with South Africa at the forefront, the region might at last be able to reverse its economic decline.

0,FT924-5353 ,"FT924-5353 _AN-CK0B0ABFFT 921127   FT  27 NOV 92 / Aids, 'killer of the fittest', debilitates developing world / Review of a survey of the disease's economic impact      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   JUST OVER a decade after the world learned of an epidemic that echoes the Black Death of the Middle Ages, reliable statistics remain hard to obtain and evidence is sometimes anecdotal, but the consequences are becoming starker. Aids (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), the fatal condition that results from long-term infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), currently kills 100,000 people a year worldwide. But worst-hit are vulnerable economies of developing countries in general, and Africa in particular. In Uganda, the condition is inflicting a terrible toll on the country's railway corporation. Ten per cent of its employees may have died of Aids; labour turnover is 15 per cent a year. In Zambia, the country's copper mines, responsible for 75 per cent of the country's export earnings, are vulnerable: 'The danger is that skilled workers, supervisors and managers will die of Aids faster than replacements can be trained,' warns one expert. 'The result will not be a sudden collapse in mine output. Rather, there will be a slow but steady increase in the incidence of breakdowns, accidents and delays, and output will suffer.' From South Africa comes other ominous news. Life insurance companies paid Pounds 855,000 in Aids-related claims between 1985 and 1988. In 1989 alone, payments were Pounds 700,000. In Zimbabwe, claims in group life schemes of one insurance company doubled between 1986 and 1990, and the amount paid out multiplied 25-fold. And in Malawi a leading insurance company pulled out of the market when the government banned Aids test on applicants seeking cover. These examples come from an extensive survey of the possible impact of the disease on development by the Panos Institute, the independent London-based research body*. Although the study takes a global view, some of the most frightening statistics come from Africa. The World Health Organisation, drawing on a World Bank model, says that life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa could fall to 47 years by the end of the century, compared to 62 without the HIV/Aids factor. Unicef predicts that the under-five mortality rate in central and east Africa is likely to rise to between 159 and 189 per 1,000 live births, instead of dropping to 132. But Africa bears a double affliction - it has nearly half the world's HIV/Aids victims but the continent's economic crisis has left it almost bereft of the resources required to meet the challenge. In 1990, says the Panos report, the global cost of Aids treatment was estimated at between Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and Dollars 3.5bn - no more than 2 per cent of which was spent in sub-Saharan Africa. It is estimated that up to 12m adults are infected with HIV - one in 250 of the world's adult population. Over 80 per cent of cases in the developing world, and most of those infected, are between 14 and 44. By the end of the century the death toll is expected to be at least 400,000 a year. And by then at least 40m people, perhaps 100m, are expected to have been infected by HIV. The world faces other killers, some of which are readily preventable or curable. Malaria claims 1m lives a year; tuberculosis 3m, diarrhoeal disease 4m. But most of these deaths are among the vulnerable - the very young or the aged: the former are unproductive, and the latter have ceased production. Aids, however, threatens the development prospects of whole nations, the report points out, by primarily attacking men and women aged between 20 and 45, 'the backbone of the labour force'. Because HIV hits active young adults hardest, it could be described as 'the killer of the fittest'. As the epidemic advances, warns the report, to be published on Monday, the eve of World Aids Day, existing skills shortages will be exacerbated and new ones will be created. Productivity will be threatened: 'As the young sexually active members of the labour force (20-40) become infected, fewer will survive to form the older segment (40-60) which has accumulated skills.' The higher the income, the greater the opportunity for sexual activity. Thus a 1988 study in Zaire found that HIV infection rates in better educated and higher paid male workers was 5 per cent, compared with 3 per cent in the lower-graded categories. Further evidence comes from Zambia, where one sample revealed 8 per cent infection among urban adults with fewer than five years of schooling, rising to 33 per cent of those with 14 years or more. The picture is incomplete, the report acknowledges. Chapters on the implications for labour rely heavily on information from central and east Africa. Nevertheless, the impact of Aids may be as severe in other developing regions. 'Cash crop production may decline . . . labour costs rise as shortages develop, and employers may face spiralling medical costs,' warns Mr Jon Tinker, president of the institute, in his foreword to the 170-page study. No cure or vaccine is in sight, most experts agree. Part of the anti-Aids strategy, says Panos, should involve more money for prevention. It cites one calculation that suggests that Dollars 100m spent in anti-HIV/Aids activities in Thailand in 1991-92 could stop 3.5m people being infected and save Dollars 5.1bn in potential losses: 'Spending Dollars 1 now to save Dollars 51 later does sound like quite a good investment,' says Mr Tinker. But even if infection were to cease overnight, the challenges posed are enormous, warns Panos. The lengthy incubation period means that . . . the number of Aids cases would continue to grow over the next decade at an average of 10 per cent a year, a total of 40m by end of century - almost 90 per cent of them in the developing world. This means that planners must prepare to adapt, says Panos. In the agricultural sector it may mean less labour-intensive crops. The schooling systems must accommodate the special needs of a forecast 10m orphans; economic policies must take into account the changing age profile of the labour force. *The Hidden Cost of AIDS: the challenge of HIV to development, The Panos Institute, 9 White Lion Street, London N1 9PD Tel: (71) 278 1111, Pounds 9.95  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

Both companies emphasise their decisions are dictated by worldwide strategy, not by the recent political instability and economic downturn in Nigeria. But sales of their assets in UAC Nigeria and First Bank of Nigeria respectively coincide with low investor confidence in Nigeria's economy. Both cases underline the problems created by the 40 per cent statutory limit on foreign shareholdings in manufacturing, energy and banking companies in Nigeria. UAC evolved from a pioneer trading company in west Africa into Nigeria's largest manufacturing and distribution conglomerate, with the 60 per cent Nigerian-owned shares held by individual and institutional investors. Unilever will keep its 40 per cent share in UAC's Tractor  Equipment division (the Caterpillar dealership), which is to be a separate joint venture, and acquire all the shares in the consumer goods division. These and the cash from the sale of the rest of its shares will be re-invested in the newly formed Unilever Nigeria. Unilever's UAC holding was valued last December at about Dollars 46m at the official exchange rate of N22 to the dollar. Since then, the naira's parallel market rate has weakened from around N48 to N75. After tax, profits in 1993 came to N432.3m (Dollars 19.6m), an increase in naira terms from 1992 of 29 per cent, below the rates of inflation and devaluation. Inflation is running at nearly 70 per cent and the naira's sharp devaluation has eroded domestic demand and put pressure on profits. Standard Chartered agreed yesterday to reduce from 38 to 9.9 per cent its stake in First Bank of Nigeria, which last year was one of two quoted companies in Nigeria to make pre-tax profits over N1bn. The shares will be sold via a public offer beginning next month. Last year's privatisation of the Nigerian government's majority stake made Standard Chartered the biggest shareholder, but did not allow it to acquire a controlling interest. Under UK law this made the group responsible to the Bank of England for the management of the bank although it lacked a controlling interest, unless it cut its stake to less than 10 per cent. The sale of the government's majority holding in Nigeria's other leading commercial bank, United Bank for Africa, to Nigerian private investors has made another foreign bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, the largest shareholder without a controlling stake.

AFRICA SKIRTS THE SANCTIONS;    WHEN IS A STEEL GIRDER NOT STEEL? WHEN IT COMES FROM SOUTH AFRICA. SOME IN  CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES.      By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HOUSTON      To some, the case of the South African steel seems to defy logic.    At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed  by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa.    Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel  since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in  1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush  Administration.    As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But  girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed  from the steel mill. In the language of government, a ""substantial  transformation"" had taken place.    ""The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid)  act,"" explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity.    While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to  others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt  the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto.    The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit  importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and  agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South  African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be  exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions.    Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel  products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are  undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.    Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles,  are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to  trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting  there anyway.    A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United  States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the  law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by  so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls  or partly owns.    At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of  methods, including ""laundering"" shipments through other countries, as a way of  moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed  trade embargoes.    The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations  subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D. Dingell  (D-Mich.), the chairman, in a letter to then acting U.S. Customs Commissioner  Michael Lane, complained that the government ""appears still to be accepting the  most outrageous legal arguments of steel importers rather than trying to assess  the clear intent of Congress. . . .""    The legislation states that ""no iron or steel produced, or iron ore extracted,  in South Africa may be imported into the United States.""    The task of enforcing the law fell to the Office of Foreign Assets Control at  the Treasury Department, which identifies only 15 items as iron or steel  products.    A Treasury official argued that the list did indeed satisfy the intent of the  law and, in fact, may have gone beyond it by including items such as wire  products. Others, however, disagree with that interpretation.    ""The law absolutely bans all iron and steel from South Africa after Dec. 31,  1986,"" said Rep. John Bryant, (D-Tex.), who has become one of the major  proponents of broadening the sanctions.    Taking the 'Low Road'    Another who considers the interpretation to be too narrow is Gay McDougall,  director of the South Africa Project of the Washington-based Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law.    ""The (Reagan) Administration was on the record as being against these  sanctions,"" she said. ""Clearly, they took the low road in terms of enforcement  and implementation. They have taken the narrowest interpretation of the embargo  possible, and they haven't taken all the steps to fully implement it.""    Import figures show that the sanctions have had some effect, but by no means  have closed off trade with South Africa. In 1986, the year before the embargo,  the United States imported $301-million worth of iron and steel from South  Africa and, overall, imported goods worth more than $2.3 billion from that  country. In the following two years, more than $353.6-million worth of iron and  steel have been imported from South Africa, according to the U.S. Department of  Commerce.    Billions in Imports    The Bureau of the Census reported that since the beginning of 1987, more than  11,000 tons of goods categorized as ""other steel products"" have been imported  from South Africa.    In 1988, iron and steel ranked as the fourth-largest category of imports from  South Africa to the United States, according to Commerce Department statistics.  During that year, the last for which the Commerce Department had figures, the  United States imported more than $1.5-billion worth of goods from South Africa.    The figures are assumed to be conservative, since they do not count goods  transshipped through other nations.    Last April, for instance, Timothy Zwane, principal secretary for commerce,  industry and tourism in Swaziland, complained that South African firms were  using false documents to export goods as Swazi products. He cited as an example  a shipment of 50 tons of cut flowers, said to have originated in Swaziland,  that were exported to Europe, where sanctions against South Africa are also in  force. The only problem was that Swaziland produces nowhere near that amount of  flowers. He also pointed out that Swaziland does not grow apples, pears or  grapes.    ""Yet we constantly find, when we travel around (that) people talk about  Swaziland apples, pears and grapes,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Of course, we  are surprised.""    In another case, a U.S. Customs official described how an ostrich egg laid in  South Africa was transferred to another country, where it was hatched, and the  chick eventually was shipped to the United States. It was considered a legal  import because the chick was not hatched in South Africa. The same official  described how South African rock lobsters are allowed into the United States  because they are processed and shipped on vessels registered to another  country.    Last March, a former South African bank manager told a House subcommittee that  a number of European banks were using their New York offices to disguise South  African transactions, including some prohibited by the sanctions. Terry  Crawford-Browne, now an adviser to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, said he could not  document his allegations, but that his past banking experience led him to  believe this was occurring.    The United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations said in a report in  July that South Africa had responded to the sanctions by developing what is  widely known as ""unconventional trade.""    The report described a raft of methods used to get around the sanctions, from  simple mislabeling to transshipment through several countries. One example: A  chain of private trading companies passes formal title to the goods among  themselves until the real owner and destination are impossible to detect.    ""This is intended to confuse or deter monitoring through sheer complexity,"" the  report said. ""Invariably, the actual movement of the goods is much more direct.  In monitoring oil shipments to South Africa it has been observed that, whereas  the tanker sails directly from the port of loading to South Africa, title to  the cargo may change hands 10 to 15 times among traders and brokers in a number  of different countries.""    'Dutch Blend' Coal    The report also explained how South Africa ships coal to places where it is not  banned. It mentioned Rotterdam and Antwerp. The South African coal is then  mixed with shipments from other locales to obscure the coal's origin. In the  parlance of trade, the Rotterdam product is known as ""Dutch blend.""    Given the lax U.S. enforcement, many South African products need not take such  circuitous routes to reach America, McDougall of the South Africa Project said.  In the project's 135-page report last year, for example, McDougall was highly  critical of the Treasury Department's definition of uranium products covered by  the sanctions. While uranium and uranium oxide are banned, uranium hexafluoride  is not. Thus, she said, only uranium in its beginning and finished forms are  banned, while the products of interim processing may be imported and then  easily transformed.    ""The Treasury Department's interpretation permits easy circumvention of the  sanction,"" the report said.    Last August, a report of the General Accounting Office -- the investigative arm  of the Congress -- said that sanctions against South Africa had been enforced  only partially because the State Department never gave Customs a detailed list  of parastatal products. It had only identified the parastatal companies.    Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) one of the most ardent foes of South Africa's  white minority government, described the GAO's findings as showing a ""shocking  lapse by top Reagan Administration officials, who failed to apply elementary  enforcement procedures in carrying out the anti-apartheid laws.""    The whole question of sanctions is a tricky and controversial one that is  further complicated by the fact that the 1986 provisions were the first in  modern times enacted by the Congress rather than the President.    The Reagan Administration deemed sanctions to be counterproductive in any  effort to get the South African government to end its minority rule. But when  Congress overrode Reagan's veto, it did so in very selective fashion, with the  announced intent of hurting just the South African government's tax base, not  the citizenry.    As a result, the imports section specified only textiles, agricultural  products, iron and steel, coal and uranium and any article grown or produced,  manufactured or exported by a parastatal. It was not until 1987 that gold,  which accounts for about 45% of South Africa's export revenues, came under the  sanctions. At that time gold was defined as a parastatal product, the  government entity being the South African Reserve Bank.    Recently, Herman Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, was  quoted as saying that the sanctions have been ""effective in bringing about new  thinking in Pretoria.""    McDougall and others say that the sanctions would be far more effective if they  were of the blanket variety imposed in the past against Libya, North Vietnam,  North Korea and other nations.    Others, including South African officials and many white South Africans who  oppose apartheid, follow the Reagan line of thinking. They say the U.S.  sanctions are hitting labor-intensive industries such as farming and coal  mining, and thus hurting the black South African labor force.    From that standpoint, ""the sanctions have been a complete failure,"" said  Michael Johns, a South African specialist at the conservative, Washington-based  Heritage Foundation.    The GAO, in a report released last month, addressed the question of whether  further restrictions on gold might be feasible. The conclusions were mixed, but  the report did point out that while gold is banned, much of it comes into the  United States anyway, as Italian jewelry.    The reason is that South Africa markets most of its gold through Britain and  Switzerland, and those countries then redistribute it. Almost all of the gold  that goes to Italy, the world's leading consumer, is made into jewelry, which  is then marketed around the world. The GAO said that 91% of all gold entering  Italy comes from South Africa.    Meanwhile, a member of the House oversight subcommittee said that hearings on  the importation of South African steel and steel products should begin in the  next several weeks, and that Treasury and Customs officials will be called to  explain their rationale on the importation of girders for the Texas bridge.    Rep. Bryant has sent the Treasury Department a letter requesting details of all  transactions in which iron and steel have been allowed into the United States  since the embargoes were imposed in 1986.    An aide to Sen. Kennedy said that an effort to tighten the sanctions will be  made during this session of Congress. (The House last year passed a bill to  widen the sanctions, but it did not make it to the Senate floor before the end  of that session.)    ""There are a lot of loopholes we've got to close,"" he said. ""We didn't cover a  lot of things.""      Photo, Main span of bridge that will replace a tunnel at Baytown, Tex., near  Houston, will be built with steel girders made in South Africa although  anti-apartheid sanctions ban steel from that country.

AFRICA SKIRTS THE SANCTIONS;    WHEN IS A STEEL GIRDER NOT STEEL? WHEN IT COMES FROM SOUTH AFRICA. SOME IN  CONGRESS ARE WORKING TO CLOSE THE LOOPHOLES.      By J. MICHAEL KENNEDY, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HOUSTON      To some, the case of the South African steel seems to defy logic.    At the Houston Ship Channel, a $91-million bridge -- the largest ever financed  by the state -- is being built with steel girders produced in South Africa.    Never mind that there has been a ban on the importation of South African steel  since the United States imposed economic sanctions to protest apartheid in  1986. The bridge project is perfectly legal -- at least in the eyes of the Bush  Administration.    As the law is being interpreted, South African steel is, indeed, banned. But  girders are allowed in because they are a fabricated product one step removed  from the steel mill. In the language of government, a ""substantial  transformation"" had taken place.    ""The plain and simple answer is that it is not covered by the (anti-apartheid)  act,"" explained one Treasury Department official who requested anonymity.    While the distinction may be clear to Administration officials, it is not to  others. Critics accuse federal officials of splitting hairs in order to skirt  the sanctions, which Congress passed over President Ronald Reagan's veto.    The sanctions, which were not intended to be comprehensive, prohibit  importation of several South African goods, including iron, steel and  agricultural products and anything produced by companies in which the South  African government has a stake. The law also placed restrictions on what may be  exported to South Africa, as well as financial transactions.    Several members of Congress charge that the importing of South African steel  products illustrates how the Reagan and now Bush Administrations are  undermining the spirit, if not the letter, of the law.    Millions of dollars of banned South African goods, from lobsters to textiles,  are coming into the United States despite the sanctions. And, according to  trade experts, American goods banned for export to South Africa are getting  there anyway.    A common theme of critics is that many goods are allowed to enter the United  States because of the U.S. Treasury Department's narrow interpretation of the  law and the failure of the State Department to identify products made by  so-called parastatals -- companies the South African government either controls  or partly owns.    At the same time, South African businessmen are said to use a number of  methods, including ""laundering"" shipments through other countries, as a way of  moving products into the United States and other countries that have imposed  trade embargoes.    The House Trade and Commerce Committee's oversight and investigations  subcommittee has begun an inquiry into the steel imports. Rep. John D.

African Situation""]    [Text] Johannesburg, April 19 (XINHUA) -- The Inkatha  Freedom Party (IFP) decided today to participate in the April  26-28 elections in South Africa.    The decision was announced by South African President  Frederick Willem de Klerk in Pretoria today after talks among  himself, African National Congress (ANC) President Nelson  Mandela and IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi.    Observers here believe the IFP's decision to participate in  the poll is of great importance to the current situation in  South Africa.    The ruling National Party, ANC and IFP are the three largest  political parties in South Africa. It is estimated that the  three parties are able to obtain more than 85 percent votes in  the elections.    The IFP itself boasts of the support from the majority of  Zulus which are the biggest tribe among the black people in  South Africa. The IFP has a strong base within the Kwazulu  Homeland.    The IFP stood for the establishment of a federal or  con-federal state for future South Africa and therefore opposed  the 1993 interim constitution drafted by the multi-party  negttiations and adopted by the parliament.    The IFP registered for the elections early March, but later  asked for the postponement of the elections and refused to  submit its candidates for the elections.    Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and six other  foreign mediators came to South Africa on April 12 in an attempt  to help solve the constitutional differences between the ANC and  IFP, but failed.    Supporters of the ANC and IFP clashed time and again since  1986, bringing the death toll to more than 10,000. The  violence has been escalating since the beginning of this year.  More than 300 people died of violence monthly.    De Klerk, Mandela and Buthelezi signed a memorandum of  agreement for reconciliation and peace today after their talks  in Pretoria.    The memorandum said the three parties ""reject violence and  will therefore do everything in their power to ensure free and  fair, elections throughout the Republic of South Africa.""    In a joint statement the three leaders appealed to their  followers and to all South Africans to end violence, to exercise  maximum restraint and to pursue their objectives by peaceful  means.    The IFP decision and the signing of the memorandum will  greatly reduce the violence raging in South Africa.    The Zulus, accounting for more than twenty percent of the  total South African people, are taking part in the elections.  This means a great change in the elections in South Africa.    Buthelezi said at a press conference today ""South Africans  may well have been saved from the disastrous consequences of  unimaginable proportions.""    Mandela said the memorandum of agreement is ""a leap forward""  for peace, reconcilation and an inclusive election process.""    ""IFP's participation in the poll deserves the support of all  leaders and of all those who love South Africa,"" Mandela stated.     "
0," LA071990-0180   249561    July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 18; Column 1; National Desk      1256 words      'THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT' STILL CAST THEIR GLOW ON PRESIDENT'S APPROACH      By STANLEY MEISLER and SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITERS      WASHINGTON      Shortly before his inauguration, President-elect George Bush told television  interviewer Barbara Walters that, in a time of tight financial resources, ""I  won't be able to match the highest bidder on federal funds for education, or  federal funds for drug rehabilitation, or federal funds for the homeless,  whatever it is.    ""But does that mean I don't care?"" Bush went on. ""No. It doesn't.""    In 18 months as President, Bush has kept steadfastly to that theme and image:  He is a caring President hamstrung by his budget. For the most part, he has  delivered a moderate message outlining the dimensions of many of the problems  generated by the crisis of poverty. But his words have not matched federal  action.    There have been some exceptions. He has increased the federal budget  substantially in the war on drugs, for example, and he has proposed a  significant increase in the funding of the popular Head Start program. But his  critics insist that his drug funds are misdirected -- more for the hunt of  criminals than the treatment of addicts -- and that his Head Start increase,  though welcome, is far less than needed.    Bush has recognized the existence of a gap between what is needed and what his  government will spend but has contended that this gap can be filled by private  Americans who offer their time and money to the needy -- the ""thousand points  of light"" of his electoral campaign. The President describes his role as mainly  one of encouragement.    ""We are deeply moved by the plight of those who lack the skills that most of us  . . . simply take for granted,"" he told the National Federation of Republican  Women in Baltimore last October. ""And rest assured, we're going to continue to  work with you, those of you out there on the cutting edge, to promote literacy  skills.""    Here are some of the President's views about poverty and homelessness in  America:     ""My problem is that the best answer to poverty is a job, and the best way you  have a job is to have a strong economy. And so you have to get the deficit  down, and that's where, under the law, I'm required to do it. So I'll keep  fighting for that.""     -- In reply to questions at John F. Kennedy High School, Denver, Dec. 8, 1989.    ""The best poverty program is a job in the private sector, where a family can  hold their heads up high with a certain dignity. . . .    ""When these mandated benefits (bills) come down here, they have good titles on  them, they have things we're concerned about: parental leave or child care,  whatever it is. And I am sympathetic with many of the objectives. But as I  weigh them, I have a responsibility to say what kind of an effect are they  going to have on this best antidote to poverty and that's a job. And so, we've  got to resist some of the call for these good things that have good titles if  they undermine the fundamental thing, which is our ability to create jobs.""     -- Talk with visitors to the White House, April 4, 1989.     ""The truth is there is no better housing policy than a growing economy. And  we've got one, one that provides jobs and wages and opportunities for  advancement, long-term interest rates that open ownership opportunities to  hundreds of thousands of first-time home-buyers. . . .    ""No child in America should have to grow up in the streets, and every family in  America should have a roof over its head. We've got to do better. . . .    ""But the real answer for the homeless, those with mental problems or dependent  on drugs or alcohol, is shelter plus care. Shelter, supplemented by the  necessary support services to get these people the help they need to live in  dignity. And that means a partnership, a combined federal, state and local  effort to supply the funding and other resources that constitute a  comprehensive solution for the hard-core homeless.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of Realtors, Nov. 10, 1989.    ""Speaking of tenants in public housing, they deserve something else: a safe  place to raise their children and live their lives. And so, I ordered an  additional $50 million to HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) the  other day to evict the drug dealers from public housing. Let's give these kids  a fighting chance.""     -- Remarks to visitors at the White House, Sept. 8, 1990.    ""One thing we can't afford is to fall behind the competition when it comes to  training the educated work force that future challenges will require.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges,  Nov. 21, 1989.    ""The fact is that we spend more per capita than many of our toughest  competitors. And as a nation, we devote more than $300 billion a year to  educating our children. And that's not stingy; it's staggering. . . .    ""We can't have a world-class economy with second-class schools.""     -- Remarks at annual meeting of the Business Roundtable, June 5, 1989.    ""We must revitalize our schools so that a solid education is once again the  birthright of every American kid.

""But does that mean I don't care?"" Bush went on. ""No. It doesn't.""    In 18 months as President, Bush has kept steadfastly to that theme and image:  He is a caring President hamstrung by his budget. For the most part, he has  delivered a moderate message outlining the dimensions of many of the problems  generated by the crisis of poverty. But his words have not matched federal  action.    There have been some exceptions. He has increased the federal budget  substantially in the war on drugs, for example, and he has proposed a  significant increase in the funding of the popular Head Start program. But his  critics insist that his drug funds are misdirected -- more for the hunt of  criminals than the treatment of addicts -- and that his Head Start increase,  though welcome, is far less than needed.    Bush has recognized the existence of a gap between what is needed and what his  government will spend but has contended that this gap can be filled by private  Americans who offer their time and money to the needy -- the ""thousand points  of light"" of his electoral campaign. The President describes his role as mainly  one of encouragement.    ""We are deeply moved by the plight of those who lack the skills that most of us  . . . simply take for granted,"" he told the National Federation of Republican  Women in Baltimore last October. ""And rest assured, we're going to continue to  work with you, those of you out there on the cutting edge, to promote literacy  skills.""    Here are some of the President's views about poverty and homelessness in  America:     ""My problem is that the best answer to poverty is a job, and the best way you  have a job is to have a strong economy. And so you have to get the deficit  down, and that's where, under the law, I'm required to do it. So I'll keep  fighting for that.""     -- In reply to questions at John F. Kennedy High School, Denver, Dec. 8, 1989.    ""The best poverty program is a job in the private sector, where a family can  hold their heads up high with a certain dignity. . . .    ""When these mandated benefits (bills) come down here, they have good titles on  them, they have things we're concerned about: parental leave or child care,  whatever it is. And I am sympathetic with many of the objectives. But as I  weigh them, I have a responsibility to say what kind of an effect are they  going to have on this best antidote to poverty and that's a job. And so, we've  got to resist some of the call for these good things that have good titles if  they undermine the fundamental thing, which is our ability to create jobs.""     -- Talk with visitors to the White House, April 4, 1989.     ""The truth is there is no better housing policy than a growing economy. And  we've got one, one that provides jobs and wages and opportunities for  advancement, long-term interest rates that open ownership opportunities to  hundreds of thousands of first-time home-buyers. . . .    ""No child in America should have to grow up in the streets, and every family in  America should have a roof over its head. We've got to do better. . . .    ""But the real answer for the homeless, those with mental problems or dependent  on drugs or alcohol, is shelter plus care. Shelter, supplemented by the  necessary support services to get these people the help they need to live in  dignity. And that means a partnership, a combined federal, state and local  effort to supply the funding and other resources that constitute a  comprehensive solution for the hard-core homeless.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of Realtors, Nov. 10, 1989.    ""Speaking of tenants in public housing, they deserve something else: a safe  place to raise their children and live their lives. And so, I ordered an  additional $50 million to HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development) the  other day to evict the drug dealers from public housing. Let's give these kids  a fighting chance.""     -- Remarks to visitors at the White House, Sept. 8, 1990.    ""One thing we can't afford is to fall behind the competition when it comes to  training the educated work force that future challenges will require.""     -- Speech to the National Assn. of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges,  Nov. 21, 1989.    ""The fact is that we spend more per capita than many of our toughest  competitors. And as a nation, we devote more than $300 billion a year to  educating our children.

In an interview with our reporters Mr. Botha said South  Africa will never recognize any government taken by force in  Lesotho. He said he had come to Lesotho to establish the nature  of the fracas within the Lesotho armed forces, but not to  dictate terms to the Lesotho Government. Mr. Botha said after  consultations with the Lesotho authorities he was assured that  the military problem will be solved peacefully.     "

PTA, whose full name is Eastern and Southern Africa Trade and Development Bank, was set up in 1985 and has 14 shareholders including the African Development Bank, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Mauritius and Burundi, where the bank is located. Today's issuance will be drawn from its Dollars 500m CP programme which is fully backed by a cash collateral account held in Bermuda. The programme is designed to protect CP holders from African risk, said Mr Francis Daniels, a senior adviser at Aidoo Group, a New York-based financial advisory group specialising in representing African governments and companies. Although PTA Bank is unrated, the structure of the programme has enabled it to secure a CP rating of A-1 plus from Standard  Poor's and F-1 plus from Fitch. Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch are the dealers for the programme. The proceeds will be used to support the bank's trade loans. The move towards democracy in South Africa has turned international investor attention to Africa but the depth of interest is far from clear. Earlier this year, a structured bond issue for the Republic of the Congo intended to raise Dollars 600m from international investors, had to be re-vamped and relaunched due to lack of demand for the original deal.

It will attend the  inauguration ceremony of Nelson Mandela, the new president of  South Africa, which will take place on 10 May.    At Jan Smuts airport near Johannesburg, Shumeyko made the  following statement:    ""A solemn and joyful event in the life of South Africa --  the  inauguration of the first democratically elected president of  the country -- has brought this Russian delegation to South  Africa.    ""As is known, Russia has made a weighty contribution to the  cause of dismantling apartheid and ensuring a political  settlement in the RSA. In the fight against the system of  apartheid and in the process of establishing a negotiating  process, we developed close friendly relations with the  constructive forces in South Africa, which are now widely  represented in the leadership of South Africa. We intend to  maintain and strengthen these relations.    ""The RSA and Russia are experiencing a similar period of  renewal, a period of seeking the ways of future development  while overcoming the old mentality and difficulties of adapting  to the new realities. Who, therefore, is better qualified than  we are to better understand each other's problems and mutually  make use of the accumulated positive experience of social  reformation.""    The similarity of approach to many aspects of world politics  paves the way to partnership in international relations. Russia  maintains that the new South Africa must enter the world  community and its international bodies as an equal participant,  and that all remaining sanctions against it should be lifted  without delay. We are prepared to help South Africa in this  matter.    The delegation also brought a personal message from  President  Boris Yeltsin to President Nelson Mandela, congratulating him  and stating that the Russian leadership and all Russia's  citizens are ready to further promote bilateral cooperation with  the RSA in all areas, which would benefit both democratic Russia  and South Africa in the name of peace and prosperity.""    In an ITAR-TASS interview, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  the RSA used to be associated mainly with apartheid. Now when  the democratic processes have begun in that country, just as  they have been in Russia, the whole world wishes it success on  this path.    Speaking of bilateral relations, the head of the Russian  Federation delegation said they are not beginning from scratch.  Since the sanctions against the RSA were lifted, many  cooperation opportunities in various fields have opened up  between the two countries that are building democracy.  Interparliamentary relations are of considerable importance.  Our countries have similar legislature in the economic sphere,  and this makes our contacts much easier. We hope that from the  outset we will start moving toward legislation that will take  into account the interests of each partner.     "

The idea of the Algebra Project and math literacy is just the entering wedge to  the question of ""the economic and political arrangements being made as we shift  from an industrial base to a high-tech base."" Blacks have to pay attention to  this shift, he says.    ""In the '60s, things began to center around the question of the right to vote.  It built over a number of years, and then finally mobilized enough of the  society to make a dent, do something. People began to see voting as a  fundamental issue, and that released a lot of energy. We may see a similar  thing soon with children, inner-city children, and their development.""

As you know, some significant parties are  not on board and we're trying to get them on board. Our meeting  with Mr. Nelson Mandela will also focus on the state of  negotiations. We also focused on the European Union's  relationship to a new South Africa, the role it could play in  ensuring that this first chapter of the new South Africa will be  a very successful one; focused on how we could expand and the  necessity for expansion of bilateral relationships in the sphere  of trade and industry. I welcome the establishment of a  cooperative organization between the private sector of Ireland  and the private sector of South Africa. We welcome the  establishment of full diplomatic relations.    By and large, may I say that we hope that also this visit  will contribute towards good cooperation between us in South  Africa, those in charge of the election -- the Independent  Electoral Commission, the government and other parties, and the  teams of international observers that we expect here to be  vastly expanded as we come nearer to the election.

The full text of the message follows:    To the OAU summit:    On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU  summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf  of the Chinese Government and people.    The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its  president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d  OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by  the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing  the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African  continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has  added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to  seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also  ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We  wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes  in their struggle to defend national independence and  sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and  improve living conditions.    We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community  Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of  Africa's economic integration is of great significance to  African people's revitalization of the African economy through a  collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and  determination of African countries and people to become united  and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international  environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire  their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the  African people's collective efforts in the economic field will  succeed.    With the changing international situation, it has become  more  and more important to maintain political stability in African  countries so as to facilitate their economic development.  Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in  particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the  economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the  international community. We firmly support the OAU in its  efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain  political and social stability in African countries.    A profound friendship has been forged between China and  African nations during long, common struggles. Under the  present complex international situation, we should even more  sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts  to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The  Chinese Government and people treasure very much the  Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and  cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the  foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how  international situation changes.    I am convinced that the current summit will certainly  achieve  its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty  missions assigned by African nations and people.

President Zafy warmly welcomed Qian Qichen. He said: The  current visit will surely further enhance the development of  friendly and cooperative ties between the two countries.    Qian Qichen said: Sino-Malagasy relations have a sound  foundation. The Chinese and Malagasy Governments will make  joint efforts to continuously consolidate and develop the  friendship between the peoples of the two countries and push  forward the development of bilateral economic and technological  cooperation.    Qian Qichen conveyed President Jiang Zemin's cordial regards  and good wishes to President Zafy. He said: President Jiang  looks forward to President Zafy's visit to China this year.    President Zafy pointed out: Madagascar and China have many  points in common. The Malagasy Government highly treasures our  friendly ties with China.    Touching on the situation in Africa, Qian Qichen said: The  process of decolonization in Africa has taken nearly half a  century. Currently, the African nations are still in a stage of  exploring how to develop their own economies. He stressed: The  practice of China's construction has proven that one cannot gain  success by indiscriminately copying and imitating the  experiences of other countries. The important thing is to  proceed from the realities of your own country, combine them  with and draw from the experiences of other countries, while  seeking your own path of development.    President Zafy endorsed Qian Qichen's views. He said: The  African people are increasingly aware of the importance of  acting independently and having the initiative in their own  hands, and of relying on themselves to develop their countries.  Notwithstanding that presently Africa has encountered  difficulties, it has its own superiorities.    Earlier on, Malagasy speaker Andriamahazo met with Qian  Qichen, and both sides exchanged views on how to further  strengthen contacts between the national assemblies of the two  countries.

0,FT924-2991 ,"FT924-2991 _AN-CLJCGABHFT 921210   FT  10 DEC 92 / Fuel for the fire in Moslem hearts: Stefan Wagstyl on frustrations ignited by the assault on Ayodhya      By STEFAN WAGSTYL   SYED Abdullah Bukhari, the imam of Delhi's largest mosque and the white-bearded patriarch of India's Moslems, sympathises with those Moslems who have taken to the streets in violent protest throughout India in reaction to the assault on the mosque in Ayodhya. 'They have fire in their chests,' he said yesterday. 'The destruction of a mosque is like killing a human being. They are right to be angry.' The imam also approved of the actions of his 40-year-old son and potential successor, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, who had just been arrested for the second time in two days for trying to lead a protest march to the prime minister's home in defiance of a police curfew. Ayodhya has stirred the passions of Indian Moslems more than anything since hundreds of thousands of people died in the riots which accompanied partition in 1947. At least 700 people have died since the mosque was destroyed on Sunday - most of them Moslems killed by police fire. Moslems are angry not just with the Hindu militants who pulled down the 16th century shrine but with the government for allowing the destruction to happen. 'This is the greatest disaster India's Moslems have faced,' says Mr Ebrahim Suleiman Sait, president of the India Union Moslem League, the leading Moslem political organisation. Anger is one thing. Action is another. Moslems have taken to the streets in the past - as recently as two years ago a partial assault on the Ayodhya mosque also prompted nationwide riots. But violence has rarely brought India's Moslems any benefits because it has rarely been followed by any concrete political action. For a community of 120m people, some 13 per cent of the population, India's Moslems have been singularly unable to assert themselves. Mr M J Akbar, a leading Moslem journalist and a former MP, says he would like to think that Ayodhya might be a big enough shock to provoke Moslems into sustained political action. But he doubts it. 'India's Moslems have a ghetto mentality.' It is not hard to find the causes of Moslems' political failure or their frustration. Hardly any large enterprises are in Moslem hands. Moslems account for less than 2 per cent of those passing senior civil service exams and only about 2 per cent of bank executives. Moslem literacy rates are officially estimated to be around 42 per cent, against a national figure of 52 per cent, though some Moslem educationalists put the Moslem figure as low as 25 per cent. Moreover, burdened by poverty and ignorance, Moslems have been unable to resolve their basic dilemma - how far they want to compete in mainstream Indian life and how much they want to assert a separate identity. Many Moslems believe the roots of their weaknesses go back to the partition when the cream of India's Moslems fled to Pakistan, including most of the political leadership. Those who stayed behind learnt through the bloody partition riots to keep their heads down. Moslems claim they suffer discrimination from the Hindu majority, in particular in schools and at work. But they also acknowledge that they are themselves partly to blame for what is probably their biggest weakness - the lack of education. Moslem clerics have been slow to promote schooling, except for Islamic studies, and especially for girls. In the large cities, life is slowly changing for those Moslems who have been able to secure middle-class jobs. Some have managed to get rich by working in the Gulf states on contracts. They and their children are able to enter mainstream Indian life - sometimes to the disgust of more traditional Moslems. But for the majority, poverty is the rule. As Mr Akbar says: 'The fundamental problem is the lack a strong Moslem middle class.' Without such a force, Moslems' role in politics will necessarily be limited. Until the late 1970s, Moslems generally supported the ruling Congress (I) party, mainly because it was in power. Moslems were guaranteed some important privileges - such as the right to enforce Moslem family law. However, in the 1980s, Moslems drifted in increasing disillusionment to middle-of-the-road secularist parties, such as Janata Dal. This helped to open the way for the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, which spearheaded the movement against the Ayodhya mosque. The BJP won a string of electoral successes in the late 1980s. Until last weekend, Moslems were steadily drifting back to Congress (I). Whether their anger at the government's failure to prevent the mosque's destruction will overcome their fear of further BJP gains is hard to say. Either way, Moslems will be unable to assert themselves at the ballot box. So it is scarcely surprising that their young men riot in the streets. And that even as moderate a man as Syed Abdullah Bukhari refuses to condemn them.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

In this afternoon's meeting with the team of reporters who  accompanied him to the Mandela ceremonies, the Cuban president  described the South African president's election as an enormous  victory for the people of South Africa and for the world's  progressive forces.    It is a rebirth and proof that great victories can be  achieved in the wake of international disasters which have  occurred in the unipolar world in which we now live, Fidel  Castro said.    Asked by PRENSA LATINA about possibilities for cooperation  with the new South African Government, Cuba's top leader said:  ""There are few countries that have the fraternal links that we  share with South Africa.""    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    Regarding his first visit to this country, which a few years  ago was Cuba's battlefield enemy, Castro said: ""We were treated  very respectfully by all sectors of society, not only from the  ANC [African National Congress], but also from the Indian,  white, and mestizo sectors, taking into account that this is a  multiracial country in which millions of people feel the need to  cooperate with one another.""    There are two South Africas, the Cuban president said. At  various occasions in South African history, there were times of  violent clashes, but now there is a new South Africa in which  there is peace, respect, and affection toward Cuba.    Castro believes the ANC government has a very difficult task  ahead of it, because ""even though it is a relatively developed  country, there is a huge population that has lived for a long  time under apartheid, and it has the needs and yearnings of a  majority which has been discriminated against.""    When referring to his first visit to this southern African  nation, Fidel Castro said, ""with few countries do we have such  heart-felt and fraternal ties as those we have cultivated over  so many years with South Africa and the ANC. [no closing  quotation marks as received]    Every time one speaks to a South African, one first notices  the great spiritual possibilities that exist, Castro said.    In discussing diplomatic relations, Castro said, ""We should  consider them when it is right for them, at an opportune  moment."" Cuba will be very honored to develop its relations  with South Africa, he said.    I see evolving events in this country as something  marvelous,  and my greatest wish is that this country achieves peace and  harmony, something we all must contribute to enable the efforts  and sacrifices made by this a country to serve as a model for  the entire world, the Cuban leader underscored.    Regarding today's swearing-in ceremony, which was witnessed  by more than 5,000 South Africans at the Union Building  amphitheater, Castro said: ""The coming together of all South  Africans and all ethnic groups was beautiful. We hope that the  process continues to progress in this direction.""    Today in South Africa, we helped bury apartheid and assisted  in the birth of liberty, Fidel Castro said.    This is the first time that a high-ranking official Cuban  delegation has stepped onto South African soil.    Both countries faced each other on the battlefield between  1976-91, when Cuban troops went to assist Angola at their  request, to safeguard its independence and territory, which had  been threatened by military forces backed by the racist Pretoria  regime.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his  airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held  in his honor.    This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia,  which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday.    During the week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet  Mandela in Namibia and then call on South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk  in Cape Town. Mandela acknowledged that the ANC had tried to discourage Baker  from visiting South Africa and that Mandela had refused to see him here.    ""If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him,"" Mandela  said Saturday. ""But I will not see him in South Africa.""    ""A high-profile visit"" to South Africa ""can result in a lot of confusion,""  Mandela said. ""It would suggest that President De Klerk has done something  positive, something fundamental that requires the world to review sanctions.""  The ANC has welcomed De Klerk's initiatives but says they fall short of  creating a climate for negotiations.    Mandela also said Saturday that the ANC has chosen him to lead its delegation  for the first official meetings with De Klerk and his white minority-led  government in Cape Town on April 11.    He declined to discuss what might be on the agenda. But he reiterated the ANC's  position that its preconditions for negotiation -- amnesty for returning  exiles, release of political prisoners and ending the state of emergency --  ""are the minimum conditions"" for ANC participation in government-sponsored  talks on a new constitution that would give the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a  reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency.

Mandela, facing pressure to end the growing black unrest in South  Africa's townships, returned home Saturday after a three-week foreign journey  and promised that his organization would devise a strategy to deal with the  problem and ""go into action"" soon.    But Mandela, 71-year-old deputy president of the African National Congress,  blamed the government for the escalating unrest, which has broken out  sporadically over a variety of issues and claimed 300 lives in the past month  in nominally independent ethnic homelands as well as in South African urban  townships.    ""Those who are worried about violence must talk to the government (and urge it)  to create conditions where peaceful forms of agitation are possible,"" Mandela,  flanked by his wife, Winnie, and colleague, Walter Sisulu, told a news  conference. He added that the trouble ""indicates the rejection by the masses of  the people"" of the government's policy of apartheid and its system of so-called  independent homelands for blacks.    Since Mandela left the country Feb. 27 for a trip to Zambia, Zimbabwe,  Tanzania, Ethiopia and Sweden, the autocratic leader of the Ciskei homeland has  been toppled by a popular military coup that prompted celebrations and two days  of rioting. A few days later, rioting in the homeland of Bophuthatswana erupted  during a march calling for the territory to be reintegrated into South Africa  in time for Bophuthatswanans to participate in the talks for a new South  African constitution.    Violence also has rocked black townships near Johannesburg. Warring black taxi  drivers in Katlehong have caused thousands to flee that township, and three  people died Thursday night when rumors swept the township of Sebokeng that  armed black attackers were poised to invade.    Mandela, who was appointed deputy president of the ANC during his stop in  Zambia, returned to South Africa from Sweden, where he spent a week thanking  the Stockholm government, the ANC's most generous overseas supporter, and  meeting with ailing ANC President Oliver R. Tambo. He was escorted from his  airport news conference here to a daylong concert by South African artists held  in his honor.    This week, Mandela is scheduled to attend independence celebrations in Namibia,  which formally ends 75 years of South African colonial rule Wednesday.    During the week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet  Mandela in Namibia and then call on South Africa President Frederik W. de Klerk  in Cape Town. Mandela acknowledged that the ANC had tried to discourage Baker  from visiting South Africa and that Mandela had refused to see him here.    ""If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see him,"" Mandela  said Saturday. ""But I will not see him in South Africa.""    ""A high-profile visit"" to South Africa ""can result in a lot of confusion,""  Mandela said. ""It would suggest that President De Klerk has done something  positive, something fundamental that requires the world to review sanctions.""  The ANC has welcomed De Klerk's initiatives but says they fall short of  creating a climate for negotiations.    Mandela also said Saturday that the ANC has chosen him to lead its delegation  for the first official meetings with De Klerk and his white minority-led  government in Cape Town on April 11.    He declined to discuss what might be on the agenda. But he reiterated the ANC's  position that its preconditions for negotiation -- amnesty for returning  exiles, release of political prisoners and ending the state of emergency --  ""are the minimum conditions"" for ANC participation in government-sponsored  talks on a new constitution that would give the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    The escalating unrest has complicated those talks by giving the government a  reason to retain its powers to quell violence under the state of emergency.  That violence, in which a white motorist was killed Thursday night near  Sebokeng township, also has hampered the ANC's attempts to reassure whites that  a black majority government would be orderly and fair.

0,FT922-14359 ,"FT922-14359 _AN-CDGBIADFFT 920407   FT  07 APR 92 / EC lifts embargo on oil exports to South Africa      By DAVID BUCHAN, PHILIP GAWITH and DEBORAH HARGREAVES      LUXEMBOURG, JOHANNESBURG   THE European Community yesterday lifted its ban on oil sales to South Africa, and paved the way for renewed sporting, cultural and scientific links. The moves brought an instant welcome from Dr Bhadra Ranchod, South Africa's ambassador to the EC, who said his country had had to compensate for the embargo by spending more on synthetic fuels, on stockpiling oil imported from other sources, and on prospecting for oil within South Africa and its waters. EC oil companies established in South Africa, such as Shell and BP, would be far freer to operate there, Dr Ranchod said. The decision paves the way for countries such as Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium to re-negotiate the cultural accords they broke off in 1985 when United Nations and EC sanctions were stepped up. South African academics and students will also have easier access to European universities, Dr Ranchod said. The only remaining EC sanctions on South Africa are those mandated by the UN Security Council banning the sale of arms to, and the exchange of military attaches with, South Africa. Oil industry operators in South Africa welcomed the unexpected announcement, but noted that the Community's decision will have limited financial impact. For the past few years South Africa has been buying its crude at world prices, paying little if any premium. The diminished impact of the embargo was already evident last year when the government announced it would sell part of its strategic reserve to finance social upliftment. It will, however, allow South Africa to diversify its sources of supply. The country will also be able to trade crude oil products openly. What remains unclear is the extent to which yesterday's announcement will undermine the United Nations embargo which remains. Locally, it will provide added impetus for the decentralisation of oil procurement, which has been controlled by the Central Energy Fund. Shipping Research Bureau, an Amsterdam based monitoring group, estimated that South Africa's oil imports cost Dollars 1.6bn in 1989. Demand is about 30 per cent below that of the mid-1970s due mainly to progress made by South Africa in achieving a level of self-sufficiency through developing a synthetic fuel industry which converts coal to oil and gas. Deborah Hargreaves adds: Oil traders do not believe the EC move will have much impact on world prices. 'We could see some temporary distortions in the trade flows of certain oil products,' said Mr Joe Stanislaw of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, 'but there will be no huge spate of demand opened up.'

Several  personalities, in particular Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba,  the speaker of the National Assembly, members of the government  and the presidential staff went to welcome him at Bangui  airport. [passage omitted]    Soon after his arrival at the Palais de la Renaissance, the  president reviewed the Ndjamena summit. He recalled the signing  of the treaty and agreements establishing the Economic and  Monetary Community of Central African States [CEMAC], the  Monetary Union of Central Africa, and the Economic Union of  Central Africa. The quality of discussions held by the UDEAC  heads of state was very much appreciated. In fact, they did not  merely content themselves with approving the reports drawn up by  experts and ministers. On the contrary, they carried out a  detailed examination of the documents submitted to them. The  issues discussed at the summit consisted of economic and  regional integration, the situation of the Bank of Central  African States, and a report on the opening up of the region,  presented by the Central African Republic.    President Ange Felix Patasse also appealed for  reconciliation  between the Chadian Government and Moise Kette's movement  operating in southern Chad, the National Awakening Committee for  Peace and Democracy. Alain-George Ngatoua has given us a full  report on President Patasse's Ndjamena trip:    [Begin Patasse recording] I would like to tell you how happy  I feel to be among you this 17 March, for, within days, we will  be marking the anniversary of the tragic death of President  Barthelemy Boganda. In Ndjamena, we contributed much to the  success of the UDEAC summit. We have remained faithful to its  spirit and I am happy to announce that at long last Central  Africa is coming out of its deep slumber. We have understood  that our destinies are linked together. Central Africa is  lagging far behind the others because of national chauvinism.  At the same time that we held our summit in Ndjamena, West  Africa was also holding its summit. While all the West African  heads of state were present at their summit, some leaders in our  subregion were absent. You will understand the anguish we felt  some time ago. So if we left Bangui for Ndjamena, it was not  simply to accept the UDEAC secretary general's report, but  because we wanted to breathe new life into this institution by  taking a decisive step.    It was a choice between continuing to tread the same  well-trodden paths or to carry out a radical restructuring. We  opted for the latter solution. Yes, Central Africa is coming  out of its long sleep and those who want to remain within this  general dymamic awakening movement will do so, but those who do  not want to do so -- and it is a question of state sovereignty  -- are free not to go along with the others.    As far as we are concerned, we have stated that the treaty  establishing the economic and monetary community in Central  Africa must be signed at all costs. We have also said that it  was not obligatory to sign the treaty on the same day and at the  same place. Each country can do so within the framework of its  peculiar institutions. On this score, the host country  submitted the draft treaty for signature. Chad, Congo, and the  Central African Republic have signed the treaty. The president  of Equatorial Guinea could not be present at Ndjamena and  delegated this responsiblity to his deputy prime minister, so  Equatorial Guinea has also signed. Cameroon sent only the  president of its Economic and Social Council, who did not even  have a mandate to initial the document. However, since the  current chairmanship of the UDEAC has fallen to Cameroon, the  ball is in that country's court. We have decided to walk hand  in hand, and that is the determining factor. The community has  been born. [passage omitted] [end recording]     "

PRESS, Christian Science Monitor      WASHINGTON      Much of Africa will have above average or even record harvests this year, as it  did last year. But many Africans are still going hungry.    The surge in food production, due chiefly to improved weather conditions,  highlights what one World Bank official describes as the paradox of ""full  silos, empty stomachs.""    Big harvests are not helping poorly paid or jobless city residents who cannot  afford to buy enough food, even if prices fall slightly. And in rural areas,  many small farmers who cannot grow enough for their families lack the money to  buy extra food.    Thus, even as many experts seek ways to further boost Africa's food production,  a smaller number are looking for ways to boost incomes to help the hungry poor  afford decent diets.      Consumption Declining    According to the World Bank, nearly one-fourth of Africa's population -- more  than 100 million people -- do not get enough to eat. Food consumption per  person has been declining for most Africans since 1980, the bank says.    Large-scale famine continues in southern Sudan, due to a five-year civil war.  War also hampers farm production in at least three other countries -- Angola,  Mozambique, and Ethiopia.    But elsewhere, ""The basic part of hunger (in Africa) is an income problem,""  says G. Edward Schuh, a former economic aide to Presidents Gerald R. Ford and  Jimmy Carter, and ex-World Bank director of agriculture and rural development.  ""It's basically a poverty problem.""    There is a growing recognition among experts of a poverty-hunger link. In a  recent issue of the publication Africa Report, World Bank vice-president for  Africa, Edward Jaycox, said: ""Hunger is not mainly caused by transitory  droughts or crop failures or interruptions in the market. . . . Rather, chronic  food insecurity is caused by poverty. . . . ""      Income Declining    Per capita income has been declining in Africa for several decades, falling by  25% since 1980, Jaycox says.    ""We cannot treat the hunger problem as (only) a food supply problem,"" says  Sholom Reutlinger, a World Bank official.    World Bank President Barber Conable has called for more efforts to help the  poor afford more food. But for now, most World Bank and other aid efforts  remain directed at boosting food production rather than income.    Diverting more international and African attention to incomes will not be easy,  Reutlinger says. Larger farmers and equipment manufacturers push to keep the  focus on increasing crop production. And donors and African bureaucracies are  long accustomed to such a focus, he says.    Reutlinger and other specialists interviewed support efforts to boost food  production. But, they say, with the improved harvests, now is a good time to  try harder to find ways to help more people afford the food already available  in their countries.      New Programs Urged    They call for such programs as:    * Hiring small farmers in the off-season to build rural roads and bridges and  paying them with vouchers that can be exchanged for food.    Malawi has begun such a program, and the World Bank is considering helping fund  it. If such programs are not run during the slack farming season, however, they  may pull farmers away from regular farm work, one expert says.    *Paying rural children with food for each week of school they attend.    This would help many families by reducing their expenses on food, and would  encourage school attendance, says Schuh, now dean of the Humphrey Institute of  Public Affairs at the University of Minnesota. A few programs like this have  been launched in schools in India, but he is not aware of any in Africa, Schuh  says.    Schuh says the more common types of aid to farmers also help feed the poor. For  example, assisting export-crop farmers through government programs such as  credit and improved roads often leads to their hiring more labor, giving the  laborers more income.    And government aid to farmers growing staple food crops also helps the poor by  reducing food prices, he adds.      Inadequate Storage    The challenge in Africa this year is what to do with the bumper crops already  in or expected. Storage facilities in most countries are inadequate.    Where storage is available, Reutlinger suggests that the local governments buy  the surplus and use it to pay for work projects carried out by the poor.    Dean Schuh says countries should export what they cannot use or sell, and save  the foreign exchange that is earned to import food during lean years.  Cumbersome as that may sound, it would avoid losses of food in storage to  rodents and insects, he says.      Potential for Growth    Africa has the potential to produce enough food for its people, says Curtis  Farrar, a World Bank expert on agriculture.    And although he acknowledges that a continuing high population growth rate --  Africa's is the highest in the world -- could offset production increases,  Farrar says the growth rate is almost certain to slow. It will slow as incomes  and education rise along with urbanization and couples have fewer children.    Some experts are not so optimistic. Family planning programs in Africa have  made some progress but no major gains so far.    Farrar is executive secretary of the World Bank's Consultative Group on  International Agricultural Research, which has several research centers in  Africa.      No Dominant Crop    No ""green revolution"" is likely to happen in Africa the way it did in Asia in  the 1960s, Farrar says. Africa lacks the kind of single dominant crop that Asia  (rice) had, he explains.    But some crops are showing major potential. Sorghum production has doubled in  some parts in recent years, and has more potential. Local crops such as cow  peas are also showing significant promise, he says.    Improved corn seed has tripled yields in Ghana, Zimbabwe, and Kenya, says  Michael Cowlinson, a social scientist at CGIAR headquarters in Washington. Such  increases have been accompanied by more effective use of fertilizers, better  planting methods, and local research, he says.    But Farrar and Cowlinson point to a weak link in efforts to boost food  production: In most of Africa, long-range research is inadequate. They also  cite lack of focus and coordination among donor nations aiding agricultural  production efforts.

The six-person sub-committee on foreign affairs of South  Africa's Transitional Executive Council (TEC) spent three days  here discussing their country's post-apartheid relations with  the EU.    ""We sensed a very warm spirit of welcome. The EU is willing  to do business with us,"" committee member Stella Sigcau said.    Heading the agenda in meetings with EU officials was South  Africa's request for a preferential relationship with the  community following its first all-race elections next month.    The EU is to negotiate a comprehensive system of political,  trade and economic links with South Africa after the elections,  to replace the frosty relations of the apartheid decades.    The South African authorities, including the African  National  Congress, the election's likely winners, have been pressing for  a special relationship in order to speed up the repair of the  post-apartheid economy.    But EU officials want to place the Union's links with South  Africa in a wider regional context which includes neighbouring  African countries, so that the benefits of development aid can  be more widely spread.    A spokesman for EU Development Commissioner Manuel Marin  said  it was up to South Africa to decide whether and how it wanted to  join regional groupings.    These include the Southern African Development Community,  originally formed to counter the economic muscle of apartheid  South Africa, and the 69-nation African-Caribbean-Pacific (ACP)  group linked to the EU through the Lome trade-and-aid convention.    ""But we believe that whatever the final decision, it will  still be important to stimulate regional development,"" he said.

MAUGH II, Times Science Writer      SAN DIEGO      New genetic evidence has strengthened the claim that all humans alive today are  descended from a single African woman and suggests that the woman lived 140,000  years ago, not 200,000 as was previously believed, a UC Berkeley researcher  said here Tuesday evening.    Descendants of that woman, whom scientist have dubbed ""Eve,"" started migrating  north out of Africa 75,000 years ago and had fully settled in southern Europe  35,000 years ago, displacing the indigenous Neanderthal population, said  molecular biologist Allan C. Wilson. The Neanderthals were dispossessed because  they were genetically incompatible with the humans of African origin, Wilson  said at an international genetics conference.    The new evidence also indicates that early males may have roamed rather freely  throughout Africa nearly 100,000 years ago while females stayed firmly rooted,  suggesting that sharp changes in cultural interaction of men and women occurred  over a period of about 30,000 years.      Basis of Conclusions    Wilson reached his conclusions by studying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA, the  genetic blueprint of humans) found not in the nucleus of cells, where most  genes are stored, but in mitochondria, small bodies inside the cell that are  the source of the cell's energy. Mitochondria have only 37 genes, compared to  the estimated 100,000 found in the cell's nucleus, making them much easier to  study.    Unlike genes in the nucleus, which are inherited from both parents, genes in  mitochondria are passed down only from mothers. Because of this, researchers  can trace maternal lineages unaffected by contributions from males.    Mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to occur at a constant rate over  long periods of time. By studying the differences between mitochondrial DNA  from two women, for example, researchers can determine how long ago they shared  a common female ancestor. When many women are used, the technique also reveals  where that ancestor lived.    Using mitochondrial DNA from placentas, Wilson and his colleagues reported in  1987 that all modern humans are descended from a woman who lived in southern  Africa about 200,000 years ago, a woman who has subsequently become known as  Eve or ""the mother of us all."" That finding does not mean that only one woman  was alive then. Rather, it means that the lineages that descended from all  other women eventually died out -- a phenomenon that is common in biology.    By comparing every possible pairing among the 147 people tested in the study,  the researchers concluded that Eve could only have lived in Africa.    Although other researchers generally accept Wilson's methodology, they  criticized two aspects of his studies: the fact that he used black Americans in  his study as a surrogate for Africans, and the speed of his so-called  ""molecular clock."" The molecular clock is a measure of the rate at which  mutations occur in mitochondrial DNA, and critics charged that Wilson's was too  fast, placing Eve too near us in time.    In his current study, Wilson used newly developed biochemical techniques that  allowed him to study the mitochondrial DNA contained in a sample as small as a  single hair. Because he could use hairs, he was able to obtain specimens from  two hunter-gatherer tribes in central Africa and from the !Kung bushmen of  southern Africa, who would not have donated placentas for such a study. (The  spelling of !Kung denotes a clicking sound in the pronunciation of the K.)    He was also able to perform similar studies on chimpanzees, which helped him  achieve a finer calibration of his molecular clock.    ""We have been able to refute both criticisms,"" Wilson told a meeting of  geneticists.    Based on the new data, he said, Eve lived in southern Africa 142,000 years ago.  ""We are all a derivative of one of the !Kung lineages,"" he said.    The data further show that humans -- men and women together -- began migrating  out of Africa into the Middle East about 75,000 years ago. By 35,000 years ago,  they were firmly established in southern Europe, displacing the Neanderthals  who had lived there.    That agrees with archeological data, thereby confirming the accuracy of his  molecular clock. The fact that Neanderthal women made no contribution to the  gene pool indicates, he said, that a fundamental genetic incompatibility  existed between the two groups.    Although men and women began migrating out of Africa 75,000 years ago, men must  have begun moving around and exploring the continent much earlier, he said.  Evidence for this was provided by the genes of the three groups of African  women.    In those stages men did all the exploring and left women to tend to the home,  whereas later the family group was clearly more important and migrated as a  unit.    Wilson found virtually no overlap in the mitochondrial DNA from the three  groups, indicating that the females had stayed put for periods long enough for  gene differences to develop -- many tens of thousands of years. To his  surprise, however, Wilson found an almost complete overlap in key nuclear  genes, which are inherited from both parents.

0,FT931-6606 ,"FT931-6606 _AN-DCACUAA8FT 930301   FT  01 MAR 93 / China boosts trade drive in S Africa      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   CHINA will extend its trade drive to South Africa next month when it opens its first trade fair there, a move that suggests that the establishment of formal diplomatic relations with Pretoria may not be far off. About 80 Chinese companies will participate in the Trade Expo organised by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and to be held in Johannesburg from April 19 to 25. The CCPIT-organised fair in South Africa is one of 22 planned internationally and coincides with a rapid increase in China's exports, expected to reach Dollars 100bn (Pounds 70.4bn) this year. China's efforts further to accelerate its trade growth - it is expected to leap into the top 10 of the world's trading nations this year - comes as Beijing intensifies its attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China and the US formally resume Gatt talks in Beijing this week after a three-year break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. China and South Africa last year established visa-issuing representative offices known as 'research centres' in each other's capitals as preparation for full normalisation. China, which has been discreetly trading with South Africa for many years, has said that formal relations would follow further constitutional reforms, including agreement on a national unity government pending elections. The foreign ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. South Africa's Mr Pik Botha visited Beijing in 1991 and China's Mr Qian Qichen went to Pretoria last year. Gold-hungry Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of Dollars 4.3bn on gold jewellery last year, according to China's official Business Weekly. Quoting a report of the Geneva-based World Gold Council, the newspaper said that, based on 'conservative estimates', jewellery sales in China exceeded 250 tons. This was equivalent to one quarter of all the gold sales in Asia - a region that is traditionally a big gold consumer. Taiwanese buy about 10 grams of gold on average a year, Hong Kong residents 6 grams and China 1.8 grams. The huge Chinese demand for gold jewellery has been partly spurred by concerns about the depreciating value of the local currency - the renminbi - and also by growing affluence in a country where economic growth last year topped 12 per cent. The World Gold Council, an association of producers, said that it would devote more resources to developing the gold market in China. It planned to target women consumers. The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has purchased large quantities of gold in the past year, but the Chinese have not disclosed details. China has not divulged the extent of its gold reserves for more than 10 years.   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

President Rawlings, who was accompanied by the first lady, Nana  Konadu Agyeman Rawlings, and officials of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs, was met on arrival by the vice president, Mr.  Ekow Arkaah; special adviser on governmental affairs, Mr. P.V.  Obeng; the chairman of the Council of State, Alhaji Mumuni  Bawumiah; Captain Kojo Tsikata, a member of the Council State;  and service commanders.    Briefing newsmen on behalf of the president, the chief  director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Victor Gbeho,  said the inauguration symbolized the importance of upholding the  rights and freedoms of the individual, the triumph of right over  wrong, and the victory of the forces of good over the forces of  division. He said the most important lesson that came out of  the ceremony was the pervading sense of feeling of the black  majority to forgive and reconcile with the white minority, so  that they can move into the new democratic era in unity.    Mr. Gbeho said while in Johannesburg, President Rawlings  seized the opportunity to interact with world leaders. They  included President Fidel Castro of Cuba, Vice President Al Gore  of the United States of America, and Mrs. Hillary Clinton, wife  of the U.S. president. Others were the heads of state of  Botswana, Mali, Senegal, Nigeria, and Guinea. He discussed the  situation in the world and how to expand inter-African trade.    On South Africa in particular, Mr. Gbeho said President  Rawlings was convinced that Ghana should move with speed to  commence diplomatic relations with her within weeks. President  Rawlings also discussed with South African leaders how to  improve economic relations between the two countries. Mr. Gbeho  said President Rawlings hoped that the modest beginnings in  South Africa would inspire all Africans to rededicate their  efforts towards the total elimination of all forms of racism on  the continent.

Sacu - consisting of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland and Lesotho  -has existed in various guises for more than 100 years, and has been the most successful of the regional economic structures in southern Africa. Domestic fiscal pressures, however, have led over the past year to vocal protests in South African government circles that the system cannot continue in its current form. The root of the complaint is that while South Africa contributes 90 per cent of all revenue to the customs pool, its share of receipts has declined to 44 per cent from 73 per cent a decade ago. In the case of countries like Lesotho and Swaziland, these payments amount to more than a third of national income. In the 1991/2 fiscal year, South Africa paid more than R4.5bn (Dollars 1.3bn) to other Sacu members, with about 40 per cent going to the nominally independent homelands in South Africa. According to Mr Gerhard Croeser, director general of the Department of Finance, today's meeting is 'just to have an exchange of views, not to make demands'. South Africa is too close to implementing new transitional government arrangements for any big policy shifts. Although the discussions will be technical in nature, they do have important ramifications, particularly for the future of regional economic co-operation. As Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said earlier this month, the issue is not whether South Africa should be making the payments. 'All I am saying is that you cannot justify the size of these payments in terms of the Customs Union. If we were to include other potential members into this arrangement, our system would run downhill at a rate which would be truly alarming.' If the Sacu formula is amended so as to make it possible for other countries to join - and some have expressed interest - this would cast serious doubts over the future of the Southern African Development Community as the premier regional vehicle for economic integration. The other main item up for discussion will be the terms of South Africa's revised tariff offer to Gatt in the Uruguay Round. Due to be tabled by the end of the month, it is likely to involve a cut in the number of tariff lines from 12,000-plus to about 1,000, and a substantial cut in the average level of protection. The issue will be how to reconcile South Africa's tariff policy with the needs of other Sacu members, all of whose economies are much less developed.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The president was  addressing a crowd which gathered at the parliamentary buildings  in Kampala today to celebrate the end of apartheid in South  Africa. Mr. Museveni said that it is a great achievement to see  that this sad chapter in human history has come to an end. He  also congratulated Mr. de Klerk for changing his mind from his  original stand and join the people of South Africa in the move  toward this new chapter.    Mr. Museveni paid tribute to the people of South Africa who  sacrificed a great deal in the struggle for freedom. He singled  out Nelson Mandela, Oliver Tambo, (Subukwe) among others as  people who refused to surrender their right to freedom despite  the terrible hardships they went through. He also paid tribute  to African leaders who made significant contributions to the  freedom struggle, whom he enumerated as Julius Nyerere, Kenneth  Kaunda, Samora Machel, Kwame Nkrumah, 'Abd-al-Nasir, Ben Bella,  Muammar al-Qadhdhafi, Sekou Toure, and Robert Mugabe. Mr.  Museveni said that with this new chapter in South Africa, Africa  is now free from the Cape to Cairo. He cautioned, however, that  Africa is only free in the broad-based sense, because there are  still many problems to solve, such as the present conflicts in  Rwanda, Burundi, the Sudan, and Angola. He also pointed out  that the combined gross domestic product of South Africa, East  Africa, and Nigeria is still smaller than the gross domestic  product of a small country like Belgium.    The president, who acknowledged the presence of ANC soldiers  at the celebrations, said that since the National Resistance  Movement came to government in 1986, it has given assistance to  the ANC in line with the OAU policy. This assistance culminated  in the receiving of ANC soldiers in Uganda after they were  forced to leave Angola in order to pave the way for the  independence of Namibia. [passage omitted]     "

0,FT934-6659 ,"FT934-6659 _AN-DKXCSABUFT 931124   FT  24 NOV 93 / Funding plans take colleges into market      By JOHN AUTHERS   In the last year further education has been subjected to one of the government's most vigorous attempts to introduce a market to the public sector. In April, further education and sixth form colleges were removed from local authority control and incorporated as independent institutions. Their funding now comes from an education department quango, the Further Education Funding Council (England), and from commercial companies which pay for colleges to train apprentices. Although further education colleges educate more than 2m students - more than half of the UK's post-16 education - they remain almost invisible to the public eye. Their aim is to provide vocational and academic courses for teenagers and adults, as well as literacy and numeracy programmes. The funding council is putting the finishing touches to a new funding methodology, endorsed by Mr John Patten, the education secretary, which will have four aims: To encourage colleges to expand and compete for students. To encourage them to retain students, rather than allowing them to drop out without completing their courses. To improve educational standards by awarding extra funds for higher attainments. To remove any distinction between full-time and part-time students in funding. The funding council will set a 'tariff' for the number of students each college is expected to teach. Under present plans this will come to about 90 per cent of total funding. Colleges will be given extra money for each student they recruit in excess of the tariff, and will lose funds if they fail to recruit enough. Most colleges are happy with the principle of the arrangements but admit they are concerned that the gearing towards expansion may be excessive. Funding will also be available for good careers advice. Pupils will be set a target attainment and colleges will be rewarded with extra funding if the target is reached. Funds will be distributed each term. If students drop out colleges will be asked to refund money. On top of these incentives from the public sector colleges will be allowed to keep all funds they raise from local employers. Mr Bill Stubbs, chief executive of the funding council, made clear that these funds would not be taken into account when grants were allocated. Colleges should therefore be able to offer competitively priced training to employers, although this is yet to be widely tested in the market.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Mr Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, said yesterday that a formal long-term credit rating would be the most tangible step towards the country's return to the international capital markets. Bankers said South Africa was likely to make submissions to Moody's and Standard  Poor's, the two leading international rating agencies. The rating process would at least a few months to complete, they added. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating which would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers.

Long  awaited by current South African leaders, this visit should  render official the ""normalization"" of relations between the two  countries after a decade of open hostility.    With just four months to go to the first multiracial,  general  elections, Edouard Balladur's government is seeking to give  greater emphasis to ""French support for the current process of  transition,"" a communique from Quai d'Orsay [Foreign Ministry]  indicated. The visit by the foreign minister therefore marks  his ""confidence in the South Africa of tomorrow and in its will  to give new impetus to bilateral relations,"" the communique  added.    Edouard Balladur showed his interest in the development of  democracy in South Africa with a private visit a few months  before last year's legislative elections. For the future prime  minister of a government of the right, it was primarily a  question of renewing contact with the ANC [African National  Congress], which had previously maintained ""exclusive"" relations  with the Socialist government. Spearheading a Western crusade  against the apartheid regime, in 1985 Laurent Fabius  unilaterally imposed economic sanctions against South Africa, a  decision that ranked France clearly alongside the ANC while  concurrently benefiting its principal competitors -- Great  Britain and Germany, which did not follow its lead.    Following in the footsteps of Edouard Balladur, Alain Juppe  -- who will meet President Frederik de Klerk; ANC President  Nelson Mandela; and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the leader of the Zulu  Inkatha Party -- must complete this rebalancing, which is  essential to new French policy in Africa. In fact, France has  been trying for several months now to secure ""fruitful  partnership relations"" with South Africa, the most advanced  country in Africa and the continent's future center of  development. There is a need to find additional outlets for  French companies which, despite some spectacular deals (such as  selling seven A-320 Airbuses and doubling investments (3  billion francs) in three years), have little chance of making up  for lost ground on the South African market.

ACTION:     Notice of final priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and other requirements for grants to be made in fiscal year 1995.            SUMMARY:     The Secretary announces priorities for awards to be made in fiscal year (FY) 1995 using funds appropriated in FY 1994 under the Cooperative Demonstration Program, which is authorized by the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act (Perkins Act). Under the absolute priority, funds under this competition would be reserved for applications proposing to demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector and public agencies in vocational education programs that serve criminal offenders under the supervision of the justice system. In addition, the Secretary particularly invites applications that, within the absolute priority on correctional education, incorporate one or more of the following invitational priorities: (1) advanced technologies; (2) community-based correctional education; and (3) juvenile justice education. The Secretary also imposes requirements related to the priorities and other matters, and will use new selection criteria in evaluating applications submitted for this competition only.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:     The Cooperative Demonstration Program provides financial assistance for, among other things, model projects that demonstrate successful cooperation between the private sector (including employers, consortia of employers, labor organizations, building trade councils, and private agencies, organizations, and institutions) and public agencies in vocational education (including State boards for vocational education, State or local corrections or correctional education agencies, or eligible recipients as defined in 34 CFR 400.4). This program can help further the purposes of the National Education Goals; specifically, the correctional education priority directly supports the Goal that, by the year 2000, every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.         The designation of correctional education as a priority under the Cooperative Demonstration program is based on the critical problems of illiteracy and recidivism pervading our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections population. The U.S. Department of Education's National Adult Literacy Survey Report, ``Literacy Behind Prison Walls'' described a 70 percent illiteracy rate among a sample of prisoners as follows:            About seven in ten prisoners***are apt to experience difficulty in performing tasks that require them to integrate or synthesize information from complex or lengthy texts or to perform quantitative tasks that involve two or more sequential operations and that require the individual to set up the problem (1993, p. vi).            Additionally, a recent study, ``Vocational and Academic Indicators of Parole Success,'' published in the     Journal of Correctional Education    , found that inmates who had received academic and vocational training while in prison were more likely to be employed and less likely to commit crimes after their release than other inmates (Schumacker, et al., 1990).     Academic and vocational training is also critical for probationers and parolees, since the majority of the Nation's criminal offenders are serving sentences within community corrections settings. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there were about 3.5 million adults under correctional supervision in the United States at the beginning of 1993. Of these, 2.6 million, or 74 percent, were under active probation or parole supervision within the community.   Educational programs for criminal offenders that use applied learning strategies to teach life skills, job skills, and literacy can reduce the likelihood that the offenders will return to the criminal justice system. After completing their sentences, ex-offenders often have limited opportunities for meaningful employment and lack necessary basic life skills, including the job-seeking and job-retention skills needed to obtain and maintain employment. Without basic literacy and job skills, it is unlikely that these persons will become fully productive members of society.   On April 6, 1994, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorities, required activities, selection criteria, and other requirements for the Cooperative Demonstration Program (Correctional Education) in the     Federal Register     (59 FR 16192).

An analysis of the specific comments follows:       Absolute and Invitational Priorities           Comments:     One commenter recommended that priority be given to programs that build on correctional education projects previously funded under the Cooperative Demonstration Program.       Discussion:     The Secretary intended that previously funded correctional education demonstration grants, awarded in September 1992, include plans for continuing after Federal funding ends, as demonstrated by the selection criteria used in the earlier competition. The Secretary believes that while expanding previously funded programs may indeed be worthwhile, other projects should be afforded the opportunity to compete for these limited Federal funds. Nevertheless, previously funded projects are eligible to apply for funds under this competition on the same basis as other projects.         Changes:     None.         Comments:     Several commenters made suggestions for more comprehensive services to be identified under the proposed priorities, including: pre-vocational assessment, individual training plans for students, case management as an approach to providing social services for released offenders, student retention as an outcome measure, use of support systems in the community, and the availability of non-traditional vocational training programs for female offenders. One commenter recommended that invitational priorities be created for offenders with special learning needs and histories of substance abuse. One commenter also recommended that the coordination of the academic, vocational, and substance abuse treatment components be an integral feature of the funded projects.

In a report - expected to be legislated by the new government later this year - the authorities declared their commitment to overall restructuring of operations, with emphasis on increasing market participation by both foreigners and black investors. The exchange will run a series of investor workshops and encourage the listing of small black companies, while also permitting limited corporate membership and some foreign ownership of local brokerages for the first time. After years of sanctions and isolation, during which many overseas buyers, particularly Americans, stopped even considering South African stocks, interest has resurfaced over the past six months. The recent boom, which has seen the major indices hit a series of new highs, has been largely foreign driven. Several specialist Africa funds have been formed, most notably Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m Africa Fund and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern Africa fund, both of which are overwhelmingly concentrated on the South African market. More are expected. As South Africa is increasingly added to global market indices, such the IFC data base on emerging markets, a greater proportion of international investment capital will almost certainly make its way to the country. With a current market capitalisation in the region of Dollars 160bn, the exchange is the 11th largest globally, and much more mature and sophisticated than most comparable markets in the developing world. With foreigners expected to be allowed to participate shortly, it is already widely rumoured that major London firms have expressed interest in partnership with local brokerages, a move that will likely generate further foreign business down the line.

0,FT932-14502 ,"FT932-14502 _AN-DDSCSABCFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Painful reforms should yield surge in third world's growth / Analysis of the latest World Bank report on prospects for developing countries - with east Asia leading the way      By GEORGE GRAHAM   THE WORLD Bank is forecasting a surge in developing countries' growth rates over the next ten years, as a result of the often painful economic reforms they have undertaken. Growth in the developing world is projected at 4.7 per cent a year over the period 1992-2002, compared to 2.7 per cent in 1982-1992, according to the Washington-based multilateral development bank's annual forecasts.* Gross domestic product per capita is expected to grow at 2.9 per cent a year  -more than three times the 0.8 per cent rate of the last ten years. Mr D C Rao, the bank's acting senior economist, said much of the improvement reflected the transformation of economic policy in the developing countries in recent years: trade rules have been liberalised, the policy of import substitution abandoned, over-valued exchange rates corrected, public finances brought under control and the state's role in industry and commerce reduced. These policy changes have led to a 'remarkable resurgence' of private capital flows to the developing countries, with foreign direct investment climbing by 50 per cent over the last two years to Dollars 38bn in 1992, with portfolio investment growing even more explosively to Dollars 34bn last year. The World Bank expects growth in the developing world to be led by east Asia, where growth is projected to slow slightly over the next decade but to remain at the high level of 7.3 per cent a year. East Asia now accounts for a quarter of output in the developing world, Mr Rao said. Over the next ten years, its weight is likely to rise to one third. In Latin America, the World Bank says growth of nearly 4 per cent a year is achievable over the next ten years, compared with a rate of 1.9 per cent a year in 1982-92, if countries such as Chile, Mexico and Argentina persevere with their domestic policies and if Brazil adopts credible policies of macro-economic stabilisation. Sub-Saharan Africa could see growth rise from 2.0 per cent over the last ten years to 3.7 per cent in the decade ahead, largely as a result of improvements the World Bank anticipates in prices of commodities such as coffee and cocoa. If their fundamental reforms succeed, the national economies of eastern Europe and central Asia should stop contracting and start to grow at a rate of 2.1 per cent for the next ten years, attaining a trend rate of 4 to 5 per cent in the second half of the decade. Mr Rao cautioned that the World Bank's forecasts were heavily reliant on the assumption that the recovery that now appeared to be consolidating itself in the US would spread to the rest of the G7 leading industrial nations, with a prospect of sustained growth in the developed world over the medium term, combined with lower real interest rates. The forecasts also assume faster growth in world trade, a stabilisation in real non-oil commodity prices, and a continuation of policy improvements, especially in Latin America. 'A more pessimistic set of assumptions would halve the rate at which developing countries' per capita income grows to about 1.3 per cent per year,' Mr Rao said, warning that this would mean an increase of 80m in the number of people living in poverty. One of the most serious threats to the economic prospects of the developing countries is the continued failure to make progress in the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation. Countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are hit by tariffs averaging 7 to 8 per cent on their exports to developed countries and by non-tariff barriers on 60 to 80 per cent of the goods they export, while expanding market opportunities are also critical for the prospects of the reforming economies of eastern and central Europe. *Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries; World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington DC 20433, USA.

December 31 marked more than the end of just another year.  It also marked the end of an era, he said.    Next year South Africa would, for the first time, have a  multiparty government that would be truly representative of all  its people. ""For the first time we will have a system where the  constitution and the bill of rights -- and not politicians in  Parliament -- will have the final say,"" Mr de Klerk said.    For the first time South Africa would have a constitutional  system containing effective checks and balances against the  misuse of power.    Important among these would be independent courts, including  an independent constitutional court with wide-ranging powers.    Equally important would be the establishment of strong and  autonomous provinces, with important powers and functions  effectively entrenched.    Mr de Klerk said South Africa faced three challenges in the  new year, the first being to let democracy succeed. ""The second  challenge...will be to make our economy work to the benefit of  all our people. Success in the economic field will be as  important as success in the constitutional field.""    Democracy and elections would not by themselves bring all  the  things that people needed, said the president. ""We will not be  able to create jobs and build all of the houses, schools and  clinics that we need, unless there is money to pay for them.  And the only way that we can get this money is to ensure that  our economy grows as quickly and as strongly as possible.""    This would require hard work, new investments and expanding  exports. ""To achieve this, the new government of national unity  will have to follow the right policies -- policies that have  succeeded throughout the world.""    ""The third great challenge that we will face will be to  build  a new South African nation; to break out of the conflicts of the  past; to break through to reconciliation,"" said Mr de Klerk.     "

Mandela's trip brought him into the fold of black-ruled nations in Africa who  have fought to maintain world pressure on Pretoria to end racial segregation  and give the black majority a vote in national affairs. Zambian President  Kenneth D. Kaunda and six other African heads of state greeted Mandela, his  wife, Winnie, and their delegation at the airport.    ""Viva, Mandela, Viva!"" cried hundreds of ANC supporters who gathered at the  airport and lined parts of the 15-mile road into town. The 71-year-old leader  waded into the crowd to greet groups of school children and women as they sang  songs praising him.    ""The people of Africa are waiting to hear from you,"" said Kaunda, who as a  leader of the so-called ""front-line states"" -- countries surrounding South  Africa -- has been one of the ANC's most outspoken supporters over the years.

We are holding discussions with  several people across the political spectrum in South Africa and  we are giving our viewers the opportunity of phoning in to air  their views and maybe to ask a question. We have a first caller  already and we have not even given a number yet. We will give  it to you soon. If we talk about the HNP [Reformed National  Party] -- we saw excerpts of your discussion in our  advertisement, etcetera -- you put your views across very  clearly, without any hidden messages, and you regard the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] as an undemocratic body  which has no jurisdiction over you and your party, but at the  same time you tell the government that there must be a white  election. Would you then regard this as democratic if a large  percentage of South Africans is excluded from such an election?    [Marais] Look, the government was voted into power by the  white electorate. These are the people who gave the government  a mandate. So if it wants to continue then it should get a  mandate from those people, not from others. This is in  accordance with the present constitution. It should act  according to the terms of the current constitution and it does  not have any mandate for what it is doing. In 1989 the  government did not tell voters that it was going to embark on  handing power over to an ANC [African National Congress]  government. At that time it said white schools would remain  white, the white residential areas would remain white. So it is  not just acting without a mandate, it is also acting directly in  contravention of the mandate it had asked for. For this reason  it should come back to the white electorate.    [De Vos] Before it continues with the Transitional Executive  Council?    [Marais] Yes.    [De Vos] Now what would the situation be like then -- you  talk about a lost war, you talk about conflict -- is it HNP  policy that if the HNP is not accommodated, or if people  supporting your policy are not accommodated, then there will be  conflict?    [Marais] Well, look the current negotiations are peace  negotiations. The ANC was involved in a war against South  Africa and the National Party [NP] government is making peace  with the ANC. If these peace talks lead to the white man in  South Africa becoming subjected to a communist government, then  the future of the white man will be much worse than it would be  if they instead stood up and prevented communist government from  ruling them. For this reason the only choices we will have are  either, virtual suicide under a communist government, or  fighting to protect our people.    [De Vos] Now you are set on this idea that negotiations are  out of the question -- that we cannot negotiate, etcetera,  etcetera, but at the same time you are part of the Afrikaner  Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front -- AVF] who are involved in  negotiations. Now how do you explain that?    [Marais] You are mistaken when you say that we are part of  the Volksfront. From the beginning we said that we will not  participate because there are real differences in approach  between the two organizations. We say that the first priority  is for us to stop the De Klerk government. If we do not stop  it, it will continue to systematically give away our rights, as  it has, for example, been done at the SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation]. The people in the National Front  only want to negotiate. They do not want to wage an open  struggle against the De Klerk government. This is the basic  difference between us in our whole approach.    [De Vos] The interesting thing is that when you talk about  us, then I take it you are talking about the HNP and not the  whole right-wing movement, as such. Is it possible for the HNP  to stop the government? Are your numbers sufficient?    [Marais] I have no doubt that if the government calls for a  general election today, that it will be flattened. For this  reason it did away with by-elections. It is the most  undemocratic thing that can ever happen in a country and they  did away with it for only one reason, because it knows that it  will lose every by-election and this will be proof that it does  not have a mandate for what it is doing, so we have no doubt  that the government is more scared of a general election than  the devil is of holy water.    [De Vos] You are talking now about a white general election?    [Marais] Yes, a white general election. That is the only  valid ...    [De Vos, interrupting] But who will defeat it? It will not  be the HNP.    [Marais] Well, it depends. If an election is held then the  entire right-wing spectrum will obviously be consolidated to  defeat the government. You do not need any other reason for  consolidation than the following: the government must be  defeated. This is how it was in '48 -- the Afrikaner Party, the  Gryshemde [Gray Shirts], the New Order, and the National Party  stood together to defeat Smuts.    [De Vos] But you are talking about the election which  brought  the government to power in '89, but there was a referendum since  then which showed support for government policy with an  overwhelming yes vote.    [Marais] Look, that question in the referendum only dealt  with continuation of negotiations to bring about a new  constitution, but there was no talk of drafting a constitution  which would eventually lead to the handing over of power to a  communist government. The ANC is a communistic front. You must  remember that the National Party always said that it supports  power sharing. Mr. de Klerk himself said in 1977 that power  sharing in a federation is a blueprint for the destruction of  the white man. Now, no one can tell me that any government  would get a mandate from a nation, for a blueprint for that  nation's destruction. So that referendum is the biggest  political gimmick ever seen in South Africa. The results were  so influenced by intimidation and false promises that it has no  validity whatsoever.    You speak about an election. You say it would be an  opportunity to defeat the government. Well, there will be an  election on 27 April; that's a foregone conclusion. Why don't  you take part in it, and get to put your views across?    [Marais] Look, I don't believe it is a foregone conclusion  that that election will take place. If the black homelands --  Zululand, Bophuthatswana, Ciskei -- as well as the right-wing  opposition refuse to take part in that election, it would have  no legitimacy. We say that election is a complete distortion of  democracy. Not only is it a means of denying the Afrikaner his  rightful political power, but millions of blacks with no  understanding of democracy and democratic methods are being  saddled with a responsiblity for which they are not prepared.  The holding of a one man, one vote election has only one goal,  and that is to break the Afrikaner's political power in South  Africa. We are not prepared to give it any validity.    [De Vos] We had our first caller earlier. I'm not sure  whether the person is still holding on...Yes, it seems the  caller has been holding on patiently while we were talking. Our  first caller is ready. Good morning. Who's calling?    [Worrall]Good morning, Eon. This is Brenda Worrall  calling from Sandown.    [De Vos]Brenda, good morning. Yes, go ahead,  please.    [Worrall]Yes, now I do not know when your rude  awakening is going to come, Jaap Marais...    [De Vos, interrupting]Can we just ask, before we go on,  can we just jack up the volume for Mr. Marais, please. He can't  hear the phone caller properly. We'll turn on the  loudspeakers here in the studio as well. Please, Brenda,  can you go ahead now?    [Worrall]Yes. Now, what I was saying is I do not know  when your rude awakening will come, Jaap Marais. We are black  people. We are South Africans. We were and still are oppressed,  and our liberation has absolutely nothing to do with the NP  giving in to the demands of the ANC. Black people can liberate  themselves and will do so, because they have and still continue  to fight for their liberation. Your pro-apartheid and  anti-black attitude -- however well you might disguise and  justify that -- is only self-destructive unto yourselves.  Please just face up to the reality. We are here to stay; a  monster of a nightmare, maybe, but a reality to be dealt with.  And, finally, I think you are the last person who can have  anything to say about democracy, because people in South Africa  know absolutely nothing about what democracy is. Thank you very  much.    [De Vos]Thank you, Brenda.    [Marais] The volume was very loud, and I could not hear  everything. [as heard] Could you just tell me briefly what it  was all about?    [De Vos] Yes. To sum it up, she said we cannot wish away the  black majority. It is a fact we have to live with, that blacks  would achieve their liberation on their own, it had nothing to  do with party politics. That's about it -- we must face up to  the reality.    [Marais]We must realize that by just saying black  majority is not stating the real position. There are various  black nations in South Africa, and they differ among themselves  just as much as whites and black in South Africa might differ.  You must realize that between the Zulus and the Xhosas there  has been war since before Jan van Riebeeck came to South Africa.  There are the two Xhosa nations in Ciskei and Transkei; they  have been at each other's throats for all these years. So there  isn't just a simple black majority. There are various black  nations in South Africa who are all entitled to govern  themselves, and not to be governed by an organization such as  the ANC, whic is Xhosa-dominated. So I think we have no problem  in saying that the blacks have a legitimate claim to govern  themselves, but not at the cost of the whites in South Africa.  The whites have been the kingpin in the development of South  Africa, and in creating stability, and even in stopping the  tribal wars between blacks in South Africa. So it's absolutely  foolish to think that you can switch South Africa to a black  majority government and think that progress and peace and  prosperity will continue. The whole of Africa has been a lesson  to us that this is just not possible.    [De Vos] Following on the question she asked, is it not true  that one could argue that if you use the rest of Africa as an  example, where you say the whites were the axle around which  everything turned, all the development, and so on...Can we not  argue that that may be so, but that the whites were the axle at  the cost of the greater group, the nonwhites, if you wish, or  the blacks who, given the same opportunities, could also have  been part of that axle?    [Marais] Well, you know, I could show you many articles  where blacks in Africa are now saying:Bring back the white  manbecause they were much better off when whites ruled. It  is true that blacks perhaps suffered injustices, but no system  can ever guarantee absolute justice to all. There are certain  things which have to be done, which may be detrimental to  certain people, but which are beneficial to the general welfare  of society, and I do not think we have any doubt that the blacks  in South Africa are the best organized in all Africa, simply  because the whites were here.    [De Vos] Our next caller is on the line. You surname is Van  Eeden, I believe?    [Van Eeden] Yes, Mike van Eeden.    [De Vos] Mike, good morning, and go ahead.    [Van Eeden] Mr. Marais, I'm not sure whether I understand  you  correctly, but it seems you are not prepared to live under a  black government, yet we as blacks have had to live for years  under a black [as heard] government. Why were we expected to do  it? Why can't you, the whites, now also do the same?    [De Vos] The question says it seems you are not prepared to  live under a black government, yet blacks have had to live under  a white government all these years. Why not?    [Marais] Look, our point of view is that the whole policy of  separate development was to enable black people or black nations  to govern themselves, and not be governed by whites. That is  the basic philosophy of nationalism. So it is not true to say  that we believe it is right for blacks to live under whites, and  not vice versa. That is not the case at all.    [De Vos] The next caller is on the line. I did not catch the  name. Good morning to you. Who's calling? Could you repeat  your name?    [Unidentified caller] I am 12 years old. I want to say to  Mr. Jaap Marais, thank you very, very much for being such a good  person to the whole of South Africa. We appreciate it very  much, and I just know that the blacks will never defeat us.    [De Vos] Could you give your name again?    [Zeelie] Madeline Zeelie, from Bloemfontein.    [Marais] What did she say?    [De Vos] She said thank you very much. She said blacks will  not defeat them.    [Marais] Well, thank you very much.    [De Vos]Have we got our next caller yet? I don't think  so.If we look at the HNP, its formation, policy, you are  actually what one might call the curator of the Verwoerd policy.  But looking at the last election, and the votes that the HNP won  at the polls, it would seem that your support is growing  smaller. What would you say the future holds for the HNP? Is  there a future?    [Marais] Look, in the 1981 election the HNP won 33 percent  of  the votes in Transvaal, where we stood against the NP. In mamy  constituencies we got over 40 percent of the votes. Then the  Conservative Party [CP] people realized that if they remained in  the NP, they would be defeated by the HNP in the next election.  So they broke away with a group of members of Parliament, and  that gave the impression that they would provide an easier way  of defeating the NP. It has now been found that the CP was not  in a position to do so. But it affected the HNP detrimentally.  The HNP has been in existence for 25 years, and we have never  held a constituency, except for a short while. But we have  never changed our policy. That is unique in our history. It  only goes to show the indestructiliby of the foundation on which  we stand. We stand on the same principles on which the NP of  Hertzog, Malan, Strydom, and Verwoerd stood, and which form the  foundation on which all the development in South Africa took  place -- the constitutional development, the economic  development, the cultural development. In politics, as in daily  life, one has ups and downs. We are quite prepared to accept  what is happening now. But we have no doubt that the HNP stance  is correct, and will be proven to be correct.    [De Vos] Our next caller is on the line. Good morning.    [Engelbrecht] Good morning, Mr. Marais. My name is  Engelbrecht of Melkbosstrand. Eon, thank you very much for the  opportunity. Mr. Marais, I want to ask you this: The NP made  many promises, both during the referendum and thereafter. We  have been sobered by the fact that these promises have not been  honored. One of the major promises Mr. de Klerk recently made  was that he would reintroduce the death penalty, as a deterrent  for the unbelievable level of violence prevailing in the country  at present. Since then he has not carried out his promise. The  violence is continuing, innocent children and adults are being  murdered countrywide. I would just like to know how the HNP  feels about this?    [De Vos] About the death penalty?    [Engelbrecht] Yes, the death penalty, but I would also like  to know how Mr. de Klerk manages to get away with such lies?  Why do they not tackle him about it in Parliament?    [De Vos] I think we have the gist of the question. I would  think half of it should be directed at Mr. de Klerk, but  nevertheless...    [Marais] Well, it's not only on the death penalty what we  have been given false promises. One of the NP placards in the  referendum read:/Want Jobs? Vote Yes.And as you know,  of all this year's matriculants, only 4 percent will be able to  get jobs. As for the death penalty, it was a popular thing to  say at the time, and the NP jumped on the bandwagon. But now  that it's time, as they say in English, to deliver the  goods, because there will no longer be a white election,  the government pretends it is not responsible. And that is the  evil of this kind of thing -- by-elections have been  discontinued, and the government can now simply ignore its own  promises. But yes, we believe the death penalty must be  reintroduced.    [De Vos] There we have it. The HNP says that the death  penalty must be reintroduced.    [De Vos] We are ready for our next call. It seems that many  are eager to speak about the HNP and its views this morning.  Good morning. Who are we speaking to now?    [Du Pokoy] This is Freddie du Pokoy from Keimoes.    [De Vos] Freddie, good morning. From Keimoes?    [Du Pokoy] Yes, the capital of Upington.    [De Vos] The capital of Upington, Keimoes. Before we  continue -- we have a sound problem...continue.    [Du Pokoy] Mr. Marais, I would like to ask you what you mean  when you speak about communists, because in the past it was we  who experienced the same thing. If someone did not agree with  the government's policy, then he was a communist. Now that the  ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], etcetera, are  unbanned, I have met some of them -- I am not an ANC or PAC  supporter but they are religious people. Where is this leading  to?    [De Vos] The question is: What is a communist?    [Marais] Well, a communist is, of course, someone who  follows  the communist ideology and method. You must realize that  communism is not just an ideology but it is a method of  revolution through which existing orders are overthrown to be  replaced by a communist order and the communist ideology is, of  course, equal status to all people with no regard for gender,  race, nationality, language, or anything. In the second place  they believe that the state should control all means of  production. Private property and private ownership must be  wiped out. Communists are also basically against family life,  saying that family life is a threat to a nation's productivity  and for this reason family life also has to be eliminated. For  this reason the education system, all social aspects of life  must be geared toward promoting these goals.    [De Vos] It is interesting that you mention this because if  one looks at what other parties, usually labeled as communists,  are actually promoting then there are very few of these elements  evident in their official policies. One could actually say, and  I have heard this argument, that the National Party, for  example, with their labor and homeland policies, etcetera -- the  breaking up of families, etcetera -- have pursued those goals  and have actually succeeded, and that they could be regarded as  being on both sides of the spectrum.    [Marais] Well, look the National Party pretends that it is a  party favoring the free-market system but it actually favors  socialism, communism. It negates virtually every positive thing  it does by embarking on a contradictory course of action -- the  one man, one vote system, the eradication of apartheid. I can  show you how the communists were on the brink of destroying  apartheid in the fifties and sixties, in favor of one man, one  vote. These are the basic things favored by communists to  promote its ideology -- equal status, one man one vote, and the  establishment of a communist government as it did in Rhodesia  and Namibia.    [De Vos] Let us hear what our next caller has to say. This  is George from Bophuthatswana. Hello, is that George?    [George] Yes, Mr. Jaap Marais, my name is George from  Bophuthatswana. My grandfather is very old. My mother and  father are also very old. There have always been whites  suppressing the inhabitants of Africa, since 1652 as you well  know, yet you still continue with your hatred, promoting this  kaffir-boss relationship. Why can't you get rid of this and  adopt a logical system used throughout the world, that of one  man one vote, then you can serve under a newly elected  government? Why are you so insistent? Look, your time has  passed.    [De Vos] Thank you George. The basic point he raised is that  he is a black man living in Bophuthatswana, and that the policy  you favor is an old, worn-out policy. He asked why you do not  move from this policy and follow the rest of the world where the  one, man one vote policy has been a success.    [Marais] Look, the policy of one man, one vote -- it has  been  proven all over Africa that it led to a single one man, one vote  election, and thereafter a one-party state emerged, or  dictatorship. We have had one violent coup after another.  Government in Africa is now a continuous process of revolution  and the overthrow of governments. It has brought nothing but  misery. Do you realize that Africa's contribution to the world  economy last year was less than 1 percent? Africa has become a  continent which exports nothing. It lives on credit as a result  of the political systems which have brought economic misery.  Remember that, during Dr. Verwoerd's time, when we had  apartheid in this country, the growth rate was 7 percent per  annum, inflation was 3 percent, and the prime lending rate was  3.5 percent. The RAND DAILY MAIL said:The nation is  suffering from a surfeit of prosperity. And what is the  situation today? We have a negative growth rate, inflation has  come down slightly to under 10 percent, but for years it was  almost 20 percent. Interest rates have caused havoc to our  economy. So you see, these are the practical consequences of  policy.    [De Vos] Our next caller is Johnny Boardman of Wesselsbron.  Good morning.    [Boardman] Good morning, Eon. I would just like to thank you  all there at the studio for the manner in which you handle these  discussions. We all appreciate it. To Mr. Marais: All these  years I have followed your career and your statements, and I do  appreciate what you are doing for the whites in South Africa.  Over the years we have come to regard you as the prophet of the  right wing. All the predictions you have made have proven to  be correct. So this morning I would like to ask you to predict,  here on the television, to the people of South Africa what lies  ahead for us on the path that the De Klerk government is  following? Maybe it will open people's eyes.    [Marais] Well, should the process which the government and  the ANC are busy with go acccording to schedule right up to the  end, there will be no order. It is impossible to accommodate  the diverse population groups in this country under the roof of  a single parliament. Parliamentary democracy has a limited  tolerance for religious and racial differences. The result will  be that the strongest group will seize power and oppress the  other groups with force. That will lead to revolt, as in the  rest of Africa. There is no way this process will succeed. The  only way to ensure order is for Mr. de Klerk to have the courage  to go back to the electorate and seek a mandate for what he is  doing; and he will be defeated in a peaceful, orderly,  constitutional manner. Then we can begin anew to restore order  here -- not to draw up a new constitution, but to restore law  and order, even if it has to go hand in hand with emergency  regulations. But it would restore economic justice and put a  stop to foreign interference in South Africa's affairs, so that  this country can once again govern itself. Those are the three  prerequisites for restoring an acceptable way of life here.    [De Vos] I think that is a good point for us to end on.  Thanks to our viewers for your participation, and thank you,  Mr. Marais.     "
0,FT933-11867 ,"FT933-11867 _AN-DG0CFAGBFT 930727   FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (9): Hopes may be too high - Edward Balls examines some harsh realities for the future      By EDWARD BALLS   GHANA is perhaps the only African country to have accepted the spirit, as well as the letter, of the World Bank's list of market-based reforms over the past decade. But after 10 years of structural adjustment, the country has yet to receive the promised rewards. At current growth rates (5 per cent for GDP, 3 per cent for population) it would take Ghana 20 years to join the ranks of lower middle-income countries. Only then would the average poor Ghanaian reach the poverty threshold - defined as two-thirds of today's average consumption per head. To succeed, the World Bank's African role model must make the leap into accelerated growth and wean itself off foreign aid by attracting much more of the private and foreign direct investment that Africa so desperately needs. Failure to do so would mean, rightly or wrongly, a damaging blow to the Bank's reputation in the continent. Little wonder that understandably nervous World Bank officials hurry to damp down expectations about Ghana's future prospects while stressing the progress that has already been made. Yes, they acknowledge, Ghana remains a very poor country (average incomes averaged around Dollars 400 per head) and relies heavily on foreign assistance. But Ghana's economic performance has still been impressive over the past decade relative both to the previous 10 years and the rest of the continent. Real incomes per head have grown by an average 2 per cent a year since 1983; they fell by 0.4 per cent a year in the decade before the structural adjustment programme began. GDP growth has averaged 5 per cent a year since 1983; in sub-Saharan Africa the average is 2.1 per cent. These growth rates occurred while Ghana's terms of trade have fallen relentlessly. While gross aid flows have averaged 8 per cent of GDP a year, adjusted for Ghana's large terms of trade losses the net resource transfer was less than 5 per cent of GDP at its peak, compared to a sub-Saharan African average of 8 per cent. In short, World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials argue, Ghana confirms that structural adjustment is a necessary condition for successful development. Low inflation, a realistically valued exchange rate, reduced tariff barriers and the removal of numerous restrictions on investment, have together delivered much faster growth. Ghana's experience, they argue, also undermines some common myths about adjustment. Does structural adjustment require a smaller public sector? Fewer civil servants, perhaps, but the share tax revenue in GDP has tripled since 1983. Does adjustment hit the poor harder? The sketchy evidence, according to Mr Ravi Kanbur, World Bank mission chief in Accra, suggests that, on average, adjustment has reduced the incidence of poverty by shifting resources from the richer urban areas to the poorer, rural regions. But Ghana also demonstrates that successful structural adjustment is insufficient for an acceleration of economic growth and a rapid fall in poverty. The obstacles to an acceleration in economic growth to the levels achieved by the east Asian developing economies over the past two decades will not be rectified by low inflation and liberalisation alone. Ghana lags far behind its east Asian competition in all areas of social and physical infrastructure, as the charts show. 80 per cent primary school enrolment is high by African standards but low compared to east Asia. And the capacity of Ghana's civil service to implement reforms remains disappointing, as Kwesi Botchwey, the finance minister, readily admits. Most worrying are the low level of private sector investment and the small share of manufacturing investment in GDP. Last year's balance of payments does, in fact, suggest that flight capital may be beginning to return. But inflows of foreign direct investment remain low. Senior government minsters call for a new 'agenda of activism' to address these deficiencies. Mr Botchwey stresses the need to attract foreign investment to supplement Ghana's small pool of domestic private savings and trumpets the new investment code. He talks of packages of tax cuts and tariff concessions to attract particular foreign investors. Meanwhile the Bank of Ghana is using all its powers of moral suasion to encourage the banking sector to bias its foreign exchange operations towards export-orientated business and offer cheaper term loans for new investments. The Bank has made it clear, says one banker in Accra, that 'importing second-hand cars is not consistent with sustainable development.' But the government appears undecided about whether to bow to pressure for infant industry protection, from members of the private sector advisory group, although the World Bank and IMF counsel strongly against it. 'Free trade means efficiency but it can also destroy domestic industry,' says one senior minister.' Mr Ishmael Yamson, chairman of Unilever Ghana, does not believe in protectionism. 'It breeds corruption and inefficiency,' he says. 'Most companies in Ghana asking for protection grew up in a shortage economy and have never had to justify their investment.' The missing ingredient is confidence. Senior ministers privately voice frustration at President Rawlings's occasional outbursts against particular private companies. Ghana's experience suggests some lessons for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. Bank, Fund and government officials list some possible reasons for Ghana's success: Ownership: the Economic Recovery Programme was identified with the government, not the donors, and ministers took responsibility for mistakes as well as successes - at each stage, they worked hard to persuade interest groups that reforms were in their interests; Sequencing: reforms were carefully staggered - the devaluation occurred well before imports were liberalised - and not pushed through faster than the government's capacity limitations allowed; Aid: donor support was substantial and became available from the outset of the programme before the government had established a track record. But the missing element is politics. The military has consistently tried to align its interests with those of the rural poor rather than the richer urban elite who probably stand to lose more from adjustment in the early stages. And the government was able to build an impressive track record, over a 10 year period, before putting its popularity to the test through last autumn's elections. An election in 1985 or 1986 may well have delivered a very different result. But the Rawlings government won the right to continue for a further term of four years, in an election which most western observers judged to be free and fair. That is perhaps the most encouraging sign yet that structural adjustment might work in Africa.   Countries:-  GHZ  Ghana, Africa.

They sent it to the Organisation of African Unity, the  United  Nations Security Council and its secretary general, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali.    But in acknowledging the crimes being predominantly  committed  by Rwandan government soldiers and ruling party militiamen,  Mandela fails to acknowledge South Africa's role in arming them.  At least 3,000 of Rwanda's soldiers and some militiamen carry  South African R4 automatic rifles. Rwanda bought them in 1992,  along with 10,000 hand-grenades, 20,000 rifle grenades, 10,000  launching grenades, and more than one million rounds of  ammunition.    Rwanda's purchase of arms from South Africa was in violation  of a 1984 voluntary UN Security Council resolution. By 1977 it  had already imposed a binding resolution against any arms sales  to South Africa.    But the UN is expected to lift its arms embargo against  South  Africa soon. This would give Mandela the chance to demonstrate  that the new South Africa would not sell arms to countries like  Rwanda. Instead, Armscor [Armaments Corporation of South Africa]  executive Andre Buys told Defense News: ""We expect that by  1996 exports will at least    When Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia in  1989,  he promised to end armed exports. But last year, after the  country split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, both renewed  exports. Unfortunately, Mandela and the African National  Congress seem likely to take the same road.    ""Once the new government is up and running, we will welcome  a  complete lifting of all remaining sanctions and embargoes  against South Africa,"" ANC spokesman Madala Mthembu told DEFENSE  NEWS. ""We also wish to state the new government will be in full  compliance with international standards governing exports of  technologies and materials that would threaten world security.""    Such standards would preclude arms sales, for example, to  states like Libya, which is also currently subject to a UN  embargo. But states like Rwanda before its present crisis would  still be able legally to buy arms.    No one expects Mandela to turn his back on what promises to  become one of the new South Africa's best earners of foreign  exchange. But few would expect, either, a man who has devoted  his life to his country's struggle for justice, equality and  human rights to turn his back on future victims of other abusive  regimes now.    He wouldn't necessarily need to. Because of the existing US  embargo, precise figures on South Africa's military exports are  unknown. But Denel, the state-owned manufacturing consortium  created out of part of Armscor and its subsidiaries in 1992, has  assets of $2.9-billion and has made about $175-million in arms  exports annually so far. Denel accounts for only about 60  percent of the country's total defence sales.    However lethal to its own citizens, Rwanda's purchase of  $5.9- million worth of grenades, mortars and ammunition from  Armscor made only a tiny addition to South Africa's balance  sheet. A leader in almost every weapons grouping, it expects to  make most of its profit from the sale of expensive, hi-tech  systems like laser-designated missiles, aircraft electronic  warfare systems, tactical radios, anti-radiation bombs and  battlefield mobility systems.    South Africa also has a technological edge in landmine  detection and sweeping equipment that countries like Cambodia,  especially, need. While South Africa has already begun to  market this equipment, it announced in March that it would not  sell landmines at the same time, and stopped exports.    Although motivated by appearance before principle, this is a  welcome sign.    But the ANC's present policy isn't good enough. While  exporting mine-sweeping equipment and hi-tech weapons to earn  foreign exchange rightfully, the new South Africa should  re-examine its small-arms export policy. International  prohibitions against arms sales to abusive regimes are at  present non-existent or low.    Rwanda, long documented for its grisly record, is a case in  point. Rather than sink to this standard, Mandela should lead  the world in raising it up.     "

Brazil, as an emerging power,  wanted to exert its influence over the Portuguese-speaking  countries that had recently become independent from Portugal.  Almost 20 years later, Itamaraty and a group of Brazilian  businessmen are playing their cards on a South Africa governed  by the African National Congress (ANC) of Nelson Mandela. But  the priorities are different: There is no longer the idea of  projecting Brazilian political influence, but rather that of  doing good business. From 13 to 20 March, just over one month  before the first South African elections in which the black  population will vote, a delegation of 34 Brazilian businessmen  headed by Celso Marcos Vieira, chief of the Trade Promotion  Department of the Foreign Ministry, made a commercial visit to  that country. The Brazilian companies were represented by large  companies such as Andrade Gutierrez, Norberto Odebrecht, Mendes  Junior, NEC of Brazil, Embraer [Brazilian Aeronautics Company],  Varig Airline, Furnas [Furnas Electric Power Plants, Inc.], and  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation]. Vieira said: ""The  time could have not been better: With this initiative we showed  confidence in the South African electoral process.""    The South African elections, which will put an end to 46  years of white minority government, will be held on 26, 27, and  28 April. Even with the growing political violence of the last  few months, the inauguration of Nelson Mandela on 10 May is  considered a sure thing by analysts, including those of  Itamaraty. The Brazilian delegation got ahead of possible  missions from Europe, the United States, and Japan. According  to Otavio Cardoso Pontes, director-superintendent of  Poliolefinas and one of the members of the Brazilian delegation,  Brazilian businessmen see many possibilities for bilateral trade  with South Africa, which is a country with a high level of  consumption and a well-developed infrastructure. Mandela's  representatives guaranteed the Brazilian businessmen that an  eventual ANC government would not implement a policy promoting  government intervention in the economy, as planned in the party  program.    The Brazilians met with heads of the ANC economic  departments  and with representatives of five different sectors (including  the National Federation of Africa Chamber of Commerce, which  includes only black businessmen) interested in joint ventures  and consultant services. The future for prospective Brazilian  deals in South Africa lies in the reconstruction and development  project that Mandela and his team have drafted. Vieira  commented that ""the ANC intends to build 1 million low cost  houses and to expand its electricity supply system. There is  lots of room for Brazilian companies in these areas."" Mandela's  supporters, moreover, are willing to review the energy policy  implemented so far by the government. The ANC intends to  minimize the African nuclear program which, it is believed,  includes nuclear bombs.    The ANC leaders are also quite interested in the  establishment of an economic bloc including Mercosur [Common  Market of the South] -- Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay  -- and South Africa, Angola, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and  Botswana. According to Minister Vieira, Brazil regards South  Africa as a doorway for the entry of Brazilian products into the  African markets. He added: ""They know how to negotiate with the  region, and this could be useful to the Brazilian businessmen.""    Although the ANC has asserted it does not have any  nationalization program in mind, it has asked to consult  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation] to determine whether  or not it is feasible to maintain the state monopoly in the oil  field. The Bank of Brazil has already opened credit lines with  the purpose of promoting bilateral trade. But the Brazilians'  visit to Mandela's country does not boil down to promises only.  At least one deal worth $3 million has already been closed:  The petrochemical industry Poliolefinas will buy raw material  from a South African company to manufacture polyethylene.  Minister Vieira exclaimed: ""We have discovered South Africa.""  What remains to be seen is whether Mandela's virtual election  will be enough to guarantee political stability in that country.  After all, Brazil's initiatives in all the Portuguese-speaking  African countries failed because they all were drowned by  endless civil wars.     "

0,FT923-6912 ,"FT923-6912 _AN-CHYAUAA3FT 920821   FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: 'Neighbour' nations defy South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   THIS week's announcement from the Southern African Development Co-ordination Conference (SADCC) that it plans to turn itself into the more ambitious Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a sign it had failed to deliver the goods. While few dispute the need for a change, it is unclear that this initiative, which aims to replace a loose arrangement of sectoral co-operation between nine nations with a formal treaty seeking greater economic integration, is for the better. With the premise of SADC seeming to provide a bulwark against South Africa's economic dominance in the region, it seems set to fail. As Johannesburg's Business Day argues, it seems an 'exercise in futility' to try to deny economic links with South Africa just when most foreign interest in the region wants to use it as a springboard, not a main player. SADCC's change was forced on it by the South Africa reform process undermining a basic tenet of its existence: the need to achieve economic independence from a hostile neighbour (South Africa itself). Formed in 1980 with nine member states (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe), since joined by post-independence Namibia, SADCC sought to reduce external economic dependence, especially on South Africa, and promote economic development. This week's changeover to the new SADC raises questions on two fronts: the relationship between SADC and South Africa; and the need for greater economic integration. South Africa elicits contradictory reactions among SADC members. It can be seen as the saviour - the region's economic locomotive and, with foreign aid flows not as free as in the past, a potential paymaster - or feared, as an economy able to swamp its neighbours. The dilemma is real, but this week's decision suggests SADC prefers to delay confronting it. Sound political reasons exist for not having any truck with South Africa until it has achieved full democracy, but it seems clear the only hope for achieving a useful regional economic grouping is with South Africa at its core. Re-organising before addressing the South Africa issue seems futile. Setting aside South Africa, analysts are sceptical about the route of deeper economic integration chosen by SADC. Dr Eric Leistner of the Africa Institute notes: 'The aims of SADC are more ambitious, so they will fail more spectacularly (than SADCC).' Three major problems are involved in this route: the first concerns the Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA). Eight of SADC's members belong to the PTA, and SADC overlaps considerably with the PTA, yet SADC will not merge with PTA - an illogical stance. Second, PTA has had limited success in its aims, such as tariff reduction, due to lack of economic resources and political will on the part of its members. Why should things be different for SADC? Also, the limited success enjoyed in achieving the far less demanding aims of SADCC casts serious doubt on whether SADC can hope to progress in the difficult task of economic integration. Finally, the enormous economic disparities between the member countries of SADC, in terms of such factors as inflation and access to foreign currency, make integration problematical. Given these problems, and an unwillingness to cede sovereignty to regional bodies, a more promising route would for the SADC countries to focus on aims such as co-operation in sectors such as energy, transport and movement of goods.

The Old Mutual South Africa Trust is hoping to raise about Pounds 50m to invest in a range of South African companies, with a bias towards smaller and medium-sized companies and the financial and industrial sectors. The fund will be managed with a bottom-up, stock-picking style. The fund's managers say that South Africa combines much of the growth potential of an emerging market with the developed infrastructure of an advanced industrialised economy and a stock market more than 100 years old. The ending of sanctions and improved political stability provide encouraging opportunities for growth. The fund's bias towards smaller companies is intended to avoid duplicating investment in areas which are easily accessible to foreign institutional investors, focusing instead on areas of the market for which research is not widely available overseas. South Africa is due to be included in the IFC emerging markets index, where it will have a weighting of about 13 per cent. This is expected to lead to heavy inflows of overseas money into South Africa, and the Old Mutual trust hopes to appeal to institutions looking for a quick way to increase South African exposure in line with the index. The fund is mainly targeted at institutional investors, but there will also be a public offer to allow private investors a chance to participate. Lord Tombs, former chairman of Rolls-Royce, will chair the trust, with other board members drawn from Old Mutual and the UK investment trust sector. Shares will be issued at 100p with one warrant attached to every five shares. The public offer opens on June 23, and closes on July 1.   Companies:-  Old Mutual Unit Trust Management.

What specifically can you do if  some governments are not representing the interests of all their  ethnic groups?    [Salim] The African states are largely the product of the  arbitrary drawing of borders by the colonial powers.  Nevertheless, we have decided to retain the territorial  integrity of our states. Regarding the representative nature of  the governments, there are a few peculiarities. There has been  democratization, which is certainly worth being recognized -- in  Benin, Zambia, the Congo, to name just a few. In Africa,  democratization means two things: first, that power emanates  from the people, and second, that we have good, reliable  governments. I do not know which system is most suitable for  that.    Regarding the problem of tribalism, it has turned out that  Europe is not free from it either -- the term ""ethnic cleansing""  was invented in Europe. I say this without polemics. It is  little consolidation if one looks at poverty, misery, and  violence as they are now in Rwanda -- conditions that shock and  sicken me -- and then says: You in Europe are not perfect  either. But no one in the world can claim a monopoly on  everything good and pleasant.    As an international community, we must learn to learn from  each other -- from the tragedies in Bosnia just as from the  tragedies in Africa. In particular, we must also solve the  ethnic and religious conflicts, because otherwise they develop  such an explosive power that they become nightmares for our  society.    [Bloch] You have repeatedly stressed how important economic  cooperation among the African states is -- the creation of a  united economic area. How is this supposed to work among  countries that are all struggling for survival, since even the  attempt at cooperation among highly developed industrial states  in Europe is difficult?    [Salim] Quite right, but I would look at it precisely the  other way round: If the need for cooperation among the  prosperous former colonial powers is undisputed, how much more  urgent is this need than for Africa! Precisely because of the  brittleness of our society and the widespread power, we must  cooperate all the more closely and effectively. In April, the  35th member country ratified the agreement on an African  economic community. It is part of our postcolonial syndrome of  dependence that we talk much about economic cooperation but have  done little for it. We have always looked toward the north. We  need experts -- we look toward the north; we want to buy things  -- we look toward the north. Even today it is sometimes easier  to fly from one African country to another via Europe. Or one  makes telephone calls via Europe -- all these are things that  must change.    [Bloch] How?    [Salim] The African countries must finally be able to  improve  their foreign trade balance. We have always been told: You  must simply work harder and produce more. But today everyone  knows that this does not work. The Africans -- in particular in  the rural areas -- can work two, three, or four times harder and  would still get less for it than 10 years ago. The unjust  imbalance of the international market must make the West think.    No one denies that Africa has enormous resources --  minerals,  raw materials, the gigantic hydroelectric volume of our waters.  People always talk about Africa as the continent of the future.  I am more interested in Africa as the continent of the present.  The point is to use our resources in a sensible way.    [Bloch] In the German media, Africa is never portrayed as  the  continent of the future, not even as the continent of the  present....    [Salim, interrupting] ...Because there is an English  proverb:  ""You give a dog a bad name and you hang it."" As long as Africa  is portrayed only as a confused, miserable, vegetating  continent, whose rulers are entangled in bloody wars with each  other and cut each other's throats after military coups,  naturally no one will care for our concerns. However, if one  explained the efforts of the normal Africans for economic  improvements and political reforms to the Germans, they would be  more understanding.    [Bloch] What are you relations like with those ruling in  Europe? Do you not often appear as a suppliant?    [Salim] When I go to Europe or the United States or to the  Gulf states, I never turn up holding out my hand in  supplication. Rather, I am making propaganda for actively  understanding our problems. The best support develops if the  people understand what is going on on our continent beyond all  cliches.    [Bloch] And does such understanding exist?    [Salim] There is a lot of double standard and hypocrisy.  Today some people talk about ""Afro-pessimism"" and reproach  Africa for precisely those things for which they are partly to  blame themselves and which they have partly brought about. Some  people speak of corrupt, dictatorial regimes -- governments with  which they have cooperated for decades and with whose help they  are acquiring advantages. In addition, the Europeans must  understand that Africa can never be understood as a homogeneous  mass. This would be as if one were to declare Bosnia a  typically European phenomenon.     "

Doukoure Amadou reports:    [Begin recording] [Amadou] It was the former executive  secretary of the Economic Community of West African States  [ECOWAS] and presently foreign minister of his country, Sierra  Leone, who was the last foreign personality to bid farewell to  President Henri Konan Bedie yesterday at 2100. After the  audience, Abbas Bundu stated that he had been sent by Captain  Valentine Strasser to attend late President Houphouet-Boigny's  funeral and then congratulate President Henri Konan Bedie on his  assumption of office of president.    [Bundu, in English fading into French translation] First and  foremost, I was asked by my head of state, Capt. Valentine  Strasser, to bring greetings to His Excellency President Bedie,  to renew the felicitations conveyed to him on his assumption of  the office of president of this great country. My president  also asked me to convey to the government and people of Cote  d'Ivoire, the condolences of the government and people of Sierra  Leone on the death of Houphouet-Boigny. The Sierra Leonean  people join the Ivorian people in sharing the pain inflicted by  the death of the late president. I was also charged with  informing the president concerning what is happening in the  subregion. Last November, the war had almost ended in Sierra  Leone, so the government decided to decree a unilateral  cease-fire and grant amnesty to the rebels.    Thus, a cease fire came into effect on 1 December, which was  to last 30 days. Unfortunately, instead of a reduction in the  war effort, the war intensified. The rebels took the  opportunity to replenish and strengthen their positions by  receiving arms from Charles Taylor of Liberia.    [Amadou] A few hours earlier, President Henri Konan Bedie  had granted another audience, this one with the secretary  general of the OAU. President Bedie discussed the upcoming OAU  summit, which will take place in Tunis in June, with Salim Ahmed  Salim.    [Salim, in English fading into French translation] The  president and myself discussed the heritage left by President  Houphouet-Boigny, not only to Cote d'Ivoire, but also to Africa  as a whole and the possibility of continuing this struggle which  President Houphouet began -- the struggle to improve the  continent's economic situation, the fight to resolve conflicts  in Africa, and the fight to maintain the dignity of our people.    [Amadou] Is there already an idea of the major issues to be  discussed at the Tunis summit?    [Salim] By the time of the summit, the elections scheduled  for South Africa will have already taken place. So there willl  be a new government in South Africa and it is most likely that  South Africa will become a member of the continental  organization at this summit. So the issue of decolonization and  apartheid in Africa will be over.    We shall then have to focus attention on issues of economic  development, economic integration, and issues relating to the  African Economic Community. We shall discuss what should be  done concerning inter-African cooperation, subregional  cooperation, and also we shall discuss the issues of stability  and security -- since we cannot speak of economic development  within an environment of chaos and anarchy.    [Amadou] Both audiences took place in the presence of the  Ivorian Foreign Minister Amara Essy. [end recording]     "
0,FT944-17976 ,"FT944-17976 _AN-EJED5AG6FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (13): Fresh hope for Afro-optimists - Analysis / Afro-optimists hope that a thriving post-apartheid South Africa will be the engine of growth that will haul the ailing economies of the region out of their protracted slump      By MICHAEL HOLMAN, Africa Editor   In spite of the optimism over the long-term trade prospects for South Africa, Afro-pessimists point to the enormity of the challenge facing the region. African countries' GDP growth last year (excluding South Africa) was 1.4 per cent, according to the 1994 World Bank annual report - better than 1992, but still well below the region's population growth rate. Whatever the outcome, no one under-estimates South Africa's dominant role in the economy of sub-Saharan Africa, strikingly illustrated by one yardstick: export credit guarantees extended to Pretoria, since Nelson Mandela's inauguration, exceed the total cover available to other countries in the region. Whether trade opportunities are indeed going to pick up north of the Limpopo depends on which analysts you believe; and the analysts assessment may well be influenced by what they wish to sell. For brokers extolling the merits of the dozen or so investment funds which have identified Africa as an emerging market whose time has come, prospects seem almost rosy. 'Out of the starting blocks' reads the caption on the cover of a bullish analysis of sub-Saharan stock markets published last month.* Vast commodity reserves and low cost production, privatisation getting under way, and the easing or lifting of foreign exchange controls are features noted elsewhere in the report. But before the exporter to Africa sends out a sales team, a distinctly more cautious comment should be taken into account. 'Small markets with low growth rates, poor infrastructure, high indebtedness, slow progress in introducing market and private sector orientated economic reforms, and low levels of technological capabilities, all reduce the attractiveness of many African countries to foreign investors,' says the recent 1994 World Investment Report.** Neither the stock market nor foreign investment level are in themselves adequate guide to the state of the African market: as much as half of the region's imports may be aid financed, and aid flows have been rising. But the comments of the Investment Report may serve as a useful indicator, for higher levels of foreign investment are essential to Africa's economic recovery. Despite the reforms that got under way in many African countries during the 1980s, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows did not increase between the second half of the 1980s and early 1990s, notes the report. Averaging around Dollars 3bn a year, FDI flows to the entire region were considerably less than those received by Malaysia in the early 1990s, it points out. Inflows are concentrated in oil exporting countries, notably Egypt, Angola and Nigeria. Although the total value of FDI flows into Africa nearly doubled from an annual average of Dollars 1.7bn during 1981-85, to an average of almost Dollars 3bn during 1986-90, says the study, those investments were concentrated in few countries, and modest when compared to FDI flows to other regions of the developing world. Average annual FDI flows into Africa as a proportion of all inflows in developing countries declined between these two periods from 13 per cent to 11 per cent. Worse was to come. Flows stagnated in the early 1990s to many African countries, while flows to other developing countries continued to increase. 'As a result, Africa's share decined further to 6 per cent by 1992, thus underlining the marginalisation of that continent in relation to FDI, apart from its marginalisation in relation to international trade.' Africa's reforms may have got it out of the starting blocks, but it has several laps to go, it seems, before it breasts the finishing tape. *Sub Saharan Stock Markets, Baring Securities; tel (44)-71-522-6707. **World Investment Report, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, (Unctad).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT FLOWS INTO AFRICA              1981-1992, (billions of dollars and percentage)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Region/country                                1981-1985    1986-1990     1991   1992                                    Annual average  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa                            1.7          2.8         2.7    3.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa's share in: (%) All countries                     3.4          1.8         1.7    1.9 Developing countries             12.9         11.4         7.0    5.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oil-exporting countries*          1.4          2.1         1.8    2.2 Egypt                             0.7          1.1         0.3    0.5 Nigeria                           0.4          0.7         0.7    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other countries                   0.3         0.82         0.9    0.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Algeria, Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Egypt, Gabon, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Nigeria and Tunisia; 2 Figure is inflated by unusually high investment in Liberia in 1988-1990 (Dollars 290m, Dollars 656m and Dollars 225m, respectively), most likely in flags-of-convenience facilities.

A ban on trade, services and investments, implemented in 1986 and 1987, would be lifted from March 15 but an embargo on sales of oil and weapons would be upheld. Norway's exports to South Africa, comprising mainly iron ore, fish, fish products and mechanical equipment, fell to NKr56.2m (Pounds 5.6m) in 1987, after sanctions were implemented, from NKr348.3m in 1986. Norway said the time had come to introduce new political instruments to promote democracy in South Africa; it had formulated a five-point programme to provide assistance during the transition. Meanwhile the Swedish government said yesterday it hoped to lift sanctions against South Africa within a few weeks, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. Mr Carl Bildt, Swedish prime minister, said: 'It is a matter of weeks', but he stressed removal of sanctions would be conditional on continuing democratic reforms in South Africa. Sweden banned investments in South Africa in 1979 and imposed a ban on trade in 1987.   Countries:-  NOZ  Norway, West Europe.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

South Africa's first step in realising the ideal of African  unity was its acceptance as the 53rd member of the Organisation  of African Unity.

0,FT941-7545 ,"FT941-7545 _AN-EBXC7ADYFT 940224   FT  24 FEB 94 / Book Review: Northern exposure for the unskilled      By DAVID GOODHART   NORTH-SOUTH TRADE: EMPLOYMENT AND INEQUALITY Clarendon Press, Oxford 482 pages, Pounds 45 In 1930s Britain, a highly qualified professional such as a univer-sity professor earned seven times the average wage and probably employed two full-time servants. Now he or she earns about twice the average wage and might employ someone to clean once a week. Part of the thesis of Adrian Wood's disturbing book is that levels of inequality in the developed world not experienced for 50 years are being re-established as a result of economic convergence between rich and poor countries. For most of the period since the second world war there has been a steady increase in the income of all citizens in the developed world. Though there have been large differences between the passengers, the ship of state has sailed ahead with everyone on board. Adrian Wood believes that the rich and the poor in developed countries are now in different boats, one rising and one sinking. Like Robert Reich, the US labour secretary, in his book The Work of Nations, Wood says the dividing line is no longer between capital and labour but between skilled and unskilled. Wood's book is part of a growing body of work on inequality, which seeks to explain the slump in demand for unskilled labour in developed economies, manifested in falling real wages for many American workers and persistently high unemployment in Europe. But what distinguishes it from the received wisdom is that it places trade with developing countries, rather than technological change, at the centre of the explanation. The argument is summed up by the author with typical clarity in the first paragraph: 'Expansion of trade has linked the labour markets of developed countries (the north) more closely with those of developing countries (the south). This greater economic intimacy has had large benefits, raising average living standards in the north, and accelerating development in the south. But it has hurt unskilled workers in the north, reducing their wages and pushing them out of jobs. Northern governments must take action to solve this problem.' Few would deny that north-south trade has changed significantly in recent years. Instead of the south sending raw materials to the north and the north sending manufactured goods to the south, the relationship is now dominated by the exchange of manufactured goods. The north sends skill-intensive computers to the south and the south sends labour-intensive textiles to the north. But the scale of the change is often not appreciated. The annual value of the south's manufacturing exports to the north has increased from virtually nothing in 1950 to Dollars 250bn in 1990. Some economists say this has had little net impact on employment in the north. As countries such as South Korea (where wages have doubled in the past five years) become richer, they stimulate demand for sophisticated goods from the north. Further, although Dollars 250bn sounds a big figure, it still represents only 3 1/2 per cent of the north's consumption of manufactured goods, up from 1 1/2 per cent in 1970. Thus demand for less skilled labour in the north has only been reduced by a few hundred thousand jobs. Wood disagrees. He says the impact of trade on labour demand in the north is 10 times greater than most previous estimates and has created a 20 per cent fall in demand for unskilled labour across the developed world. Previous calculations, he says, have not accounted for the fact that many northern companies have responded to the threat of southern competition by introducing production methods which eliminate low-skill labour. The south's declining demand for labour-intensive manufactures from the north has also been ignored, as have large areas of manufacturing where the north no longer competes. Not all of these arguments carry equal weight. The observation that northern companies have introduced new production methods raises the question of why they were not doing this anyway, if it was profitable to do so. And with only 18 per cent of employees in Britain working in manufacturing, it seems implausible that such a far-reaching impact on overall job levels should be conducted through such a small group. Why, in any case, is this shift in world trading patterns occurring now? Supporters of the trade case, such as Wood, say that a large gap opened up between wages in the developed world and the undeveloped world in the century to 1960, and that a combination of technology (containerisation), politics (the end of empire and the removal of trade barriers) and education (the trebling of literacy rates in the past 30 years) has only allowed this gap to be exploited by the south relatively recently. Supporters of the technology case as an explanation for inequality can, just as convincingly, point to labour-saving innovations, such as robotics, which did not exist until a few years ago. Nevertheless, Wood has eloquently raised the profile of trade in the debate about skills, equality and employment. Rather disarmingly, he accepts that the technology argument might be equally plausible, but as a strong opponent of protectionism, his policy prescriptions remain the same. The solutions are familiar but well argued: more help for unskilled workers to acquire skills, and income supplements for low-paid workers. The taxes to finance such initiatives should not destroy the incentive to acquire skills. The justification for intervention by governments is that it is unfair that the poorer members of northern society should suffer as a result of changes which benefit the majority. Those who suffer can also make life unpleasant for those who do not. It is preferable, says Wood, to be taxed than to be mugged.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      WINDHOEK, Namibia      South Africa threatened Saturday to expel a large U.N. peacekeeping force on  its first day of work in Namibia after charging that guerrillas entering from  Angola had clashed with Namibian police as a formal cease-fire went into  effect, leaving 38 insurgents and two police officers dead.    Roelof F. (Pik) Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, called the clash a  ""flagrant violation"" of international agreements. He said that if the U.N.  secretary general did not issue a clear statement on the matter, South Africa  would ask U.N. peacekeepers to leave until the South-West Africa People's  Organization (SWAPO), which has fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South  African control, ""can be brought to its senses.""    Despite Botha's threat, it was considered unlikely that South Africa would  expel the U.N. team that is here to oversee Namibia's transition to  independence because that would wreck the entire process and allow Cuba to  renege on its agreement to withdraw its troops from neighboring Angola.    SWAPO officials declined to comment Saturday, saying they needed more  information about the incidents before answering South Africa's charges.    The U.N. special representative in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said he would  send a four-member team to the area of the clashes, about 400 miles north of  Windhoek, today. Ahtisaari considered them ""a very serious development,""  according to a U.N. spokesman.    ""We need to go up there and find out for ourselves"" what happened, said  Frederic Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman in Windhoek, the Namibian capital. Eckhard  added that ""it's safe to say"" that U.N. peacekeeping forces were not involved.    Statements issued by Botha and Louis Pienaar, the South African administrator  in charge of Namibia, cited three separate incidents along 120 miles of the  Namibia-Angola border, beginning before the cease-fire went into effect at 6  a.m. local time Saturday. They said a group of 40 to 50 armed men entered  Namibia near Ruacana, a second group of about 50 entered near Oshikango and a  third group was encountered halfway between the two cities.      Accused of Atrocities    Security police sources in northern Namibia told The Times that the incursions  were repelled by units of Koevoet, a counterinsurgency unit of 3,000 black  Namibians under the command of white South Africans. The unit, which has been  accused of widespread atrocities, was recently returned to normal police work  and incorporated into Namibia's police force.    The sources could not confirm the number killed in the attacks but said two  alleged SWAPO guerrillas had been captured and others were being sought late  Saturday night. Botha said 14 police officers were injured.    Botha did not specify what weapons were used by either side, but under the U.N.  peace plan Namibia's police were to begin carrying only pistols ""in the normal  performance of their duties.""      December Agreement    The incidents apparently marked the first serious clashes between SWAPO and  South African-backed Namibian authorities since South Africa, Cuba and Angola  signed an agreement in December that paved the way for Namibia's independence  and the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern  neighbor.    Under a U.N. plan intended to lead to free and fair elections here in November,  both SWAPO and the South African Defense Force were restricted to their bases  beginning on Saturday. Most of SWAPO's bases are in southern Angola.    South Africa is conducting the transition to Namibian independence, but its  actions are subject to the approval of the United Nations, which, at peak  periods, will have a team of about 7,000 soldiers, police and administrators to  monitor the process. SWAPO, with strong support among residents of the most  populous northern region, is favored to win the elections.    In Windhoek's black township of Katutura on Saturday, tens of thousands of  Namibians donned the bright colors of their political parties to try out their  new freedom and begin campaigning to govern Africa's last colony.    Police stopped several thousand trade unionists as they began a march from the  township to Windhoek to protest a move to sell Namibian enterprises to private  investors. The group dispersed without incident.      Jubilant Crowds    Namibia's two major political parties -- the Marxist-oriented, predominantly  black SWAPO and the capitalist, multiracial Democratic Turnhalle Alliance --  drew jubilant, singing crowds of about 5,000 each to rallies less than two  miles apart. The country's first unfettered political campaigning, conducted  under a hot sun, was generally peaceful.    Namibia is a mostly desert territory twice the size of California on the  southwest coast of Africa. Its population of 1.5 million is overwhelmingly  black, and more than half live in the northern Ovambo province, the seat of  SWAPO support.    Tens of thousands of SWAPO guerrillas have been killed since 1965, when the  group launched its war with South Africa, which has controlled this territory  for 74 years -- the last 20 years in defiance of the United Nations.    Until recently, South Africa had questioned the United Nations' impartiality in  Namibia because the international body had once declared SWAPO the ""sole and  authentic"" representative of the people of Namibia.    The United Nations currently has only about 1,000 peacekeeping troops in the  country, and U.N. officials say the full force of 4,650 troops will not arrive  until May 1.    The troop deployment was delayed by haggling at the United Nations earlier this  year over the cost of the mission. To cut the cost, now set at $461 million,  the United States and the Soviet Union reduced -- to 4,650 from the originally  planned 6,000 -- the number of troops for Namibia's transition to independence  and black majority rule.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a one-day visit to Namibia, said  Saturday the border incidents were ""a most serious challenge"" to the Namibian  peace process and she called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council  to discuss the matter.      NEW ERA FOR NAMIBIA     Saturday marked the start of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, which has  administered the huge, sparsely populated territory since World War I. Hours  before the transition began, South Africa reported major clashes with  guerrillas in northern Namibia near Ruacana and Oshikango. Provisions of the  plan:     April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of 7,000-member U.N.  Transition Assistance Group that will oversee transition. South African troops  in Namibia and guerrillas of South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),  based in neighboring Angola, are confined to bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is to be disbanded; South Africa is to  reduce its troops to 12,000. South African administrator Louis Pienaar is to  publish election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners to be freed; Namibian exiles to return.    July 1 -- South Africa's forces to be cut to 1,500; election campaigning to  begin.    Oct. 31 -- Half of Cuba's 50,000 troops are to have left Angola; rest are to  withdraw north of 13th Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections are to be held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered  to approve constitution for independent Namibia -- the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops are to leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate is to end.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans are to withdraw last troops.

British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, on a one-day visit to Namibia, said  Saturday the border incidents were ""a most serious challenge"" to the Namibian  peace process and she called for a special meeting of the U.N. Security Council  to discuss the matter.      NEW ERA FOR NAMIBIA     Saturday marked the start of a transition period for Namibia under a regional  accord reached in December by Angola, Cuba and South Africa, which has  administered the huge, sparsely populated territory since World War I. Hours  before the transition began, South Africa reported major clashes with  guerrillas in northern Namibia near Ruacana and Oshikango. Provisions of the  plan:     April 1 -- Cease-fire in 23-year-old Namibian guerrilla war becomes official;  U.N. special representative Martti Ahtisaari takes charge of 7,000-member U.N.  Transition Assistance Group that will oversee transition. South African troops  in Namibia and guerrillas of South-West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO),  based in neighboring Angola, are confined to bases.    May 14 -- South African security force is to be disbanded; South Africa is to  reduce its troops to 12,000. South African administrator Louis Pienaar is to  publish election rules, subject to U.N. approval.    June 3 -- Political prisoners to be freed; Namibian exiles to return.    July 1 -- South Africa's forces to be cut to 1,500; election campaigning to  begin.    Oct. 31 -- Half of Cuba's 50,000 troops are to have left Angola; rest are to  withdraw north of 13th Parallel.    Nov. 1 -- Elections are to be held for Namibian Constituent Assembly, empowered  to approve constitution for independent Namibia -- the independence date to be  decided.    Nov. 8 -- Remaining South African troops are to leave.    April 1, 1990 -- U.N. transition group's mandate is to end.    July 1, 1991 -- Cubans are to withdraw last troops.

The goodwill visit will also help boost Britain's chances of  selling military hardware as naval equipment is high on the  South Africans' shopping-list.    HMS Norfolk, the first of the Navy's most up-to-date Type 23  frigates, and its support vessel Royal Fleet Auxiliary Grey  Rover will visit Cape Town and Simonstown from January 27 to 31.    The visit follows an invitation by the chief of the South  African Navy, Vice-Admiral Robert Simpson-Anderson.    A United Nations ban on military contacts with South Africa  was lifted last October, reflecting the government's commitment  to end white rule.    And it is expected that sanctions preventing the sale of  military equipment to South Africa will be lifted following  elections in April.    UK Defence ministers and officials have been holding  discussions with the South African government and the ANC  [African National Congress] in preparation for the lifting of  the embargo.    The British government and defence industry can see  significant opportunities for sales of military equipment.    There is keen interest in buying naval equipment including  offshore patrol craft, maritime patrol aircraft and helicopters  because of concern about piracy around the South African coast.     "

0,FT944-17977 ,"FT944-17977 _AN-EJED5AG5FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (14): New initiatives in South Africa - Regional focus / A rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia      By MARK SUZMAN   As a glance through Johannesburg's leading business newspaper, Business Day, demonstrates, South Africa's days as a trade pariah are well and truly over. The pages are filled with news of new trade conferences, expos from all manner of countries, and a steady stream of high level ministerial visits - including two trips by America's Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown; visits from both British prime minister John Major; and the president of the British Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine - to try and boost international trade links. Reflecting the country's return to favour as a trading partner, there has been a substantial rise in the number of international institutions willing to provide trade finance for South African transactions and of governments giving export credit guarantees. Britain has been at the forefront of these new initiatives, and Mr Major announced a trade guarantee package of over R1bn during his recent visit, a move which makes South Africa one of the biggest markets for the UK's export credit guarantee programme. However, other countries have also been involved, with both Japan and the US announcing new packages and the European Union agreeing to grant South Africa GSP status from next January (although some key goods such as processed fruit and paper products will not be covered under the agreement following French pressure). And given South Africa's excellent payments record, the risks are relatively small. Another particularly interesting development is the rapid expansion of trade links with other developing countries, particularly in the rest of Africa and Asia. Trade delegations have been arriving from places as diverse as Nigeria, Malaysia, Taiwan and India. As a result, trade with these countries has been growing very rapidly over the past 12 months, albeit off a very low base, and businessmen on both sides are confident that these links will continue to expand. The new interest has been clearly signalled in South Africa's trade figures for the year, and its import bill has been soaring. In the first six months of the year, merchandise imports rose 21 per cent from 1993's levels and in August alone, they rocketed up by 20.8 per cent to a high of R8.07bn for the month. Also contributing to the surge is the desperate need by South African companies to modernise plant and equipment. After having let fixed investment decline to dangerously low levels during the crippling four-year recession that ended last year, many companies are now embarking on long-delayed capital spending, and machinery has accounted for nearly half of all imports. Given that South Africa has a notoriously high propensity to import during times of economic growth, this move may soon send the trade account into deficit. Indeed, the IBCA, the European ratings agency that recently gave South Africa a sub-investment grade rating of BB, cited this is one of the problems with the South African economy. Such an event is made even more likely by the government's declared commitment to start lowering import tariffs in line with the Gatt agreement, a process that began in July with the announcement that duties on motor cars would be reduced. However, despite this, South Africa continues to run a trade surplus, expected to be around R10bn on the year, and although import growth has far outstripped the rise in exports, the country's businessmen are confident that the tide will soon start to turn. South Africa's remains overwhelmingly dependent on mineral exports, particularly gold, but given the fact that the commodity cycle appears to have bottomed out and in light of the continued depreciation of the Rand, the mining industry is expecting a good year in 1995. The government's decision to start restructuring GEIS, South Africa's controversial R2bn a year export incentive scheme, which subsidises companies involved in manufacturing exports, may cause a short-term drop as companies are forced to cope with reduced government aid.

0,FT934-15493 ,"FT934-15493 _AN-DJLB5AA9FT 931012   FT  12 OCT 93 / S Africa open for business: A successful transition depends on the economy      By PHILIP GAWITH   MR Derek Keys, South Africa's finance minister, and the ANC president, Mr Nelson Mandela, are taking a joint message to the world: South Africa is back on the international stage, and it is united. Beneath this banner, the two men will be seeking foreign investment at a Confederation of British Industry conference in London today, in an effort to complete a reversal in economic fortunes which has gained momentum with the African National Congress's call for an end to economic sanctions and a new convergence between the ANC and the government on economic policy. The next step is the wooing of foreign investors, with the country needing foreign investment 'more than ever before', according to Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank. The urgency has come with a realisation that a successful political transition is going to depend on improving the dismal growth performance of recent years. The key issue is jobs. In its annual report the Reserve Bank estimates that the portion of the workforce unemployed, or involved in the informal sector of the economy, rose to 46 per cent in 1992, from 39 per cent in 1988. While some argue that this figure is overstated, none disputes that unemployment is a serious contributor to the high levels of violence in the country. Although a better agricultural season, a weaker rand and the mid-year flurry in the gold price should help the economy reverse three years of decline in 1993, there is widespread agreement that only restructuring will produce sustainable high growth. This will involve investing more and spending less, restoring investment as a percentage of GDP to something closer to 25 per cent than the low of 15.9 per cent reached in 1992. It will also require a substantially improved export performance. In the first flush of the post-sanctions era, the air has been positively thick with good will, especially abroad. Back at home, though, the going has been rougher, with the government embroiled in disputes about the issue of cellular telephone licences and a rise in the petrol price. Although the petrol dispute may yet drive the unions to mass action, economic policy is not the war zone it once was. These latest difficulties are much more a reflection of the transitional phase in which South Africa finds itself - in both cases the core objection of the ANC and its trade union ally Cosatu is that they were not adequately consulted - than of serious policy differences. Indeed, the ANC has now turned to soliciting the foreign investor with fervour. In a series of appearances in the US last month, both Mr Mandela and Mr Trevor Manuel, the ANC's economics spokesman, went out of their way to persuade investors that not only would they be 'very, very welcome' (Manuel) in South Africa, but they would not have to fear 'radical policies' (Mandela). As Mr Keys told a Washington investor conference, the 'best move' South Africa's policymakers can make is to equip a government of national unity, which South Africa will have after next April's elections, with a 'credible and attractive' economic policy. He believes South Africa's chances of achieving this are 'very good' and cites four recent events as constituting important steps towards this goal. They are the renegotiation of foreign debt repayments; the revised tariff reduction offer to Gatt in terms of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks; the negotiation of an Dollars 850m (Pounds 563m) loan from the IMF; and agreement on how South Africa will work with the World Bank. Certainly, finalising the debt agreement, and renewing ties with the IMF - South Africa last accessed IMF facilities in 1982 - immeasurably improve the country's creditworthiness. The Gatt offer is also crucial to South Africa's hopes of improving economic growth. All of this is music in the ears of foreign investors hoping for a business-friendly future under a new government. But the past is not far below the surface. It is a source of wry comfort to businessmen that the ANC has now taken to justifying what it describes as anti-trust policy in terms of the 'efficiency of markets' rather than the whites simply having too much.  ------------------------------------------------------     SOUTH AFRICA: AN ECONOMY THAT IS FOCUSING MINDS  ------------------------------------------------------                                 1990    1991    1992  ------------------------------------------------------ GDP growth                      -0.5    -0.4    -2.1 Inflation                       14.4    15.3    13.9 Budget deficit as % of GDP*      0.6     2.5     4.2  ------------------------------------------------------ *For fiscal year ending March 31 Source: Department of Finance  ------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Speaking at an ANC fundraising  dinner in East London, he also said neither he nor ANC President  Nelson Mandela had accepted an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland].    He said the ANC had been looking forward to the meeting  which  was to have been held with the Zulu king this week but was  cancelled. ""As of now we have never received any proposal from  the Zulu king as to what he wants so we don't know what he wants  apart from what was reported in the newspapers. We would like  to engage the king to hear what he wants and to see in what  manner whatever concerns he expresses can be addressed.""    Clearly, in legal, political and constitutional terms, and  in  ordinary reality there was no such thing as an independent  kwaZulu/Natal. The question of the secession of any part of  South Africa could not be decided on except through democratic  processes. ""Any matter that has to do with dismemberment of  South Africa in any way is a matter that would have to be  decided by the people of South Africa as a whole.""    He said the ANC had not agreed to a volkstaat. What it had  agreed was to continue discussions with what was now called the  Freedom Front on the idea of a volkstaat. ""To continue the  discussions and possibly conclude them before the elections,  we've agreed to that.""    A document agreed to by the ANC and the Afrikaner Volksfront  [Afrikaner National Union] in September last year stipulated  that any solution to the volkstaat question would have to be  consistent with the principles of democracy and non-racialism.  The two sides had agreed that any further discussion on the  issue should be guided by these principles. ""So the proponents  of a volkstaat have an obligation to make proposals about a  (territory) that would be democratic, non-racial,  anti-apartheid, resulting in peace, absence of conflict and so  on. If a volkstaat consistent with these principles can be  proposed, I don't think the ANC will have a problem with it.""  However no such proposal had been made. ""So there is no  volkstaat to be accepted by Nelson Mandela or myself.""     "

Only hours after Mr Mandela's call at the United Nations in New York, the US Senate approved legislation lifting US sanctions. Canada, Australia and the Commonwealth leadership said they would follow suit. Mr Mandela, urging that all economic sanctions against South Africa be lifted in an attempt to end the country's isolation, said victory against apartheid was in sight. Addressing a specially convened meeting of the UN Special Committee Against Apartheid, which has spearheaded the sanctions drive over the past three decades, Mr Mandela asked governments 'to take all necessary measures to end the economic sanctions you imposed'. His plea came a day after South Africa's parliament approved the creation of a multi-racial Transitional Executive Council giving blacks a say in government for the first time. Mr Mandela called on the international investment community to 'help regenerate the South African economy'. He said steps should be taken to prevent South Africa becoming another Somalia or Bosnia. Sanctions had brought it to the point 'where the transition to democracy has now been enshrined in the law of our country'. The passage of the South African legislation has been welcomed by President Bill Clinton as an 'historic step'. He said the US would launch 'initiatives to help restore economic growth' to South Africa. These include supporting South African access to the IMF and World Bank. Mr Mandela's call comes at the beginning of a crucial 10-day period in which senior officials of the government and the ANC will be seeking to convince investors and donors that they should invest in South Africa. Mr Clinton later announced that the commerce secretary, Mr Ron Brown, is to lead a trade and investment mission to South Africa to explore business opportunities, particularly with the black private sector.

The largest circulation newspaper carried the deputy foreign  minister's interview with its political correspondent Edyth  Bulbring on South Africa's foreign policy.    Pahad said the People's Republic of China is important for  South Africa not only because of the enormous trade potential,  but also because it is a permanent member of the United Nations  Security Council.    He pointed out that should South Africa establish diplomatic  ties with China, it would have to forgo the long-established  diplomatic ties with Taiwan.    However, he stated, Taiwan is one of South Africa's largest  trading partners.    ""In the final analysis, our decision will be determined by  our interests and international precedents.""    Pahad said given South Africa's sanctions-battered past, the  focus will be to increase favorable economic relations with its  traditional trading partners -- the United States and the  European Union.    But, he said his country will also be looking beyond  traditional partners to expand economic relations with, among  others, Canada, Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, India, the People's  Republic of China and Latin America.    Another area where links were unexplored is the Middle East,  not only for trade, investment and tourism but for oil, he said.     "

AFRICA SALES      From Reuters      ORLANDO, Fla.      Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.    While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.    ""If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break,"" said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.    Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.      Tax Bite, Loss Cited    Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.    ""We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites,"" he said.    Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.    Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.    The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.      Personnel Arrangements    Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will  remain there after the sale is completed in June.    ""An honest exchange of disagreement,"" Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.    The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.    ""It will set a precedent in terms of remaining indirect ties and in terms of  consultation with local workers about divestment,"" said Donna Katzin, speaking  for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.      One Company Remains    Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture of Chevron and Texaco, is the sole  remaining U.S. oil company doing business in South Africa.    In Cape Town, Jock McKenzie, chairman of Caltex Oil SA, said his company had no  intention of leaving South Africa.    He dismissed speculation that Caltex would follow the lead of Mobil and noted  in a statement that motions calling for the withdrawal of Texaco and Chevron  were overwhelmingly defeated in recent annual meetings of both companies.    Since 1985, more than 170 U.S. companies have left South Africa under pressure  from anti-apartheid groups.

AFRICA SALES      From Reuters      ORLANDO, Fla.      Although Mobil recently decided to sell its operations in South Africa, some  stockholders at the company's annual meeting Thursday complained that it has  not done enough to sever ties with the white-ruled nation.    While they applauded the sales, representatives of religious groups and an  official of New York City's pension fund pressed unsuccessfully for resolutions  that would cut Mobil's indirect economic ties with South Africa and end sales  of its petroleum products there.    ""If Mobil is pulling out of South Africa, then let it be a clean break,"" said  Kenneth Sylvester, director of Investment Responsibility for New York's office  of the comptroller.    Mobil announced two weeks ago that it was selling its South African unit to  General Mining Union Corp. for $150 million in cash, ending its role as the  largest U.S. employer in South Africa.      Tax Bite, Loss Cited    Mobil Chairman Allen Murray said a punitive U.S. tax law aimed at discouraging  investment in South Africa had resulted, in effect, in 72% taxation. The sale  will result in a book loss of $140 million.    Mobil had long contended that its continued presence in South Africa would do  more to combat apartheid than its leaving the country, and Murray voiced that  sentiment again Thursday.    ""We remain proud of what Mobil people have accomplished in South Africa in  their contributions to economic and social programs for nonwhites,"" he said.    Murray recommended that stockholders vote against the resolutions proposed by  the activists, and his advice was largely heeded. Only 14.3% of Mobil's shares  were voted in support of a resolution to sever all economic ties with South  Africa, while 15.5% were voted to end all petroleum sales to South Africa's  government.    Pressed by the activists, Murray said Mobil's trademark could be used by  Gencorp for as long as five years.    The activists also said Mobil had broken a promise to consult with its local  workers before the sale of the unit was arranged. Murray said that the workers  will enjoy the same benefits Mobil had provided, and he added that Gencorp has  promised not to lay off anyone for at least one year.      Personnel Arrangements    Mobil has a staff of about 2,800 in South Africa, all but two of whom will  remain there after the sale is completed in June.    ""An honest exchange of disagreement,"" Barbara Aires of the Sisters of Charity  of Saint Elizabeth said after the meeting. She was one of a group who  repeatedly questioned Murray about the terms of the sale and about Mobil's  indirect ties with South Africa.    The activists said they were asking Mobil to do more because its earlier  announcement was so significant.    ""It will set a precedent in terms of remaining indirect ties and in terms of  consultation with local workers about divestment,"" said Donna Katzin, speaking  for the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility.

0,FT944-10932 ,"FT944-10932 _AN-EKHDPAHVFT 941108   FT  08 NOV 94 / Survey of India (16): Silk, coffee and silicon chips - The southern state of Karnataka      By PAUL TAYLOR   Karnataka's chief minister, Mr M. Veerappa Moily, boasts that the south Indian state has 'substituted the red carpet for red tape' in its dealings with potential new investors. New foreign investments, he says, are handled by a single agency and cleared within 30 days. Judged by the number of Western high-tech companies which have operations in Bangalore, Karnataka's capital, Mr Moily's aggressively pro-business administration is succeeding, in this area at least. Over the past decade Bangalore has reinforced its claim to be India's Silicon Valley. Among the multinationals which have established operations in the leafy Bangalore environs are 3M, AT  T, Digital Equipment, L M Ericsson, Hewlett Packard, IBM, Motorola, Sanyo, Siemens, and Texas Instruments. Some are wholly owned subsidiaries, others joint ventures with Indian partners. India's eighth largest state in terms of both land area and population, Karnataka generates about Rs23bn of annual revenues from electronics and is responsible for about a fifth of India's total electronics output. A tenth of its 47m population lives in Bangalore, a city known for its pleasant climate and friendly people. Karnataka was one of the first states in India to industrialise and pioneered hydro-electric power in South-east Asia with the building of the Sivasamudram project in 1902. Ironically, although electric power was one of the catalysts for the early industrialisation of the state, today a shortage of power is one of the main constraints on economic growth. The big surge in industrialisation came in the 1940s and 1950s when the Indian government decided to base several big public sector companies in Bangalore including Bharat Electronics and Bharat Earth Movers, Hindustan Aeronautics, Hindustan Machine Tools and Indian Telephones Industries. These companies have played an important role in the state and have provided a strong magnet for ancillary companies, drawing in small-scale industries which could work as sub-contractors to the big industries. Today, Karnataka's main industries include electronics, computer engineering, computer software and services, telecommunications, aeronautics, machine tools, watch-making, electrical engineering, aluminium, steel, cement, sugar, food processing, textiles and mining. Other factors which have contributed to Karnataka's industrial growth have included an abundance of natural mineral resources including high grade iron ore, manganese and gold, a well developed network of research and research establishments, a large pool of engineers and a high literacy rate of 56 per cent compared with a national average of 52 per cent. Bangalore, which is 3,000 feet above sea level, also benefits from a particularly pleasant climate and relatively light rainfall. It is green with parks and tree-lined roads - quite unlike other big industrial or business centres, such as Bombay. It has become a popular city with young educated Indians who frequent Bangalore's many western-style bars, cafes and boutiques. There is therefore a large pool of talent which foreign companies in the electronics and computer software sectors in particular are keen to tap. The Indian Institute of Science, the Indian Space Research Institute, National Aeronautic Laboratory and the Central Machine Tool Institute are all to be found in Bangalore together with a large number of engineering colleges, training centres and universities. Bangalore in particular has become known as an important source of software engineering talent since the mid 1980s when many US technology companies realised that demand was far outstripping the supply in the US. Although wage rates are rising rapidly, foreign business leaders say it is still possible to hire graduate engineers for between Dollars 1,000 to Dollars 2,000 a month, a fraction of the cost of similarly qualified employees in the US. As a result many US, European and Asian information technology and telecommunications companies have established computer services operations in the state, mostly to service their internal software or chip design requirements. Foreign investors say they are attracted by the state's relatively good record in terms of labour relations, and usually harmonious community relations as well as the Karnataka government's positive attitude towards investors. 'Karnataka has been a magnet for foreign investment,' says Mr J C Lynn, the state's chief secretary. Among companies which have recently chosen to site their Indian headquarters in Bangalore are Brooke Bond, Lipton and Britannia. Under Mr Moily, whose tenure in office began in late 1992 after his predecessor was ousted because of alleged corruption, the state has drawn up a new development plan. As part of its industrial policy the state established the first 'electronic city' near Bangalore in the early 1980s and is developing two more electronic cities at Mysore and Dharwad. But despite this focus on electronics, Karnataka has also made considerable efforts to diversify its industrial and agricultural base. At Mangalore, Karnataka's main port, a large oil refinery has been built and is now being expanded. Similarly there are plans to expand steel and cement production elsewhere in the state. Irrigation schemes in the northern part of the state have allowed sugar-cane and rice to be grown in some areas, and the state is rich in teak, rosewood and sandalwood, particularly from Mysore, Karnataka's beautiful and historic second city. Karnataka accounts for nearly half of India's silk production and 80 per cent of the nation's coffee production. Sericulture employs about 200,000 people in the state and generates annual revenues of about Rs2.8bn including RS1.6bn of foreign exchange earnings. In industry, however, the rapid growth and development have brought new problems - in particular, shortages of power, water and transportation. Bangalore's airport has been brought up to international standards and there are tentative plans to alleviate the city's traffic problems by setting up a 15 mile elevated mass transport system. However, the top priority is to meet industry's appetite for electrical power which already outstrips supply. As a result many companies install their own generators. Mr Lynn, however, insists that the state can expand its power capacity.   Countries:-  INZ  India, Asia.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

The company said the result, which exceeded analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 120m, was achieved despite difficult economic and trading conditions in all its main markets and the weak dollar. The adverse impact of exchange rates in the second half was expected to affect full-year results by 4 per cent. Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said the company was 'cautious but confident' about the outlook for the second half; much would depend on trading over the Christmas period. He expected confidence to recover earlier in the UK among consumers than among retailers, who had responded to recession by tightly controlling stock levels. The company confirmed that it had looked at the French mineral water assets which the European Commission was forcing Nestle to sell, but said the price was unrealistically high. Sales in the first half rose to Pounds 1.47bn (Pounds 1.42bn). Earnings per share of 10.27p (10.16p), reflected dilution due to the recent share issue. Trading profit in the Americas rose 51 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 16.9m), helped by the acquisition of Aguas Minerales in Mexico, a reorganisation of US operations and improved productivity at the Mott's juice business. However, confectionery profits fell by 2 per cent. In the UK, trading profit rose to Pounds 61m (Pounds 51.8m). A late surge in demand due to good weather helped the Coca Cola-Schweppes Beverages joint venture raise profits by 63 per cent, while confectionery benefited from strong Easter sales. However, chocolate sales volumes fell 4 per cent in a declining market. In the rest of Europe profit declined by 32 per cent to Pounds 20.7m (Pounds 30.5m), reflecting tougher competition in beverages in France and and poor weather Spain. Cadbury also increased marketing expenditure in confectionery in response to product launches by Nestle. The contribution from the Pacific Rim contracted 12 per cent to Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 28.7m) on an 8 per cent drop in sales, reflecting poor weather in Australia and tougher conditions in Japan. Rising drinks sales in South Africa raised profit in the rest of the world to Pounds 8m (Pounds 6.9m). Net debt, at Pounds 491m, was Pounds 25m lower than a year earlier. The interim dividend is raised to 3.3p (3.2p). See Lex  The Financial Times   London Page 21  "

The announcement is disappointing for the government, which had been hoping for a BBB investment grade rating, but still puts it in the same category as countries such as Mexico, Hungary and Argentina. Mr John Major, the first British Prime Minister to visit South Africa since 1960, nevertheless struck an upbeat note at the end of his three day visit, saying that he had been deeply impressed by the ability and determination of the coalition government, which took power after elections in April. 'The South African government is well aware of the need to create the right climate for the private sector and private enterprise. 'They see no ideological barriers to creating that,' he said. South Africa has been seeking an international credit rating since its April elections and has appointed US investment bank Goldman Sachs to represent it to the major agencies. The price of South African government bonds fell on disappointment among domestic investors that the country had been assigned a sub-investment grade rating. As prices fell, yields rose by 28 basis points to 16.49 per cent. 'There is little surprise outside of South Africa about the decision, but the feeling within the country was that it would get an investment grade rating,' said Mr Graham Bell, of Baring Securities in London. He added: 'However, this reaction is likely to be short-lived. Ibca is not as widely recognised as Moody's and Standard  Poor's, the two major American agencies. 'Their ratings, expected next month, will provide more of a benchmark.' Although the country has borrowed money in the European markets without an official rating, the government is known be particularly keen to get access to the US market. If Moody's and SP give the same rating, this would preclude some major funds from buying South African bonds and force the country to pay a premium on any international issues it might make. In its June budget the government announced its intention to raise R1.8bn (Pounds 320m) from international capital markets in the current financial year. In its report the Ibca acknowledged South Africa benefited from good physical infrastructure, an advanced financial system, good managerial talent and relatively low foreign debt. However it warned that the economy's propensity to import remained high and said that exports remain overly dependent on primary commodities. Mr Christopher Huhne, Ibca Managing Director, said that although the rating may have been lower than government officials hoped, 'the overall tone of the report is optimistic. If the government can establish a credible fiscal track record over the next couple of years, the rating could well improve.' Mr Major, speaking in Johannesburg, said overseas investment was vital if South Africa was to generate the jobs needed to achieve economic prosperity and avoid social disruption. He urged British companies to add to the UK's Pounds 10bn investment in South Africa, which accounts for nearly half of all foreign investment. Economic liberalisation has been a key theme of Mr Major's three-day visit, during which he had talks with President Mandela, Deputy Presidents Mr Thabo Mbeki and Mr FW de Klerk, and cabinet ministers, including Finance Minister Mr Chris Liebenberg, and Chief Buthelezi, leader of the Inkatha Freedom party. Mr Major said the South African government would face 'many difficult problems' and forecast 'setbacks as well as advances'. The key to confidence would be clear indications that the government was moving in the right direction. 'I think that if that is the case the South African government, although there will be difficulties, will have every chance of carrying its programme through,' he said.

0,FT943-13711 ,"FT943-13711 _AN-EGRD8AFSFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (33): Missions abroad have doubled - Foreign policy      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   If South African newspaper headlines are taken at face value, President Nelson Mandela is the diplomatic equivalent of Superman. Barely a week has gone by since the new government took office without what is presented as yet another presidential foreign policy initiative, exciting unrealistic expectations. Mr Mandela is, it seems, single-handedly reforming the Organisation of African Unity, in which newly-admitted South Africa is 'destined to play a leading role in peacekeeping and conflict resolution', according to local reports. He is much in demand. Over the past few weeks Mr Mandela has been described as 'brokering' peace efforts in Rwanda and Angola, and contemplating imposing democracy on troubled Lesotho. Thanks to President Francois Mitterrand's invitation, he will attend the next gathering of Francophone states, while the French leader's championing of South Africa placed the country 'firmly on the agenda' at last week's Group of Seven leading industrial nations' meeting in Naples. Meanwhile South Africa has rejoined the Commonwealth and looks forward to playing an active role in the Non-Aligned Movement. New ties have also been forged with Japan. Tokyo's aid package, said to be worth R4bn, will, says Mr Mandela, help to 'kick-start' the country's reconstruction and development plan. But closer examination of the package suggests it may be worth less than the initial estimates suggest. If all this is not enough, President Mandela appeared on video at President Bill Clinton's White House conference on Africa last month to lend his weight to calls for a Marshall Plan for the continent, the name given to the US-led programme to rebuild Europe after the second world war. Included in Mr Mandela's speech was an appeal for radical measures to ease Africa's external debt burden. While these initiatives - real, imagined or exaggerated - take place, one arm of foreign policy seems to be operating with its past efficiency: the state-owned arms manufacturer, Armscor. With sanctions lifted, and its activities given the endorsement of Mr Joe Modise, defence minister, officials are now lifting at least a corner of the veil of secrecy. The defence industry provides 70,000 jobs and foreign exchange, say government officials, who add defensively: 'If we didn't sell weapons, someone else would.' To be fair to Mr Mandela, he and his senior advisers have tried to play down expectations. On the one hand, Mr Mandela's integrity and moral authority makes him the acceptable voice of Africa on behalf of its many causes. At the same time, he makes clear that that he has no easy answers to offer. Advisers also point out that an effective diplomatic role is not made easier by the fact that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in the throes of reorganisation. South African missions abroad have doubled since the transition to respectability began, while new entrants to the diplomatic service have to be trained, and suitable ambassadors found to replace many of the pre-election incumbents. Meanwhile the overstretched service is still getting to grips with issues in which it has had little or no experience. These range from getting to know the OAU to the implications of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade deal, or reconciling relations with countries with whom ties were initially forged by the African National Congress, or the former government. Thus, the new South Africa has to weigh its relationship with Taiwan, one of its biggest trading partners, against recently-established official links with the People's Republic of China. The latter's trading potential is bigger, and its position as permanent member of the UN Security Council will have to be taken into account by Pretoria should South Africa have aspirations for a council seat as Africa's representative. Nominally in charge of this demanding portfolio is Mr Alfred Nzo, the foreign minister. His surprising appointment is put down to years of loyal service to the ANC. It may also be explained by the fact that policy will be shaped by Mr Mandela himself, and his senior deputy president, Mr Thabo Mbeki. As the initial euphoria and excitement dies down, South Africa's foreign policy is likely to become more cautious. Mr Aziz Pahad, the deputy foreign minister, acknowledges the dangers of taking on too much. But expectations are nevertheless high. In an interview with the Financial Times he echoes the explanation he gave to the Johannesburg Sunday Times: 'We have captured the moral high ground in nonracialism, democracy and conflict resolution to become the world leader in this area.' First of all, however, South Africa has to consolidate its success and build a stable, flourishing, democracy: 'If we don't sink, they (Africa's donors and creditors) see the hope that the region won't sink, and if the region doesn't sink, they see some hope of a breakthrough in the development of other parts of Africa.' Mr Pahad hopes that foreign investors do not ignore South Africa's neighbours: 'If you don't have mutually advantageous regional development, illegal immigrants will come to South Africa and, given that our borders are so big, we will not be able to prevent it.'

0,FT921-13556 ,"FT921-13556 _AN-CAUBNACXFT 920121   FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: South Africa in Ecu250m landmark offering      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   SOUTH AFRICA's return to world capital markets yesterday received considerable impetus with the announcement that the government was raising Ecu250m (R890m). The issue is the first by South Africa in the Ecu market since 1984, and follows the country's re-entry last September into world capital markets with a DM400m issue, after an absence of six years. The issue, which was mostly pre-placed, is 'new money', unlike the D-Mark issue, half of which was used to refinance a maturing issue. The issue underlines the change in attitudes towards South Africa since the dark days of mid-1985, when the refusal of foreign banks to roll over the country's loans forced South Africa to declare a standstill on debt repayment. Since then, Pretoria has maintained what Mr Gerhard Croeser, director-general of the department of finance, yesterday called a 'meticulous' record in meeting debt commitments and complying with the conditions of the three Interim Debt Arrangements, to which South Africa's foreign debt has been subjected since the 1985 standstill. The South African authorities believe the launch also showed that international investors felt the country's political and economic prospects had been enhanced by the formation in December of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for the country's constitutional negotiations. The funds, Mr Croeser said, would contribute towards the financing of the national budget, play an important role in strengthening the country's reserves, and promote economic stability and the further normalisation of South Africa's relations with its foreign creditors. Strengthening the country's foreign reserves is particularly important as it will allow the Reserve Bank (central bank) to pursue a less restrictive monetary policy, and enhance economic growth. In recent years, South Africa's ability to finance economic growth has been constrained by the need to export savings to finance debt repayments. The country exported about R30bn of capital in this way between 1986 and 1990. In international terms, South Africa is an under-borrowed country. Total external debt at December 1990 totalled USDollars 19.3bn, equivalent to 70.2 per cent of annual export earnings. The interest service ratio is 7.1 per cent. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 23.7bn at the end of August 1985, when the standstill on international borrowing was declared. The Ecu issue, for maturity in 1997, has a coupon of 10.375 per cent. The Department of Finance said this was a premium of about 1.77 basis points over the average for three benchmark Ecu issues, of similar maturity, by Spain, Norway and Belgium. The premium is partly a function of political risk, the debt standstill, and the fact that having been out of the market for so long, South Africa lacks liquid issues, and it is liquidity which brings marketability and a lower price. Last week Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the country would push for a final debt arrangement to deal with the outstanding Dollars 5bn when the third interim arrangement ended in 1993. He said a further arrangement was necessary because South Africa could not afford to repay the whole amount in 1993. The removal of the debt standstill, and South Africa's readmission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are the biggest remaining obstacles to the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international financial community.

0,FT932-3840 ,"FT932-3840 _AN-DFKB5AG1FT 930611   FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (4): In search of skills and technology - Resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained recovery      By TONY HAWKINS   AFTER a decade of political turmoil, sanctions and disinvestment, few multinationals have been perched on the end of their chairs waiting for Nelson Mandela to give the green light to invest in South Africa. But with investment at its lowest level for more than 30 years (15.9 per cent of GDP), and with capital pouring out of the country at the rate of 2.8 per cent of GDP between 1985 and 1992 the resumption of foreign investment is crucial to sustained recovery. Little is likely to materialise in the near term, though in both business and government there are high hopes of resumed access to IMF and the World Bank funding once agreement is reached at the constitutional negotiations. Welcome though this will be, what South Africa desperately needs is substantial direct investment inflows, bringing with them skills, technology and market access. The Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre (IRRC) estimates that between 1984 and 1991, 214 US firms or about two thirds of those with investments in South Africa disinvested. As a result, the stock of US direct investment fell to Dollars 700m at the end of the 1980s from Dollars 2.6bn at the start. Another 190 non-US firms have left during the same period, the majority British-owned. Many foreign firms retained non-equity links with South Africa, which could limit the number of returnees. There have been some moves since the sanctions thaw began three years ago with Mr Mandela's release. The IRRC says 16 US companies have quietly opened offices or established subsidiaries in the past two years, including four of the 168 US corporations that disinvested between 1985 and 1990. Six of the new entrants were in the software and computer businesses. There are now 119 US corporations with direct investments or employees in South Africa, with many more likely to set up shop once second-tier sanctions, operated by more than 60 city, county and state organisations penalising US firms doing business in South Africa, are lifted. Britain is by far the biggest player with the UK-South Africa Trade Association estimating British investment, direct and portfolio, at more than Dollars 16bn. The London School of Economics Centre for the Study of the South African Economy and International Finance, has identified 51 new investments in the country since late 1989. While stressing that its database is incomplete the centre estimates the inflow of new direct investment over the past three years at around Dollars 1.5bn or 1.5 per cent of GNP. The LSE Centre found that the bulk of the resumed foreign investment has focused on a narrow range of activities - those that are highly vertically integrated, knowledge and communications intensive and quality dependent. More than 85 per cent of the investments identified since 1989 were in five sectors - beverages, hotels and leisure, electronics, chemicals and oils and engineering. According to the IRRC, a feature of renewed US investment is the switch from equity to non-equity links, with the number of US companies with non-equity links increasing from 184 to 299. South African Reserve Bank figures show a similar trend. The Bank's census of foreign transactions for 1989, just released, makes a distinction between direct and non-direct investments, noting that the share of the latter has risen from 46 per cent of the total in 1973 to more than 76 per cent in 1989. Since South Africa fell off the foreign investment agenda of most global firms in the mid-1980s, the rules of the game have changed. Today's global business is unenthusiastic about natural resource investments in mining and less likely than 20 years ago to be attracted by plentiful labour, even when it is low-cost. The key attractions today are markets and skills and because South Africa is a long way from the Triad markets of North America, the EC and the Far East and has little to offer on the skills front, new foreign investors - as distinct from those already there - may well be thin on the ground. The more so if the new government insists on codes of conduct, social programmes, affirmative action, and expatriate and local value-added quotas. The fact is that global competition for inward investment is intense and there are already enough disincentives to investment in South Africa without throwing up new obstacles that do not apply elsewhere in the third world. Pessimism can be overdone. A peaceful, stable South Africa must become the logical headquarters for African operations and the platform for developing exports and markets in the sub-Saharan region.

""We are meeting at a time to celebrate the  victory of South Africa but also to stop the agony of the  conflict in Rwanda and Africa as a whole,"" he told the  correspondent of the PAN AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA) in Tunis.  The situation in Rwanda, he said, would remain one of concern  as long the parties to the conflict failed to agree on a  ceasefire. ""We are actively involved in getting Africans to  contribute troops for peacekeeping and are quite satisfied with  the response,"" [word indistinct] Salim. Apart from Ghana,  Ethiopia and Senegal, he said, Congo and Nigeria had given firm  commitments to contribute forces. He said some African  countries which were unable to contribute troops had offered  other help in resolving the crisis. Namibia, Salim said, had  pledged 500,000 US dollars to assist UNAMIR [UN Assistant  Mission in Rwanda] in the peacekeeping mission. ""The African  commitment and African readiness to do something is there,"" he  said. The current ministerial session, he said, would focus on  how to strengthen the organisation's capacity to manage and  prevent conflicts but would also create conditions for what he  called the ""second liberation of the continent.""    Speaking earlier at a press conference Salim said the  peaceful elections in South Africa was a miracle, commending the  spirit of reconciliation in which the elections were held and an  all-race government installed. ""South Africa has demonstrated  something more: It has shown that notwithstanding the  complexity of a situation, given national dialogue, leadership  and foresight, it is possible to resolve the most intractable  problem including that of Rwanda,"" he said.    Rwanda is represented at the current session by the foreign  minister of the interim government, Jerome Bicamumpaka. The  Rwanda Patriotic Front is represented by Bizimungu Pasteur,  member of the front's executive committee and minister designate  for internal affairs of the broadbased government put in place  after the Arusha August 1993 accord. Rwanda's warring parties  ended ceasefire talks last week without making progress towards  a truce and with the front vowing to fight on. The OAU is  supporting international efforts to bring to account the  individual leaders responsible for the killings in the country.  The carnage has claimed 500,000 lives in eight weeks.     "
0,FT944-58 ,"FT944-58 _AN-FAAACADJFT 941231   FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: How to remain safe in Africa - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots)      By JDF JONES   I was once staying in a game lodge in Uganda when a Belgian tourist met a painful death because he tried to feed a sugar lump to an elephant. No doubt his friends back home concluded that Africa was a dangerous place and resolved never to visit the savage continent. They would not have understood that this had been a most rare and unlikely accident. Many potential visitors to South Africa, who do not already know the country, probably have similar, and excessive, fears about what might happen to them. After all, an awful lot of people get killed there - you see it on television all the time, and this is no longer political violence but criminal (ie anyone can be a victim). South Africa is a world leader in the incidence of violent crime (just one statistic: 60 of every 100,000 South Africans are likely to be murdered next year, compared with 10 in the US and two in Britain). The overall crime rate continues to rise, with heavy increases in rape and assault this year. Is this not bound to enter the mind of the first-time visitor? Is it safe (or rather, because South Africa palpably is not as 'safe' as Bournemouth or Biarritz) - is it safe enough? The answer, as foreigners begin to pour into South Africa to visit this most beautiful of countries, is that the new South Africa is adequately 'safe' so long as you are sensible, which is to try to understand the roots and the manifestations of a security situation which obviously cannot be compared with the Cotswolds: The present situation in certain districts of the big cities is undeniably tricky, by which I mean that it demands caution and commonsense on the part of the visitor. Downtown Johannesburg is the best example: you would not dream of walking the streets after dusk and you would exercise some care during daylight. More generally, the visitor should learn the habit of locking car doors on the inside, concealing handbags and parcels, driving through red lights if there are suspicious youths at the junction, not flaunting jewellery, not carrying too much cash. Outside the towns, the open countryside is much safer on the nerves. But the sensible rules still apply: do not drive through certain areas (eg the Transkei) at night - not so much because of any danger of brigands as of cattle on the unfenced roads; do not drive yourself into a township unless you have a guide or know where you are going; do not pick up people at the roadside without looking carefully; and do not go walking in remote areas without taking advice (best to stick to the national parks, where security is good). Bear in mind that South Africa has an appalling record for simple road accidents. Drive very carefully. There is no point in denying that South Africa today is an even more violent society than it used to be, which is saying something. But that does not begin to make it a no-go area. Let us keep a sense of proportion. How much of the above would also apply to New York City or Florida, Rio or Zimbabwe? I am writing this from a delightful hotel on the Indian Ocean coast of the Transkei. We are protected by an electrified fence. At least, that is what it says: I have not tested whether the current is turned on. PS: I am actually filing this piece from another, equally delightful hotel on the edge of Zululand. We are only a few miles from an area where horrifying tribal bloodletting has featured in the international press this year, yet they do not bother to lock the doors.

0,FT943-3029 ,"FT943-3029 _AN-EIPC9AAZFT 940916   FT  16 SEP 94 / Wallenberg in call to slash state spending      By HUGH CARNEGY      STOCKHOLM   Mr Peter Wallenberg, Sweden's most powerful industrialist, yesterday called for deep spending cuts to tackle the country's mounting state debt, saying further deterioration could 'in the worst case' lead to pressure on Wallenberg companies to move their headquarters overseas. Mr Wallenberg's warning, in a newspaper interview, came three days before a general election in which the main issue has been the extent of spending cuts needed in the country's extensive welfare system. These are required to curb the budget deficit and control a public debt running at close to 100 per cent of gross national product. His call followed a similar intervention earlier this week by the chiefs of Volvo, Ericsson, Stora and the Swedish division of ABB, the country's four biggest exporters. They warned that new investments of up to SKr50bn (Pounds 4.2bn) a year were at risk if higher tax levels made Sweden less competitive. Ericsson, Stora and ABB all fall within the Wallenberg sphere of influence. Mr Wallenberg said if the deficit was not controlled there was a risk that Sweden's credit rating would be lowered. In that case, Swedish companies would be under pressure to relocate to secure lower interest rates on the funding they required. 'It can in the worst case make it difficult for us to stay in Sweden,' he told Expressen newspaper. He said the government needed to take 'a motor-saw' to state spending. 'I am genuinely worried for Sweden,' he added. 'If the politicians do not take the situation seriously, with substantial measures against the budget deficit, things will go badly.' The highly unusual interventions in the election campaign by the top industrialists are widely seen as being aimed at the opposition Social Democratic party, which is expected to lead the new government, although latest polls have shown a shift towards the right-centre coalition of Mr Carl Bildt, prime minister. Business leaders have criticised the SDP's emphasis on tax increases to match spending cuts as a way to cut the deficit. But it is not clear to what extent the industrialists' interventions have been responsible for the tilt towards Mr Bildt's coalition. The Social Democrats believe they the business leaders may have irritated many voters instead. Yesterday, Mr Wallenberg's advisers denied were at pains to deny that he had intended any threat to voters about how they should vote - or that he was suggesting the whole Wallenberg empire might move abroad. They protested strongly to the tabloid newspaper Expressen over a front page headline suggesting this. Mr Wallenberg's hitherto high public standing was also under unprecedented fire yesterday over remarks he made on television denigrating the abilities of black people in South Africa. 'There are a few well-educated blackies' in South Africa, he said, but blacks did not have the competence to run South Africa without help from the white minority. He later apologised fpr the remarks. Observer, Page 17   Countries:-  SEZ  Sweden, West Europe.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.   Types:-  NEWS  General News.

The row, which threatened to overshadow a three-day official visit to South Africa by Mr Major, erupted after Lady Thatcher during a trip to India dismissed South Africa's hopes of attracting international investment. She told businessmen at an official British gathering in Bombay that investors were afraid of violence and social unrest in South Africa, in spite of the formation of a government of national unity after the country's first all-race elections in April. 'What you are getting is people who look at the rest of Africa. They say 'Look at Rwanda, look at Somalia'. Are we going to have the same thing happening in South Africa?' she said. Lady Thatcher, who also described Nigeria as 'a terrible mess', pointed to tensions between Zulu leaders as evidence of continuing friction in South Africa. 'There will be a certain amount of trouble there. This is why people are holding back,' she said. However, after a vigorous rejection of her views by Mr Major and British business leaders, Lady Thatcher issued a statement saying that she 'fully supports the new democratic government of South Africa and feels that the country will attract the inward investment it so much needs'. In a clear attempt to repair the diplomatic damage in South Africa, the statement said that Lady Thatcher 'further hopes that the prime minister's present mission to that country will be highly successful'. Her views contrasted with the tone of Mr Major's visit, during which he has expressed confidence in the South African government's ability to achieve economic prosperity. British officials are also aware that Lady Thatcher is a controversial figure among black leaders, many of whom were angered by her reluctance to endorse sanctions against the former all-white government. Without responding directly, Mr Major went as far as he could to rebuke Lady Thatcher without naming her, suggesting that she was out of touch with events in South Africa. 'I do not think there is a shred of doubt about the confident future South Africa can look forward to,' he said. 'You don't have to sit back in your armchair abroad and wonder what is happening. People should come here. It would be good for South Africa and good for them too.' Mr Major told businessmen that optimism about South Africa's future was well founded.

And it emerged that Mandela is being seen by fellow African  heads of state as a key to mediating in the Rwandan and Angolan  wars. Mandela's spokesman, Joel Netshitenzhe, said yesterday  both Rwandan government and rebel representatives had asked to  meet Mandela to seek his help in resolving the bloody conflict.  He said Mandela would meet the two parties.    Addressing a press conference at the SA embassy in Tunis  yesterday, Mandela also revealed he had discussed the Angolan  war with President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola and President  Mobutu of Zaire during the Organisation of African Unity summit  in Tunis.    He reiterated his willingness to meet UNITA [Total  Independence for the Liberation of Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi  to help resolve the Angolan dispute.    On possible reparations by South Africa to African  countries,  he said no compensation would be offered to countries that had  helped in the liberation struggle because they had done it not  for reward but from a sense of duty.    Mandela was asked how the Government would respond to  requests for reparations in the light of indications that the  Angolan government might seek such payments.    ""We are prepared to discuss issues with the aim of resolving  past differences, and if we have the resources and there is a  demand that we should make reparations we will have to consider  that matter seriously"".    He said that if a complaint was made by a neighbouring  country about damage done by the previous government ""we cannot  take the attitude that, look this was a minority government, we  are not responsible for its crimes.    ""But the matter will have to be discussed very carefully.    ""We too were involved in the struggle as organisations and  as  people not affiliated to any particular organisation.    ""Now that we are free we are not going to give any material  resources to the people who took part in the struggle other than  to help to raise their living standards to ensure that they have  a secure future.    ""It was in that spirit that the continent of Africa helped  us.""    Asked whether Deputy President F.W. de Klerk's failure to  attend certain recent functions indicated a split between him  and the president, Mandela said both he and De Klerk at times  had to miss functions because of the pressure of other duties.

[Derycke] During the parliamentary debate, it was only the  Flemish Bloc which shocked me, arguing for the abandoning of an  Africa which they see as on the road to ruin. If that is the  position of Belgian society, as the Flemish Bloc claims, then I  am almost ashamed to be Belgian. Europe has a tradition which  will not allow it to act in this way. I have also been  surprised by the extent to which certain deputies, and no doubt  public opinion, are ill-informed on the subject of Rwanda,  unaware that we have redirected 80 percent of our aid for this  country to basic activities, far removed from political  intrigues.    [Stroobants] Specifically?    [Derycke] In the field of education, health care, and  agriculture we have given the minimum necessary for these people  who, without us, would have nothing. In the future, we will  have to discuss cooperation within the government, with the  Parliament, and with the people. Like everyone else, I too am  pained by the death of our paratroopers and civilians. They  were all in Rwanda to help with the country's democratization.  But we must not forget that the drama experienced by the vast  majority of Rwandans is, at the very least, as awful as our own.    [Stroobants] Could democracy really be envisaged in Rwanda?    [Derycke] We created an elite which was ready for democracy,  in accordance with the policy defined by the European Union.  Africa is not entirely a disaster, even if seven or eight  countries are still lagging behind on the question of freedoms.  The other donor countries must understand this, together with  the IMF and the World Bank. The socio-economic problems, the  poverty, are also factors which partly explain what is happening.    [Stroobants] Belgian cooperation will continue?    [Derycke] We are already providing humanitarian aid, as of  today. For the rest, it is clear that we must now consider the  situation and it is not going to start up again overnight. But  I cannot stand those who say ""It's all over, let them get on  with it."" Africa can be our principal partner. Improving the  life of the people of Africa can also bring benefits for us. I  myself am proud that Belgium is maintaining a policy of  cooperation. In 80 percent of the countries we aid, the policy  is a genuine success. [passage omitted]     "

This was the message which Organisation of African  Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his  discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and  roleplayers.    Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25  February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and  political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive  political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa  and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the  process. ""No stone should be left unturned to see even at this  11th hour if a solution can be found.""    He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. ""This is a  challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be  successful,"" he said.    Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in  Ulundi earlier on Friday had been ""very interesting and candid"".  The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations  to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out  to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all  parties took part.    Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in  any  negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make  compromises. The government and the ANC had made some  ""significant"" concessions, he said.    Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were  reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to  decide.    The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which  Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the  democratic process, like respecting and understanding the  country's cultural diversity, he said.    Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's  future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each  other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had  indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic  process, he said.    During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth  talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik  Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress  Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral  Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet  state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.     "

It was only a few days ago that he toured this huge black township, looking in  on a migrant workers' hostel reeking of human waste, a primary school and a new  shopping center where he stopped to buy a pack of Camel Lights.    When he appeared at the door of a neat yellow stucco home, he surprised  Henrietta Mafokosho by asking if she'd give him and his wife a house tour.    ""I was shivering,"" Mafokosho, 21, recalled. ""I couldn't believe such a great  man was here in my house, shaking my hand. He's a nice guy.""    There haven't been many white South African leaders in this troubled country's  history whom Sowetans would call great men -- or even, for that matter, nice  guys. But De Klerk is like none before him.    Since he was sworn into office a year ago last week, the 54-year-old head of  state has shaken up South Africa and the world with his stunning reform  program.    Upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Sunday, he  quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and declared that his nation  is on ""a great journey"" toward full democracy.    A smiling De Klerk, recalling the words of King, said: ""Peace and freedom are  the goals of all men. South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a  journey for full democracy at home, and abroad full participation in the family  of nations.""    He added that ""the new South Africa is at hand"" and promised that the ""walls of  apartheid are coming down.""    De Klerk, who meets President Bush today, has said his mission is to persuade  Americans that he is serious about reform.    ""Many people (in America) are still looking at South Africa through glasses  they should have discarded by now,"" De Klerk said before embarking on his trip.  He added that it would be ""a great challenge to change the image burned into  their minds by years and years"" of violent scenes from South Africa on their  television screens.    But the trip comes as De Klerk's program to dismantle apartheid and begin  negotiations, warmly welcomed both here and abroad, runs into its most serious  difficulties since the government opened talks with the African National  Congress in May.    A month of factional violence in Johannesburg-area townships has left more than  760 dead and put new obstacles on the road to peace. De Klerk has sent extra  police into the townships in Operation Iron Fist, which seemed to halt the  trouble, at least temporarily.    The president also ordered razor wire put up around flash points of trouble,  prepared to impose curfews beginning Tuesday and declared a 10-day amnesty for  the surrender of dangerous weapons.    The ANC has criticized the crackdown, saying it amounts to a reimposition of  the state of emergency and is designed to repress legitimate political  activity. The ANC blames the current violence on right-wing white agitators who  are stoking black fighting to undermine the peace process.    De Klerk says the fighting stems primarily from ethnic and political  differences among blacks, although he says it is possible other, unknown,  forces are behind some of the attacks.    Incidents of unrest have increased sharply since De Klerk normalized black  political activity by legalizing the ANC and other black organizations in a  landmark speech Feb. 2.    The rising expectations of blacks living in ghettos has touched off hundreds of  demonstrations. Some have been peaceful but others have been broken up with  police tear gas and bullets.    A recent judicial inquiry recommended that charges be brought against three  dozen black and white police officers who killed five demonstrators without  provocation in Sebokeng during a March protest.    The scenes of unrest have been replayed nightly for nervous whites on state-run  television, driving many into the lap of the government's right-wing political  opponents.    Adding to De Klerk's woes is the almost daily criticism from militant white  groups who complain that whites suspected in right-wing attacks and bombings  have been detained without cause and tortured while in custody. Police  officials express private fears for De Klerk's life.    The growing power of the right wing has put pressure on the president to prove  that his reforms will be good for the country's whites in the long run.    ""De Klerk tries to project an image of sweet reasonableness, and he's done it  successfully,"" said Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch  University. ""But in the next six months, he'll have to deliver some of that  sweetness.""    Most analysts agree that the lifting of economic and other sanctions against  South Africa would go a long way toward easing the anxieties of whites, who  have been financially and emotionally hurt by the campaign to isolate them from  the West's markets, culture and sports fields.    ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, during a U.S. tour in June, won assurances  from many congressional leaders that sanctions will remain in place until  apartheid reform is irreversible. The ANC says that point has not yet been  reached.    So far, De Klerk has said he's disappointed that foreign governments have  refused ""to acknowledge that the process in South Africa has become  irreversible. We sincerely say . . . there will be a new constitution. And that  constitution will be fair and just.    ""The time is right for the international community to re-evaluate the situation  and to put their money where their mouths are,"" De Klerk added.    The president said, though, that he did not come to the United States ""with hat  in hand"" to plead for an end to sanctions. ""That will take care of itself as  South Africans prove that we mean business,"" he said.    Sanctions against South Africa, passed over President Reagan's veto in 1986,  are among the most severe Pretoria faces. The American law outlines specific  steps that must be taken by the South African government before the  Administration can consider removing those sanctions.    The Bush Administration believes De Klerk has met most of those conditions. One  obstacle will be removed when the government releases about 2,500 political  prisoners. The government and the ANC have agreed on a plan to identify and  release those activists, beginning in a matter of weeks.    A more formidable obstacle is the lifting of the state of emergency in Natal  province. Three years of black faction fighting in Natal between supporters of  Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has  killed nearly 4,000 people.    Even if De Klerk receives no promises from Washington, the trip still will be  heralded back home as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The last South African  leader to visit the United States was Gen. Jan Smuts, in 1945, three years  before the National Party came to power.    Many white South Africans have chafed under the diplomatic and economic  isolation engendered by their country's system of apartheid, which segregates  neighborhoods, schools and hospitals and denies the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    Since 1983, the number of American firms doing business in South Africa has  dropped from 386 to 129. Nevertheless, many South Africans still admire  Americans and delight in American entertainment and products.    Two of the most popular programs on state-run television are ""LA Law"" and  ""thirtysomething."" Theaters here show many American movies. And South Africans  snap up everything from American canned goods to computers -- despite mark-ups  that average 400% of the U.S. sales price.    De Klerk's promises to negotiate a new constitution that will end apartheid and  extend voting rights to black people has greatly improved Pretoria's relations  with the United States, Europe and Africa. But that has yet to translate into  trade agreements to aid South Africa's sagging economy. Many foreign  governments are looking for more concrete signs of change.    The president already has promised that the next session of Parliament, which  opens in February, 1991, will scrap the Group Areas Act, a pillar of apartheid  that carves the country into separate neighborhoods for blacks, mixed-race  Coloreds, Indians and whites.    He has moved less quickly on opening schools. White public schools will be  allowed to open their doors to blacks next year if 72% of a school's parents  agree. But the government still maintains veto power and, even in integrated  schools, whites still will get first choice for openings.    De Klerk has been heartened, though, by the warm reception many blacks in South  Africa have given to his reform program. The graffiti artists in South Africa's  townships have splattered his first initials -- ""Viva F. W."" -- next to their  anti-apartheid slogans.    And recent opinion polls suggest that if a multiracial election were held  today, the white Afrikaner president would get one in five black votes.  (Mandela would get three of the other four.)    De Klerk was cheered by hundreds of Sowetans during his recent tour here. Many  were surprised to hear him admit that the conditions of many township  residents, especially those living in the hostels that have been the flash  points of recent violence, ""were absolutely unacceptable.""    ""My impression is that so much needs to be done,"" he said.    He had told Soweto primary school pupils that he and ""other leaders, the black  leaders, all of us, are trying to work out a new South Africa in which you will  be able to live happily.""

It was only a few days ago that he toured this huge black township, looking in  on a migrant workers' hostel reeking of human waste, a primary school and a new  shopping center where he stopped to buy a pack of Camel Lights.    When he appeared at the door of a neat yellow stucco home, he surprised  Henrietta Mafokosho by asking if she'd give him and his wife a house tour.    ""I was shivering,"" Mafokosho, 21, recalled. ""I couldn't believe such a great  man was here in my house, shaking my hand. He's a nice guy.""    There haven't been many white South African leaders in this troubled country's  history whom Sowetans would call great men -- or even, for that matter, nice  guys. But De Klerk is like none before him.    Since he was sworn into office a year ago last week, the 54-year-old head of  state has shaken up South Africa and the world with his stunning reform  program.    Upon his arrival at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington on Sunday, he  quoted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and declared that his nation  is on ""a great journey"" toward full democracy.    A smiling De Klerk, recalling the words of King, said: ""Peace and freedom are  the goals of all men. South Africa has embarked on a great journey. It is a  journey for full democracy at home, and abroad full participation in the family  of nations.""    He added that ""the new South Africa is at hand"" and promised that the ""walls of  apartheid are coming down.""    De Klerk, who meets President Bush today, has said his mission is to persuade  Americans that he is serious about reform.    ""Many people (in America) are still looking at South Africa through glasses  they should have discarded by now,"" De Klerk said before embarking on his trip.  He added that it would be ""a great challenge to change the image burned into  their minds by years and years"" of violent scenes from South Africa on their  television screens.    But the trip comes as De Klerk's program to dismantle apartheid and begin  negotiations, warmly welcomed both here and abroad, runs into its most serious  difficulties since the government opened talks with the African National  Congress in May.    A month of factional violence in Johannesburg-area townships has left more than  760 dead and put new obstacles on the road to peace. De Klerk has sent extra  police into the townships in Operation Iron Fist, which seemed to halt the  trouble, at least temporarily.    The president also ordered razor wire put up around flash points of trouble,  prepared to impose curfews beginning Tuesday and declared a 10-day amnesty for  the surrender of dangerous weapons.    The ANC has criticized the crackdown, saying it amounts to a reimposition of  the state of emergency and is designed to repress legitimate political  activity. The ANC blames the current violence on right-wing white agitators who  are stoking black fighting to undermine the peace process.    De Klerk says the fighting stems primarily from ethnic and political  differences among blacks, although he says it is possible other, unknown,  forces are behind some of the attacks.    Incidents of unrest have increased sharply since De Klerk normalized black  political activity by legalizing the ANC and other black organizations in a  landmark speech Feb. 2.    The rising expectations of blacks living in ghettos has touched off hundreds of  demonstrations. Some have been peaceful but others have been broken up with  police tear gas and bullets.    A recent judicial inquiry recommended that charges be brought against three  dozen black and white police officers who killed five demonstrators without  provocation in Sebokeng during a March protest.    The scenes of unrest have been replayed nightly for nervous whites on state-run  television, driving many into the lap of the government's right-wing political  opponents.    Adding to De Klerk's woes is the almost daily criticism from militant white  groups who complain that whites suspected in right-wing attacks and bombings  have been detained without cause and tortured while in custody. Police  officials express private fears for De Klerk's life.    The growing power of the right wing has put pressure on the president to prove  that his reforms will be good for the country's whites in the long run.    ""De Klerk tries to project an image of sweet reasonableness, and he's done it  successfully,"" said Sampie Terreblanche, a political analyst at Stellenbosch  University. ""But in the next six months, he'll have to deliver some of that  sweetness.""    Most analysts agree that the lifting of economic and other sanctions against  South Africa would go a long way toward easing the anxieties of whites, who  have been financially and emotionally hurt by the campaign to isolate them from  the West's markets, culture and sports fields.    ANC Deputy President Nelson Mandela, during a U.S. tour in June, won assurances  from many congressional leaders that sanctions will remain in place until  apartheid reform is irreversible. The ANC says that point has not yet been  reached.    So far, De Klerk has said he's disappointed that foreign governments have  refused ""to acknowledge that the process in South Africa has become  irreversible. We sincerely say . . . there will be a new constitution. And that  constitution will be fair and just.    ""The time is right for the international community to re-evaluate the situation  and to put their money where their mouths are,"" De Klerk added.    The president said, though, that he did not come to the United States ""with hat  in hand"" to plead for an end to sanctions. ""That will take care of itself as  South Africans prove that we mean business,"" he said.    Sanctions against South Africa, passed over President Reagan's veto in 1986,  are among the most severe Pretoria faces. The American law outlines specific  steps that must be taken by the South African government before the  Administration can consider removing those sanctions.    The Bush Administration believes De Klerk has met most of those conditions. One  obstacle will be removed when the government releases about 2,500 political  prisoners. The government and the ANC have agreed on a plan to identify and  release those activists, beginning in a matter of weeks.    A more formidable obstacle is the lifting of the state of emergency in Natal  province. Three years of black faction fighting in Natal between supporters of  Mandela's ANC and Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party has  killed nearly 4,000 people.    Even if De Klerk receives no promises from Washington, the trip still will be  heralded back home as a major diplomatic breakthrough. The last South African  leader to visit the United States was Gen. Jan Smuts, in 1945, three years  before the National Party came to power.    Many white South Africans have chafed under the diplomatic and economic  isolation engendered by their country's system of apartheid, which segregates  neighborhoods, schools and hospitals and denies the black majority a vote in  national affairs.    Since 1983, the number of American firms doing business in South Africa has  dropped from 386 to 129. Nevertheless, many South Africans still admire  Americans and delight in American entertainment and products.    Two of the most popular programs on state-run television are ""LA Law"" and  ""thirtysomething."" Theaters here show many American movies.

0,FT933-4400 ,"FT933-4400 _AN-DIIB8ABUFT 930909   FT  09 SEP 93 / End of S Africa sanctions era in sight      By PHILIP GAWITH   THE breakthrough made this week by South Africa's constitutional negotiators towards establishing a multiracial government promises significant relief to an economy that is short of good news, writes Philip Gawith. Agreement on a Transitional Executive Council (TEC), after many false dawns, has at last brought the end of the sanctions era in view. Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, has said the ANC will probably call for the lifting of remaining financial sanctions - most notably the embargo on International Monetary Fund/World Bank financing - by the end of the month. It is likely also to mark the start of an era of considerably increased international development assistance. As Chief Emeka Anyaoku, secretary-general of the Commonwealth, made clear during a recent visit: 'The international community wants to help and to help substantially once the next step has been taken towards representative government.' The US and European Community have expressed similar intentions. Although white South Africans have for years with bravado dismissed sanctions as ineffective there will be no disguising the joy when they finally go. While a minority found succour in the romance of the besieged volk in its laager, most longed to be rid of the burden of being an international pariah. It could not come at a better time. Economists believe South Africa's net reserves have fallen as low as one month's import cover, while capital outflows and the lower gold price have driven the rand to a record low against the dollar. Top of the list will be re-establishment of links with the IMF. Since declaring a moratorium on the repayment of part of its external debt in 1985 South Africa has been forced to run a current account surplus to finance more than Dollars 1bn a year in debt repayments. This has seriously hampered growth. Renewed access to the IMF will allow South Africa to run a deficit and growth prospects will be improved. Banks will also be much happier to do business in South Africa when it enjoys the financial backing of the IMF. The IMF has made no secret in recent months of its willingness to lend to South Africa again, most recently in July when President FW de Klerk held talks in Washington with Mr Michael Camdessus, its managing director. The World Bank has also made clear it is ready to lend large sums, most for infrastructure and human resource development. Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, the central bank, believes that the TEC agreement will be seen by the IMF and World Bank as the signal that the time is ripe to re-engage formally with South Africa. He said yesterday that in terms of the IMF's compensatory and contingency financing facility (CFF), South Africa is eligible for about Dollars 800m in assistance arising from balance of payments shortfalls related to the severe drought in 1992. The technical groundwork for the loan has already been done, but he stressed that an application would have to come from the finance sub-committee of the TEC. Mr Dave Mohr, chief economist at the Old Mutual, the Cape-based life office, argues that when the world economy starts growing again, South Africa's current account will benefit more directly than in the past when its trade was hampered by such factors as having to accept a political discount on goods and incur the cost of routing trade through a third party. Although nobody is expecting big capital inflows to the country, the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations should help stop the haemorrhage on the capital account. In the year to June, the total net outflow of capital not related to reserves amounted to R9.8bn (Pounds 1.4bn). Mr Stals argues that this 'is not a sign of economic weakness, but of the difficult political situation in which we find ourselves'. He believes that the removal of sanctions will allow investors to assess South Africa more in terms of conventional risk criteria, without 'extraneous' political distractions. There remain of course, as he is quick to recognise, ample reasons for believing that investors are likely to hold back until well after an election. At the very least, uncertainty about political stability, the shape of future economic policies, and the economy's seeming inability to emerge from a prolonged slump give considerable cause for caution. From the point of view of the US investor there are other obstacles too. At the last count, 26 states, 90 local authorities and 24 counties still had sanctions in place. The effect of these has been to prevent US bank lending to South Africa and US pension fund investment in companies with South African ties. The fact that some sanctions still remain in place against Namibia, which received its independence in March 1990, is a reminder of the obstacles that lie ahead.

According to the 1992 edition of the IRRC publication, International Business in South Africa, 508 non-US companies have direct investment or employees in South Africa, up from 454 a year ago. Of these, 153 are British, 142 German and 111 are American. US companies are also returning to South Africa, but in much smaller numbers, says the report. Since President George Bush lifted the ban on new investment in July 1991, five US companies have established offices, bringing the total of US companies with direct investment or employees up to 111. US disinvestment from South Africa began on a substantial scale after the violence of the mid-1980s, with the number of US companies in the republic falling from 267 in May 1986 to 168 by October 1987 to a low of 106 in 1991, according to IRRC statistics. But the report notes that US companies remain reluctant to invest in South Africa 'because of more than 60 state, city and county selective contracting laws that penalise companies doing business in South Africa when awarding contracts'. Investors are also discouraged by violence and political uncertainty, the report adds. The trend towards establishing non-equity links with South African companies 'has continued to increase dramatically', the report continues. It says that 303 non-US companies have non-equity links (such as licensing or distribution agreements) with South African companies, a net increase of 132 from a year ago. US companies with non-equity links rose by 23 to 256. International Business in South Africa 1992, IRRC, 1755 Massachusetts Ave NW, Suite 600, Washington DC 20036. Phone (202) 234-7500. Dollars 250.

Cristiani declares that ""During the past 10 years, El Salvador has accomplished  what took Western democracies a century to achieve."" Some of these  ""accomplishments,"" as noted in a report from the U.S. State Department: The  infant mortality rate, a barometer for the general health of the population,  which was 53 per 1,000 at the end of the '70s, rose to 71 per 1,000 by 1987.  While urban centers show a literacy rate of 62%, the figure for rural areas is  40% or below. The gross domestic product, an indicator of a country's economic  activity, dropped more than 30% between 1978 and 1987.    Amnesty International's annual report documents a large number of arrests of  government opponents in 1990. INS statistics indicate that the number of  Salvadoran refugees entering the U.S. has increased significantly in the past  two years.    Cristiani says that it is unfair to criticize his government for the slow pace  of the investigation of the Jesuit murders, but speed alone is not the issue.

Cristiani declares that ""During the past 10 years, El Salvador has accomplished  what took Western democracies a century to achieve."" Some of these  ""accomplishments,"" as noted in a report from the U.S. State Department: The  infant mortality rate, a barometer for the general health of the population,  which was 53 per 1,000 at the end of the '70s, rose to 71 per 1,000 by 1987.  While urban centers show a literacy rate of 62%, the figure for rural areas is  40% or below. The gross domestic product, an indicator of a country's economic  activity, dropped more than 30% between 1978 and 1987.    Amnesty International's annual report documents a large number of arrests of  government opponents in 1990. INS statistics indicate that the number of  Salvadoran refugees entering the U.S. has increased significantly in the past  two years.    Cristiani says that it is unfair to criticize his government for the slow pace  of the investigation of the Jesuit murders, but speed alone is not the issue.  The American public is more disturbed by reports of evidence destroyed while in  police custody, of witnesses harassed and intimidated by government agents, of  potential witnesses shielded by the military and of collusion among army  officers.

The Dollars 500m global offering of five-year bonds is likely to pave the way for a flood of new issues from other South African borrowers in both the public and private sectors. It is being closely watched by major South African companies and institutions as a measure of the acceptability of South African bonds on the global market and of confidence in the economic policies of the new government. The state-owned electricity utility Eskom and telecommunications company Telkom as well as several private companies are expected to approach the international capital markets over the next few months. Although South Africa has borrowed on the international markets before, this is the first time it has been able to approach the US market directly. The bond offering is expected to be launched either today or tomorrow. Goldman Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, the banks lead-managing the deal, were last night unable to comment on the pricing of the bonds, but the market expects a price about 170 to 200 basis points (1.7 to 2 percentage points) over US Treasury bonds of the same maturity. This compares with a margin of about 175 basis points available on Greek bonds of a similar maturity. Mexican debt is trading at about 200 basis points over US Treasuries. Both countries have a similar credit rating to South Africa. Earlier this year, South Africa was awarded an investment grade rating by Moody's, the US credit rating agency. Japan's Nippon Investor Services also gave the country an investment grade rating. However, Standard  Poor's, the other major US rating agency, awarded a sub-investment grade rating, albeit with a positive outlook. The launch follows the completion yesterday of a series of investment presentations in Asia, Europe and the US by a South African delegation, including Mr Chris Liebenberg, the finance minister; Mr Alec Erwin, his deputy; Mr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank; and Mr Tito Mboweni, labour minister.

Station manager Stephen Kulczycki, backed by president William Kobin, said in a  statement that he had screened an upcoming segment of the program and was  ""delighted"" to determine that he no longer found it biased or unbalanced.    When he had announced a week earlier that KCET was dropping the series, which  is carried on 80 stations nationwide, Kulczycki had charged that it was slanted  in favor of the African National Congress.    ""We still have concerns, but based on what we have seen today, it appears that  the producers are making a good-faith effort to address our needs,"" Kulczycki  said.

""Whereas the previous decision was made not under pressure, as a matter of  judgment of the show's indefensible nature, this one was steamrollered by a  political juggernaut from the left,"" Horowitz said in a telephone interview  from Cape Town, South Africa, where he is researching a magazine article.    But community activists and the program's producers saw the decision to  reinstate ""South Africa Now"" as a victory for the grass-roots efforts of those  who had protested the near loss of the program in the nation's second most  populous metropolitan area.    ""I think it really shows that any time the community begins to mobilize in its  own defense, there are no obstacles we can't overcome,"" said Michael Zinzun,  who had organized protests over KCET's decision.    People ranging from City Councilman Robert Farrell to anti-apartheid activists  to USC professors who use ""South Africa Now"" in the classroom had pleaded with  KCET officials to keep the program on the air. One group appeared before the  station's Community Advisory Board on Wednesday and persuaded that body to  issue a statement reprimanding station executives for pulling the show.    Kulczycki said that KCET had agreed to pick up at least another six weeks of  the program. Whether it then takes the other seven installments that the  producers are planning to make this season depends on their continuing to be  ""unbiased,"" he said.    KCET said that it would run ""South Africa Now"" only because the show's  producers, Danny Schechter and Rory O'Connor, had promised that it would not be  biased, and had visibly changed their approach for the last program of the  current 13-week series run, due to be broadcast here Sunday at 9 a.m.    In addition, the station said, it had received assurances from officials at  station WNET in New York, which assists in the production of the show and is  its sponsor in the public-television system, that they would monitor ""South  Africa Now"" for fairness.    Schechter and O'Connor, who had denied the accusations of bias, could not be  reached for comment, but Kasriel disputed Kulczycki's contention that the  program had been altered. ""The show has not been changed,"" she said, adding  that the standards used in the program Kulczycki screened Friday had been  applied throughout the show's previous five seasons.

TOO MANY CHILDREN COULD SAY YES;    SUMMIT: THE U.N. CONCLAVE FOCUSES ON THE YOUNG -- AND ALSO ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S  FAILURE TO MAKE A REAL COMMITMENT. HE'S WASTING PRECIOUS TIME.      By Marian Wright Edelman and James D. Weill, Marian Wright Edelman is president  and James D. Weill is general counsel of the Children's Defense Fund.      WASHINGTON      The cause of children is progressing in much of the world. We saw dramatic  proof of that progress last weekend when 71 heads of state met at the United  Nations for an unprecedented world summit for children -- the largest gathering  of national leaders in history. But we also had a dramatic disappointment:  President Bush's performance.    The President made a lackluster speech that used less than his allotted five  minutes. He then left for Washington while the other world leaders stayed on.  Back in Washington, he joined in announcing a budget agreement shortchanging  American children's health, education and other needs and showing little regard  for the nation's future.    The summit, as a whole, produced some real hope for the world's children, hope  that is desperately needed when millions are being killed by malnutrition,  preventable diseases, war and abuse. Fifteen million children under the age of  5 die every year around the world -- 40,000 a day. The summit participants  agreed on a specific plan to try to save as many as 50 million children this  decade.    Goals include reducing child mortality in each nation by at least one-third,  reducing malnutrition by one-half, raising immunization rates and assuring the  earliest possible ratification by all governments of the international  convention on the Rights of the Child.    U.S. children are in desperate need of real presidential and congressional  leadership to reach these goals. With nearly 13 million poor children, we have  a Third World within our nation One of every four U.S. infants and toddlers  lives in poverty. And American children are two or three times more likely to  live in poverty than those in countries we consider our peers and competitors  -- countries like West Germany, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland  and Sweden.    The United States is an underdeveloped nation in caring for its children. It  has 13 million children with no health insurance. It ranks 19th among nations  in preventing infant mortality and 29th in preventing low-birth-weight births.  Immunization rates are declining, and measles cases have increased tenfold in  the last few years.    In some respects, conditions for California's children are even worse. In  recent years, California's child poverty, prenatal care, teen birth and school  dropout rates have been worse than the United States' already terrible  averages.    Bush's brief appearance at the United Nations barely acknowledged any of these  problems. Much of it was devoted to empty rhetorical flourishes. The President  did allude to the education and health goals that he, the governors and the  Public Health Service have set for the year 2000. But he failed, however, to  suggest that he would take any specific measures to reach these goals. And he  failed to mention that the United States is moving away from many of them.    The U.S. Public Health Service goal is to reduce by more than one-third the  rate of babies born too small to thrive. With some effort, this goal would be  attainable, but the nation has not been making such an effort. From 1980 to  1988, the rate of low-birth-weight births actually increased, rather than  decline as in prior decades. We are also moving away from the Public Health  Service goal that 90% of pregnant women get prenatal care during the first  three months of pregnancy.    Early prenatal care and higher birth weights are the most effective way to  reduce infant mortality. Judging from recent rates of progress, however, the  United States will not come close to either its own or the U.N. summit's  mortality goal by the end of the century. The nation's rate of infant deaths is  still going down, but the rate of progress has become grindingly slow -- in the  last three years, the infant death rate, on average, fell only one-third as  fast as it did each year in the 1970s.    Bush knows these trends and how to reverse them, making his silence at the  United Nations all the more inappropriate. Last November, a White House task  force on infant mortality produced a draft report reviewing all this  information and recommending initiatives that would save at least 10,000 U.S.  babies' lives and prevent disabling conditions for another 100,000 each year.  The President has done nothing to move the task-force recommendations forward.    Bush should have talked at the summit about practical steps by which the United  States can reach the year 2000 goals. He should have said that he would make  room in the budget for the modest initiatives that are necessary. He should  have told the American people that we have to start now -- not in 1996 or 1999  -- if we want to attain these goals and not only help America's children but  prepare our work force and strengthen our society. The nation needs the whole  decade, not just two or four years, to reduce infant mortality by one-third.  Bush is already wasting precious time.    The President underlined his disinterest in the plight of America's children  when he also failed to sign, endorse, or even mention the U.N. Convention on  the Rights of the Child. This convention protects children against  discrimination, parental abuse, drug trafficking, sexual exploitation, lack of  health care, illiteracy and poverty. Around the world, 129 countries have  either signed or ratified it. The major holdouts are Iran, Iraq, Libya,  Cambodia, South Africa and the United States -- poor company, indeed.    The excuses given by White House staff for the President not signing the  convention are just that -- excuses. One was that Bush believes the convention  does not adequately protect fetuses. The convention is neutral on the abortion  issue because the drafters knew that siding one way or the other would doom it  in dozens of countries.    This neutrality is fine with the many Catholic countries of Latin America,  which have ratified the convention. It is fine with the Vatican, which has  ratified it. But the White House says it is not good enough for Bush.    In fact, the excuses hide the reality that the President is simply too  disinterested in children to do battle with the handful of senators who dislike  any human-rights treaties. And such provisions as the clause requiring the  nation to take reasonable steps to reduce infant mortality are the ones that  really give the President pause. After all, he has already decided against such  steps.    In his first press conference after the 1988 election, Bush said, ""When I talk  about investing in our kids, that would be an indication of how I will pursue  this objective of a 'kinder and gentler' nation."" Ever since 1988, however,  Bush has turned his back on America's children. The United States is becoming a  meaner and harsher nation for children.    While the U.N. summit was a watershed for tens of millions of children abroad,  for U.S. children the event has had far less meaning. It is time for the  President to start redeeming his pledges and to take the lead in attacking the  child poverty, hunger, education, health and child-care problems that plague so  many millions of our children and threaten our nation's future.

The United States is an underdeveloped nation in caring for its children. It  has 13 million children with no health insurance. It ranks 19th among nations  in preventing infant mortality and 29th in preventing low-birth-weight births.  Immunization rates are declining, and measles cases have increased tenfold in  the last few years.    In some respects, conditions for California's children are even worse. In  recent years, California's child poverty, prenatal care, teen birth and school  dropout rates have been worse than the United States' already terrible  averages.    Bush's brief appearance at the United Nations barely acknowledged any of these  problems. Much of it was devoted to empty rhetorical flourishes. The President  did allude to the education and health goals that he, the governors and the  Public Health Service have set for the year 2000. But he failed, however, to  suggest that he would take any specific measures to reach these goals. And he  failed to mention that the United States is moving away from many of them.    The U.S. Public Health Service goal is to reduce by more than one-third the  rate of babies born too small to thrive. With some effort, this goal would be  attainable, but the nation has not been making such an effort. From 1980 to  1988, the rate of low-birth-weight births actually increased, rather than  decline as in prior decades. We are also moving away from the Public Health  Service goal that 90% of pregnant women get prenatal care during the first  three months of pregnancy.    Early prenatal care and higher birth weights are the most effective way to  reduce infant mortality. Judging from recent rates of progress, however, the  United States will not come close to either its own or the U.N. summit's  mortality goal by the end of the century. The nation's rate of infant deaths is  still going down, but the rate of progress has become grindingly slow -- in the  last three years, the infant death rate, on average, fell only one-third as  fast as it did each year in the 1970s.    Bush knows these trends and how to reverse them, making his silence at the  United Nations all the more inappropriate. Last November, a White House task  force on infant mortality produced a draft report reviewing all this  information and recommending initiatives that would save at least 10,000 U.S.  babies' lives and prevent disabling conditions for another 100,000 each year.  The President has done nothing to move the task-force recommendations forward.    Bush should have talked at the summit about practical steps by which the United  States can reach the year 2000 goals. He should have said that he would make  room in the budget for the modest initiatives that are necessary. He should  have told the American people that we have to start now -- not in 1996 or 1999  -- if we want to attain these goals and not only help America's children but  prepare our work force and strengthen our society. The nation needs the whole  decade, not just two or four years, to reduce infant mortality by one-third.  Bush is already wasting precious time.    The President underlined his disinterest in the plight of America's children  when he also failed to sign, endorse, or even mention the U.N. Convention on  the Rights of the Child. This convention protects children against  discrimination, parental abuse, drug trafficking, sexual exploitation, lack of  health care, illiteracy and poverty. Around the world, 129 countries have  either signed or ratified it. The major holdouts are Iran, Iraq, Libya,  Cambodia, South Africa and the United States -- poor company, indeed.    The excuses given by White House staff for the President not signing the  convention are just that -- excuses. One was that Bush believes the convention  does not adequately protect fetuses. The convention is neutral on the abortion  issue because the drafters knew that siding one way or the other would doom it  in dozens of countries.    This neutrality is fine with the many Catholic countries of Latin America,  which have ratified the convention. It is fine with the Vatican, which has  ratified it. But the White House says it is not good enough for Bush.    In fact, the excuses hide the reality that the President is simply too  disinterested in children to do battle with the handful of senators who dislike  any human-rights treaties. And such provisions as the clause requiring the  nation to take reasonable steps to reduce infant mortality are the ones that  really give the President pause. After all, he has already decided against such  steps.    In his first press conference after the 1988 election, Bush said, ""When I talk  about investing in our kids, that would be an indication of how I will pursue  this objective of a 'kinder and gentler' nation."" Ever since 1988, however,  Bush has turned his back on America's children. The United States is becoming a  meaner and harsher nation for children.    While the U.N. summit was a watershed for tens of millions of children abroad,  for U.S. children the event has had far less meaning. It is time for the  President to start redeeming his pledges and to take the lead in attacking the  child poverty, hunger, education, health and child-care problems that plague so  many millions of our children and threaten our nation's future.

He  also spoke of the devaluation of the CFA franc, the backup  measures being implemented, and the effects of the monetary  adjustment on the balance sheet of the Bank of Central African  States [BEAC]. He also mentioned the steps to take in response  to the presentation of the experts' report on economic and  monetary integration. Taking stock of the summit, the president  stated that the Libreville meeting helped adopt practical steps  to implement the backup measures. [passage omitted]    Analyzing the incidence of the monetary adjustment on the  balance sheet of the BEAC, the heads of state noted the negative  effects that the new exchange rate has had on their transaction  accounts, all of which are now in debt. Central Africa,  President Patasse said, is lagging behind its West African  counterparts and its issuing bank is not doing well, mainly  because of the selfishness of some states. This attitude has  worsened to such extent that the BEAC's balance relies on the  fragile economies of two states in the subregion.    [Begin Patasse recording] It is very easy to note that  Central Africa is ill as a result of the selfishness shown by  each of the subregional states. As a result of exaggerated  nationalism in the subregion, Central Africa is now lagging far  behind West Africa. I stress that if Central Africa does not  realize the danger we will get lost, and that is the main lesson  to draw from our Libreville meeting. When you analyze the  report presented by the BEAC governor, you will note that the  Central Bank hinges on the CAR in the first place and then on  Chad. When we take into account the transaction accounts, we  can say that as far as the Central African Region is concerned  there is a deficit. It is thanks to our country that the  Central Bank survives. But we must avoid boasting because the  essential element needed first of all is solidarity. [end  recording]    The main decisions made by the heads of state in Libreville  include: checking increasing inflation, reducing increases in  the prices of essential commodities, and negotiating with the  IMF the possibilities of ensuring an influx of funds to Central  Africa necessary to reestablish financial balance in the  subregion. But the main announcement that the head of state  made was the creation in the days ahead of the CEMAC. The heads  of state agreed on the examination of two draft texts to be  submitted to them for signature in order to rapidly put in place  the institutions of the new community. All this is expected to  be ready for the next summit slated for Ndjamena. Let us listen  to the president again:    [Begin Patasse recording] We will find solutions to our  problems. We will meet in Ndjamena in one or two week's time,  and we will find solutions. We have transcended the chauvinist  stage to tackle major problems confronting all of us, that is  how we will create the CEMAC. That is the main point of our  meeting in Libreville. We also examined security problems in  the subregion. Concerning this point, there are the examples of  our Chadian brothers that we have accepted on our territory and  the Cameroon- Nigeria conflict. These are the current problems,  but we are convinced that if political will exists in such a way  that we can pool our resources to rejuvenate Central Africa, I  am convinced that we shall overcome micro-nationalism which  constitutes an obstacle to Central Africa's development.

Even under sanctions and with high levels of violence and political uncertainty, it is the continent's second largest tourist industry, accounting for almost 20 per cent of regional tourist income, more than double Kenya's 9.6 per cent. In 1991, Morocco headed the African league with 24 per cent of tourist revenue. Globally, South Africa is a tiny player accounting for less than 0.25 per cent of the international tourist business. Excluding African visitors, there were some 560,000 tourist arrivals last year, the bulk of whom (70 per cent) came from Europe, with the UK as the main market (26 per cent) followed by Germany (16 per cent) and the US (9 per cent). With a growth rate of 18,5 per cent in 1992, the Asian market - especially Taiwan (4 per cent) and Japan (1.5 per cent) - is becoming increasingly important. Growth accelerated in the first seven months of 1993 with the number of arrivals increasing 12.7 per cent. Overseas tourists spend an estimated R4,800 (Dollars 1,750) per visit (excluding air fares to and from the country) and the industry earned R2.75bn (Dollars 1bn) in foreign exchange in 1991, making it the fourth largest foreign currency earner, after manufactures, gold and other minerals. Aside from the lifting of sanctions, the main factor making for tourism growth at a time of global recession has been the liberalisation of the aviation policies and the expansion of air traffic capacity. In the past three years, 18 new airlines have started services to South Africa. A more market-driven aviation policy has resulted in more competitive market prices and the opening up of the charter market. The number of tour operators has more than doubled, while government has become more active in tourism promotion allowing accelerated tax write-offs for the accommodation industry, a R600m (Dollars 180m) loan programme for Eco-tourism projects and support schemes for small entrepreneurs. On the debit side, tourist perceptions of personal safety in South Africa have deteriorated markedly. In January 1990, some 70 per cent of overseas visitors rated the safety factor in South Africa good but by January this year, this rating had fallen below 30 per cent. The government's target is to more than treble the number of arrivals by 2000 reaching 1.75m visitors earning some R24bn in foreign exchange. With hotels operating at below 50 per cent of bed-night capacity, there is considerable scope for expansion without significant new investment in hotels. Nevertheless, three leading global players - Hilton, Hyatt and Sheraton - have expressed interest in opening up in South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT921-15892 ,"FT921-15892 _AN-CAHBJAAJFT 920108   FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (10): Attacking the tariff barriers - Manufacturing must become a lead sector      By TONY HAWKINS   IF STRUCTURAL adjustment is to succeed, manufacturing industry, and manufacturing exports in particular, must become the lead sectors of the economy for the rest of the century. This was recognised in 1986 when the government's economic policy statement - Sessional Paper No 1  - set a target growth rate of 7.5 per cent a year for the industrial sector during the 1988 to 2000 period. While manufacturing industry has been the lead sector since 1988 with growth of 5.5 per cent a year, it has, in common with the rest of the economy, fallen behind target, in spite of the impressive momentum of reform, especially in trade policy. Kenya's industrial sector ranks as the fourth largest in Africa after South Africa, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. In 1985, it comprised some 560 medium and large-scale companies, more than 700 medium-scale businesses, and an estimated 1,600 micro-enterprises. In 1990, manufacturing value added was estimated at Dollars 440m. Food processing is the largest single activity, accounting for almost 30 per cent of value-added, followed by tobacco and beverages with 11.5 per cent, while chemicals and machinery and transport equipment account for about 10 per cent each. Manufacturing is the second largest employer, providing 334,000 jobs or a quarter of wage employment. In 1987, a World Bank team studied a sample of 45 companies and concluded that the average company enjoyed 90 per cent protection. In spite of this, some import-substitution activities, notably food processing, beverages and tobacco, were relatively efficient. But when they were assessed as potential exports, the bank found that while their ex-factory prices were competitive against those of landed imports, once transport costs to export markets were taken into account, they were too costly to compete. Furthermore, packaging and quality did not measure up to international standards. It concluded that the rest of the sector was inefficient. Highly protected activities - steel, chemicals, transport and electrical equipment - would never be internationally competitive because of scale economies, and the bank was unhappy that so much investment had gone into these industries. Critics of Kenyan economic policy tend to overlook the extent to which these shortcomings have been addressed, primarily by reducing protection and devaluing the shilling. Tax rates have been lowered, most prices decontrolled, imports liberalised and export incentives strengthened. The main thrust of reform has been to force industrialists to seek export-led growth and to improve efficiency as protection is reduced. Quantitative controls on imports have been abolished, tariff rates lowered and tariff dispersion narrowed. There are 12 tariff bands compared with 25 previously, and while maximum tariff rates have been cut and average tariffs reduced, the main reduction in protection was achieved by abolishing import controls. In the mid-1980s, import bans covered most of industrial production, but by the end of 1990, the IMF estimated that only about 5 per cent of imports were restricted. Today, protection is greatest for cars and textiles. Four years ago, the top tariff rate was 170 per cent, and as recently as 1990 there were more than 1,400 items with tariff rates of 80 per cent or more. Today, the top rate of 70 per cent applies to some 1,370 items, with more than half the product categories attracting tariffs of 15-35 per cent. The next stage of tariff reform is to abolish the licensing system and further narrow the range of tariffs which will shift the responsibility for stabilising the balance of payments to demand management by fiscal and monetary means. It is too early to tell how the sector is responding to this shock therapy. There is some evidence of inefficient producers going to the wall and of industrialists responding positively to improved export opportunities brought about by the reduction in protection and currency depreciation. Industrialists support liberalisation, though there have been loud complaints from electronics, vehicle components and razor blade manufacturers that they are being marginalised by import dumping. Statistics on industrial exports differ. According to the government, there has been a 70 per cent rise in the volume of manufactured exports since 1982, but the value of manufactured exports (excluding chemicals) shows a fall from more than Dollars 100m in 1980 to an average of Dollars 96m over 1988-90. Opinions differ about Kenya's capacity to become a significant exporter of manufactures. The optimists believe its geographical location is ideal for exploiting its traditional east African and Preferential Trade Area market and markets in the EC and southern Asia. Pessimists say the market is too small to secure scale economies while quality and packaging is inferior. A worrisome aspect is the apparent reluctance of multinationals to invest or expand in Kenya. Bankers say that most of the new investment in manufacturing has come from smaller and newer investors, often Asians, including Asian businesses based abroad. This has led to increased competition in industries such as edible oils, previously a monopoly, and to improved performance in several sectors where cost-conscious entrepreneurs, using modern equipment, are transforming some of Kenya's industries.

Mr Jemal-ud-din Kassum, IFC vice-president for operations, said that the investments - which will be made in a franchise financing fund and a life assurance company - would 'help bridge the gap between the first and third world parts of the economy'. The IFC, which promotes private sector activity, will invest R12.5m (Pounds 2.4m) in the South Africa Franchise Capital Fund. This will be a R50m vehicle to provide loans and equity to members of 'previously disadvantaged groups' so they can acquire franchises in businesses such as fast food, dry cleaning and photocopying chains. The IFC will also invest R41.6m in a 10 per cent stake in African Life Assurance (Aflife), a life assurance company that does most of its business with poor blacks. The franchise fund will help black businesses overcome shortages of capital and give them access to accounting and marketing expertise as well as the research and development facilities of larger organisations, Mr Tei Mante, director of IFC's sub-Saharan Africa department, said. The life assurance company, which is being restructured to be predominantly owned by black interests, will provide a home for savings from people in the townships and provinces. The two investments 'are all part of building a climate that provides a stable base for economic growth', Mr Mante said. The Aflife restructuring, which will entail the building up of a new sales force to cover black residential areas, was an 'example of the changes in ownership and control that are necessary for increased participation by previously disadvantaged groups in the formal economy.' IFC's partner in structuring and arranging the leasing fund was Nedcor Bank of South Africa. Nedcor will take a 25 per cent stake in the fund. The rest of the shares will be placed with a small group of international and South African institutional investors. In remarks to the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Mr Christo Liebenberg, the South African finance minister, said the Bank's multilateral investment guarantee agency would soon give its first guarantee for an inward investment into South Africa.

0,FT924-10040 ,"FT924-10040 _AN-CKCCTABOFT 921103   FT  03 NOV 92 / Ghana votes on Rawlings and reform: Economic programme is on the ballot and in the balance      By JULIAN OZANNE   GHANA goes to the polls today after eleven years of military rule. The presidential elections, the first since Flight-Lt Jerry Rawlings seized power in 1981, will be a critical test in Africa of the continent's fragile transition to democracy and sustainable economic growth. After nine years of economic growth, Ghanaian voters are faced with a complex choice: should they stick with Flt Lt Rawlings, despite his heavy-handed leadership and well charted human rights abuses, or should they return to the mould of two traditional political parties with a less than favourable track record on the economy since independence in 1957. Concerns about the future of Ghana's economic reform programme in a post-electoral democratic order are also shared by international donors who have poured in about Dollars 650m a year (8 per cent of GDP) to support Ghana's drive towards economic reform. Many donors fear that austere economic reform in Africa could be jeopardised by a wave of democratic populism. They also believe that many of the unpopular reforms, undertaken in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa throughout the 1980s were only possible under authoritarian government. In a recent internal World Bank document entitled 'Ghana  - 2000 and beyond' the Bank says that if Ghana makes the leap to self-sustainable growth it would have tremendous implications for other African countries, but it warns: 'Authoritarianism often has been seen as a useful, if regrettable, expedient for effective policymaking in the face of political instability.' There is little fundamental economic policy difference between the five presidential candidates in today's election. However, opponents of Flt Lt Rawlings are more critical of the austerity programme without offering a coherent alternative. Western donors feel that at the very least a defeat of Flt Lt Rawlings would cause a period of economic policy instability and that a democratically elected president would be more inclined to pander to populist sentiments and opinion. The question Ghanaian voters will decide, in part, is whether the past nine years of painful economic reform which has produced considerable benefits will translate into support for Flt Lt Rawlings, particularly among the rural farmers who have benefited most from better producer prices. 'To a certain extent the election is a referendum on structural adjustment,' said a western economist. There are four contenders standing against Flt Lt Rawlings. The strongest challenger is Prof Adu Boahen representing the conservative New Patriotic Party. He is expected to draw his support from Ghanaians who have suffered during the past decade, particularly town dwellers and sacked civil servants, and from the powerful Ashanti tribe. However, the decision by Ghana's electorate on structural adjustment will be considerably distorted by Flt Lt Rawlings' poor track record on human rights and by the government's less than total commitment to the reform programme, which many economists say could have yielded much better results. Donors say Ghana's economic reform faltered in the face of government reluctance to accept the critical second phase of adjustment which involves stimulating investment by releasing economic control and ownership to private foreign and local investors. After nine years of austerity and often painful reform, many Ghanaians have yet to see significant increases in living standards. The promise of short, sharp, shock therapy for the economy quickly turning into high economic growth rates has faded. Measures which include devaluation, liberalisation of trade and foreign exchange, a disciplined fiscal and monetary policy and retrenchment of bloated bureaucracies have given Ghana some rewards. Inflation has fallen from 123 per cent in 1983 to 18 per cent last year and the country has managed an average growth rate of 5 per cent a year since 1984. But with population growth at around 3 per cent real per capita incomes have only grown about 2 per cent. When savings are deducted, real per capita consumption is even less. If economic and population growth continues at current levels, economists estimate it will take Ghanaians 40 to 50 years to double their incomes, presently at a paltry Dollars 400 a year. The critical question facing Ghana, as in many other adjusting countries in Africa, is how to move to self-sustainable accelerated growth of 8-10 per cent a year where private flows of capital and export growth replaces aid-dependence. To achieve this gross investment will have to increase significantly from 16.5 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 20-25 per cent over the next five years and national savings will have to rise from 13.1 per cent to 20 per cent of GDP. A private sector working group has made recommendations to government of measures to be taken. The list includes speeding up divestiture of 330 state-owned companies including 17 classed as 'strategic', slashing bureaucratic obstacles to foreign and local investment and reducing the role of the Ghana Investment Centre from an overly-protective body to a facilitatory and promotional one. Many Ghanaians feel that Flt Lt Rawlings, with his distaste for private profit enterprise, has been a big obstacle to the fundamental change in attitudes which need to be taken towards foreign investors and businessmen to achieve much higher growth. However, any incoming elected president will face the same challenges and tasks: deepening the reform programme and accelerating economic growth while dealing with the new post-electoral democratic reality.

Beck, Karl S. Beck, longtime resident of Southern Africa, is a  senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.      WASHINGTON      In the nasty climate that is South African politics, Pieter W. Botha's sudden  resignation has quelled the thunderstorm over which National Party oligarch  will run the government. Unfortunately there is no sign things will get  substantially better soon. Frederik W.de Klerk, Botha's interim successor --  who appears certain to be elected president after whites choose their new  Parliament in September -- inherits a country that has been in a debilitating  crisis for more than a decade. De Klerk enters office with countless problems  and three assets: relief, expectations and opportunity.    Everyone is happy to see Botha go. His irrationality and tantrums are  legendary. Botha screamed at Cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors and  visiting U.S. congressmen. He once told his own vice president to ""shut up"" at  a meeting where Botha personally fired the director-general of the South  African Broadcasting Corp. for straying from his prescribed line for TV news.  He told Cape Town's Catholic cardinal to ""listen or get out"" when the cardinal  asked Botha to stop human-rights violations by the police and army. Given  Botha's close connections to South Africa's dreaded intelligence and security  forces -- forged during 14 years as defense minister -- his ire was terrifying.  Few had the guts to tell Botha the truth, and he clung to a dream world where  he relied on thugs, rogues and political alchemists to respond to the demand  for black rights, the most pressing issue confronting the South African  government.    Botha never accepted the fact that the majority of black South Africans support  the African National Congress, he never comprehended the effects of burning  barricades in Soweto on the decisions of bank presidents in Zurich and New  York. Botha also reserved a special contempt for foreigners who sought to be  involved in South African affairs. Two exceptions were British Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan, but Reagan fell from grace after the U.S.  President imposed mild sanctions on South Africa in 1985, to ward off harsher  measures then gaining support in Congress. Botha still believes Reagan betrayed  him.    In August, 1985, as international financiers and Western governments waited for  Botha to deliver a speech drafted by the South African Foreign Affairs Ministry  to restore confidence in South Africa's stability, Botha threw away the text  and declared he would keep South Africa on a course of repression and  segregation. The next year, Botha promulgated state-of-emergency laws that the  police and army used brutally in an attempt to kill off support for the ANC and  its internal allies in the United Democratic Front. They failed, and the  effects of the state of emergency, still in force, were to strengthen the  resolve of anti-apartheid dissidents, to increase black support for the ANC and  to prolong the political stalemate while the government refused to talk to  legitimate black leaders.    Meanwhile large sums of money continue to flow out of South Africa, and no one  will lend South Africans capital needed to modernize industries and put  employment opportunities in sync with population growth. Black unemployment is  already dangerously high -- more than 60% in some areas. Blacks are  increasingly being politicized and activated against the government because of  their desperate economic conditions. Ironically whites, whom Botha claimed to  protect, are also pinched by the deteriorating economy, while feeling ever more  threatened by the country's permanent political crisis. Botha saw his role as  that of a parochial, white Afrikaaner politician. He leaves South Africa in a  terrible mess.    Many people expect, or hope, De Klerk will find a way out of the mess.  Principal among them is Thatcher, who met with De Klerk in London last month  and told him it is getting tougher everyday for her to defend South Africa from  those in the European Community and Commonwealth who want to punish Pretoria  for its treatment of blacks. De Klerk, for his part, probably responded by  assuring Thatcher of his plans eventually to release ANC leader Nelson Mandela  and to enter into negotiations with blacks.    What is less likely is that De Klerk could have told Thatcher he is prepared to  allow blacks equal political rights with whites. De Klerk is a segregationist  who wants to maintain white privilege despite spiraling political and economic  costs. He is solidly within the National Party right wing that hopes to attract  blacks away from the ANC by imposing black quislings on the black masses as  ""leaders"" and sponsoring public works projects in areas where blacks live. This  will never succeed. Similarly, De Klerk opposes admitting blacks into a  national Parliament on a one person-one vote basis. When he told Thatcher  recently that he will seek a system of government in a South Africa where no  racial group will be able to dominate any other, Thatcher reportedly  interjected impatiently: ""What are you, afraid the blacks will do to you what  you did to them?""    Yet De Klerk might be susceptible to a contrary influence if he realizes  repression and cooperation won't solve South Africa's problems. Three years  ago, his brother Willem (Wimpie), formerly editor of an Afrikaans paper, was  fired for being too liberal. Willem de Klerk wants the South African government  to negotiate with the ANC and other popular anti-apartheid organizations that  the National Party has consistently tried to discredit. The brothers stay in  close touch despite their differing politics.    De Klerk has an opportunity to cast his image of a South African president  above his predecessors' Afrikaaner parochialism and to exploit propitious  circumstances that currently exist for talks with the black opposition. The ANC  has declared its interest in discussions and has offered reasonable proposals  outlining how De Klerk could create a context for negotiations to begin. Even  more important, various black groups in South Africa have begun to talk to each  other about how they would relate during negotiations.    Washington, London and Moscow have great interest in promoting such  negotiations. These governments, and others in Africa and Europe, would jump at  a chance to apply their diplomatic facilities in support of talks. In South  Africa, De Klerk can count on the extensive propaganda capabilities of the  state-run electronic media to sell the idea of negotiations to whites. If the  National Party needed proof of its capacity to form white political opinion, it  was apparent last year in the government's successful effort at selling  Namibian independence to South African whites.    Whether De Klerk will use the opportunity is questionable. He would have to  arrive at the decision that it is more important to save South Africa from the  steady disintegration of its current course than to preserve National Party  hegemony plus segregated schools and neighborhoods for the white minority. A  group of British businessmen recalled a long social conversations with De Klerk  when they pressed him to speed reform in South Africa. After listening  patiently to their suggestions and warnings about the effects of allowing the  crisis to go on, De Klerk reportedly answered: ""Gentlemen, I am prepared to  accept any conceivable form of constitution and government system -- as long as  it keeps the National Party in power.""

Castro and the high-level delegation accompanying him  arrived  in Cuba at 2119 GMT and were welcomed by Army General Raul  Castro, vice president of the Council of State and Council of  Ministers and Armed Forces chief, and other ranking leaders.    Fidel Castro's arrival in South Africa on 9 May to attend  Mandela's presidential inauguration ceremony was a milestone in  the traditional ties of friendship and solidarity between Havana  and Africa.    The Cuban president and his entourage held several bilateral  meetings in Pretoria with over 20 statesmen and well-known  figures from Africa and the Middle East. Castro also granted  interviews to various news media from South Africa and other  countries.    Significant and historic were among the descriptives used by  sources close to Fidel Castro in reference to his conversation  with the African National Congress (ANC) leader and new  President Nelson Mandela, to whom Castro expressed Cuba's  resolve to initiate and develop multilateral cooperation.    Another important event was the establishment of diplomatic  relations between both states on 11 May, based on a protocol  signed by Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto  Robaina and Alfred Nzo, respectively. This, reports indicated,  was the first foreign policy decision of the new ANC government.    Fidel Castro thus concluded a tour that began in Barbados,  where he attended the First World Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island States, which ended on 6 May.    At that regional forum, he urged developed nations to stop  polluting the environment and called for the equitable  distribution of wealth in the world to bridge the growing gap  between poor and wealthy states.    After the meeting in the Barbadian capital, where he also  met  with dignitaries and well-known conference attendees, the Cuban  president visited Ghana in western Africa during a technical  stopover en route to South Africa.    His stay in Accra, although brief, was considered official  by  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings, who welcomed Castro at  Katoka Airport for a friendly meeting.    The Cuban delegation, comprised also of National Assembly  President Ricardo Alarcon and Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of  science, technology, and environment, traveled from Pretoria to  Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, which, in July 1993, hosted the Third  Ibero-American Summit.    On that stopover en route to Havana, the head of the Cuban  Revolution also conducted various official activities with the  authorities in Salvador de Bahia, capital of Bahia State, who,  last night, gave a reception in his honor at Ondina Palace,  headquarters of the state government.

Even though  the visit to Burkina Faso by Velayati and the high-ranking  political delegation accompanying him is the second phase of our  foreign minister's tour that began on Tuesday, the delegation  actually stopped in two countries before arriving in Burkina  Faso. In addition to meeting and talking with officials of  Guinea, the delegation stopped briefly at the airport in the  Chadian capital, Ndjamena, on its way to Burkina Faso and talked  with the Chadian foreign minister.    During the meeting between the Iranian and Chadian foreign  ministers, Chad requested that the Islamic Republic of Iran  assist in exploiting its oil resources as part of cooperation  among countries of the South. This request is vitally important  to Chad, especially after the discovery of an important oilfield  in southern Chad.    In Guinea the Iranian delegation held detailed talks on  economic, political, and cultural cooperation between Tehran and  Conakry, including discussions on cooperation in the  exploitation of bauxite mines, energy, the construction of  hydro-electrical dams, and the construction of railways.    In Burkina Faso our foreign minister and his delegation met  with the prime minister and discussed political and economic  relations between the two countries. During this meeting, the  initial basis for the expansion and consolidation of economic  and commercial cooperation was laid, and with the formation of a  joint commission in this field, a new era began in the economic  cooperation between Tehran and Ouagadougou. To acquaint the  government and nation of Burkina Faso with our country's high  economic potential, it was decided that a trade exhibition  including products and industries of Islamic Iran be set up in  Ouagadougou.    Iran's diplomatic activities in Africa are of interest to  political experts and analysts for various reasons. The first  is that this diplomatic initiative by the Islamic Republic of  Iran strengthens the position of Muslims in Africa, especially  in Black Africa. The second is that this activity is  significant to the expansion of South-South relations vis-a-vis  the array of forces by the North against the South. The third  is that meeting mutual needs in the economic, cultural, and  political fields and helping deprived countries, especially with  experts and know-how from the rich scientific and industrial  experiences that our country has among the Third World, is an  important objective in our country's diplomatic policy.    At any rate, Tehran's new look toward Africa has attracted  the attention of many political experts.     "
0,FT943-13712 ,"FT943-13712 _AN-EGRD8AFRFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (34): Credit rating sought - Foreign borrowing      By MARK SUZMAN   One of the more dramatic signals of the normalisation of South Africa's international economic relations has been the country's decision to seek an international credit rating. After an intense competition among international merchant banks for the right to represent the country, the new government in May appointed Goldman Sachs as its agent to secure a grading from the leading agencies, who are expected to announce their assessment later this year. Although South Africa has long borrowed money on European markets without a rating, it wants access to the American market, hence the the new move. Following the successful agreement with international banks on a repayment schedule for outstanding debt that had been caught in the 1985 standstill, and given its new-found political stability, the country feels the time is ripe to make formal entry into global capital markets. Depending on the success of the present initiative, a similar move into the Japanese market may follow early next year. Although political and economic uncertainty has long forced South Africa to pay a fairly hefty premium on offshore borrowing, government authorities are confident of achieving an investment grade rating of at least BBB. 'I would actually prefer a lower rating that we can improve upon, rather than a higher one which might be downgraded,' notes Mr Chris Stals, South African Reserve Bank governor. Even with the rating, however, initial borrowing is likely to be limited. The new budget makes allowance for about Dollars 500m, but Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, says that figure may well be increased, depending both on the final rating achieved and the comparative strength of international markets at the time of borrowing. The outcome of the government's initiative will also have a bearing on South African companies seeking to raise money offshore. Assurer Liberty Life recently announced plans for a Dollars 360m-Dollars 500m rights issue, and electricity utility Eskom and the Development Bank of South Africa are both likely to float issues some time later this year.

The trainers, led by a brigadier and including three RAF  [Royal Air Force] members, are part of an expected expansion of  Britain's military and commercial ties with South Africa.  British contractors are ready to strike deals in avionics,  shipbuilding and technical training.    British security interests are expected to increase  significantly throughout southern Africa; military trainers are  already working in several countries in the region and Mr  Mandela, the President-elect, has indicated that South Africa  might return to the Commonwealth.    South African and British officials regard the appointment  of  Mr Joe Modise as South African Defence Minister as indicating  that Mr Mandela intends to maintain a strong defence force which  could help the United Nations throughout southern Africa.    South African officials suggest the renewal of military  links  with Britain would be at the expense of Pretoria's ties with  Israel, which has helped maintain South Africa's high-technology  weapons industries.    South Africa is making a determined effort to sell Britain  its new Rooivalk attack helicopter. The Ministry of Defence has  allowed the Rooivalk to be officially entered as another serious  contender, along with American and European firms, for a 1  billion pound contract for up to 91 helicopters.    It will be demonstrated in Britain for the first time this  week at the Army Air Corps air show at Middle Wallop, Hants.     "

Letter From Congress    More than 100 members of the House of Representatives asked President Bush in a  letter released Tuesday not to meet De Klerk unless South Africa relaxes its  apartheid policies of racial separation and white minority rule and ends its  three-year-old state of emergency.    ""To meet with the National Party leader and anticipated president of South  Africa without any significant political change by the white minority regime  would send a terribly wrong signal concerning the direction of U.S. policy  during the Bush Administration,"" the letter stated.    No dates had been announced for the trip, but it had been expected that De  Klerk would head for the United States toward the end of the month. He accepted  a general invitation to visit Washington after Baker met with South African  President Pieter W. Botha last May in Rome.

So argues political correspondent Kaizer Nyatsumba in a  commentary published in Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 27  May on page 16. Mandela, the commentary continues, ""is so firmly  committed to allaying the fears -- perceived and real -- of  whites and the business community that he is in danger of soon  finding himself a captive of white South Africa."" Nyatsumba  cites as examples of Mandela's efforts to appeal to the white  community his state of the nation address in which he ""unveiled  remarkably moderate plans"" and Mandela's decision to appoint  Leon Wessels as deputy chairman of the Constitutional Assembly  despite the ANC parliamentary caucus decision to nominate  Bridgit Mabandla to the position. The commentary argues that  there is now a need for ""a voice to the left of the ANC...in  Parliament to remind the new ANC-led government of its  responsibility to the black masses."" Nyatsumba concludes his  commentary: ""For Mandela's own sake, for the ANC's and indeed  the whole country's we must hope our leaders will be able to  combine reconcilatory moves with concrete steps, to send a  message that the lot of blacks will not stay the same, and that  some sacrifices by those who have been beneficiaries of  apartheid in the past will have to be made.""    WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN    KwaZulu Land Deal -- A brief editorial in the Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL  GUARDIAN in English on page 28 of its 27 May  to 2  June issue keeps alive the recent KwaZulu land transfer. The  editorial says that while President Mandela, ""master unifier  that he is,"" might have been expected ""to play down the  seriousness"" of the ""secret land deal,"" no one else has ""to fall  in step."" The paper sees the incident as ""an early test of the  way in which this country will work under the government of  national unity. The government, without effective parliamentary  opposition, will try and brush aside embarrassing conflicts  and...encourage the media to go along with this."" ""We won't,""  promises the paper.    NEW NATION    100-Day Reform Program Viewed -- ""The minutes have started  ticking by since President Nelson Mandela announced his 100-day  reform programme in Parliament this week,"" begins the  Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 27 May in a page 14  editorial. We ""welcome the President's approach in making the  RDP [Reconstruction and Development Program] a `people-driven'  process."" ""This approach played a critical role in giving a  voice to voters' needs and also shaped the programme of action  which was pursued by their leaders. It would be tragic if we  were to fail like the United States of America did during the  presidency of Lyndon Johnson, when the privileged white  community proved unwilling to share their material success with  people of other races."" The South African plan should succeed,  however, because it ""is aimed at unlocking the energies of the  multitudes who were denied the opportunities given their white  counterparts through the country's draconian apartheid laws.""    BEELD    Mandela's Parliamentary Address Viewed -- ""A people-centered  community -- this was the theme and refrain yesterday of  President Nelson Mandela's opening address in Parliament,""  begins a page 12 editorial in Afrikaans in the Johannesburg  BEELD on 25 May. ""Freedom and human dignity formed the basis of  the vision offered by Mr. Mandela, and the fact that he  mentioned the word vision confirms that he is aware of his task  -- that is, leading through inspiration. If the New South  Africa accepts these ideals then a good future awaits the people  of this country, and a people-centered community will be  established. Each government must have a philosophy, but that  alone will not create jobs or feed mouths. The real test will  be in the program of action -- the practicality of the policies,  the management, and the good leadership by government in  realizing the above."" ""Our impression is that President  Mandela's approach reflects a reasonable and sound policy.""    Country's Admission to OAU `Positive'-- A second editorial  on  the same page notes that ""South Africa's formal admission to the  Organization of African Unity is the fulfillment of a dream.  This will have a positive influence on the country itself, on  southern Africa, as well as in the rest of Africa."" ""For as  long as whites withheld equal rights from their fellow citizens  this dream would have been impossible to realize. Africa was  often placed in a serious dilemma because of South Africa. The  advantages of technical and economic contact often overcame  ideological aversion to the 'apartheid regime'. In addition to  this Africa was often guilty of worse atrocities than those it  accused the 'regime' of. Now that South Africa is allowed to  fulfill its rightful role, South Africans should not expect too  much, because Africa and the OAU carries very little weight  globally. In befriending the rest of Africa, South Africa  should not neglect its most valuable friend, the West.""     "

The move invites a confrontation that could endanger the already  meager flow of funds to the desperate African nations.    Behind the initiative is a controversy over whether the bitter medicine being  administered by major sources of money, including the World Bank and IMF, has  been working. A report by the World Bank in March argued that nations adopting  strong reform programs are indeed doing better than the others. The ECA  disagrees and, in a report released Thursday, concluded that ""more often than  not, even the positive results that might be achieved through the conventional  programs, could be outweighed by . . . negative consequences.""    ECA's report promotes the ""African Alternative Framework,"" a complex formula  for a ""more human-centered development process."" It would modify the existing  emphasis on reduced budgets, traditional export promotion, credit squeezes,  free trade and what the authors of the new study call ""doctrinaire  privatization."" The report is laudable in its sensitivity to the dimension of  suffering in Africa, its recognition of the importance of agriculture and its  candid recognition of African weaknesses, including the centralized,  non-democratic governments that prevail. It calls for ""a prominent focus"" on  such things as ""employment generation for the majority of the population,  equitable income distribution especially to households and vulnerable groups  and the satisfaction of the essential needs of the people."" But World Bank  officials can argue persuasively that the best way to address those problems is  to make growth the first priority, increasing the size of the pie, rather than  making equitable divisions of an admittedly inadequate pie the first priority.    Adebayo Adedeji, the respected Nigerian executive secretary of the ECA, is the  moving spirit behind the report. Through it, he is asking the sources of  external credit and aid to soften the conditions imposed on recipients and to  provide funds on more flexible terms, trusting that the money will be  well-spent. But the report admits that ""government interventions in Africa have  so far become discredited, not because there is an effective alternative in the  form of efficient market mechanism, but because of inefficient management, poor  results and misallocation of resources.""    The report's lack of confidence in the private sector raises the danger of  allowing Africa to repeat the errors of the past when bureaucracies paralyzed  progress. If nothing else, the report may serve to underscore one issue on  which all agree, and that is the desperate need for more money. The United  States, for example, has failed to provide the increased aid promised in  exchange for economic reform, but the debt relief plan announced Thursday by  President Bush will help many nations significantly.    Africa stands out among the developing continents, the only region where there  has been a decline in almost every element of society and the economies. Unlike  Asia and Latin America, Africa is seeing a steady decline in per capita food  supplies and per capita gross national product, despite what had been a  relatively high flow of aid. That has now reversed into a net outflow because  of declining new credits and debt repayment burdens. Internal organizational  failures have been made worse by the collapse of prices for primary commodities  on which most African nations depend for export earnings. Droughts and civil  wars have compounded the misery, flooding already impoverished nations with  tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring states.    Some of the ECA report's proposals may contribute constructively to fine-tuning  the essential reforms to minimize the impact on the already impoverished  people. It may be possible to do that without turning off the flow of resources  so urgently needed. That, however, will require a process of collaboration and  consultation rather than the confrontation that appears implicit in the new  report.

Unlike  Asia and Latin America, Africa is seeing a steady decline in per capita food  supplies and per capita gross national product, despite what had been a  relatively high flow of aid. That has now reversed into a net outflow because  of declining new credits and debt repayment burdens. Internal organizational  failures have been made worse by the collapse of prices for primary commodities  on which most African nations depend for export earnings. Droughts and civil  wars have compounded the misery, flooding already impoverished nations with  tens of thousands of refugees from neighboring states.    Some of the ECA report's proposals may contribute constructively to fine-tuning  the essential reforms to minimize the impact on the already impoverished  people. It may be possible to do that without turning off the flow of resources  so urgently needed. That, however, will require a process of collaboration and  consultation rather than the confrontation that appears implicit in the new  report.      Editorial    "

0,FT943-15124 ,"FT943-15124 _AN-EGKDTAERFT 940711   FT  11 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: Buyers still shy of South Africa - International      By GRAHAM BOWLEY   South Africa's new government has worked hard to reassure international investors of its intention to keep its budget deficit firmly under control, and to a large extent it has been successful. But bond investors will require further reassurance if they are to keep faith with the new South Africa. The government's first budget on June 22 went a long way towards doing this. It was tough on public spending, with the budget deficit forecast to be 6.6 per cent of gross domestic product for the current financial year, down from 9 per cent two years ago. However, the sharp rise in bond yields on Tuesday following the resignation of Mr Derek Keys, the widely respected finance minister and the man largely responsible for proving South Africa's fiscal credentials, is a measure of how nervous the financial markets remain. Investors fear the government, faced with so many demands on its resources as it embarks on its ambitious plan of reconstruction and development, will overshoot spending targets. To fund the growing budget deficit it might then be tempted to print money, so fuelling inflation, or issue more bonds in world markets, so driving up yields. However, South African government bond yields have risen almost 3 percentage points to almost 15 per cent since the start of the year and only part of this increase can be explained by these fears. The rise in yields is due mainly to the fall in world bond markets; South Africa, like most of the world, has been buffeted by worries about strengthening global economic recovery and rising world inflation. This is understandable, since in South Africa it is international investors who on the margin are the main influence on bond yields, and increasingly so as more foreign investors are tempted into the newly open economy. At the end of 1992, the South African public sector bond market was roughly the equivalent of Dollars 59.4bn in size, about the same as Australia's. Although most of the country's government bonds are owned by domestic investors, they are constrained by foreign exchange controls and tend to hold on to bonds to maturity rather than trade them. It is therefore unlikely that South African bond yields will fall back until international sentiment improves and bond yields, especially in the US, decline. The economy came out of a three-year recession last year and is expected to grow by more than 3 per cent this year, boosted in part by overseas investment and by export growth after years of an international boycott. Inflation has fallen significantly from the double digit rates of the 1980s, to 7.3 per cent in May, and although with renewed economic growth it may not have further to fall, it is still declining, which will have a beneficial impact on the bond market. This relatively bright outlook for the South African bond market, however, has to be tempered with caution as the situation could turn sour. The money supply is expanding rapidly - M0 grew by a preliminary 22.8 per cent in the year to March - an indication that inflation may be more of a problem in the future. That could mean a serious test of the Reserve Bank's, and governor Chris Stals', autonomy at a time when the new government will not be keen to see a rise in interest rates. A further risk is political. So far, the new government of national unity has worked well. But the pressure on the administration is tremendous and the expectations of the formerly disenfranchised population are great; conflicts between the finance ministry and other government departments on spending levels may be unavoidable. The role of Mr Christo Liebenberg, who will succeed Mr Keys as finance minister later this year, will be of primary importance. An experienced banker, with no formal political affiliations, his appointment shows the government intends to keep a firm hold on public spending. However, he lacks Mr Keys' powerful personality, and without Mr Keys' carefully nurtured relationship with top figures in the African National Congress, he may not command the same respect in the new government. 'There may be a change of face, there may be a change of style, but there won't be a change of direction,' Mr FW de Klerk, deputy president, said last week. With such unlikely bedfellows in the new government, the financial markets will take some convincing. There is no doubt that international investors will be watching developments closely, even more so after being unnerved by Mr Keys' departure. As it steps up its efforts to acquire an international credit rating in an attempt to return to the international capital markets, the government may, therefore, be even stricter than it would have been with its public finances and implement the spending controls proposed in Mr Keys' last budget in full.

0,FT934-7752 ,"FT934-7752 _AN-DKRC7AGCFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (1): A new nation starts to take shape - Nearly four years after Nelson Mandela's release, South Africa begins a fresh era      By PATTI WALDMEIR   YESTERDAY South Africa broke the twisted mould of apartheid, and cast away the bits. After decades spent fighting the tide of history, which submerged other racist regimes long ago, South Africa yesterday opted to join the modern world. It can now play a full role at the United Nations, rejoin the Commonwealth, become a member of the Organisation of African Unity, and play a much-needed, constructive role in the development of southern Africa and beyond. Yesterday's agreement on a post-apartheid constitution is the first irrevocable step on the path to full democracy; but it is only a first step. The next few months and years will show whether South Africa's tenure as a democratic nation will be nasty, brutish and short, or stable, happy and prosperous; whether it will substitute black domination for white repression; whether it will defy the logic of divided societies worldwide, and nurture true multi-ethnic democracy. Though the mould of apartheid has been broken, Africa provides other unfortunate models for the new state: tyrannical regimes which abused power, crushed dissent and lay waste whole economies through maladministration, corruption and theft. South African politicians, black and white, bridle at the comparison: Finance Minister Derek Keys offers the consensus view when he insists that South Africa 'will be totally different from the rest of Africa. It always has been and it always will be'. Economically, that is obviously so. Mr Keys points to South Africa's clear superiority in terms of 'indigenous capital', both human and financial. The new leaders will manage the continent's most powerful economy, with gross domestic product equal to 75 per cent of sub-Saharan Africa's gdp, with an economic hinterland which stretches as far north as Zaire, generating half of Africa's electricity. Even in broader international terms, it compares well: with a well developed stock market, banking sector, and body of company law, South Africa offers more to the investor than, for example, eastern Europe; and with foreign debt at USDollars 17.3bn, or 15 per cent of gdp, it is underborrowed by any standard. In political terms, too, South Africa is different. In 1957, when Ghana became the first African nation to gain independence from Britain, Kwame Nkrumah inherited a position of largely unfettered power. But South Africa's first black president - likely to be the African National Congress leader, Nelson Mandela - will find his room for manoeuvre far more circumscribed, in law, and more importantly, in fact. 'South Africa is too big for the ANC,' says one ANC member who bemoans the complexity of a society which imposes manifold constraints on the party of government: he believes they will inhibit the ANC's ability to transform South Africa virtuously; others welcome these constraints as curbs to abuse of power. But all would agree that South Africa does not fit the classic African mould of a society which easily falls prey to bad government. Strong interest groups counterbalance the power of government: chief among them is a strong, diversified and battle-hardened corporate sector; the 1.2m-strong labour federation Cosatu, historically allied to the ANC, has recently begun flexing its independent muscle, and is well organised and powerful enough to play the role of democracy's watchdog. The highly politicised and motivated township 'civics', or community associations, could also prove an important check on government power: for South Africa's 'masses' are not the fawning crowd which greeted Kwame Nkrumah, African liberator; they are demanding, well organised, and used to fighting their political corner. The list of powerful interest groups outside the ANC's sphere goes on and on: the 1.2m strong civil service is dominated by Afrikaners, who are scarcely natural allies of the ANC. The defence force, though professional and committed to supporting the government of the day, is also Afrikaans-dominated, as is the police. Last, and arguably least of the factors constraining an ANC government, is the constitution agreed yesterday by the main political parties. That constitution was meant to prevent majority domination through power sharing: it was supposed to guarantee democracy by ensuring that the minority losers in any majority-rule election would still enjoy a powerful say in government. It falls some way short of so doing: minorities will be represented in government, with every party earning 5 per cent of the national vote entitled to a seat in cabinet; but the power of minority parties in cabinet is precarious. The ANC, which will have both a president and a deputy president, will have its own way on any disputed decision. And though it has promised regular consultation with the second deputy president, drawn from the second largest party (probably Mr FW de Klerk, current president), he will have no statutory powers to frustrate Mr Mandela's will. The constitution fails to deliver other checks and balances which the ruling National Party had insisted were essential. The party's 1991 constitutional proposals called for political power to be divided between three tiers of government - central, regional and local - with each tier to have 'original and entrenched authority with which other tiers of government may not interfere'. In fact, central government retains wide powers to 'interfere' with regional governments: the constitution authorises central government to intervene in terms so vague (to impose uniform national norms and standards, to ensure proper regulation, and where there are implications for national security or economic policy) as seriously to undermine regional autonomy. And with regions barred from imposing taxes without central government approval, it is hard to accept Mr de Klerk's claim that the new state will be 'federal'. National Party negotiators believe that they will not need entrenched constitutional provisions to play a powerful role in restraining the ANC: they believe the ANC's assurances that it does not wish to govern alone (and does not believe it could do so effectively); and they judge their electoral strength will give them an important say in cabinet, though only if they are able to better their poll showing of 11 to 13 per cent. But clearly, the National Party has settled well below its bottom line on crucial issues; probably, it had no choice. As a minority government whose power diminishes by the day, negotiators calculated that a deal done now would be preferable to that available next month or next year. And whatever the shortcomings of the constitution, agreement is better than continuing deadlock. Though it is not strong enough, it is far from illiberal, and should help to reinforce democratic forces. But if South Africa does escape some of the more grotesque abuses of power for which Africa is famous, it is scarcely likely to become a prosperous liberal democracy overnight. The new bill of rights enshrines tough emergency powers which can be used to restore stability after the April 27 elections. Agreement seems to exist between the ANC and NP that restoring stability, through temporary repression, is the highest post-election priority. According to this scenario, democracy will be a temporary casualty while the new government pursues stability and economic development; and if it succeeds in restoring law and order without repeating the oppression of the past, it will be widely popular with an electorate (white and black) fed up with crime and violence. Much will depend on whether the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi can be persuaded to participate in next year's elections: though he has made clear that he rejects yesterday's constitution, he could decide he has more to gain by fighting rather than boycotting an election. If he actively opposes the poll, the security situation could become untenable, especially if the white right wing, now in tactical alliance with Inkatha, also opposes the election. The ANC and NP must guarantee that there is critical mass at the political centre, and that the crackdown need only suppress the lunatic fringe. If Inkatha and the right wing, with their numbers and their firepower, are to be suppressed in unison, stability may be unattainable. But in the end, it is economics - and not politics - which will seal South Africa's fate. For yesterday's constitution marks a decisive shift in electoral power from the 'haves' to the 'have-nots' of South African society.' Popular expectations will soon strain the intentions of even the most benevolent government; at that point, it must either give in to populism, or suppress it. The latter now seems most likely: the new South Africa will start with a hefty dollop of the old. That will be unfortunate, but bearable; what will destroy South Africa's democratic prospects forever is failure to deliver a better economic deal to the masses. It is a tall order.

The ceremony was presided over by Army General Raul Castro,  second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba and minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who moments before the ceremony  made exclusive comments for this newscast:    [Begin Castro recording] This is the most important event of  the century, and Mandela -- I was thinking the other day -- is  the greatest leader of the century. I even dare say the greatest  leader Africa has had in its long history.    As you know, ceremonies such as this are being held in over  150 mausoleums nationwide as a salute to the death of apartheid;  the birth of the new South Africa; and to remember our comrades  whose blood and effort, as leaders of the ANC including Mandela  have pointed out, were instrumental in reaching 10 May, a day  such as today. This is a highly moving day for us, a day of deep  remembrance and immense gratitude toward all our dead comrades.  Once again, this shows that in a third country -- first Angola,  then Namibia, and now South Africa -- the effort and the  bloodshed were not in vain. They conducted the most glorious  internationalist missions. I say glorious because they were  probably the most selfless acts in the history of mankind, of a  people toward their African brothers, a significant limb of our  national identity.

0,FT922-14133 ,"FT922-14133 _AN-CDHA7ACZFT 920408   FT  08 APR 92 / World Stock Markets: A dry season in prospect for Johannesburg stocks - A nervous mood pervades the JSE      By PHILIP GAWITH   The euphoria which accompanied the resounding referendum victory in South Africa three weeks ago has been replaced by a nervous mood on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) as investors contemplate the fragility of overseas markets and a number of negative factors on the domestic front. Although a negative outcome of the referendum would have been a catastrophe for the market, a positive outcome had been largely discounted. Analysts agree that its effect was neutral, since it merely confirmed that the country is addressing the complicated process of political negotiation, with all the attendant uncertainties. Buoyed by the strongly rising Dow Jones Industrial Average, the JSE all-share index rose nearly 8 per cent in the first two weeks of January. However, with the gold price slumping to a near six-year low in March, the market lost a lot of its momentum. This was followed by a 2 per cent fall last week as the JSE tracked the movements of the weak Japanese and London markets. The overall index closed at 3,440 yesterday, (the market was closed on Monday for a public holiday), down 7.4 per cent from its 1992 high of 3,713 in mid-January. Mr Roy McAlpine of Liberty Asset Management, the fund managers, comments: 'Everybody agreed that for the last few months the market looked fairly frothy. In this situation, at any possible opportunity it is likely to have a correction.' The weakness in the Nikkei average, he says, merely precipitated what was bound to happen eventually. Mr McAlpine observes that a frothy market in South Africa normally stops people buying, but it doesn't make them sell out. Hence last week's correction took place on fairly low volume. He also argues that the market is technically strong in the sense that it is dominated by institutions which hold most of the prime stock, and which tend to take a long-term view. Two factors on the mining side have had a bearish influence on the market: a very weak gold bullion price and a recent fall in the share price of De Beers, which closed yesterday at R83.80, down from a year's high of R96.85. De Beers dominates the JSE, making up nearly 10 per cent of the overall index. Last year turnover in De Beers accounted for 11 per cent of total turnover. The recent slide in its share price reflects poor prospects in 1992 which have led analysts to predict flat earnings for the year. Two other recent events which failed to revive the JSE were the country's budget, and the announcement by the Reserve Bank (central bank) of a 1 per cent cut in interest rates. Mr Rob Lee of the Board of Executors investment institution, says investors were disappointed by the budget, because although it was expansionary, and hence good for short-term growth, it did not contain fiscal incentives for business or individuals. The cut in interest rates was widely discounted, so it had a negligible effect. Of potential benefit for foreign investors was the recent announcement by the Reserve Bank that it plans to intervene in the volatile financial rand market. If the bank succeeds in narrowing the discount between the investment currency and the commercial rand, this would offer a currency appreciation for foreigners, thus making the JSE more attractive. It is too early, however, to properly assess the implications of the Bank's announcement. One potential threat to market prices, which is being ignored for now, is the country's severe drought which economists estimate will knock at least 0.5 per cent off economic growth this year. Mr McAlpine notes that historically there has been little correlation between GDP growth and the performance of the JSE. Analysts agree that shares are looking fully priced until there is evidence of an economic upturn, which is not expected until later in the year. Although there is unanimity that 1992 will not see the industrial index rise again by 40 per cent, as in 1991, there is also a widespread belief that the country's longer term prospects are good, and that the stock market will continue to reflect this.

In a report to the standing committee  for safety and security at Nasrec [National Exhibition Center]  near Soweto, Duarte said the creation of peace and the  rebuilding of communities on the East Rand were high on her list  of priorities.    Other priorities included the establishment of community  policing forums, car theft, rape, allegations of police torture,  and gun control legislation.    Duarte said the improvement of working conditions for  policemen and the upgrading of police stations were also  ""absolute necessities"".    ""Job satisfaction is certainly not the motivating factor for  entering the SAPS [South African Police Service]. Rather, job  necessity seems to be the factor motivating people.""    She added that solving the problem of disillusionment,  without looking at a programme of affirmative action for black  police personnel in particular, was not possible.    Duarte said efforts to stabilise the East Rand had already  begun, with the creation of an IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]-ANC  working group to look at the opening of ""no-go areas"", the  resumption of train services between Kwesini and Katlehong, and  the security of residents returning to their homes.    She explained proposals to reorientate members of  self-defence and self-protection units created to protect  communities and hostels. Duarte said a programme, organised by  the PWV MEC [member executive council] for education, had been  established to enable members of the units between the ages of  13 and 18 to attend six- month ""reintegration school programmes""  to prepare them for admission to ordinary schools.    Members between the ages of 19 and 24 would be put through  adult literacy programmes and be assisted with job creation or  entrance to tertiary institutions.    And older members would be assisted in joining the police  force as reservists or organised into neighbourhood watch  programmes.    Duarte said that according to the defence force about 20,000  illegal weapons were in circulation on the East Rand and an  amnesty or gun collection campaign would retrieve only about 10  percent of the weapons.    One of the problems was community scepticism about the  police  force and the number of weapons illegally owned by criminals,  said Duarte.    The ""unprecedented"" increase in rapes and violent crime  against women had prompted the urgent need for members of the  police force to be trained to deal with victims, said Duarte.    She also proposed the creation of a commission of inquiry to  investigate police torture.     "

AFRICA LEAVES 11 DEAD      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      A bitter dispute over South Africa's homelands policy erupted in weekend  rioting, leaving nine black police officers and two civilians dead in  Leeuwfontein, a village recently forced by Pretoria to become part of the  nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana.    Bophuthatswana police went door to door Sunday, arresting at least several  hundred residents of the town, including two key tribal leaders. And police  helicopters scoured the countryside for others who had fled onto white-owned  farms in South Africa seeking refuge. By nightfall, only a few women and  children remained in the shacks of the rural community of 18,000.    The melee came six months after South Africa's white minority-led government  decreed that Leeuwfontein and next-door Braklaagte were to become part of  Bophuthatswana, a homeland comprising seven separate tracts of land inside  South Africa. So far, court challenges to the South African proclamation have  been unsuccessful, and the angry residents are seeking permission to appeal.      'A Desperate Point'    ""It had reached a very desperate point where people had lost faith in anything  ever returning to normal,"" Aninka Claassens, a spokesman for the Transvaal  Rural Action Committee, said in an interview Sunday night. ""They had tried  everything.""    The Action Committee provides legal support for Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte and  has worked extensively in the towns, about 180 miles northwest of Johannesburg.    The violence was the latest in a series of incidents that have hampered  Pretoria's 13-year-old attempt to force blacks into ethnic homelands, thereby  depriving them of their South African citizenship. More than 11 million of  South Africa's 26 million blacks live in 10 homelands, four of which, like  Bophuthatswana, have been declared independent states but remain almost totally  dependent on South Africa.      Little Recognition    Most of the world refuses to recognize the Pretoria-created homelands as  sovereign states. In fact, international anti-apartheid groups have  consistently called on entertainers to boycott the Sun City casino resort,  which is located in Bophuthatswana and pays taxes to its 12-year-old black  government.    The latest trouble broke out Saturday afternoon during a meeting of several  thousand Leeuwfontein residents that was called to discuss the efforts to  extricate themselves from Bophuthatswana's control. The town's population had  swelled because it was the end of the month and many migrant workers had  returned home with their paychecks.    Some residents said fighting erupted after police arrived to break up the  meeting. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, and  witnesses said they heard automatic weapons fire.      Four Officers Killed    The Bophuthatswana authorities said four police officers were killed when their  armored personnel carrier was destroyed by a gasoline bomb. South African  authorities, who last year stepped in to put down an attempted military coup  d'etat in Bophuthatswana's capital, Mmabatho, said they were not involved in  the weekend incidents.    But Paul van der Merwe, a farmer who lives near Leeuwfontein, said he saw South  African security forces on Sunday conferring with Bophuthatswana police  officials on a remote section of his farm, in South Africa just outside the  Bophuthatswana border.    Van der Merwe said dozens of residents of Leeuwfontein have used his farm to  escape harassment by the Bophuthatswana police in recent months. And the farmer  has refused requests by South African and Bophuthatswana authorities to press  charges against the villagers for trespassing, saying he relies on them to help  him plant and harvest his 4,000-acre farm and ranch.    ""I'm not going to do that. We are neighbors,"" he said.    Before Jan. 1, the land that includes Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte had been part  of South Africa, in between two distinct sections of Bophuthatswana. The  government proclamation incorporating the two villages into the homeland  surprised most residents, who said they had not been consulted, as required by  South African law.    The two communities didn't want to lose their South African citizenship, but  they also feared retribution from Bophuthatswana authorities. The region's  Tswana tribal chiefs have been violently opposed to Bophuthatswana's South  Africa-supported president, Lucas Manyane Mangope, also a Tswana chief, since  the 1950s.      Patrolled by Police    Since they became part of Bophuthatswana, Leeuwfontein and Braklaagte have been  heavily patrolled by the homeland police, and sporadic violence has been  reported. Eighty people were injured during a police raid in Leeuwfontein in  March, and residents said that the authorities beat or arrested anyone who  refused to say they loved Bophuthatswana.    About one-third of South Africa's residents -- or about half of the nation's  blacks -- live in the homelands, which cover only 13% of the country's land  area. Pretoria's original intent was to counter the increasing demands for  black voting rights in South Africa by creating independent states outside  white-designated South Africa where the country's voteless black majority could  exercise their political rights.    But the policy has been a drain on Pretoria's coffers, and it has come under  heavy criticism from outside and inside the government in recent years. South  Africa spends more than $1 billion annually supporting the homeland  governments, but, because the land is generally rugged and the homeland leaders  often corrupt, poverty remains endemic.

0,FT924-3264 ,"FT924-3264 _AN-CLJACAA4FT 921209   FT  09 DEC 92 / Pretoria cancels talks with PAC after murders      By PATTI WALDMEIR      JOHANNESBURG   THE SOUTH African government said yesterday it was cancelling planned talks with the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress and would hold no further negotiations with the group until it distanced itself from attacks carried out by its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla). Yesterday the PAC further enraged the government, which is under pressure from its white supporters to take a tough line on racial violence, by defending Apla, which has claimed two attacks on white civilians over the past 10 days. Five people have died. Orde Boerevolk (Order of the Afrikaans People), a white splinter group, said it would bomb black taxi ranks in retaliation. Other white right-wing groups, most small but with former and serving security force officers among their members, also threatened vengeance. The Conservative party, the largest white opposition group, asked its supporters to report to their nearest CP office to help counter the Apla threat. Tour operators said publicity over the attacks, notably in the UK, had prompted some to cancel Christmas holidays. White South Africans have been shocked by Apla statements declaring war on whites - despite the fact that, in a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, the risk of falling victim to racist terrorism is small. In the past, political commentators have tended to dismiss the PAC, which waged a guerrilla war from exile for more than 30 years until it was unbanned in 1990, but can claim few previous attacks on military or civilian targets. But they point out that the African National Congress's decision to enter negotiations with the government has alienated some radical black youths, and has probably boosted PAC membership. Although a recent opinion poll put this at only 3 per cent nationwide, the organisation has recently struck a chord with radical township youths by condemning the white reaction to Apla's attacks: the PAC argues, not without foundation, that whites ignore thousands of black deaths and react only when whites also die. The PAC army has established bases in the Transkei black 'homeland', where three out of five members of the ruling Military Council are understood to be PAC sympathisers. Ironically, one effect has been to cement the improving relationship between the ANC and the government, which are negotiating to rule South Africa by coalition in the transition to full democracy. In the face of PAC leaders defending their slogan 'one settler one bullet', the ANC, which has condemned the attacks, appears more moderate. The Apla campaign - even if it claims no further victims - is likely to undermine progress in constitutional negotiations. The government had succeeded in recent months in persuading the PAC to join talks on a new constitution, but PAC officials have now said they will no longer participate in talks, or in an interim government.

I would like to ask you one very personal  question. You studied in South Africa. You were at Fort Hare  University, and you have been avoiding coming to this country  for very a long time. With the demise of apartheid how do you  feel being back in the Cape?    [Mugabe] It's a great feeling to be back to South Africa. I  was back actually at the time of the inauguration, to attend the  inauguration of President Mandela, and that was a great feeling,  a great feeling indeed because I had last been here in 1952,  only when I came back for graduation. I stayed in South Africa,  I think for two years up to 19...[pauses] end of '51, in the  Eastern Cape. A lot of things have happened since then, when I  was at Fort Hare, and apartheid was just beginning to be  implemented, and I remember the students who belonged to the  African National Congress Youth League planning real action by  way of demonstrations, sit-ins, and passive resistance, but  after that the struggle took other dimensions, and there was  armed struggle.    It was during that period -- we were in exile together with  the ANC and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], and together we  planned the strategies to defeat colonialism in whatever form,  whether it was in the form of apartheid or in form of UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence], as in southern  Rhodesia then. And we got our independence in 1980, 14 years  before South Africa got its freedom and democracy.    Of course, when we got our own freedom, we never regarded  that as complete freedom of Africa, and we had always worked on  a program, yes, for us to get our own freedom in what was  Rhodesia, but also for others -- Namibia to get its own  independence; South Africa to get its own freedom and democracy,  and that was a long, long wait, a very long wait indeed. We all  longed for a day when apartheid would go, when we could interact  with South Africa, and we could visit South Africa and the South  Africans could visit us. The day has now come, so it's a  tremendous joy.    [Mashokwe] Were you at all surprised by the turn of events  come February 1990, when President De Klerk then announced these  changes?    [Mugabe] Yes, a mixture of both surprise and disbelief.  Surprise, because we never expected that the leader of an  Afrikaner Party, the National Party, which in fact had been the  initiator of apartheid, could one day reverse it in that  dramatic way. It was indeed dramatic, too dramatic for us to  believe, but there it was.    When it was first announced, we thought it was just  palliative, the statement was just palliative in that apartheid  would not really go, but when one measure after another was  taken to undo it and completely eradicate it from the statute  book, then we started to believe.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, do you ever regret the stance that  you took? You were known to be very vocal against apartheid.  You didn't mince your words on this. When you look back, your  country suffered a lot of economic ills. You were destabilized  in the process. When you look back, do you have any regrets?    [Mugabe] We don't regret having taken the steps that we  took.  In fact, a country like Zimbabwe, who did not go the full length  in opposing apartheid -- we wished we could have done more, but  it was not possible because of the linkage between our economies  -- the South African economy and Zimbabwe, a linkage that was  consolidated by Ian Smith during UDI, and when Rhodesia was made  to depend on South Africa. But politically, diplomatically we  took quite a rigid stand, and we were not to have anything to do  with those who were in charge of apartheid here and in  government, therefore, because we held them responsible. We  don't regret having taken that rigid stand at all, but we regret  the loss of life that ensued, the sabotage that was carried out  in Zimbabwe, destruction of ANC property and the loss of life  that followed that destruction of property. That we regret. We  still have those wounds. We still have the scars, the damaged  buildings. They still are there, and in fact we still have  prisoners we have arrested--people we have arrested for  committing those acts of sabotage. But all that was really the  amount of sacrifice we were called upon to make in order for us  to have the day that now we have. In order for us to return to  South Africa, we had to do all that.    [Mashokwe] The prisoners -- are they going to be released at  any stage? What are the possibilities?    [Mugabe] Well, we are reviewing their cases. There are only  five in our prison, and one of whom is a South African,  (?called) (Zwayo), and the other four were South Africa's agents  from white Rhodesia -- Rhodesians who worked with South Africa,  but President De Klerk and now President Mandela have all  appealed to me for possibly their release, but their death  sentences had been commuted to life imprisonment, and therefore  they are not going to die, but we are reviewing their cases.    I consulted with the Minister of Justice the other day, and  we thought we should review their cases in the same way as we  review the cases of our own, but now that here people have been  pardoned, people who were guilty of what one might call  political crimes, and had been pardoned, except a few, we might  very well review their cases in a favorable way.    [Mashokwe] In South Africa we talk of this truth commission  where South Africans are saying: Let's know what happened in the  past. Let's pardon people, including right-wingers probably.    [Mugabe] Pardons, sure, must be granted. The past must go.  Bygones must be bygones, and this is what I said in March 1980,  when I appealed to both the black and white community to work  together. They had to forget the past. They had now to  recognize that whether yesterday they had fought as enemies or  as allies, they could no longer actually do without each other,  whichever way things go. We shall live side by side with each  other, and therefore, there had to be a recognition of that  common belonging, a common denominator that came about as a  result of our independence.    The same with South Africa. There is that common denominator  and your situation here is even much more complex than our own.  We are only 10.5 million. You are 40-plus million, and  therefore it's a big population you have, but apart from that a  population that also subdivides itself into various races,  various tribes, people living in various regions and a number of  religious affiliations, and so it's a much more complex  situation, and I admire the stance that President Mandela and of  course the ANC have taken in demonstrating that this is now a  new South Africa, which requires a new ideology, a new political  outlook that binds everyone together and makes the people of  South Africa have a common destiny, which means there is that  greater sense of belonging to South Africa, greater sense of  nationality than there ever was before. At least that's what is  being cultivated and we admire that.    [Mashokwe] We talk now of the conference that you attended,  on the threshold of the new era. Many critics say that this  threshold never really reaches the ordinary people of southern  Africa, of Africa. What is your comment on this?    [Mugabe] No, it does reach to the ordinary people of African  grassroots, and we are always talking about the grassroots.  True, when policies are first enunciated they don't  immediately....[pauses] They don't go down to the masses until  they have been explained, but this is the work that our  subordinates must be doing in the regions and at various levels,  to tell the people that we are now one, but of course it will  take time for some of our people to forget and to forgive and  forget, but the leadership, if it does continue to preach  national reconciliation and national unity, national harmony,  the message will get through. I assure you.    [Mashokwe] Unemployment in Zimbabwe is said to be about a  fifth of your people there. We have the same kind of problems.  Is there no danger, not just in Zimbabwe -- South Africa has  the same problem -- is there no danger of unemployed people  overturning political gains?    [Mugabe] No, I think the numbers are exaggerated. We have  quite a lot of youngsters, yes, who are unemployed but our  situation is quite different from yours. We are less urbanized  than South Africa, less industrialized than South Africa. In  industries -- we have in Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, yes --  but over 70 percent of the people, between 70 and 80 percent,  are over [sentence as heard]. And the youngsters who are  unemployed by and large are people with roots back in the rural  areas. They come into urban areas to seek employment, but when  they can't get that employment they go back to the rural areas.  There is hardly a Zimbabwean who says Harare is his home. None.    We all have our roots where people can do agriculture, and  this is a solution that really, that we find amongst us -- that  is, if the going is not that good in town, people can always go  back to the rural areas and eat, provided of course we have not  been struck by droughts, and so there is that aspect. People can  do agriculture, and our youth, we are now trying to mobilize so  some of them, I hope a substantial number, can pursue  agriculture you see, as a way of life. But this is not to say  we don't have a sizable number of people unemployed. Yes, the  reason they are unemployed is not because there had been any  mismanagement of the economy, but rather that colonial -- the  colonial legacy that we have has been that of underdevelopment  in what was regarded as the African sector in the rural areas  and also the development of skills was delayed or denied in some  cases.    Therefore, even though the jobs are there but they are jobs  for skilled men, and these cannot be found in every case. With  jobs in industry, even in the public service, you see, we have  jobs, but they require skilled people. In some cases the white  employers go out of Zimbabwe to get skilled personnel, people  with high skills whom they want to be managers or to be highly  trained technicians operating in the -- I mean, to undertake  operations in their industries. So that is one reason, but of  course we are now engaged in trying to transform the system and  opening it up to investment, encouraging existing investment to  expand and, thereby, create more jobs. It will take us time,  but we are doing that.    [Mashokwe] What role, Mr. President, do you see for South  Africa in the Southern African Development Community?    [Mugabe] Oh, a tremendous role. South Africa will now come  with its heavy muscle and join us. Heavy muscle, because it is  a highly developed country. It has its own problems, of course,  of underdevelopment in certain sectors, but you have highly  developed industries and that gives South Africa quite a muscle  with which it can interact with us as we relate to it, both  multilaterally within the region, and also bilaterally.    We trade with South Africa. Zimbabwe is the largest trading  partner South Africa has in Africa, and 20 percent of our  imports come from this country, and so we are quite a market.  Botswana gets about 80 percent of its imports from this country  and so also is a good market, and now what we want to see is an  economic order that binds us together in a cooperative way, and  of course the benefits must be reciprocal. We must open up our  borders, remove tariffs, or lower them for a start, and trade  with each other as freely as we can.    [Mashokwe] Is there no fear of this big brother image which  could probably bring about concern or suspicion?    [Mugabe] Oh, no, no, no. We are very happy. In fact we are  encouraging countries whom whenever we speak and this subject  arises, we always encourage countries to help South Africa at  this stage. South Africa will need a lot more of aid by way of  investment, even grants for a start. We had that kind of, you  know, boost at the beginning of our independence, and at least  to get us...[pauses] to get our economy to be reconstructed and  rehabilitated, and South Africa needs that kind of assistance  from the whole of the international community.    Yes, when one looks at Cape Town and Johannesburg, Durban,  and the other big cities one is impressed by what happens there.  But one must look also, even within those cities, at the  depressed areas, you see, the townships, that has been  neglected. One must look at the systems, social systems that  operate and see whether these systems are equitable or  inequitable. Look at the educational system. A lot needs to be  done really to rehabilitate, to reconstruct and restructure it  in such a way that it is the education that formally on the  blacks [as heard].    Education systems can be boosted, can be qualitatively  transformed and brought to the level of the education that was  obtained on the European side, and this is what we had to do in  our own country -- remove the inequities of the past, all the  inequalities.    That will require some funding, a lot, lot more funding and  investment is required in order for the economy to continue to  grow, and if South Africa prospers that way they will get the  benefits as well, by way of the new technology which has come to  South Africa.    There would be companies that will come to Zimbabwe, to  Botswana. We already have lots of South African companies in our  country and the technology that their parent companies acquire  here will be technology that the subsidiaries elsewhere will  require, but of course, within the system of our interaction,  cooperation, the benefits by way of technology will be our  benefits. The benefits by way of capital goods will also be our  benefit. We will use machinery for our mines from South Africa.  South Africa will sell them much more cheaply that Britain or  Germany, for obvious reasons, are likely to sell those same  goods to us. So, there is that benefit to be derived and we  don't think that money that comes to South Africa is money that  would have come to us, necessarily, no.    [Mashokwe] Fourteen years of Zimbabwe's independence. What  lessons are there for South Africa -- for this new emerging  democracy?    [Mugabe] Quite a number of lessons, and I don't think they  are lessons necessarily for the government or for Mandela. They  are lessons for the community. One, independence does not usher  in an era of manna falling from heaven. Never will there be  gifts the Almighty will shower down on the people of South  Africa. The people of South Africa have got to sweat, to work  hard. Now the environment is there. We must ask for the  opportunity, you see, for them to work. The opportunity for  them to have the necessary skills, the opportunity to be  appointed, given they have those skills, to jobs that they were  denied yesterday, and this is what the outlook must be on the  part of the people -- patience. They will require a great  amount of patience because delivery of benefits is a process, a  function really, of the development of industries.    Then there is the second aspect which has to do with racial  harmony. That has got to continue. If that fails then the  country is ushered into an era of conflict and a country as  large as South Africa, if it develops conflict you know what the  consequences will be and there will then be a spill over into  neighboring countries. One we would hope that doesn't happen.  We are glad that the policy that has been adopted by President  Mandela is one of racial harmony and one, of course, that seeks  now to get rid of the conflict between Inkatha and the ANC, the  conflict between the whites and the blacks, and if only the  people will heed that lesson, then we will have a very peaceful  and stable South Africa, but it will take time.    It has taken a long time for our own whites to adjust to the  new situation. Yesterday they were the leaders, they were,  well, the policy makers, and now that we are the policy makers  some of them find it extremely difficult to adjust.  Economically, they are still bosses in our country, the whites,  and they have not, you know, as it were, reoriented their  thinking. They have not fully adjusted. Some have adjusted but  they are only a small number.    Ian Smith is still talking the same UD language ... UDI  [Unilateral Declaration of Independence] language as in 1965.  He hasn't adjusted, but we didn't have to adjust. We adopted  the policies that we espoused, even during the liberation  struggle. We said to ourselves we are not fighting the white  man because he is white. We are fighting his policies. Once  those policies have gone the white man becomes acceptable, but  he will have to accept the new order, but you have people like  Ian Smith. You have your own Ian Smiths here who will continue  to fight for the old order, even though it's a futile struggle,  but it will continue until [laughs] death takes them, and so  really, we have got to be patient, and I would hope that my  brother President Mandela will be patient with them and not get  annoyed. We have been patient with Ian Smith. He still runs  his farm. We have not confiscated it in any way. We ...  sometimes you feel... [pauses] you feel the man is completely  unrepentant. Why continue to treat him justly, but then sense  and I think, magnanimity bids that, well, that the man is  harmless anyway. Let him have his outpourings and they won't do  anyone any harm.    [Mashokwe] Mr. President, I'm running out of time.    [Mugabe] Yes?    [Mashokwe] The issue of the Frontline States, will it still  be there as the OAU has been accused of not being able to  address its own socioeconomic and political problems. Let's  look at Rwanda for instance?    [Mugabe] Yes, the Frontline States no longer have a front  line, and we do not regret that the front line has gone. I was  joking with former President de Klerk yesterday, when he asked  me whether South Africa was a member of the Frontline. I said  yes, and he said where is the front line? I said if the FL  still exists it's now the fishing line along the coast. And so  that's why we wanted the Frontline to (?leave) and that's where  we now are. So we can go fishing now, but we are looking at how  we can transform the Frontline into an organ that will be a  watchdog one, and come to the assistance of countries or a  country that will have lost control because of some instability  that has been triggered by lawless people.    And we have the example of Lesotho, what's happening in  Lesotho, and really Lesotho requires friends now. Friends who  believe in democracy. Not long ago they had elections there in  order to transform the military experience there, which the  people of Lesotho were forced to embrace for so long a time,  into a new democratic order, and the elections were won by the  BCP [Basotholand Congress Party]. But some people are opposed  to that experience. And we feel that Lesotho is really to be  allowed now some period of rest from military rule, and anyway,  a period it deserves, because everybody in our region is going  democratic. They will possibly be assisted.    And so the Frontline States, as a spearhead of the OAU, and  also of course as an organization of our own region, can be  transformed so it embraces not just the countries that fought  for Zimbabwe, Namibia, and South Africa, but others also in our  region. Possibly the role of SADC [Southern African Development  Community], and has this political agenda, but not an agenda to  interfere in the domestic affairs of a country, an agenda really  to salvage a country, to save it from being torn apart by forces  that are inimical to progress and democracy. And that's the  role we hope those of our experts we asked to look at how the  Frontline States can be transformed, and the new look Frontline  States might be able to do.    But you made mention of the OAU and Rwanda. Well, the OAU is  a much larger organization than the Frontline States, and of  course the larger an organization is then the more complex and  the more problems, and in some cases the more contradictions it  embraces. And it's true that in Rwanda we have a situation that  should have been controlled long ago, but this is not to say  nothing was being done, President Mwinyi was working with our  encouragement on a program to get the leaders to agree to  proceed to elections, and in fact there is already an Arusha  Agreement.    Unfortunately, the incident of an air crash reversed the  process that was underway, but we hope we can once again, if we  send troops, as some of us have committed ourselves to do, and  bring the situation under control, and President Mwinyi can  start the exercise from there. He left it off where the air  crash and the events that followed disrupted it. So it's not  that nothing was being done in Rwanda, it is only that when the  event or the tragedy of the air craft that crashed happened, and  the subsequent developments, the Hutu rising against the Tutsi,  and we were not poised immediately to go into Rwanda and help  solve the situation, that was unfortunate.    [Mashokwe] In conclusion Mr. Mugabe, what do you want to do  when you stop being a politician?    [Mugabe] What do I want to do? I want to teach again. I  want to go teaching. When I retire from politics, obviously, I  want to do a little more reading, more writing especially, and  bring you into another focus of our people, and some of my  experiences in getting them to read and evaluate my experiences.    [Mashokwe] Mr. Mugabe, thanks for your time and for honoring  us with this interview.    [Mugabe] Thank you.     "

Anywhere else in the world it would be the retreat of the rich, a private playground in an unspoilt environment. It's within easy reach from Johannesburg - a 60-minute flight east to Umtata, and then an hour's drive through the green hills of what used to be the Transkei homeland. On the cove's grassy slopes are scattered 42 bungalows. A tennis court and swimming pool are in easy reach, while alongside the jetty on the river which feeds the lagoon, a motorboat stands ready for fishing or bird-spotting expeditions. The hotel is not a retreat for the well-off. Dinner, bed and breakfast costs R125 a night - just over Pounds 20 - but the resort has only a handful of guests.* It is as if Umngazi is still cocooned and isolated from the outside world by the country's apartheid past. In the grim period after the mid-1980s, when Mr PW Botha, prime minister, defied the world and angry black teenagers took to the streets, Umngazi and hundreds of other resorts suffered the consequences. South Africa seemed to have put up the shutters against political reform, and the outside world shunned it: barely 250,000 tourists came to the country in 1988. But with the political transition and the inauguration of a stable government of national unity, Umngazi awaits discovery by visitors to the new South Africa. Many of those travellers who already knew what this spectacular country has to offer are looking back with something akin to guilty nostalgia to a time when a berth in the luxurious Blue Train could be obtained at short notice, or a room at the Mount Nelson hotel in Cape Town with a view of Table Mountain - provided it wasn't the school holidays. Those days are well passed, for a vigorous promotion campaign is getting under way. 'Explore South Africa 95 Year' will be its theme, exploiting events such as the World Rugby Cup, the Comrades Marathon in Natal, the Million Dollar Golf Classic at Sun City and the Grahamstown festival 'The aim is to to achieve R9.5bn in foreign exchange earnings by 1996, based on 1m overseas visitor arrivals and 3.7m arrivals from Africa', says the South African Tourism Board's marketing plan. It may seem an ambitious target, but when the world discovers what South Africa has to offer it will beat a path to beaches, game parks, mountains and lakes served by an excellent transport and communications infrastructure, and offering lodges and hotels that range from budget class to the luxurious. Since the lifting of sanctions, direct air links with Australia and the US have been re-established, existing airlines have increased their services, and more than 20 new airlines are serving South Africa. Tourist sector officials acknowledge that coping with a million holidaymakers a year will strain the country's existing hotel capacity. But the sector is already preparing for a boom that will encourage hotels to upgrade their facilities and, above all, create jobs. And while the 1m target is four times the annual number of holidaymakers who came during the political traumas of the mid-1980s, Satour points to last years' figures as evidence that it is within reach. In 1993, the country earned about R6bn from 618,000 overseas tourists - 10.5 per cent up on 1992 - making the sector the fourth-largest foreign exchange earner after manufactured goods, gold and mining, and employing approximately 430,000 workers. Notwithstanding this increase, the potential has barely been tapped, say Satour officials. South Africa has less than a 1 per cent share of the international market and tourism accounts for only 2 per cent of South Africa's gross national product, compared to the world average of 6.1 per cent. There is scope for growth even in traditional strongholds. The UK is by far South Africa's largest overseas market, accounting for about 23 per cent of visitors - excluding those from Africa - and Germany is the second-largest source. But thanks to the new political environment and the number of new airlines serving Johannesburg, Satour can now exploit lucrative markets hitherto out of reach, such as India and Japan, and Scandinavia. But it is Africa itself that is expected to provide the most dramatic results, from a mere 200,000 arrivals in 1991 to a targeted 3.7m in 1996. Good news for the South African economy, but not happy reading for those who now have to share the country's scenic beauty with millions of newcomers. So don't delay: visit South Africa while the hotels are relatively cheap and underbooked, the beaches are not crowded, tourists are not fleeced, and Umngazi River Bungalows are not taken over by the package tour business. *Umngazi River Bungalows, near Port St Johns (0471) 22370   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Cairo yesterday for a three-day visit during which he will discuss establishing diplomatic links with Mr Amr Moussa, his Egyptian counterpart. These will be the first bilateral talks between the two countries. The South African minister's arrival in Cairo follows his tour last month to Jordan, Oman and Qatar. It underlines Pretoria's determination to increase trade and investment and develop political relations in the region. Egypt, which formally applies the international embargo against South Africa, has very limited ties with the republic. These amount to the exchange of a handful of tourists and a small amount of informal import and export trade. But Egyptian officials said that once an election date and transitional executive council - which will advise the South African government before the planned elections - were named, Cairo would see no great impediment to diplomatic relations. Parties to constitutional talks in South Africa earlier this month said they hoped to fix an election date by early next month. The officials did not expect any progress on South Africa's desire to join the Organisation of African Unity, which will hold its annual summit in Cairo at the end of next month.

0,FT942-11536 ,"FT942-11536 _AN-EEED1ADQFT 940505   FT  05 MAY 94 / Personal View: An example for the rest of Africa      By Lord CALLAGHAN   South Africa's elections were a reminder to those with jaded political palates how much the vote means when it has been denied for so long. Now comes the hard part - the fulfilment of the masses' expectations that the election of a government of their choice will in a very short time transform into reality their demands for decent housing, better schooling and more jobs. Not that their leaders were extravagant in their pre-election promises, although enthusiastic local activists over-egged the pudding. Among the national leaders, there is a sober appreciation of the tremendous tasks that they will face. I doubt whether this has gone home to the electors in the excitement of living through a truly revolutionary era. In truth, although a beginning can and must be made quickly, a levelling up process will take several years. As many as one-quarter of black people are living in miserable lean-to huts and shanty towns with flimsy housing materials, and with a lack of water, proper sanitation and electricity. The ANC believes that extra social expenditure can be financed by the faster rate of economic growth that they expect now sanctions have been lifted - and in fact the economy has already begun to expand. Another favourable factor is that the country's small international debt should permit additional borrowing, and it will have renewed access to IMF drawings and to World Bank loans. There are signs that many of the 200 to 300 overseas companies which ran down their operations as a result of sanctions are considering returning. The economy of South Africa is altogether larger and stronger than any of its neighbours. It manufactures nearly as much as the whole of sub-Saharan Africa put together and exports twice as much as all the rest. By comparison with its neighbours, it is an industrial giant in every respect. But when viewed against the industrialised west, its deficiencies are glaringly apparent. Sanctions had a bigger impact than was admitted. New investment declined seriously during the 1980s and, if it is to increase to the level at which it can sustain a fast rate of growth, the present low levels of domestic savings need to improve and a favourable climate needs to be established to encourage overseas capital to return. Both big parties in the new government favour lower tariffs and less protection with a reduction of subsidies to domestic industry. And both recognise the need to recover South Africa's international position in price and quality, despite the lack of skilled technical, managerial and professional manpower. But the incoming government must strive to formulate economic policies that will give confidence both at home and overseas, while at the same time transform the social landscape, finding work for the near 50 per cent unemployed, and deliver those basic services which the African people expect. Without economic success, the social improvements will not bear fruit. But without social reform, a democratic society would collapse, and the boldest multi-racial venture ever undertaken in Africa could dissolve in disorder or worse. It will be as difficult a task as any government has undertaken. The world cannot turn its back on South Africa at this crucial moment. Additional resources are needed to enable it to transform itself and to assist its re-integration with the rest of the continent. Whilst it is imperative that South Africa's revolution should succeed for the sake of its own people, an additional bonus will be the enormous impact it would have on sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. It is already a magnet for Africans in other African countries. A few of its continental neighbours have recently embarked on far-reaching reforms and show signs of progress. But that is not the general picture. Some are in turmoil: agriculture stagnates; many are unable to break free from the burden of foreign debt; there is corruption and an absence of sound government, indifferent and sometimes no education, grossly high military expenditure, ethnic tension; and so on. The example of a successful South Africa would galvanise other sub-Saharan countries. What energies might be unlocked if South Africa could hold out a vision of a future in which neighbours could integrate their resources and skills as a means of realising the potential of Africa's rich diverse resources and bringing hope to poverty-stricken millions? What better international role for a newly democratic, multi-racial country emerged from decades of isolation than to assist friends and neighbours weaker than itself to rejoin the mainstream of the international community? South Africa's revolution must not fail. The author was British prime minister from 1976 to 1979   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

With other European aid agencies, Christian Aid has launched a campaign for the abolition of these subsidies. Since 1984, EC beef exports to West Africa have increased seven-fold, subsidised to the tune of Pounds 280m by European tax-payers. Local beef prices have collapsed. The low-quality, subsidised EC beef sells at half the price of locally produced meat. Sahelian farmers are finding that no-one is prepared to buy their herds. EC beef dumping is not only threatening the survival of Sahelian communities, it also undermines aid from the EC itself to support livestock production in the Sahel. Hundreds of millions of Ecus from the European Development Fund have been spent on building refrigerated abattoirs in Burkina Faso, on improving cattle breeds in Mali, Gambia and Senegal, and on promoting disease control in the Ivory Coast and Ghana. An EC council of ministers meeting is expected to discuss the issue at the end of the month. Christian Aid argues that to stop the export of subsidised beef to West Africa would not seriously damage farmers in Europe. Less than 0.5 per cent of total EC beef production of 8.7m tonnes in 1991 was exported to the region.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).     EHZ  Western Sahara, Africa.

Laut, a shot putter, was at Pilditch Stadium on the outskirts of Pretoria,  South Africa, on that October day in 1988, part of a contingent of 14 track and  field athletes from the United States who had chosen to ignore an international  ban on competition in South Africa. They were risking their eligibility by  competing in a country where apartheid in sanctioned by law.    Laut admitted he had mixed emotions as he stepped into the shot-put ring at  Pilditch, with 16 pounds of metal tucked between shoulder and chin.    ""I mean here I was, about to throw the shot in South Africa, and I'm thinking,  'Are you sure you want to do this?' "" recalled Laut, who swallowed his emotions  long enough to launch a 66-foot put -- the longest ever on South African soil.  ""I really had the adrenaline going on that one.""    The Athletics Congress, the governing body for track and field in the United  States, recognized Laut's record by handing him a four-year ban from  competition. However Laut, an Olympian in 1984, is far from repentant --  recently he returned from his third trip to South Africa, a decision he fully  expects will earn him yet another ban, this time for life.    ""I'm guessing, but they'll probably give us a lifetime (ban) now because we  went back,"" said Laut of the five-meet tour in which he and 13 teammates  participated in November. ""I'm waiting to get the letter any day.""    Nine of the U. S. athletes who participated in the original October, 1988, tour  received TAC suspensions ranging from two to 12 years.    Laut, 33, said there is no simple reason for his decision to risk punishment by  competing in South Africa, although money was an important factor.    A standout shot putter at Santa Clara High, Moorpark College, San Jose City  College and UCLA, Laut earned a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympics. The  following year he won the TAC outdoor championships and, buoyed by those  performances, drew a bead on the 1988 Olympics.    Looking for a job that would provide him with both the cash and the time to  train, Laut tried out in the summer of 1986 for a position with the Oxnard Fire  Department. While running with a fire hose, he felt a sharp pain in both knees.  Ruptured tendons sent him sprawling to the pavement.    The following year, which Laut should have spent in training for the Olympics,  was consumed instead with rehabilitation. His few performances were poor and he  lost both his momentum and valuable financial support from Nike.    When he took a part-time time as a realtor, his training suffered. At the 1988  Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, Laut, who needed to finish in the top three to  win a spot on the team, placed fifth.    When Skip Robinson, the track coach at Pasadena City College, approached Laut  at the trials and proposed a possible tour of South Africa, Laut was  apprehensive. Robinson was straightforward -- he told Laut this would be the  first such tour since 1962 and the first since the International Amateur  Athletic Federation banned South Africa from international track and field  competition in 1976.    Any athlete who went likely would face repercussions. Laut, however, was ready  to take a chance.    ""It sounded like a pretty serious commitment, but I'd lost my contract (with  Nike) and things were looking pretty bad, so I thought, 'Well, why not take a  chance and see?' "" said Laut.    According to published reports, the U.S. athletes were paid a minimum of  $10,000 per meet during the 1988 tour and, with performance bonuses, could earn  much more. Miler Jim Spivey claimed he was offered $200,000 to compete in the  meets.    Spivey declined the offer.    Though Laut refused to discuss specifics, he said he was paid somewhere between  $10,000 and $30,000. Whatever the sum, said Laut, money was the only way to get  athletes to take the risk.    ""You're not going to ask an athlete to risk his eligibility and his whole  sports career without paying them for it,"" Laut said.    Though money spurred Laut to take his first trip to South Africa in the fall of  1988, subsequent trips in April and November were taken for other reasons.    ""South Africa is the only place in the world I can compete now,"" Laut said.    ""I think that everyone who's gone over there has a goal and we're committed to  seeing it through,"" added Laut, whose tour teammates have included Olympians  John Powell, Ruth Wysocki, Tom Petranoff and Gregg Tafralis. ""Hopefully through  our efforts and what we're doing we'll maybe make a dent on this ban on sports  over there.""    Not everyone agrees. When plans for the first tour were announced, many decried  the idea, saying it would lend legitimacy to a political system that allows  South Africa's 27 million blacks no vote and little voice. Critics say the  tours have fostered no change, and many accuse the athletes who participated of  ignoring moral concerns for financial benefit.    ""The people that went there, they know its wrong,"" said George Mehale, a South  African who coaches track and field at Cal State Long Beach. ""Nothing changed  because they went.""    ""If anything, people are telling me informally that in a way they hurt the  cause -- not major injury, but they certainly did set things back,"" said TAC  President Frank Greenberg, one of several TAC officials who voted to ban the  athletes who participated in the 1988 tour. ""I think it's counterproductive  when individuals go. Global reaction against South Africa is getting stronger,  that pressure has already produced some changes.""    Supporters of sanctions against South Africa say the sanctions contributed to  President Frederik De Klerk's recent decisions to release political prisoners  such as Walter Sisulu and Nelson Mandela.    De Klerk also lifted a decades-old ban on the African National Congress and  more than a dozen other groups dedicated to the abolition of apartheid; eased  government censorship of the media; and asked his justice department to reserve  capital penalties for the most severe crimes.    But De Klerk, whose Nationalist Party has ruled South Africa since 1948 and is  thus responsible for instituting the most repulsive separatist laws, left most  of the pillars of apartheid intact. The pass laws, which require blacks to  carry legal documents when traveling outside their townships, are still  enforced and the nation's black citizens are still not entitled to participate  in the government or in national elections.    Laut prefers to steer clear of debate. Others, however, vehemently defend the  tours.    ""We spent time doing clinics, promoting goodwill and helping people of all  colors,"" said tour organizer and coach Dick Tomlinson. ""Ours is a purely  humanitarian effort. We're trying to bring understanding and turn the lights on  the South African situation so people will realize that there are millions of  black South Africans who are being deprived of international sport.""    Laut said he has seen few signs of segregation during his trips to South  Africa. Critics argue that Laut and his fellow athletes were sheltered from  apartheid's worst. Although they were free to travel as they wished --  including visits to the volatile black townships of Soweto and Crossroads --  one team member admitted there was ""a strong possibility"" she and her fellow  athletes were sheltered during their visit.    ""We did go different places, but they had an itinerary set up with where they  were going to take us and what we were going to do,"" said Pamela Page, a  hurdler who participated in the most recent tour. Page, who is black, also said  that despite outward appearances of normalcy, something was amiss.    ""People were nice and they kept saying, 'We're trying to change, we're trying  to change,' but it was still strange,"" Page said. ""I'd be shopping and they  (white South Africans) would just kind of stop and look at me like, 'Wait a  minute.' It kind of caught them off guard.""    But while Laut admits he knows little about South Africa's politics, he does  know something of sport and he sees in South Africa a potential track  powerhouse.    ""There's just an unbelievable amount of talent over there, it's just amazing,""  Laut said. ""If they could become a part of the world, they would be a major  power in track and field in 10 years. That's my sincere belief.""    During the November tour, Laut and the rest of the U. S. contingent met briefly  with De Klerk. According to Laut, the president lent his support to the tour  and expressed hope that the South African athletes would soon be able to  compete internationally.    ""They've got a lot of national pride and I think they would really like to see  their country get back into international competition,"" Laut said.    Laut also expresses admiration for the South African athletes who continue to  train and compete in the face of an international ban that keeps them at home,  leaving them to compete against the same faces in the same places.    ""When I was in high school and college I always had that Olympic medal as my  dream. That was my focus, the driving force that kept me going . . . ,"" Laut  said. ""The South African athlete doesn't have that dream, but he keeps working  as hard as we do, maybe harder. To me that determination is amazing.""    For Laut, training and competition have also taken on a slightly different  slant from his college days. He has pared his training substantially --  slipping away from work in the afternoon to put the shot at Hueneme High or  lift weights in the garage of his home.    ""If I'm lucky, I can get in two hours of training a day,"" Laut said. ""It's not  what I need, but I know what to do now and I can eliminate a lot of the  nonsense stuff that I used to do. I just do the exercises that will help me  throw the shot, which is basically the whole name of the game.""    Laut will return to South Africa, possibly as early as April for the South  African national championships. According to Laut, a full team will probably  return to South Africa again this fall and there is talk of a contract with  sponsors and the South African Athletic Union that would guarantee such visits  for the next three to five years.    Laut's ultimate goal, however, is to compete in South Africa as a member of an  official U. S. team.    ""I'd like to be able to represent the United States, have USA colors, raise the  flag and compete for the United States,"" Laut said.

0,FT933-11265 ,"FT933-11265 _AN-DG3CDAC0FT 930730   FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (12): A weakness for discipline - Traditionalism still rules in most schools      By SIMON LONDON   TOKYO'S most prestigious fee-paying boys school owes nothing to the tradition of Eton or Harrow. Housed in undistinguished concrete in the urban Hiroo district of the city, Azabu Gakuen looks like a product of the 1960s heyday of comprehensive education in the UK. That resemblance runs more than skin deep: the relaxed attitude of the teachers, casual dress and unruly classrooms are evidence of a liberal attitude never embraced by the bastions of the British public school tradition. But Azabu is far from representative of Japanese schools. It can afford to go against the grain because it gets results. It sends a higher proportion of pupils to prestigious universities, notably Tokyo University, than almost any other school. In the eyes of status-conscious Japanese parents, that is the sole barometer of success. Although fee-paying, entrance to Azabu is by competitive examination only. In that respect it is very much a product of the Japanese system. It prospers by its ability to get pupils through the university entrance examinations, and sets its own entrance examinations to cream off the best pupils. To stand a fighting chance of getting to Azabu, and thence to Tokyo University, most pupils will have already passed entrance examinations to win a place at a good preparatory school. For many the process of testing will have started at the age of three. 'We can afford to be liberal because our pupils are all keen to learn and want to succeed,' said Mr Takao Negishi, Azabu's headmaster. Faced with intense competition at every stage - and pupils generally less blessed with diligence or intellect than Azabu - mainstream Japanese schools favour a disciplinarian approach. At Takamatsu Junior High, a model state school in suburban Tokyo, a strict code of uniform, punctuality and good behaviour prevails. That might be enough to make traditionalists in many European countries weep with nostalgia. The role of testing, the existence of a national curriculum and a thriving private sector would equally win plaudits among conservative educationalists in the UK. Conversely, though, the approach is now being questioned in Japan. For example, while in principle the national curriculum has almost universal support among Japanese teachers, the design of the current curriculum is seen to place too much emphasis on the accumulation of facts while neglecting creative thought. There is some sympathy with this view within the Ministry of Education. Its interest does not stem from liberal sentiment: the over-riding question for government is whether Japanese schools are producing the workforce required by the service and high-technology industries of the future. Even though Japan spends less on education as a percentage of gross domestic product than its industrial rivals - classes of 40 pupils per teacher are the norm - it achieves higher rates of literacy and numeracy. The worry is that such basic skills no longer suffice. Yet while the main function of schooling is - in the eyes of many parents - to propel children up the educational pyramid with Tokyo University at its apex, piecemeal reform of the curriculum is unlikely to transform the system. Schools like Azabu are free to tailor tuition to fit the requirements of university entrance examinations. For example, ninth grade pupils at Azabu spend six hours per week on mathematics. AT TAKAMATSU pupils of the same grade receive only four hours tuition - as demanded by the national curriculum. If the state sector strays too far from the three-R's, the gulf between public and private schools will only widen. The emphasis on examinations has also created an industry of 'juku' or cramming schools, which children are expected to attend outside normal hours for extra tuition in core academic subjects. Like Azabu, the better juku do not come cheap. That raises the question whether a traditionally egalitarian education system - what could be more egalitarian than a system based squarely on entrance examinations? - is now failing the poor. The growth of private schools is also adding to the problem of falling rolls as Japan passes through demographic changes more pronounced than in the UK. Takamatsu's newly refurbished buildings now house 469 pupils, against more than 1,500 in the mid-1980s. The encroachment of private schools means still fewer pupils, and can cause problems in the classroom. 'The best pupils in this area are more likely to attend private schools. The natural leaders are taken out of our classes. 'There is no problem with discipline, but motivating the remaining pupils to learn has become more difficult,' said Mr Makoto Kawashima, headmaster at Takamatsu. The Ministry of Education sees two options to close the gap between public and private education: either deregulate the state sector, allowing public schools to imitate fee-paying schools, or regulate the private sector by imposing the national curriculum strictly across the board. Neither option is particularly attractive. The first would only reinforce the reputation of Japanese schools as rigorous crammers and increase examination pressures. The second would require heavy-handed intervention in a private school system which has widespread support among parents. Ultimately, though, change may have to filter down through the system from the top before the style of Japanese education changes. 'Higher education in Japan has historically emphasised imitation rather than innovation. Since the end of the last century that has been seen as the way for Japan to compete successfully with the West,' commented Mr Michio Nagai, an educationalist and former Minister of Education. 'For these historical reasons, Japan has not developed a tradition of basic academic research.' Admission to even the best universities is regarded by students as a comfortable interlude between the pressure of school and the horrors of life as a 'salary-man'. University entrance exams are thus tests of accumulated knowledge rather than measures of academic potential. Only if universities value creativity and spontaneity are parents likely to put pressure on schools to do the same. If an education system is a mirror of the society it serves, there can be no more eloquent commentary on the growing pains of Japan itself.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The Office for Standards in Education, the schools watchdog, said the qualifications - dubbed 'vocational A-levels' by the government - needed a more manageable assessment of standards, better course design and tougher external checks. It said that the rate of improvement since Ofsted last reported on the qualifications during their pilot 12 months ago was 'far too slow'. Advanced GNVQs completed their pilot earlier this year, and were attempted by only 3,800 students. Mr Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, said: 'We are concerned that if urgent action is not taken then the credibility of the qualifications will be undermined. That would be a tragedy, given the possibilities which now lie before us.' He pointed to problems in the way the National Council for Vocational Qualifications, the quango which administers the new qualifications, assessed standards. He said that external assessors did not check that different institutions used the same gradings when setting assessment, and the curriculum had not been defined with sufficient clarity. The national council stresses that it measures competencies, using the driving test as an analogy. Mr Woodhead rejected the comparison, pointing out that employers wanted some idea of how well students had performed, rather than whether they had managed to pass. The inspectors said the coursework produced for advanced GNVQs - taken in the sixth form - was equivalent in its standard to two academic A-levels, in line with government intentions. However, 25 per cent of work for intermediate GNVQs did not come up to the intended standard of four GCSEs. The Further Education Funding Council for England published a report on GNVQs in colleges, which have a stronger tradition of training and vocational education than schools. It found that the strengths of GNVQs outweighed their weaknesses but identified 'teething problems'. These included variable assessment practices and too little attention to the 'core skills' of literacy and numeracy. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, said the reports 'powerfully reinforced' the list of demands for improvement which he gave the national council earlier this year. He said that reforms were now needed 'with still greater urgency'. Mr John Hillier, chief executive of the national council, acknowledged 'inevitable teething problems' with the qualification. He said the council was 'working very hard to accelerate the development of our quality system'. GNVQs in Schools 1993-94. Ofsted. HMSO. Pounds 3.95.

Political observers deem the visits as ""very important"" and  in line with bilateral interests for further strengthening of  political, economic and cultural ties as well as regional and  international cooperation.    In the pre-revolution era, Africa was ignored by the shah's  regime which had ties with only certain African countries such  as the racist South African regime. However, the following the  triumph of the Islamic revolution in 1079, Iran severed its  relations with the racist South African regime upon the orders  of the father of the Islamic revolution the late Imam Khomeini,  and expanded its ties with sub-Saharan African countries.    Islamic Republic of Iran now has established ties with 20  African countries at the ambassadorial level and ""very sincere""  relations with many others, but is yet to develop healthy  economic ties with them.    The six African countries which Velayati is to visit are  rich  in gold, diamonds, silver, bauxite, zinc, iron, copper, tin and  cobalt as well as in such agricultural products as coffee,  cocoa, tea, rice, cotton, sugar cane and pineapple.    Iran can have favourable cooperation with the said countries  and can invest in their mineral and agricultural sectors in  favour of common interests.    However, Iran has no direct aerial and marine transportation  links with the said countries to promote economic cooperation.    Contrary to Iran, the European Community, U.S., Japan and  even the Zionist regime have embarked on economic investments in  sub-Saharan Africa unilaterally to plunder the rich natural  resources of the deprived continent.

0,FT923-6037 ,"FT923-6037 _AN-CH1BVABLFT 920827   FT  27 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Neighbours build up links with Pretoria - Philip Gawith on a struggling region which has found a new level of co-operation      By PHILIP GAWITH   ECONOMIC need has concentrated political minds in southern Africa where seven countries are co-operating in the handling of 8.2m tonnes of maize imported into the region, which has been devastated by one of the worst droughts this century. At the heart of the scheme is Spoornet, the state-run South African rail company, enjoying a level of regional co-operation which would have been unthinkable during the apartheid years. Although co-operation over the shipments was prompted by fears in some areas of possible starvation, it is also a sign of it being more acceptable for South Africa's neighbours - Lesotho, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia and Malawi - to be seen doing business with it now that a transition to democracy is under way. This raises the question of what steps South Africa should take to integrate itself formally into the region and what sort of economic assistance the international community can offer. At the heart of these issues lies one broad plank of consensus: the southern African region will prosper or perish as a unit. Although differences in wealth and resources between countries mean that there will not be an even rate of progress or failure, it is inconceivable that South Africa will flourish in splendid isolation or that its neighbours will progress without it. South Africa is well aware, in the phrase of Dr Anton Rupert, the famous tobacco entrepreneur: 'If your neighbour doesn't eat, you don't sleep peacefully.' Already there are 27,000 Mozambican refugees living in the eastern Transvaal, victims of drought and civil war. Refugees are also filtering into the northern Transvaal from Zimbabwe. Not only does this sort of inflow strain limited resources, but the economic fragility of South Africa's neighbours also limits what ought to be important markets. According to a study by the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI)*, Africa accounts for only 7 per cent of South Africa's exports, with a quarter of this going to Zimbabwe. Aside from trade and humanitarian concerns, regional politicians are also aware that, in an era of capital scarcity, they have a lot of work to do if they are to garner even a fraction of international capital flows, very little of which currently come to Africa. The main obstacles to foreign investment in the region are problems of political instability, economic decay and a dilapidated infrastructure. However, the recent talks between Mozambican President Joachim Chissano and rebel Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama, the upcoming elections in Angola, and South Africa's transition process all represent important progress, albeit of a very fragile kind. Peace, however, is only the first step. The extent to which governments will subsequently be able to forge a framework of economic co-operation remains to be seen. The potential for regional integration is also complicated by South Africa's dominant position whereby its gross national product (GNP) exceeds the combined GNP of the 20 member countries of the two regional trade groupings  -the Preferential Trade Area (PTA) and the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the new version of SADCC - by about 40 per cent. Conventional wisdom suggests that greater economic convergence is necessary for successful integration. In their more sanguine moments, South Africa's neighbours look on it as a market for their goods, and a source of funds for projects which other international investors or governments won't fund. Underlying that, however, is an anxiety that the normalisation of South Africa's political situation may be to their disadvantage. Thus the ODI special report, which investigates the possibility of granting financial and trade privileges to South Africa, found that the most common reaction outside South Africa when the possibility of EC preferences was raised was 'incredulity'. The report finds, however, that the gains from preferential trade regimes with the EC would be small because the bulk of South Africa's exports are metals and minerals which face low barriers. The authors conclude, therefore, that since South Africa's principal economic problems are domestic, not external, foreign assistance would probably best be directed elsewhere. This thinking is likely to be consonant with the priorities of any future government, which will face overwhelming pressure to improve domestic social conditions. Trade concessions will be welcome, and regional integration may provide a warm feeling of returning to the fold, but these issues will not top any list of economic priorities. *Trading with South Africa: the policy options for the EC.

0,FT933-5765 ,"FT933-5765 _AN-DIAB3AGFFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (7): Still caught in the vice - Foreign debt      By MICHAEL HOLMAN and EDWARD BALLS   OF ALL the problems in Africa's post-independence legacy that now have to be resolved, few are more burdensome and debilitating than external debt. In 1962, the outstanding debts of all sub-Saharan African countries were less than Dollars 3bn, with a debt service ratio of less than 2 per cent, says Dr Percy Mistry, a former World Bank economist who has written extensively about African debt. By 1990 debt exceeded Dollars 146bn, equivalent to 110 per cent of GDP; service payments would take up three times its annual export earnings. Dr Mistry traces the build-up over three phases. The rush to borrow, which began with the commodities boom that followed the first oil price increase in 1973, came to a sudden end in the wake of the second oil shock. Between 1978 and 1982, high interest rates and deteriorating terms of trade for Africa meant that sub-Saharan debt soared to Dollars 72bn with a further Dollars 8bn in arrears. The third phase continues: the struggle to manage an ever-increasing debt well beyond Africa's capacity to service, let alone repay. 'Although it seems almost incredible in retrospect,' writes Dr Mistry, 'international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank used little of their influence to curb extravagant and unsustainable programmes of public expenditure financed by external borrowing.' Some of the white elephants from this era are carcasses, others are still on their feet. Grand conference centres, airports, steel mills and hotels dot the African landscape. With better management, some might have been viable; most should not have got beyond the drawing board. The most prominent survivor is Nigeria's Ajaokuta steel mill, conceived in the 1970s. Even with the project cost written off, it will be a net loser of foreign exchange when operating. Yet successive Nigerian governments have refused to write-off a Dollars 5bn project that will be a liability for its lifetime. The institutions remain reluctant to intervene. Nigeria today seeks further rescheduling of its Dollars 34bn debt. But neither the Bank nor the Fund has so far been prepared to add the scrapping of Ajaokuta to the list of conditions for debt relief. The burden extends beyond the Ajaokutas of Africa. The time and energy of finance ministers and senior officials is spent in seemingly endless rounds of external-debt negotiations. Debt initiatives over recent years have had a limited impact. Between 1989 and 1991 some Dollars 10bn of concessional debt was written off, with most donor countries converting concessional bilateral loans to grants, while official creditors have applied enhanced Toronto terms to a dozen low-income countries. The more generous Trinidad terms (which would write off up to two thirds of official debt) have rarely been applied. But the World Bank says a permanent, and workable, solution must go further: 'The enhanced Toronto terms and the Trinidad terms are not enough to ensure that African countries can service external debts in the medium and long term as scheduled. A more radical approach is needed.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Africa: Facing the competition                                        Sub-Saharan Africa     East Asia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Population growth rate 1980-91                    3.1            1.6 GDP growth rate % pa 1980-91                    2.1            7.7 GNP per capita 1991 USDollars                     350            650 GNP per capita growth rate % pa 1980-91        -1.2            6.1 Inflation 1980-91                           18.4% pa          8.3% Investment (% of GDP 1991)                         16             35 Savings (% of GDP 1991)                            14             36 Exports of goods and services (% of GDP 1991)      28             30 Government consumption (% of GDP 1991)             15             10 Share of  Global exports 1991                              1.1            7.5  Global imports                                   1.0            7.6 Annual growth  Rate of exports  1980-91                                          2.7           10.2  Imports                                         -4.0            8.4 Terms of trade: Change 1985-91                 -18.7%          12.5% External debt % of GNP 1991                     107.9           28.2 Debt-Svc ratio 1980                              10.9           13.5                1991                              20.8           13.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- % Enrolment primary education  Primary  1970                                              46             88  1990                                              68            127  Secondary  1970                                               6             24  1990                                              17             49  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: World Bank  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

The campaign's first phase begins with local Pentecost worship services and  vigils focusing on South Africa and culminates June 17 with a rally at the  Washington Monument.    The campaign grew out of a meeting here in October of eminent U.S. church  leaders -- calling themselves the ""South Africa Crisis Coordinating Committee""  -- who responded to calls for support from South African churches concerned  about increasing incidents of violence against the churches.    In August, the headquarters of the South African Council of Churches in  Johannesburg, Khotso House, was bombed. And just 6 weeks later, an arson fire  gutted two floors at Khanya House, the Pretoria offices of the Southern African  Catholic Bishops' Conference.    Diana Scott, who is coordinating activities for the United Church of Christ's  Board for World Ministries here, said that a number of UCC events related to  the campaign have already been held, including workshops on apartheid and the  circulating of petitions.    She reported that 7,000 information packets were mailed to UCC anti-apartheid  activists across the country to bring the campaign to the grass-roots level.

The campaign's first phase begins with local Pentecost worship services and  vigils focusing on South Africa and culminates June 17 with a rally at the  Washington Monument.    The campaign grew out of a meeting here in October of eminent U.S. church  leaders -- calling themselves the ""South Africa Crisis Coordinating Committee""  -- who responded to calls for support from South African churches concerned  about increasing incidents of violence against the churches.    In August, the headquarters of the South African Council of Churches in  Johannesburg, Khotso House, was bombed. And just 6 weeks later, an arson fire  gutted two floors at Khanya House, the Pretoria offices of the Southern African  Catholic Bishops' Conference.    Diana Scott, who is coordinating activities for the United Church of Christ's  Board for World Ministries here, said that a number of UCC events related to  the campaign have already been held, including workshops on apartheid and the  circulating of petitions.    She reported that 7,000 information packets were mailed to UCC anti-apartheid  activists across the country to bring the campaign to the grass-roots level.

The  meeting starts on Thursday [2 June].    On Friday, Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe will host what  is expected to be the final meeting of the Frontline states, the  regional alliance of southern African nations which opposed  apartheid. Officials said leaders of the seven-nation grouping  would discuss a new organisation to replace it.    Already in Harare is Benin leader Nicephore Soglo who hosted  the previous GCA meeting in June last year. Due to arrive on  Wednesday are the heads of state of Angola, Namibia, Mozambique,  Tanzania, Zambia, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mali, Eritrea, Ivory Coast  and Botswana, and former World Bank head Robert MacNamara and  former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere.    Founded with World Bank finance and based in Washington, the  GCA was established as an alliance of African nations and  Western donor nations with close ties to the continent. It was  part of a bid to counter a shift of Western financial support  from Africa after the fall of the Communist bloc. Backers  describe it as dedicated to ""keeping alive the good news in  Africa"".    Frontline heads of state are expected to support moves to  keep the body alive in spite of the transition to democracy in  South Africa. However, the group is expected to change its  ""confrontational"" name and adopt a new direction, working for  peace and political stability in the region and to provide a  forum for conflict mediation.

An editorial by the newspaper GRANMA, official organ of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba, salutes the  electoral triumph of the African National Congress (ANC) in the  South African elections which, with its victory, has crowned the  process sealed in the fierce fighting of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola.    GRANMA says that, the historic battle and defeat suffered by  the racist army in the face of the resistance of the Angolans  and Cuban international fighters changed the correlation of  forces in South Africa and led to the current triumph of the  South African people.    Regarding the struggle and merits of ANC leader Nelson  Mandela, the paper states that when he assumes his nation's  presidency, the world will have occasion to render tribute to  his wisdom, courageous revolutionary stance, and unwavering  principles.    It can be seen in all its dimensions that the triumph  corresponds to those who struggle and the example offered must  be again appreciated. The value of this example is heightened  at this shameful moment when so many have lowered their flags  and have repented for what they once were, it states.    The newspaper criticizes the regime of racial discrimination  that existed in South Africa, noting that capitalism and  imperialism were responsible for instilling in that state the  notion of superior and inferior races.    We are proud to have been and to continue to be close  companions of arms of Nelson Mandela and of the South African  people, the GRANMA editorial concludes.     "

HILTZIK, Times Staff Writer      ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar      Pope John Paul II, starting his fifth trip to Africa as Pope, raised the  possibility Friday of a formal visit to South Africa sometime in the next year.    The issue of a papal visit to South African came up at a press conference on  the Pope's flight from Rome to Madagascar, an island nation of more than 2  million Roman Catholics, the first of four stops in nine days.    Among the stops is Lusaka, Zambia, headquarters of the anti-apartheid African  National Congress, where the pontiff is expected to make a powerful  denunciation of apartheid. The racial separation policy in South Africa is an  important obstacle to a papal visit, he indicated.    ""Speaking sociopolitically,"" the Pope said, ""we all know very well what the  moral problems are in this sphere in South Africa.""      Not Directed at Leaders    But he added that papal visits are directed at Catholics, not necessarily their  leaders, and he suggested that he would make the evil of apartheid the theme of  any visit to South Africa.    ""The Pope must be respected in his role as someone who tells the truth,"" he  said.    Vatican officials said later that John Paul expects to make two further trips  to Africa in the next year, and a stop in South Africa could be included.    In his remarks en route to Madagascar, the pontiff also made one of his  strongest statements yet on another subject he is likely to take up during this  trip -- AIDS. He said that AIDS, which in the West generally strikes  homosexuals and intravenous drug users but in Africa is largely a problem for  heterosexuals, is something that reflects the decline in the moral order of the  times.    ""It is not a case of personal blame in each instance,"" he said, ""but many times  it is.""      AIDS Affects Up to 20%    AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is estimated to affect up to 20%  of the people of Zambia and Malawi, his two final stops on this trip. Among the  more prominent victims is the son of Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda.    The Pope also said he might meet with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  when Gorbachev travels to Italy in November. Such a meeting would be the first  between the Pope and a Soviet leader.    Meanwhile, the pontiff's arrival in Madagascar placed him squarely in the  middle of a developing political maelstrom. He landed amid a ""papal truce""  called by opposition parties whose contention that last month's presidential  election here was rigged has led to riots that left six dead and 74 injured  last week in downtown Antananarivo.    The election, which was overseen by a committee of churches, including the  Catholic Church, gave President Didier Ratsiraka his third seven-year term with  62.7% of the vote, his smallest margin ever.      Foes Charged Fraud    The opposition complained of widespread fraud and of an electoral code that  allowed Ratsiraka to schedule the vote during the rainy season, when only he  could reach remote rural districts to campaign.    At one point the government hinted that unless the opposition halted public  demonstrations, it might be forced to cancel the Pope's visit.    The opposition, led by Manandafy Rakotonarina, a key figure in the 1972  revolution that drove out the colonial French, promptly declared a treve, or  truce.    ""No politician wanted to take responsibility for the cancellation of the  visit,"" a diplomat in the capital said.    On greeting John Paul at Antananarivo's Ivato airport Friday evening, the  Jesuit-educated Ratsiraka laced into the opposition, charging them with  fomenting ""anarchy and political bad faith.""    The Pope listened impassively from his seat in the airport's VIP lounge. In his  response, he made no allusion to Madagascar politics.    Madagascar's Catholics, about 20% of the population, are slightly outnumbered  by Protestants and overwhelmed by the 55% who profess belief in animism and a  mystical brand of ancestor worship.    Elaborate tombs adorn the countryside, and the streets are often blocked by  processions of carts carrying coffins. These are not exactly funerals, but  rites in which the bodies of the dead are exhumed at regular intervals,  reclothed, and led around the neighborhood to reacquaint the dead with the  living. The Malagasy people often make decisions based on what they gather to  be their ancestors' wishes.    The Catholic Church here long ago came to terms with these beliefs. One  prominent Malagasy noted that priests, far from objecting to such rites, ""often  themselves preside at the ceremonies. They coexist very comfortably.""    In contrast, Catholics have often had an unhappy relationship with the  country's rulers and nationalists. Four priests were killed last year by what  are thought to be political groups. Three were killed the year before, among  them an Italian priest who was beheaded by a nationalist youth group that was  later disbanded.    The killings were discomfiting echoes of trying times in the past. These  included a period in the 19th Century when a Malagasy queen had Catholics flung  off the cliff behind her palace, the peaked black roof of which rises over the  site of several events scheduled in connection with the papal visit.    Still, Ratsiraka is trying harder to appeal to Catholic leaders, as he is to  other Western powers. Press censorship has been lifted for the most part, and  opposition candidates were permitted to wage unusually energetic presidential  campaigns last month.    Furthermore, the president appears to be trying to reverse more than a decade  of economic decline here by shifting his economic policies from a brand of  socialism to Western-style free enterprise.      THE POPE IN AFRICA    1 -- Pope John Paul II arrived in Madagascar on Friday, the first stop in a  9-day African tour.    2 -- May 1-2.

0,FT911-2053 ,"FT911-2053 _AN-BEBBRAATFT 910502   FT  02 MAY 91 / High ideals and small deeds of Cold War victors order: Peter Norman surveys the beginnings - and the potential pitfalls - of a new world economic      By PETER NORMAN   AFTER the end of the Cold War and the Gulf war, the world's leading industrial powers are groping towards a new co-operative, international economic order. But they still have to muster the political will and financial wherewithal to make their ideals more than aspirations. That at any rate is the impression left by the meetings in Washington this week of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries and the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. US pressure on Germany to cut its interest rates dominated the headlines for much of the meetings. This was a pity. The row overshadowed the ferment of ideas now unleashed - not least in the US Treasury - on how to ensure that all parts of the world can benefit from the Cold War victors: market economy, pluralism and democracy. On the other hand, the interest rate spat exposed the painful gap among western policy makers in general - and in the US in particular - between sometimes impressive analysis of the problems of the Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Africa and Latin America - and feeble and frequently self-serving policy prescriptions. Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary, and Mr David Mulford, his undersecretary for international financial affairs, did the world a service in drawing attention to the shortage of global savings at a time when demands for capital are likely to rise. Economic restructuring in eastern Europe, reconstruction in the Gulf region and the gradual economic rehabilitation of Latin America's debtors threaten to add to problems caused by a sharp decline in Arab oil surpluses and Germany's move into current account deficit. But just as the US analysis had some merit, its prescription was at best nave and at worst mischievous. US Treasury officials were never able to explain how lower interest rates in Germany and elsewhere could encourage savings. Experience tells that forced cuts in official interest rates often result in higher long-term rates as bond market investors fear new inflationary pressures. The US stand on interest rates can be excused by the approach of the 1992 presidential election. But in other respects, a big gap was apparent between Washington's hopes for a new post-Cold War economic order and its ability to support this goal with deeds. The rhetoric was captured in Mr Brady's remarks to the IMF Interim Committee. 'The success of Desert Storm has shown what can happen when the international community focuses its energies of a singular objective,' he said. 'Now is the time to extend this spirit of international co-operation to meet the major challenges we face on the economic front.' The reality of what is now dubbed 'responsibility sharing' was somewhat different. When the US was asked recently to contribute to a Dollars 1bn loan for Czechoslovakia from the group of 24 industrialised countries, it offered just Dollars 15m. The US has also made sure that its allies finance help for Poland. It dragooned the Paris Club of western creditor governments into forgiving 50 per cent of Poland's official debt while being one of Poland's smaller official creditors. It is now attempting to arrange a similar deal for Egypt and ring-fence the principle of large scale debt forgiveness to exclude other hard-pressed middle-income countries from similar agreements. The official explanation for such inconsistency is that Poland and Egypt are special cases because of their high levels of government-held debt. But the differentiated policy approach can also be explained in terms of domestic US politics and foreign policy priorities. Because of the Polish diaspora, there are many millions of US voters with Polish surnames or ancestors and relatively few US citizens of Czech origin. In Egypt's case, 'Realpolitik' dictates generous treatment of one of Washington's more dependable friends in a very volatile region. The inconsistencies of US policy are also a sign that Washington no longer has the financial muscle to be an economic superpower. The military successes of the US-led coalition in the Gulf conflict have not given the US the capacity to bend its trading partners to its will. For this reason, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, was determined when in the US to gain US recognition for Germany's large DM25bn (Pounds 8.4bn) contribution to economic reform in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Germany fears that without some careful coaching, the US will focus responsibility sharing on the problems of the Middle East at the risk of neglecting the Soviet Union which Bonn considers has huge crisis potential. By focusing on disagreements, one could easily ignore that there is a remarkable consensus over the principles by which the world economy should be be managed. Pluralism, democracy and the market economy are now economic mantras in the developing world as well as in the industrialised countries and the former communist states of eastern Europe. The experience of the Gulf war has persuaded the US and other industrialised countries that democratic regimes deserve to be given financial help and that financial leverage should be used to curb further arms races in the developing world. Symbolic of a huge shift in attitudes was an aside by Mr Norman Lamont in his speech to the Developmemt Committee on Tuesday. Britain's conservative chancellor cited with approval the speech by the finance minister of Guinea  -a state that until the mid-1980s was trying to create its own breed of socialism in Africa.

0,FT942-915 ,"FT942-915 _AN-EF0DGADRFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: South Africa   Two months after its first all-race elections, South Africa is reaping the reward in terms of access to international capital. Liberty Life, the country's largest insurance company, is leading the way with a Dollars 500m convertible bond offering. Smaller debt and equity issues are sure to follow. Last week's budget included a government overseas borrowing target of R1.8bn (Pounds 320m). Yet buying rand-denominated assets remains difficult. Despite being the world's 10th largest equity market, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is notoriously illiquid thanks to a complex web of cross-holdings. Until South African companies and institutions are free to invest overseas, equities will remain gridlocked. The financial rand - a closed pool of currency through which all inward investment must be channelled - is another hurdle. True, foreign investors enjoy exceptionally high bond yields because the financial rand trades at a discount to the domestic currency. But the closed pool restricts liquidity, making it difficult to buy and sell. These factors are likely to limit the flow of foreign investment in South Africa, however promising the economic fundamentals may seem. While the discount on the financial rand remains high, the government may be too worried about capital flight to abolish exchange controls. The danger is that the discount will not close because international investors dislike dealing in the volatile financial rand. Unless the government takes the initiative, South Africa could find itself locked into a damaging stand-off.   Companies:-  Liberty Life Association of Africa.

During an interview with the media that have accompanied him  on his visit to the Republic of South Africa, Fidel Castro said  Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos sincerely expressed  with ""heartfelt words that came from the bottom of his soul""  what the aid given by Cuba represented for his country.    Today, the two leaders held a meeting following the  inauguration of antiapartheid leader Nelson Mandela as South  African president, an event that shook the world on 10 May.  Referring to the meeting, the Cuban head of state said dos  Santos also told him that Cuban cooperation was important not  only for Angola but also for South Africa and the rest of that  vast continent. He added that dos Santos' words shook him when  he referred to the unselfish aid given by the Cuban people to  that region of the planet.    Today, Fidel Castro talked with a dozen African heads of  state and government who attended Mandela's inauguration,  including Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, Namibian President  San Nujoma, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, and Mozambican  President Joaquim Chissano.    He also talked with Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat,  Israeli  President Ezer Weizman, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto,  and UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, among other  personalities invited to Mandela's inauguration, which was  attended by 150,000 guests, including 42 leaders.

Why not act on the information provided by Baholo?""  This ""vacillation must stop if the Lesotho crisis is not to  develop into a major regional crisis.

Addressing the World Economic Forum summit in Cape Town, Mr  de Klerk told international business leaders that South Africa  would be foolish if it ""precipitately tore out the stitches from  wounds which are only now beginning to heal"".    But Mr Mbeki, speaking from the same platform, said his  sister-in-law was still looking for her unionist husband who had  disappeared without trace in Durban about seven years ago. ""We  are trying to find him and we are hoping somewhere in South  Africa there is somebody who knows what happened, who will come  and say I am sorry...because of the particular times in which we  were, we took him and because of who he was and what he was  doing, given those times, unfortunately we got rid of him.  That's why you can't find him. Because then his wife and two  children can at last say he is dead and do whatever custom and  tradition demand they do in the circumstances. It's that kind  of truth, (Deputy) President de Klerk, that we are looking for.""  His sister-in-law could then become part of the process of  national reconciliation, Mr Mbeki added.    Earlier, Mr de Klerk said South Africa had to be very  careful  how it approached sensitive questions relating to the past,  particularly with regard to amnesty, indemnity and the truth  commission. ""We agree that processes have to be developed to  put the political crimes of the past behind us once and for all,  that the wounds of the past must be healed. But such a process  cannot be allowed to develop into a tug of war or even a running  sore which might continue to suppurate for years."" The reality,  he said, was that during the past conflict, unacceptable crimes  were committed by followers of all sides and factions. ""We have  just completed four years of hard negotiation aimed at resolving  that conflict. We would be foolish if we precipitately tore out  the stitches from wounds which are only now beginning to heal.""    Mr de Klerk also said it was important that South Africa  ""build well"" and not make basic errors that could weaken its  national structure in the future. He had no problem with  affirmative action, but the country should be very careful about  the way it implemented such programmes, and dared not throw  merit out of the window. ""Instead of drifting into new  state-sponsored discrimination against some members of our  society, we should redouble our efforts to remove any vestiges  of discrimination against any South African.""    Other issues that would have to be handled with sensitivity  and care were land ownership, financial discipline, the size of  the civil service and the funding of the Reconstruction and  Development Programme.

0,FT933-5763 ,"FT933-5763 _AN-DIAB3AGHFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (10): An optimistic outlook - Stock markets      By TONY HAWKINS   PROBABLY there is more optimism and enthusiasm about stock market development in Africa than about any other aspect of the business landscape. The strong rebound in Latin American markets since the end of the 1980s shows what could happen in sub-Saharan Africa as reform programmes take hold. Zimbabwe's experience is a case in point. Reforms introduced mid-year, including reduced taxes and guaranteed free exit for dividends and disinvestment proceeds, saw the ZSE index rise more than 50 per cent, driven by an influx of more than Dollars 2m in foreign money. Initiatives from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and private investment agencies will boost the sector. In mid-1991, there were no funds operating in the region, but in the past two years, a number have been established, most notably the Africa Growth Fund (a venture capital vehicle), the Commonwealth Equity Fund, the Emerging Markets Fund and the Mauritius Fund, while London-based Genesis Emerging Markets Fund has minor African holdings. Also active in the fund field is the Wall Street-based Aidoo group, headed by a Ghanaian American, Judith Aidoo, which earlier in the year formed an investment advisory arm, Aidoo Group Asset Management. AGAM plans to market African fixed-interest and equity securities to US investors. Initially, it is using a niche market approach seeking to interest expatriate Africans living in the US and elsewhere in investing back home, while also targeting black Americans. The fund, of about Dollars 20m to Dollars 30m is likely to be followed by a purely equity fund at a later stage. South Africa comes into the picture here too, with scope for reversing the sanctions process of pension funds and institutional investors that divested from the country during the sanctions era. Ms Aidoo is also developing innovative ways of tapping into privatisation and debt restructuring financings. One of these involves linking the Clinton administration's proposed 'Russia Fund', designed to finance Russian privatisation, with debt relief for African countries that owe money to the Russians. Angola, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia together owe the former Soviet Union some Dollars 14bn. She suggests that Russia should sell its African debt to western donors in the G-7 group at deep discounts. The Aidoo group puts the market value of African debt owed to Russia at no more than 10c in the dollar. So a Pounds 1bn Russia privatisation fund could purchase Dollars 10bn of the total Dollars 14bn African debt owed to Russia. The purchasers could then either cancel the debt outright or use it for debt-for-nature or debt-equity swaps. Debt trade is also a growing area. The Aidoo group estimates the outstanding debt paper at around Dollars 180bn - or almost 30 per cent of the global market in emerging market debt - covering 60 to 70 issues with an annual turnover of some Dollars 13bn. Prices range up to 50 per cent of nominal value, but the average is lower at around 15 per cent. This year, Salomon Brothers in New York calculated Nigerian par bonds were the highest yielding collateralised Brady bond paper in the market, offering a yield of some 15 per cent compared with 9.3 per cent for Mexico. But the fundamental need is the return of sub-Saharan Africa's 'stock' of flight capital, which may exceed 80 per cent of GDP, according to the World Bank calculations. Only after Africans show themselves willing to invest in their own countries will foreigners follow.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.     ZWZ  Zimbabwe, Africa.     ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

The way South African Business  responded to the political transition was going to be a key  determinant of this.    Mr Manuel welcomed their response to the programme and their  willingness to establish a fund for it. ""I think political  certainty will also see more investment by South African  corporations in new opportunities. All that will hasten the  date by which we will be able to announce the lifting of  exchange controls. It is a matter under discussion.""    Vice-chairman of the United States-based Citicorp and  Citibank Bill Rhodes told journalists he was ""very impressed""  with the realism of the new government. South Africa needed to  demonstrate it would continue to show fiscal and monetary  discipline to obtain a positive credit rating in international  markets. He said Citicorp had recently been granted a licence  to open a representative office in South Africa and hoped to be  able to do so in the next few months. It was already allocating  funds to trade finance facilities. He sensed a strong  recognition by the South African Government that they needed to  maintain the balance between economic reforms and providing  social necessities.    Mr Manuel said funds raised by merchant banks in the US for  investment in South Africa had done exceedingly well. ""They've  surpassed expectations. That must say something about the way  people are reading the moment in South Africa.""     "

Officials said millions of people will be affected, AP reports from Washington. Among the hardest hit of the 10 drought-stricken countries are Zimbabwe and South Africa, traditional food exporters which this year will have to import substantial quantities of grain. As the drought persists, estimates of the grain harvest throughout the region have been falling precipitously. The deteriorating situation in southern Africa adds a new dimension to the continent's overall food crisis. The north-east is the most deprived area in Africa, encompassing Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The lives of 15m people are thought to be at risk. Officials in Zimbabwe said last week 60,000 cattle died from starvation during February alone and thousands more will die unless heavy rains come soon. The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organisation warned late last month that the drought could lead to widespread famine. About 98m people live in the affected regions in southern Africa. 'Considerable donor assistance will be needed to avert a major humanitarian crisis in the region,' the US State Department said last week.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

The figures are likely to provoke controversy as many colleges said the differing goals of schools and colleges, and the limited information available on vocational qualifications, made comparisons impossible. Two statistics caused surprise. One was the performance of Sheffield, a Labour-controlled authority with significant inner-city deprivation, which had the highest overall A-level point score per entrant of any local authority in England - where only pupils taking two or more A-levels were considered. The other surprise was the extent of the disparity in performance between independent schools and others. Independents managed an average of 17.97 A-level points for candidates taking two A-levels or more (a grade A is worth 10 points and an E is worth two), while state schools managed 12.85 and further education colleges 10.19. In other words, pupils at independents could expect at least one grade more in each of three subjects. Independent schools are usually much more selective than state schools can be, and this will account for much of the disparity. The results for many relatively affluent southern authorities may have been harmed by large numbers of pupils being sent to independent schools. The performance figures for further education colleges have also aroused controversy. They show that even for vocational qualifications, in which many of the colleges specialise, they appear not to perform quite as well as schools - with a pass rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications of 82.12 per cent, compared with the 85.84 per cent of state schools. The Association for Colleges objected that the figures did not include National Vocational Qualifications - directly work-related courses - which account for the bulk of the colleges' work, or any indicators of the success achieved in the adult literacy and numeracy programmes which they are legally obliged to provide. Any ranking system is open to question. In the tables below the FT has first ranked colleges by success rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications. Where two score equally, the college with the superior A-level performance is ranked higher. This method must carry the serious 'health warning' that it produces unfairly low rankings for sixth-form colleges, because they concentrate on A-levels. For now, it is better than nothing. Mr John Patten, education secretary, admitted the tables were incomplete. He said the government would next year publish tables that included performance in the new General National Vocational Qualifications ('Vocational A-levels').

C. Tsai]    [Text] Johannesburg, March 22 (CNA) -- South African  police on Tuesday [22 March] rapped Britain's Environmental  Investigation Agency (EIA) for falsely accusing a Taiwan  diplomat of involvement in rhino horn trade.    Pieter Lategan, chief of the Endangered Species Protection  Unit (ESPU) under the South African Police Administration, said  the Republic of China [ROC] Embassy and the Republic of China's  National Police Administration have worked closely with the ESPU  on wildlife protection.    None of the embassy officials or vehicles were ever involved  in rhino horn smuggling, Lategan said.    Moreover, he noted, no one from the ESPU has ever been  interviewed by the EIA.    The South African official said he has phoned the EIA to  express his strong dissatisfaction at the accusations. In  addition, he has sent a letter to the London-based conservation  group requesting a detailed explanation of the accusations.    During a meeting of nongovernment organizations (NGO)  following the Standing Committee meeting of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Geneva  Monday, the EIA aired a 20-minute videotape, in which a South  African policeman charged Taiwan envoys with smuggling rhino  horns.    A statement issued by Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Tuesday said the man accused of rhino horn smuggling was not a  diplomat but an Overseas Chinese who once worked as a member of  the Control Yuan, Taiwan's highest watchdog body.    The man, Yen Nuo, was [word indistinct] in South Africa in  February 1986 for illegally trading in rhino horns, but was  found not guilty as Yen had a license to sell rhino horns issued  by the South African Government.    Meanwhile, a report from Geneva said the CITES Standing  Committee has decided to ignore the EIA's accusations.     "

Today we  celebrate not the victory of a party, but a victory for all the  people of South Africa.    Our country has arrived at a decision. Among all the parties  that contested the elections, the overwhelming majority of South  Africans have mandated the African National Congress to lead our  country into the future. The South Africa we have struggled  for, in which all our people, be they African, coloured, Indian  or white, regard themselves as citizens of one nation is at hand.    Perhaps it was history that ordained that it be here, at the  Cape of Good Hope that we should lay the foundation stone of our  new nation. For it was here at this Cape, over three centuries  ago, that there began the fateful convergence of the peoples of  Africa, Europe and Asia on these shores. It was to this  peninsula that the patriots, among them many princes and  scholars, of Indonesia were dragged in chains. It was on the  sandy plains of this peninsula that first battles of the epic  wars of resistance were fought.    When we look out across Table Bay, the horizon is dominated  by Ro?ben Island, whose infamy as a dungeon built to stifle the  spirit of freedom is as old as colonialism in South Africa. For  three centuries that island was seen as a place to which  outcasts can be banished. The names of those who were  incarcerated on Robben Island is a roll call of resistance  fighters and democrats spanning over three centuries. If indeed  this is a Cape of Good Hope, that hope owes much to the spirit  of that legion of fighters and others of their calibre.    We have fought for a democratic constitution since the  1880s.  Ours has been a quest for a constitution freely adopted by the  people of South Africa, reflecting their wishes and their  aspirations. The struggle for democracy has never been a matter  pursued by one race, class, religious community or gender among  South Africans. In honouring those who fought to see this day  arrive, we honour the best sons and daughters of all our people.  We can count amongst them Africans, coloureds, whites, Indians,  Muslims, Christians, Hindus, Jews -- all of them united by a  common vision of a better life for the people of this country.    It was that vision that inspired us in 1923 when we adopted  the first ever bill of rights in this country. That same vision  spurred us to put forward the African claims in 1946. It is  also the founding principle of the Freedom Charter we adopted as  policy in 1955, which in its very first lines, places before  South Africa an inclusive basis for citizenship.    In the 1980s the African National Congress was still  setting the pace, being the first major political formation in  South Africa to commit itself firmly to a bill of rights, which  we published in November 1990. These milestones give concrete  expression to what South Africa can become. They speak of a  constitutional, democratic, political order in which, regardless  of colour, gender, religion, political opinion or sexual  orientation, the law will provide for the equal protection of  all citizens.    They project a democracy in which the government, whomever  that government may be, will be bound by a higher set of rules,  embodied in a constitution, and will not be able govern the  country as it pleases.    Democracy is based on the majority principle. This is  especially true in a country such as ours where the vast  majority have been systematically denied their rights. At the  same time, democracy also requires that the rights of political  and other minorities be safeguarded.    In the political order we have established there will be  regular, open and free elections, at all levels of government -  central, provincial and municipal. There shall also be a social  order which respects completely the culture, language and  religious rights of all sections of our society and the  fundamental rights of the individual.    The task at hand on will not be easy. But you have mandated  us to change South Africa from a country in which the majority  lived with little hope, to one in which they can live and work  with dignity, with a sense of self-esteem and confidence in the  future. The cornerstone of building a better life of  opportunity, freedom and expression is the most dynamic program  of social upliftment in the history of this country. The  Reconstruction and Development Programme -- this needs unity of  purpose. It needs unity in action. It requires us all to work  together to bring an end to division, an end to suspicion and  build a nation united in our diversity.    The people of South Africa have spoken in these elections.  They want change! And change is what they will get. Our plan  is to create jobs, promote peace and reconciliation, and to  guarantee freedom for all South Africans. We will tackle the  widespread poverty so pervasive among the majority of our  people. By encouraging investors and the democratic state to  support job creating projects in which manufacturing will play a  central role we will try to change our country from a net  exporter of raw materials to one that exports finished products  through beneficiation.    The government will devise policies that encourage and  reward  productive enterprise among the disadvantaged communities -  African, coloured and Indian. By easing credit conditions we  can assist them to make inroads into the productive and  manufacturing spheres and breakout of the small-scale  distribution to which they are presently confined.    To raise our country and its people from the morass of  racism  and apartheid will require determination and effort. As a  government, the ANC will create a legal framework that will  assist, rather than impede, the awesome task of reconstruction  and development of our battered society.    While we are and shall remain fully committed to the spirit  of a government of national unity, we are determined to initiate  and bring about the change that our mandate from the people  demands.    We place our vision of a new constitutional order for South  Africa on the table not as conquerors, prescribing to the  conquered. We speak as fellow citizens to heal the wounds of the  past with the intent of constructing a new order based on  justice for all.    This is the challenge that faces all South Africans today,  and it is one to which I am certain we will all rise.     "

[Soares] We must do both at the same time.    [LE FIGARO] Would not such change be too much of a shock for  newcomers?    [Soares] Austria, Sweden, Norway, and Finland want to join  the Union. Their motives are mostly economic. But we need to  explain to them that enlargement without a renewed political  structure is not a viable proposition. One of these days,  Europe will fall apart unless it has a political structure and a  real European constitution. We need European parties, European  trade unions, etc.    [LE FIGARO] After taking in such countries, will it be  necessary to rebalance the Union to the south, for instance by  having Malta or Cyprus join in?    [Soares] Yes, I believe it is necessary. We shall also need  to readjust eastward.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe that Europe is taking too long in  opening its doors to new Eastern democracies?    [Soares] Yes, without any doubt. I believe Europe has not  proved bold enough, that its response to the perspectives that  have opened has been completely inadequate. The Europe we built  was one based on the divide between two blocs. Now that blocs  have vanished, we cannot keep looking at Europe in the same  light as before.    [LE FIGARO] How do you view Europe's attitude with respect  to the Bosnian conflict?    [Soares] Europe has not progressed as far as external policy  and defense are concerned. Institutionally, Europe has made no  headway either. Bosnia is a good reason for us to speed up the  construction of a real European political structure.    [LE FIGARO] Is not the Maastricht crisis behind us, now?    [Soares] Things have improved, no doubt about it. But  everything remains to be done. One major problem is the fact  that since Europe's inception, the driving force has been the  Franco-German axis. What will become of this axis in the  future? That is the question. There is no certainty that all  difficulties have been overcome.    [LE FIGARO] What are you worried about?    [Soares] What will come out of the election in Germany?  Chancellor Kohl has taken a major part in the European  construction; he has always been strongly pro-European. He is a  German of the West. We do not know whether his successors will  share his European ideal.    [LE FIGARO] Doesn't Europe need a charismatic figure?    [Soares] Yes, I think so. You know, for years, all  Europeans have tended to look at Mitterrand as the man who  embodied this determination to build Europe. But Mitterrand is  now reaching the end of his term....    [LE FIGARO] Among Europe's other potentially troublesome  neighbors are also North African countries, and especially  Algeria. What turn do you expect things will take in Algeria?    [Soares] I do not see any short-term solution.    [LE FIGARO] Do you believe a military dictatorship can work  toward the reestablishment of a civilian government in a few  years' time?    [Soares] This can only be a temporary solution.    [LE FIGARO] There is the example of Turkey....    [Soares] Turkey remains a problematic country, but true,  things have not gone too awry there.    [LE FIGARO] Is Islam the West's new enemy, now that  communism is dead?    [Soares] There are exponents of Islam with whom it is  possible to talk. One cannot be satisfied with a simplistic  vision of the problem; no attitude could be worse. There are  positive forces within Islam. We must encourage and help them.  One must never lose sight of the economic and social context in  which Islam thrives. This is what fuels religious fundamentalism.    [LE FIGARO] Even in Saudi Arabia?    [Soares] We should not let Saudi Arabia remain the way it  is, we should not let the people of Islam revert to archaic  models.    [LE FIGARO] And still we do nothing about it....    [Soares] The West does nothing about it; that is the West's  mistake. If one wants to foster democracy, one cannot tolerate  dictators. This is the contradiction at the core of the United  States' policies, as well as Europe's, to a lesser extent. Take  East Timor, which was annexed illegally by Indonesia after the  1975 military invasion. We have been exerting pressure on the  United Nations so that this island's right to self-determination  may be recognized. This is a just cause. And yet, when we ask  France or other European countries for help, we are faced with a  wall of silence. Of course, Indonesia is a powerful country  that purchases European goods. So we conveniently forget that  it is a dictatorship.    [LE FIGARO] Is not your position somewhat inconsistent?  On the one hand you advocate dialogue with Algeria's  fundamentalists, and on the other you believe that we should  interfere with Indonesia or Saudi Arabia's affairs -- hard-line  regimes, to be sure, but without a civil war.    [Soares] No, they do not have a civil war, they are  dictatorships. One must call a spade a spade -- and  dictatorships are dictatorships. And one must not respect those  as though they actually represent a people. I am quite  sensitive to these things because I fought dictatorship in  Portugal. And the Western world -- including England, the  United States, and France -- used to consider that the  Portuguese and Spanish dictators were acceptable because they  were anticommunist. I believe there is no excuse for such an  attitude if one wants to have a global human rights policy.    [LE FIGARO] After the Gulf war, there were aspirations to a  new world order. Today, the dream has collapsed, has it not?    [Soares] It will re-emerge, it is inevitable. Because  humankind's major problems know no border. Only a global policy  will solve problems such as environment degradation or  starvation. This is why we are necessarily headed for a global  legal order, headed by a reformed United Nations organization.  Living in a world where two-thirds of the population are  starving is an untenable proposition.    [LE FIGARO] You know Africa well. Is it a lost continent?    [Soares] No. Africa is a continent that has gone adrift,  but it is not lost. We have no overall policy with respect to  this continent.    [LE FIGARO] Which is Africa's key country?    [Soares] As far as Sub-Saharan Africa is concerned, this is  undoubtedly South Africa. If peaceful elections can be held  there, then I think settlements can be found for peripheral  conflicts -- in Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, etc.    [LE FIGARO] Do you think Mandela is the right man for the  job?    [Soares] He has learned a great deal. He is a really wise  man.    [LE FIGARO] Your trust in him is total?    [Soares] Yes I trust him. He is a moderate. He knows what  the issues are, and he wants a peaceful way out for his country.  He is prepared to make a number of vital concessions to avoid  causing a panic among the population.    [LE FIGARO] All told, you are much more optimistic than most  Western leaders....    [Soares] I am optimistic inasmuch as I think we are going to  rediscover a number of essential values. We shall finally  realize that humankind's evolution does not solely hinge on  interest rates and growth rates, but also on political and  social values. That humankind must mobilize for ideas, not only  for interests. And that notions of equality, fraternity,  democracy, and human rights are the only ones likely to free  humankind. We are still in a transitional phase. The end of  totalitarian regimes constitutes a considerable improvement.  This is important. If we feel the world has been going all  wrong lately, it is also because of the hopes for an everlasting  peace created by the collapse of communism.     "

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with praise during his visit, the first by a South African leader. He said Mr de Klerk deserved a place alongside the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian, given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa may prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at end of the year. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were protestations of African brotherhood from both, each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two superpowers.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Although the situation in the United States is less dire, the inexorable growth  of Western states and their increasing demands on limited water resources will  force more of the nation's richest croplands out of production, the institute  reported.    The earliest and most dramatic impact of worldwide pressure on water supplies  may be felt in Egypt, according to the institute, a nonprofit research  organization that studies world environmental and economic problems.    It noted that virtually all productive land in Egypt is irrigated, the  population is growing at a rate of a million people every eight months, and the  country is the last in line to draw water from the Nile River.    The outlook for China, India, Mexico, Israel and Jordan is somewhat less stark,  but nevertheless foreboding, the institute reported.    At least 10 countries in North and East Africa ""are likely to experience severe  water stress by 2000,"" the report states. ""Egypt, already near its limits,  could lose vital supplies from the Nile as upper basin countries develop the  river's headwaters.""    In much of the Third World, food security is destined to replace military  security as the most pressing priority of many nations, Worldwatch Director  Lester R. Brown said at a press conference.    The institute's study was headed by Sandra Postel, a Worldwatch vice president  and senior researcher who attributed looming shortages to short-sighted  policies, technical obsolescence and rising costs, in addition to the pressure  of growing populations.    In China, Postel said, the water tables beneath Beijing are dropping as much as  2 meters per year, and farmers in the arid region of the country may lose 30%  to 40% of their irrigation water to critical municipal and industrial demands.    In India, thousands of villages already face shortages, and large sections of  metropolitan New Delhi have water for only a few hours a day, while around  Mexico City, land is subsiding because of ground-water depletion.    In Israel, Jordan and the West Bank, where streams, aquifers and all other  water supplies that are renewed by rainfall will be in use by 1995, ""shortages  are imminent,"" Postel said.    On a per-capita basis, the amount of irrigated land has been declining  worldwide since 1978, and in some countries, such as Mexico, there have been  outright reductions in the total area under irrigation.    Although many countries, such as China and India, rely on irrigation for more  than half of their food production, lending for irrigation by the major  international donors has declined sharply over the last decade, Worldwatch  reported.    Lending to 23 countries in Asia, North Africa and the Middle East by the World  Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development  and the Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund fell more than 60% after  adjusting for inflation between 1977 and 1987, the report said.    The cost of bringing new land under irrigation is soaring -- reaching as much  as $4,000 per acre in Mexico -- and more than half of the world's irrigation  systems are in need of upgrading to remain in good working order, the group  said.    Although the United States will not experience the potential catastrophe facing  much of the Third World, the report found trends in the United States moving in  the same direction and policies hardly more efficient than those where critical  shortages loom.    Rapidly expanding Western cities, facing future water deficits, are  increasingly buying up perpetual water rights in a practice known as ""water  ranching."" In Pima County, Ariz., around Tucson, irrigated agriculture is  expected to disappear by the year 2020, the institute reported.    Meanwhile, some 4 million hectares -- about 10 million acres -- of U.S.  agricultural land is being irrigated at unsustainable rates ""and will  eventually come out of irrigated production"" unless farmers reduce pumping to  no more than the rate at which rainfall recharges aquifers, Postel said.    Water subsidies by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation have  subsidized farmers who grow hay and pasture while more valuable water  priorities go wanting. And the artificially low cost of water used to irrigate  croplands such as California's San Joaquin Valley causes inefficient use of  scarce water resources.    ""Farmers benefiting from the huge Central Valley Project in California have  repaid only 5% of the project's costs over the last 40 years -- $50 million out  of $931 million,"" Postel said. ""This free ride in large part explains why so  few Western farmers invest in efficiency improvements.""    The institute report was completed before the Interior Department's decision  Nov. 29 to renew 28 Central Valley water contracts for another 40 years. The  contracts provide for a 300% increase in the price paid by valley farmers for  irrigation water while ensuring that they will continue to receive ample  supplies well into the next century.    The 28 contract renewals were regarded as a harbinger of Bush Administration  policy on hundreds of contracts due to expire over the next several years.  Although some contract terms could be modified in response to findings of an  environmental impact statement, the amount of water allocated to agricultural  interests will not be reduced.    Among significant water policy initiatives around the world, Postel cited the  conservation initiatives of Southern California's Metropolitan Water District  as an example worthy of wide emulation.    By financing conservation projects in the Imperial Irrigation District, the  Metropolitan Water District is getting enough water for 800,000 Southern  Californians without the need for taking cropland out of production or selling  irrigation water rights.    Postel said that approach is ""at the other extreme"" from the strategy in  Arizona, where water ranching by cities has already destined thousands of acres  of prime agricultural land to revert to desert.

Postel said that approach is ""at the other extreme"" from the strategy in  Arizona, where water ranching by cities has already destined thousands of acres  of prime agricultural land to revert to desert.

This policy, called  the ""New Frontier Program,"" aims to provide comprehensive  assistance to southern African nations, which are attracting  much global interest, so as to improve the economic situation of  the whole region on the occasion of RSA's achieving the  historical change from white domination to multiracial  coexistence. Japan especially aims to stress the expanded  range of its international contribution, which tends to be  regarded as ""Asian-oriented.""    Providing ODA to the RSA has been allowed since 1990 only  for  the purpose of helping black citizens to become self-reliant.  However, by the end of 1992, Japan had only provided about 100  million yen in small-scale grants and technical cooperation.    Following the new administration's inauguration, it is  expected that larger assistance will be needed in the future.  Therefore, Japan wants to positively extend cooperation in the  form of loans and other aid on the premise that the OECD's  Development Assistance Committee will designate RSA as a  qualified recipient of assistance.    With regard to Mozambique, Japan has already decided to  provide it with full-fledged ODA in the form of bilateral  assistance, while also participating in UN Peacekeeping  Operations. Japan is now studying details of the plan.  Moreover, in light of the establishment of the new  administration in the RSA, Japan will expand its assistance  program to cover Botswana, where the Southern African  Development Community's secretariat is located, so that Japan  can carry out comprehensive assistance. Japan provided  Mozambique with about $200 million in bilateral assistance from  1988 to 1992, and Botswana with about $5 million from 1987 to  1992.     "

He was  given a standing ovation at the NP federal congress at Kempton  Park's World Trade Centre for a sharp attack on the ANC while  speaking in support of the NP's new election manifesto.    The ANC was not African or national or a congress, he said.  The ANC was an embarrassment everywhere in Africa because it  pursued policies which were no longer practiced anywhere on the  continent. ""They still call each other 'comrade', and African  leaders ask me why can't the ANC get rid of the past. It claims  to have international acceptability but, but by whom? They  confuse their acceptability with that of Mr Mandela who is a  martyr,"" he said.    ""They are not African because there is not one country in  Africa that propagates their policies. They are not national  but a conglomeration of converse foreign ideologies. They are  also not a congress but a conglomeration of confused people.""    The ANC also could not refrain from personal insults against  President F W de Klerk. In front of foreign governments and  audiences where Mr de Klerk was regarded as a man of integrity,  the ANC acknowledged this. But the moment the ANC addressed an  audience that ""lives in the past with a racist orientation"", Mr  de Klerk was reviled as a criminal and racist terrorist. ""There  was only one man who liberated South Africa -- not as a sign of  weakness -- and that is why he got the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Mr  Botha said.    Mr Botha received a standing ovation with some black women  delegates ululating and whistling.     "

Mr Mandela, on a two-day visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.

By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER      MITCHELLS PLAIN, South Africa      The highest-ranking exiled leaders of the African National Congress, speaking  directly to South Africans for the first time in three decades, told a rally  here Sunday that this week's talks with the government signal the beginning of  the end of ""the misery of apartheid.""    ""South Africa shall never be the same again,"" ANC Secretary General Alfred Nzo  told about 10,000 supporters gathered on a soggy sports field on a cold,  blustery day. ""Ours is a society in transition to a new order.""    In one of the most remarkable scenes in the nation's history, Nzo, South  African Communist Party chief Joe Slovo and other leaders who direct the ANC's  guerrilla war against Pretoria mounted a stage in this mixed-race township near  Cape Town.    ""It's so weird . . . so very strange to see Joe Slovo up there,"" said Alexandra  Noble, a 20-year-old white college student in the crowd of black, white,  mixed-race and Indian faces.    Nzo, Slovo and their colleagues, who returned Friday from exile in Zambia, have  for years been the most notorious of the white government's enemies. Until  February, their words and even their photographs were banned from the country's  books, newspapers and television.    Their public appearance Sunday, guarded by their aides as well as South African  police officers, indicated just how far South Africa has come in the 2 1/2  months since President Frederik W. de Klerk lifted the bans on anti-apartheid  groups and invited the ANC and others to the negotiating table.    ""We are together at last, and we are here because you, the people of South  Africa, made it happen,"" said Slovo, a 63-year-old white lawyer who fled South  Africa at age 35 under threat of arrest.    Until recently, Slovo was the ANC's chief military strategist and directed  operations that killed or maimed hundreds of black and white civilians. As  leader of the Communist Party and member of the ANC's executive committee, he  is a key figure in the ANC-Communist Party alliance and the leader most feared  by many white South Africans.    Slovo and Nzo, the day's keynote speakers, abandoned much of the war talk that  has characterized ANC speeches in the past.    ""We have come in a spirit of conciliation,"" Slovo said. ""If there is a way  forward without bloodshed, the whole world knows we will grab it with both  hands.""    During three days of talks beginning Wednesday, an ANC delegation, led by  Nelson Mandela, and a government team, led by De Klerk, will discuss the  remaining obstacles to negotiations.    Among those hurdles are the ANC's insistence that the four-year-old state of  emergency be lifted, that political prisoners be freed and that the 15,000 ANC  exiles be indemnified from prosecution. The government wants the ANC to abandon  its armed struggle, which De Klerk claims has fueled an upsurge of township  violence in recent weeks.    The ANC leaders used the forum Sunday to explain their reasons for agreeing to  government talks, a move that has been criticized by many young ANC supporters  who believe De Klerk has not yet moved far enough to warrant talks.    ""We have come to the table in search of a future of peace and equality,"" Slovo  said. He criticized ""armchair revolutionaries,"" an apparent reference to the  radical black Pan-Africanist Congress. Groups like the PAC ""scream treason when  the word dialogue is mentioned,"" he said.    Slovo praised De Klerk's ""courage"" in removing some of the obstacles to peace  in South Africa. But he said the president ""has only removed one or two bolts  from the door. The master lock has not yet been opened.""    Part of the blame, he said, lies with white South Africans ""who have allowed  their human feelings to be washed away by their swimming pools and champagne.""    Slovo said the ANC needs to see more reforms from the government before it  considers relinquishing its 30-year-old armed struggle.    ""It is because we spoke with the AK-47 (rifle) that dialogue is at least in the  air,"" he said. ""We will be ready to walk through the door (for negotiations)  when we see signs of real democracy. Short of that we will have to break down  the door.""    Slovo also outlined the ANC's negotiating strategy, reassuring opponents of the  government that his organization would not back down from its demands for  majority rule, a constituent assembly to draw up a new constitution and a  redistribution of wealth. The government has said it will grant the 27 million  black majority the vote but it wants political protection for the 5 million  whites.    ""We accept that the time may arise when a degree of compromise is needed,""  Slovo said. ""But there is a limit -- and this is the gap that must be closed.    ""We can't go to the negotiating table ready to abandon (the ANC's demand for)  majority rule or forget that 90% of the productive property in this country is  owned by whites,"" he said.    ""A future South Africa without majority rule is a future South Africa in which  we cannot touch the economic fruits of our country. It's just apartheid by  another name.""    Until the government shows its willingness to meet the ANC's demands for  negotiations, foreign governments should maintain their economic sanctions and  diplomatic isolation of Pretoria, Slovo added.

0,FT943-13723 ,"FT943-13723 _AN-EGRD8AFGFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (23): Two taxing conditions - Manufacturing industry      By TONY HAWKINS   In the new South Africa, manufacturing industry must fulfil two taxing conditions. Growth must be both export-led and labour-intensive. Marrying these two goals is not going to be easy. South Africa is not a low-cost country - more a high-wage, low productivity one - and its competitive advantage stems primarily from the combination of a rich resource base and highly capital-intensive, value-adding activities. The numbers tell their own story; in 1990, base metals, chemicals and metal products accounted for 58 per cent of manufactured exports, while almost three quarters were classified as 'resource-based'. In part, as trade theory predicts, this reflects South Africa's resource endowment, but two policy elements - forward cover for exports and tax incentives for 'beneficiation' industries, adding value to minerals, also contributed. Since the 1920s, industrial growth has been driven by import substitution behind high tariff and protective walls. In the past decade, however, the emphasis has changed as domestic recession pushed more and more companies into the export market. Despite sanctions, exports of manufactures grew 10 per cent a year between 1984 and 1990 - nearly three times faster than in the 1970s. Indeed, since 1972, exports have grown twice as fast as production - 6 per cent as against 2.6 per cent for output. Five industrial sectors - foods, industrial chemicals, steel, non-ferrous metals and metal products - make up almost two thirds of total manufactured exports but in recent years non-traditional exports - furniture, jewellery, rubber and plastics, and cars - have expanded strongly as business was forced to seek market opportunities abroad. On the face of it, this ought to make cheerful reading for Pretoria's policymakers. Industrial exports that performed so impressively under sanctions should surely do far better now, not just because sanctions have gone, but also because supplyside reforms to enhance productivity and competitiveness are in train. These reforms take two main forms. First, political transition and the thrust of the RDP which, between them, should both improve substantially the industrial relations environment, while boosting productivity, on the strength of increased spending on education and training. The second is the pronounced and continuing shift in trade policy, underlined by tariff reform and the commitment to more export-friendly strategies. South Africa's extremely complex and skewed tariff system is being reformed as part of the country's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade submission under the Uruguay round. From next January, tariffs will be lowered and rationalised over a five-year period, with longer phase-in periods and higher protection for 'sensitive' industries, most notably clothing and textiles and vehicle assembly. Although South African manufacturing has not been over-protected - according to the World Bank the average tariff is about average for a developing country, although very high by first world standards - the dispersion, complexity and instability of the system have undermined economic efficiency. The net effect has been a heavy bias against exports, two- thirds of which stems from the higher input prices that industry must pay for manufactured inputs. The South African Chamber of Business (Sacob) estimates that manufacturing costs are 15 per cent above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average, mainly because South African companies pay a quarter more for their inputs than their first-world competitors, but also because both the cost of capital and labour costs, adjusted for productivity, are higher. From next January, this will start to change. The number of tariff rates will be reduced from more than 100 to just six, ranging from 0 per cent to 30 per cent, lowering the average tariff to 15per cent. The frequent discretionary changes in the system that have been the norm, will no longer be possible. The World Bank says that the General Export Incentive Scheme which, until the 1994 budget, provided tax-free financial subsidies to exporters, provided a subsidy of nearly 17 per cent of the value of export. The subsidy, costing some R2bn annually, applies to most exports, increasing with the degree of value added. The Bank warns that manufacturing industry's recent impressive export growth is unlikely to be maintained, when it is phased out, probably by the end of 1997. Crucial to the export drive will be a new system of incentives - by way of exemptions and duty-drawbacks - improved mechanisms for providing pre- and post-shipment export finance, and linking training and research and development assistance to export-oriented companies. The underlying strategy is a reversal of past performance, shifting from a situation in which export sales are a residual after satisfying the home market, to one in which domestic market sales play second fiddle to exports. How tariff reform and export incentives will play out in terms of their impact on manufacturing will only become clear towards the end of the decade. The Industrial Development Corporation, using a macroeconomic model borrowed from the Australians, has calculated that Gatt submission will have a positive impact, albeit only a minor one. Its model, criticised on technical grounds by some private sector economists, estimates that tariff reform will increase gross domestic product by only 0.7 per cent - a one-off impact - while lowering inflation 1 per cent, raising employment 1 per cent, exports 1.2 per cent, and imports 2.5 per cent. The magnitude of these calculations suggests that the impact of Gatt on the South African economy is being oversold. This, however, ignores the qualitative implications in terms of transforming an inward-looking into an outward-oriented manufacturing sector, with significant gains in terms of technology, skills and productivity. Nor do such macro calculations capture the impact of restructuring. Two sensitive industries - cars and clothing and textiles - face a potentially traumatic transitional phase during which some companies will have to close, jobs will be lost and significant government financial support will be needed, for retraining and possibly for redundancy benefits. The motor industry, with seven assemblers, faces far-reaching structural change. The number of models produced will shrink, exports will loom larger as protection phases down over the next seven or eight years to 45 per cent from 110 per cent at present, and - in all probability - two or even three of the existing manufacturers will close or merge with a local competitor. Just what this will mean for employment is unclear at this stage, but there is an influential lobby in business, with some support from the World Bank, for further exchange rate depreciation. This would make exporting more profitable, generating investment and jobs, while giving import substitution industries at least a temporary respite in coming to terms with enhanced competition from abroad. Greater outward orientation of the economy from 1995 might be an engine of growth, according to the World Bank, though not, it warns of (direct) employment generation. A Bank research paper comes down in favour of a three-pronged approach - fostering growth in a small number of selected subsectors, which sounds suspiciously like picking winners, usually frowned upon in Bank orthodoxy; linking support to export performance; and supporting employment generation. Crucial to employment growth is a shift away from the capital-intensive self-sufficiency, counter-sanctions, investments of the 1970s and 1980s, to smaller-scale, export-oriented, job-intensive investment. A potential snag is the ANC's opposition to Asian-style low-wage, sweat-shop industrialisation. The new government is looking for the best of both worlds - labour-intensity but at wage levels above those found in competitive economies. Naively, in a world in which employment growth has been decoupled from output expansion, the World Bank's best scenario for South Africa assumes a return to capital-labour relationships that existed 25 years ago. Only the optimists believe that this will happen. A more likely outcome is greater job creation in manufacturing, especially the small scale sector, though at nothing like the rate necessary to defuse the unemployment crisis.

First disclosed in AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL, Blaauw's evidence  was  the the subject of a MAIL  GUARDIAN front page story last  week,  which called into question De Klerk's assertion last year that  South Africa had not acquired nuclear weapons technology or  material from another country, or provided another country with  nuclear materials. Reacting to the expose, De Klerk insisted  that South Africa's procurement of 30g of tritium from Israel,  and its provision of yellow cake uranium to Israel, were not  part of collaboration between the countries on nuclear and  conventional weapons.    His statement was endorsed by Atomic Energy Corporation  chief  Waldo Stumpf. Cape Supreme Court documents make it clear that  Blaauw was the government's key intermediary in sensitive  military deals with Israel, including those involving tritium  and yellow cake.    It was General Hendrik van den Bergh, head of the Bureau for  State Security (Boss) who personally asked Blaauw to get  tritium, according to the documents. They note that the 30g  Blaauw ultimately secured ""was sufficient for the manufacture of  12 atomic bombs"".    The tritium shipments were so sensitive that ranking South  African and Israeli officials accompanied the 12 air shipments  of the gaseous substance, and the heads of both governments were  notified each time a shipment was successfully completed,  according to the newly published book CRITICAL MASS by U.S.  journalists William Burrows and Robert Windrem.    Much of what South African officials withheld from the  public  was told to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA), which is charged with verifying the government's  compliance with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. According  to a confidential IAEA document -- it bears the identifying  numbers GOV/2684 and 93-03174 -- South Africa's Atomic Energy  Corporation ""received some tritium in 1977, but after the  withdrawal of a small sample for the verification of its  quality, the material remained in store until 1987"".    During that time, according to the IAEA document, South  Africa was engaged in ""theoretical and practical"" research on  ""lithium-6 separation for the production of tritium for possible  future use in boosted devices"".    The government also did the preliminary engineering work on  a  reactor -- ""to be built at a site at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay""  -- to produce and recover plutonium and tritium, says the IAEA,  repeating information provided by the De Klerk administration.  It adds: ""In September 1985 the South African government  decided to...stop all work related to possible plutonium devices  and to limit the production of lithium-6, but to allow further  development work on implosion technology and theoretical work on  more advanced devices.""    The 1985 date seems compellingly to coincide with the  refusal  of international financial organisations to roll over their  loans to South Africa. It is reasonable to infer that if  sanctions had not started to bite, the South African Government  would have built an advanced nuclear device whose only purpose  could be to attack--or threaten--nations within range of its  surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.    Even after putting its advanced weapons programme on ice,  South Africa kept the tritium for another two years. With  extensive Israeli help, it worked on developing its own versions  of Israel's Jericho missiles.    After the two countries jointly tested a South African  Jericho clone from the Overberg test range in July 1989, U.S.  officials told reporters that one of the several missiles Israel  was helping South Africa develop was intended for delivering  nuclear warheads. Last year De Klerk asserted that South Africa  only planned to make seven crude nuclear weapons and only  intended the six which were actually made as a ""deterrent"".  This purportedly meant testing a bomb in order to blackmail  Washington to save the established order from ""total onslaught"".    At an international conference last weekend to discuss  future  nuclear policy for South Africa, the head of the ANC's [African  National Congress] science and technology department, Roger  Jardine, slammed De Klerk's ""list of lies"" about South Africa's  nuclear weapons programme. He called for the nuclear industry  to be opened to full public scrutiny.     "
0,FT941-5911 ,"FT941-5911 _AN-ECDC4ABMFT 940304   FT  04 MAR 94 / Fund managers watch S African cliff-hanger with bated breath: South Africa is on the threshold of an investment 'third wave'      By MATTHEW CURTIN   A select group of visitors to South Africa with around half a billion dollars to invest are following the country's nail-biting political negotiations with particular interest. They are 28 fund managers from some of the most prominent European and North American investment institutions on a week long tour. They will be seeking the answer to one question above all else: what are the prospects for a stable, post-apartheid South Africa? Signs are that the representatives from New York's Lazard Freres and Merrill Lynch Asset Management, London's IDC International and Toronto's Goodman  Co, among others, have liked what they have heard from minister of finance Derek Keys, the ANC's economics department, the Reserve Bank, and businessmen such as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries (SAB), and Mr Hans Smith, managing director of the steel-maker Iscor. Mr Richard Jesse, at stockbrokers Martin  Co, which arranged the visit, says there is no doubt that even the most cautious foreign investors 'like the concept' of investing in South Africa. A successful outcome to the political negotiations currently under way would remove much of the remaining unease about the country's investment risk. But with elections so close, many will take the attitude that waiting a few weeks more before committing funds 'can do no harm when you have been waiting for 50 years'. When they do take the plunge, South Africa is likely to see indirect foreign investment which will dwarf the sums spent on shares since the lifting of sanctions in September which saw records broken on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. 'The JSE has seen hundreds of millions of rands of foreign money. Now it will see hundreds of millions of dollars,' says Mr Jesse. The change in sentiment is dramatic (only 10 companies accepted Martin  Co's last invitation for a fund managers' visit in October), and has been fuelled by the feverish interest in emerging markets. Mr Miles Moreland of the London-based Blakeney Management, which specialises in discovering 'new' markets, says South Africa is on the threshold of a third wave of offshore share buying. The first wave saw hedge funds and the 'more nimble, unrestricted' investors buy South African shares for much of 1993, and move quickly to take profits this year. Then came the specialist Africa funds such as Morgan Stanley's Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.3m) Africa Investment Fund, and Alliance Capital Management's Dollars 100m Southern African Fund, listed on Wall Street on Friday. Mr Moreland says the more cautious global investors, the large mutual and pension funds, are about to follow. This comes about as much the result of growing confidence in a growing South African economy as the JSE's forthcoming inclusion in the International Finance Corporation's emerging market index and Morgan Stanley International's developing market index. The JSE in one of the world's largest stock markets by capitalisation (about Dollars 170bn) but is under-represented in emerging market portfolios. When the JSE is added to indices by which the performance of share portfolios are judged, emerging market fund managers will have to redirect some of the Dollars 8bn assets they manage to South Africa to ensure they have even exposure to a market which represents at least 10 per cent of the value of all emerging markets. Ms Maria Ramos, an ANC economist, says any increase in indirect investment is welcome, as its improves market liquidity and economic confidence. That will be vital if a new government is to raise new funds on international capital markets. But she points out it does not create jobs. Direct foreign investment will be critical if the estimated 6m unemployed South Africans are to find work. Job creation has risen swiftly this year to the top of the agenda at the National Economic Forum, which links government, business and trade unions. However, as high-profile as the announcement of the return of Industrial Business Machines (IBM), Kodak and Reebok have been, the sums involved with the companies' reinvestment are small. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation (Opic), the US government agency which helps US businesses invest abroad, completed a 10-day visit on Tuesday by announcing a Dollars 75m equity investment fund aimed at black business, and small business partners. Mr Richard Morningstar, an Opic vice-president, says the trip was an 'unqualified success' but admits the agency can only make the smallest, albeit important, contributions to the economy. Even if the political transition proves surprisingly free of violence, and fears of future macro-economic indiscipline are unwarranted, foreign companies contemplating direct investment are entering a competitive domestic market. Mr Jesse says it is easy to say a foreign brewer or pharmaceutical company should be able to rush into South Africa, but large indigenous groups are unlikely to give ground easily to competitors. Foreign investment will be good for stockbrokers' pockets but promises no free ride for the economic planners. See World Stock Markets   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

He emphasised the mission was not designed to raise funds yet, but to pave the way for future funding when appropriate. He said the high-powered roadshow was the first opportunity the government, which took power after the country's first all-race elections in April, had had to go abroad to market the country's policies and philosophy. The officials would use the credit ratings assigned to South Africa in October by American and Japanese risk assessment agencies 'to establish ourselves in the minds of potential investors'. Moody's Investors Service and Nippon Investors Service gave the country investment grade ratings, while Standard  Poor's gave it its top speculative ranking, with a 'positive' outlook. The ratings will enable South Africa to tap a wider range of markets and investors than would otherwise be possible. Mr Liebenberg said three teams of officials would travel to Europe, east Asia and the US. Apart from Mr Liebenberg, they would include Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals, deputy finance minister Alec Erwin, and labour minister Tito Mboweni. The officials would be accompanied by represen- tatives of Goldman, Sachs and Swiss Bank Corporation, which have been named lead managers for the country's first global offering. The national budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year ending in March provided for R1.8bn (Pounds 327m) in possible foreign loans, but Mr Liebenberg said South Africa did not need to borrow abroad to meet the budget.

A White House statement said Mr Clinton had asked Mr Brian Atwood, administrator of the US Agency for International Development, to head the bipartisan delegation including members of Congress and private organisations. The group would try to prevent mass starvation in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Kenya by investigating and then raising and co-ordinating more help from global organisations. 'The crisis in the east Africa region threatens every nation in the region and is caused by drought conditions and civil conflicts,' the White House statement said. 'At this early stage, it is still possible to avoid widespread famine, but an estimated 20m people are currently at risk and may have to leave their homes to search for food.' It said concerted regional and international action two years ago prevented a similar drought in southern Africa from becoming a severe famine. 'Our effort to head off the incipient famine will be both short- and long-term and will help the nations of the region address what have become chronic food shortages.' The delegation is to examine programmes sponsored by the US government and other donors in Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya, and meet heads of state and government representatives. The current delegation will travel to Rome, Geneva, and Brussels to seek increased aid for east Africa. The White House said it would meet officials of the World Food programme, the Food for Agriculture Organisation, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and leaders of the European Union.

A group of passengers called in to tell the Beijing-based  CCTV, China's only national TV station, that they intended to  sue a domestic airline over a delayed flight.    Three days after CCTV covered the issue in a peak-hour  program called ""Focus Moment,"" the Civil Aviation Administration  of China (CAAC) put out new rules for airline companies to  compensate delayed travelers.    ""Focus Moment,"" whose hot-line paging number is publicized  nation-wide, received hundreds of telephone calls from all over  the country.    Zhang Haichao, producer of the program, said that it is one  of the most popular programs in the capital because ordinary  people want to have their own voices on the air.    Like CCTV, all TV and radio stations in Beijing are  government sponsored. Most of them have broadcast phone-in  programs in the past two years, which enjoyed wide popularity  that promises good returns.    Wang Liang, director of the Beijing Communications Radio  Station, said that these programs are encouraged by the  government because they are ""close to the people and to life.""  The government has stipulated that in a market economy, the  media must operate both with good social efficacy and good  economic returns.    Wang, former director of the Beijing Economic Radio Station,  opened the first live phone-in broadcast program in Beijing a  few years ago.    He said that in such a program, the studio speakers are open  to questions from all kinds of people, regardless of the  callers' age, literacy or background.    People found a vent for their anger at some problems in  daily  life through such phone-ins.    Recently, many people called in to the traffic radio station  to complain about chronical traffic jams at a busy fly-over in  west Beijing.    The radio station reported: ""the bridge design is  inefficient,"" and it suggested drivers should go by other  routes. Many people took the advice and the jam at the bridge  improved. The complaints have dropped off.    Most of the radio and TV stations learn in what topic the  audience are most interested through letters and phone calls.  They also do regular or occasional surveys to see what is their  share of the potential audience.    Some hot-line programs are done from the site of an  incident,  so people can get information from the background sounds and  pictures. Sometimes, candid cameras are used to record illicit  activities.    Beijing residents like these programs better than the  others.  A CCTV survey showed that its hot-line program ""Oriental Time  and Space"" has the second slot in audience rating among all its  programs, beaten only by the news.     "

In a statement issued at the end of the 30th African  Development Bank (ADB) and 21st African Development Fund (ADF)  annual meetings in Nairobi, temporary governor for the People's  Bank of China Yin Jieyan said that Africa's development relies  on the unremitting endeavours by the governments and peoples of  African states, but the international community also bears a  significant responsibility for this.    Yin Jieyan, who is also the head of the Chinese delegation  attending the meetings which started officially on Wednesday [11  May], said the founding of the ADB embodies the aspirations of  the African people in pursuing economic independence.    Yin Jieyan said ADB in the past 30 years has surmounted  various difficulties in her efforts to promote the industrial  and agricultural development on the African Continent, to  improve the living standard of the African people, and to  enhance the close cooperation among its member countries.    He noted that for promoting the economic development in  Africa, the ADB had adopted positive policies, including forest  development and population control.    Referring to difficulties the African countries are facing  in  economic development, Yin Jieyan said Africa has been developing  at a low speed for several years, the balance of payments has  shown a sustained deficit, the terms of trade have been  deteriorating further, the debt service ratio has exceeded 25  percent in several consecutive years. Other difficulties  include the natural disasters and trade protectionism of the  Western countries, he said.    On China's commitment to the African Continent, the head of  Chinese delegation said while developing her domestic economy,  China has never forgotten her duty to support Africa's economic  development. ""China is ready to continue making due  contributions to Africa's economic development through the ADB  and ADF, which we consider the most important financial  institutions in Africa,"" he added.

Moreover, officials of Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola assert that at least some of the withdrawing Cuban  troops have been sent to nearby African countries instead of returning to Cuba.    Jardo Muekalia, chief of UNITA's Washington office, said that U.N. verification  of the accord, signed Dec. 22, is so lax that President Fidel Castro's Cuban  government can violate it at any time.    ""The accords will not be carried out unless the verification mechanism does its  job,"" Muekalia said in an interview.

He said that the Havana government describes the action as ""normal  rotation"" of its forces.

At the very least, he said, the  rotation will make it far more difficult to determine the pace of the Cuban  withdrawal.

At a speech delivered to the chamber of commerce of Belgium  and Luxembourg and the ACP states (Africa, Caribbean and the  Pacific), he stressed that (black) Africa was changing and the  continent's image as the ""black"" continent which it had until a  few years ago no longer corresponded to the reality of the  situation.    The Zambian president, who peacefully succeeded Mr. Kenneth  Kaunda following elections in 1991, an almost unique event in  Africa, has been on a three-day visit to Belgium since  Wednesday, during which he is to meet European Community  officials.    Mr. Chiluba, a former trade unionist, added that ""new  leaders"" and ""new regimes"" had appeared, who were asking for  time in order to continue with democratization.    ""The best way of helping us in this matter is by investing  in  my country,"" he added.    Mr. Chiluba believes that Zambia now possesses a pluralist  political system. ""I could be beaten at the next elections,"" he  stressed.    The Zambian president also affirmed that his government had  been insisting on the privatization of the economy since 1991.  ""Previously"" (under the regime of the single party of the left,  editor's note) it had been 80 percent nationalized. Other  priorities are the fight against inflation and investments in  roads and education.    Mr. Chiluba was received by King Albert II on Thursday  morning. Following a meeting with the ambassadors of the ACP  states, he met in the afternoon with European Commission  President Jacques Delors.

But today, as SWAPO sits on the verge of realizing its dream in Namibia's first  free and democratic elections, the rhetoric of war has given way to the  practicalities of politics.    SWAPO leaders still call each other ""comrade,"" reiterate their devotion to  socialism and promise a redistribution of wealth from the mostly white  landholders to the black masses. But, having seen Africa littered with failed  Marxist policies, they have promised a mixed economy, freedom of speech, no  mass nationalization and protection for the property of whites who want to  stay.    ""Our policy is to leave the sad history behind us, to adopt a much more  flexible approach and to write our future on a clean sheet of paper,"" says  SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, the bearded leader who has spent half his 60 years  in exile. His efforts will be watched closely in neighboring South Africa,  especially by whites who fear that a black government in Pretoria would usher  in communism and force them out.    SWAPO is heavily favored to win at least a majority in the five-day Namibian  elections, which ended Saturday. Initial results are expected to be announced  late today. Ten political parties have been vying for power in the  U.N.-supervised elections, and SWAPO needs a two-thirds majority to control the  72-seat constituent assembly and write a new constitution for Namibia.    No one knows for sure what SWAPO will do with the new power. Although Nujoma's  chief aides hold advanced degrees in political science from American and  European universities, they have no practical experience in government. Until  last June, in fact, SWAPO was only a liberation movement with a dream. Now it  is a political party with a constituency to keep happy and, perhaps soon, a  country to run.    The Marxist principles to which SWAPO held fast for so long have been dated by  recent ideological changes in the Soviet Union. And today, African countries  founded on Marxist principles, from Angola to Mozambique and Ghana to Tanzania,  are embracing free-market solutions to their economic troubles.    This may be the first and last multi-party election in Namibia. SWAPO has long  favored a one-party state, believing that the Western model of multi-party  democracy does not work in developing African countries. But Nujoma also has  said he would consult with all other parties in mapping the country's future.    ""If SWAPO doesn't turn us into a Communist nation, we'll be OK,"" said Anton  Ferreira, a white Namibian who waited in line more than six hours to vote on  the first of five days of balloting last week.    A white woman standing nearby added: ""If SWAPO wins, people are going to get  used to standing in lines like this.""    Despite its talk of unity and conciliation, SWAPO's history of planting land  mines on white farmers' land and allegations that it tortured black Namibians  believed to be spies has made many here wary.    SWAPO's foreign affairs chief, Theo-Ben Gurirab, says the organization  regretted the torture. But others, including Nujoma himself, have not been  penitent.    ""I'm not regretting anything,"" Nujoma said as voters went to the polls. ""We  lost hundreds of our comrades in the war because of information those traitors  supplied to South African troops. Do you think we were stupid enough to let  them carry on?""    Nevertheless, SWAPO now says it wants to establish a bill of human rights for  Namibia. And Nujoma says the fighters of his People's Liberation Army, who  surrendered their arms to return to Namibia for the elections, will form the  basis of a small national army designed only for defense.    Few of the country's 80,000 whites, who account for less than 10% of the  population but own 65% of the land, relish the prospect of a SWAPO government.  But many agree with SWAPO that South Africa has siphoned off much of Namibia's  wealth over the years.    ""We've been exploited by South Africa for 75 years, why not give Sam Nujoma a  chance,"" said J. P. D. Blaauw, a retired brigadier in the South African air  force. Blaauw, who lived in Namibia as a child, flew from South Africa last  week to vote and said he plans to move here permanently after independence.    SWAPO will face many of the same logistical problems that South Africa has  faced in trying to administer the territory, which is twice the size of  California, with a dozen ethnic groups and only 1.3 million people, 60% of them  illiterate. To help the South African administration stage the first one-man,  one-vote national elections in the vast, rugged landscape, the United Nations  had to bring in more than 7,000 peacekeeping troops, police monitors, election  supervisors and administrative workers.    An independent government in Namibia will have to accept, at least at first,  its economic links with South Africa, whose government it calls the ""apartheid  colonialists."" About 90% of its exports go to South Africa and three-fourths of  imports, mostly food, come from there.    Its primary port city, Walvis Bay, will remain a South African enclave even  after independence.    SWAPO has promised over the years to redistribute the country's resources and  exert more centralized control over the economy. The main target for land  redistribution is whites, especially foreign absentee landlords.    ""There are white farmers here who own up to 20 farms. That is a crime,"" Hidipo  Hamutenya, SWAPO's chief spokesman, says. ""They will be asked to choose the one  they like best and give the rest to the people.""    But SWAPO leaders also have said that farmers using their land effectively and  producing food for the country will be left alone. And they say no land will be  confiscated without negotiation with the owners.    SWAPO is counting on the country's reserve of diamonds, uranium and other  minerals, which now make up 75% of foreign exchange earnings, to help it  improve the schools, health care and housing of black Namibians.    Although it once believed in nationalizing the mining industry, SWAPO now says  it intends to negotiate new contracts with the mining companies. It  specifically has said that the companies will be required to reinvest ""a  substantial part"" of their profits in Namibia.    The mining companies, which currently have a tax rate of 60%, doubt they can  afford to pay more. But they believe Namibia's mineral potential has been  largely untapped and that more mining companies will be lured here if trade  sanctions against Pretoria, which still extend to Namibia, are lifted.    SWAPO's biggest headache, though, may be dealing with the raised expectations  of the black masses, most of whom are landless and 30% jobless.    ""We will educate the people that independence is not a panacea, that they will  have to work hard and produce,"" Hage Geingob, SWAPO's election director,  recently told the South African magazine Leadership. ""It would be a serious  mistake to believe that independence is the time for people to make big claims  on the state.""

The show of solidarity was to have begun with  a rally addressed by ANC President Nelson Mandela and Namibian  President Sam Nujoma in Windhoek on January 27, but Mr Mandela  cancelled his visit. ANC spokesman Gill Marcus said the ANC  President had other engagements.    SWAPO Secretary-General Moses Garoeb said senior ANC and  SWAPO officials would address meetings and rallies across  Namibia to raise money for the ANC's election coffers. He said  SWAPO's support for the ANC was part of the responsibility it  felt towards South Africa. SWAPO was confident of, and hoped for  an ANC landslide victory and felt a need to contribute in the  same way the ANC had helped SWAPO to victory in the 1989  Namibian elections.    Mr Garoeb said SWAPO believed the ANC, with its ""pragmatic  and experienced leadership"", was the party best structured to  manage a post-election South Africa and keep southern Africa  stable.    Money would be raised at SWAPO branch and regional level in  cooperation with the National Union of Namibian Workers. Mr  Garoeb appealed to all South Africans living in Namibia to  register and vote for the ANC on April 27.    In an editorial on Monday, the Windhoek Advertiser warned  that SWAPO's support for the ANC risked drawing Namibia into a  partisan role in a potential future civil war. ""In the event of  a troubled South Africa plunging into civil strife of  proportions where factions go over to guerrilla war and  unrestricted sabotage, Namibia will not be spared. Our  allegiance with the ANC will under such circumstances be on the  debit side of Namibia's interests,"" wrote editor Hannes Smith.    Mr Garoeb dismissed Mr Smith's comment as the ""cry-baby  attitude and professional negativism from a confirmed pessimist""  who could not see anything good about the SWAPO government.     "

Nelson Mandela talks about the  obstacles that the new South African democracy encounters in its  path: the white extremists and the black ones. He promises to  practice an ""open-door policy"" toward the international  community, without ""tyrannizing"" investors. Pre-election  opinion polls give the ANC 60 percent of the votes.    [Emiliani] Mr. Chairman, apartheid in South Africa is  officially dead. The blacks have finally gained admission to  the transitional government whose task is to organize the first  free general election, to be held on 27 April. And yet the  enemies of peace and democracy in the country seem to be  multiplying. Who are the die-hards?    [Mandela] The toughest opposition to the transitional  government currently comes from Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha  Freedom Party and some of its fellow members of the Freedom  Alliance. They sit at the negotiating table with us and do  nothing but pursue an ""all or nothing"" tactic. Inkatha above  all does not favor mediation, whereas the ANC -- the African  National Congress -- has made mediation the rule so that as many  sides as possible may be involved in the negotiations and the  greatest number of political demands can be taken into account.  Believe me, we are doing all we can to stop Inkatha and the  other parties in the Freedom Alliance from walking out of the  negotiations, now and again going far beyond the limits that we  had set, just to keep the negotiations open.    [Emiliani] But the opposition in South Africa is now an  armed opposition, and violence is spreading throughout the  country. Which do you consider the more dangerous: the  extremism of the whites, the hard-liners who want a return to  apartheid, or that of the more radical black groups?    [Mandela] The African National Congress has never refused to  talk to the right-wing groups, Inkatha and the Afrikaner  People's Front included. As far as we have been able to  establish, some of the leaders of the Afrikaner People's Front  are inclined to be reasonable and are perfectly aware how  dangerous it is to threaten civil war at the drop of a hat. Our  discussions with them have been fruitful, and we are  understanding one another better. Unfortunately, I cannot say  the same of our talks with Inkatha. At times we come out of the  negotiations with Buthelezi's party with the distinct feeling  that we have made not the slightest step forward in mutual  understanding. Nevertheless, we shall continue talking with  Inkatha in the hope of persuading them to take part in the  negotiating process again, and above all in the election on 27  April.    [Emiliani] So what point have the transitional government's  negotiations with the parties forming the Freedom Alliance  reached?    [Mandela] As such, the transitional government, or rather  the transitional executive council, is not negotiating with the  Freedom Alliance. It is a structure conceived under the interim  constitution to organize and monitor the election, an election  that must be free and fair. The negotiations involve all the  parties and organizations forming the transitional executive  council, which have made some, albeit still inadequate, progress  in the course of the negotiations. We are doing our best to  speed things up, but there are limits beyond which we cannot go,  issues on which we cannot compromise, such as the date of the  election itself, which is set for 27 April.    [Emiliani] What is the ANC in particular doing in this  connection?    [Mandela] The ANC's role in the negotiations is absolutely  central. We are the guardians of the mediation process, and we  are conducting it in the most all-inclusive manner, placing the  interests of South Africa above any party interest.    [Emiliani] The more radical black groups, too, are raising  difficulties and rejecting the negotiations. How are relations  between the ANC and the Pan-African Congress at the moment?    [Mandela] We are both liberation movements. There are  obviously differences between us, but we are working together as  partners in the mediation process. We are pleased that the  Pan-African Congress has decided to take part in the 27 April  election.    [Emiliani] And what about relations between the ANC and  AZAPO, the Azanian People's Organization?    [Mandela] Our relations with AZAPO, too, take account of  the fact that we are both organizations working for the  liberation of the oppressed black people of South Africa.  However, we are different organizations, and the ANC is  exterting strong pressure on AZAPO to fight the election.  However, the fact that it has decided to boycott it does not  detract from its being an organization working for liberation.    [Emiliani] According to the latest opinion polls, the ANC  could win over 60 percent of the votes on 27 April. What is  your economic program, what are your priorities once you are in  government?    [Mandela] The opinion polls and the meetings that we are  holding all over South Africa so that people can inform the ANC  of their needs all point to the most sensitive issues being  unemployment, the housing shortage, lack of education, and  inadequate healthcare provision. As a people's liberation  movement, in other words a movement that sets out to meet the  people's needs, these are also the ANC's priorities.    [Emiliani] How have the business world and the international  economic community, reacted to the transitional government? Are  they showing confidence in South Africa?    [Mandela] I hope with all my heart that they start to  believe in South Africa again. Since the ANC's appeal to the  United Nations to repeal sanctions, the response has been  favorable, and the Johannesburg stock exchange has recently  shown a considerable increase in the volume of trade. Some  major international companies are still put off by the spread of  violence, but I am confident that as soon as we manage to create  a true democracy and take measures capable of putting an end to  the violence, we shall be able to create the conditions required  to attract further investment.    [Emiliani] What sort of policy does the ANC intend to pursue  toward foreign companies?    [Mandela] An open-door policy that avoids ""tyrannizing""  investors. What I mean is that we believe foreign investments  must not be penalized by over-restrictive currency regulations  and that the best way to attract them to South Africa is to give  companies a wider range of investment opportunities. We should  also like to see investment directed increasingly toward our  country's emerging black business class, which apartheid has  kept on the sidelines for a long time.    [Emiliani] One last question, Mr. Chairman. In your heart  of hearts, to whom have you dedicated your Nobel peace prize,  apart from the South African people?    [Mandela] You are right in saying that the courageous, long-  suffering South African people, deserves the Nobel peace prize.  Apart from South Africa, I believe that the president of the  Palestine Liberation Organization, Yasser Arafat, and the  Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, deserve it for the effort  that they are making to bring peace to the Middle East.

0,FT943-2092 ,"FT943-2092 _AN-EIUDKACTFT 940921   FT  21 SEP 94 / Management: Capitalism on the steppes - Kenneth Gooding visits a Kazakhstan gold mine - one of the first to use western-style business techniques      BY KENNETH GOODING   This is a country where you discover that the office manager is a prominent heart surgeon. He can no longer afford to follow his profession because it does not pay enough to support him and his family. This is a country where the plant has a 'vodka room' rather than a vending machine dispensing tea and coffee. With vodka costing the equivalent of 5 cents for a full-strength bottle, it is a cheap perk. This is a country where prices have risen 20 fold since 1989 so there are not enough bank notes to go round. For the past six months most public-sector workers have instead been given vouchers to exchange for food and other essentials. Sometimes cheques are issued to top up the vouchers. But the local banks do not have any money to honour them. This is Kazakhstan, once part of the former Soviet Union. Mark Wilson, who has worked for mining companies in many western countries, says managing in Kazakhstan is different from anything he has previously experienced. He found it difficult to adjust to the fact that while people were well educated - it is claimed that the literacy rate in Kazakhstan is higher than in the US - they had not been taught to show initiative or be willing to take responsibility. Set Kazakhs a target and they will attempt to achieve it, even when common sense suggests that pressing on regardless could have costly, even disastrous, results. For example, at first Wilson found his employees would keep a machine running at full stretch to achieve production targets, ignoring all warning signs that it needed attention until it ground to a noisy halt. It was also impossible to persuade any Kazakh to admit mistakes. Wilson recalls one frustrating conversation with a group of employees after something had gone wrong. 'Ok, who stuffed it?' he inquired. All heads were shaken. He said: 'Well, it couldn't have been me, I was in bed.' They brightened. 'Ah] Then you must have dreamt it.' After decades of Communist rule, when everyone was promised cradle-to-grave care, many Kazakhs do not understand the western approach to work, Wilson suggests. 'Why bother to turn up for work on time and why stay sober after lunch when you get the same treatment and pay, no matter what?' The first time he fired someone for persistent lateness and drunkenness, policemen were at his door early the next day to tell him he could do no such thing. Wilson had a hard time convincing them that the man was working for a privatised company and could be fired. Wilson is project manager at the Bakyrchik Gold joint venture, one of the first in Kazakhstan to involve western capital and management. For the past year he has overseen the installation of new process plant to extract gold from the ore at the Bakyrchik gold mine, on Kazakhstan's north-eastern steppes, 1,000km from the capital Almaty. In the past, Russian metallurgists had tried various ways to extract the gold without success. They settled for sending the ore to nearby copper smelters so the gold could add value to the concentrate they produced. But this meant that the arsenic in the Bakyrchik ore went up the smelter chimneys into the atmosphere. Wilson applies western psychology when attempting to instill the 'fair day's work for a fair day's pay' concept. He suggests that if you have to fire a Kazakh employee, it is a good idea to wait until he or she has collected a first pay packet at the end of the month. That way the employee knows what rewards are available provided the rules are followed. Bakyrchik joint venture employees are paid cash, not vouchers. They earn an average of Dollars 100 (Pounds 64) a month, which in theory is about 20 per cent more than the gold miners who are still employed by the state precious metals organisation. But the miners are having to make do with vouchers. Many of them cannot wait for the time when the joint venture takes over the mine as well. Wilson is helping to spread the capitalist message. Already about 20 per cent of the joint venture employees have been persuaded of the benefits of having savings accounts in local banks and regularly deposit 70 per cent of their earnings in them (personal tax rates are very low). As there is little to buy in the small town of Auezov, the frontier town next to the mine, Wilson arranges buses to take employees to Semipalatinsk two hours away by road, where there are at least a few goods in the shops or on sale in the markets. The relative affluence of the joint venture employees has divided the local community. Those who work for the western-managed company are given the cold shoulder by the rest of the town. Recruiting is a problem because local people are not used to the idea that they can be fired if they do not perform adequately. Wilson used to ask an employee who had been working well if he or she had a friend who might be interested in joining the joint venture. That does not work any more because, when newcomers did not meet requirements and were fired, they frequently blamed the friend who recommended them for the job. The venture needs two more drivers, Wilson says, and he knows his personal driver has two out-of-work brothers with driving licences. But his driver will not ask his brothers if they would like to join Bakyrchik. 'He says that if they do not measure up and I have to fire one or both of them, I will be angry with him,' says Wilson. There have been some cost benefits to operating in Kazakhstan, according to Wilson. Some tanks in the new plant are made of titanium, bought at a cost of Dollars 16 a kilo compared with the Dollars 110 it would have cost to have them delivered from the US. The joint venture's ball mill was bought locally for Dollars 93,000 compared with the Dollars 650,000 it would have cost in the west. On the other hand, Wilson points out: 'A light bulb you could buy in the west for a few pennies costs Dollars 10. And it is impossible to get a toothbrush here, or a toilet roll.'

[passage omitted]    [Havel] I would like to say that the principle of civic  disobedience as such is a respectable form of defense by a group  of citizens in the conditions of a dictatorship, apartheid, and  so forth. In my view there is neither room, motive, nor logical  reason for such a principle of disobedience in a democracy where  power has really come from the people -- in free elections.    It also strikes me as somewhat alarming that this view is  voiced by an official of the party which has on many occasions  throughout its history proved its opposition to democracy. I  wonder if this appeal is not a harking back to the communist  methods of conquering power.    [Tamchyna] I hope it will not sound too lofty if I say that  all the world's eyes have over the past few days been focused  primarily on the Republic of South Africa [RSA], where the first  multiracial elections are over and the results known, and  probably no one expected those results and the new division of  political forces to solve all the problems of the Republic of  South Africa. My question is probably something like this: Will  the new political structure of the Republic of South Africa be  able to appreciate the concept of democracy not only in terms of  its advantages and rights but also with all the duties and  responsibilities it entails?    [Havel] The process of national liberation and extrication  from white domination is a logical, legitimate, and lawful one  which has taken place throughout the world, and I think that the  fall of apartheid in the Republic of South Africa is cause for  universal delight. The Republic of South Africa naturally faces  a difficult time ahead. All countries which freed themselves  from colonial domination have experienced and are still  experiencing difficult times, but they probably do have to pass  through this phase.    Since you are asking me, I would like to take the  opportunity  to praise the achievements of President de Klerk, who at one  time paid an official visit to our country during which we  talked at length. He really is a courageous man. He has made a  decisive contribution to these changes. He was well aware that  after putting into effect the changes he is now instituting and  which he considers to be right, he would lose the presidential  office. But he put justice before his own position. I think he  is a man who deserves worldwide recognition and who was rightly  awarded the Nobel prize. By this I do not mean to say that  Nelson Mandela did not deserve it. All that remains for me to  wish him is that, if he is indeed elected president at the  beginning of next week, he might lead his country wisely through  the period which awaits it.

Mr.  Agboyibor's Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] has decided to  suspend its participation in the electoral campaign in protest  against the assassination of three of its members, including a  deputy who was elected in the first round of the elections. The  CAR will not rescind its decision unless the security of its  members is totally guaranteed. Olabire da Cruz, who is in Lome,  explains the issue to Africa No. 1.    [Begin Cruz recording] Confirming the decision made by his  party's steering committee following a long meeting, CAR  Chairman Yaovi Agboyibor stated that this suspension will remain  in force until security is guaranteed for all candidates.  According to him, this is not possible for two of them at  present. Already, by early yesterday evening, the CAR's  decision was rather foreseeable, especially as this party and  its ally, Edem Kojo's party, had withdrawn from the state media  program arranged by the Ad Hoc Audiovisual Communications  Commission for 14 February. The Rally of the Togolese People,  the former single ruling party, therefore participated in the  program alone. All the same, it will not be surprising to see  CAR rescind its decision very rapidly.    Meanwhile, after vehemently condemning last weekend's  assassinations, the International Committee for Monitoring the  Ouagadougou Agreement did not hide its concern and fear for the  consequences that this act may have on the democratic process.  It therefore appealed for the restoration of confidence among  the various parties and hoped that security measures will be  taken as soon as possible.    Similarly, the Togolese Armed Forces [FAT] categorically  denied any implication in last weekend's assassinations. In a  statement, the FAT headquarters said that immediately a group of  people in military uniform does anything wrong, some  ill-intentioned and unscrupulous voices are raised and attribute  this to the security forces. A strong warning was sounded to  all those who use military uniforms to commit reproachful acts  in a bid to stain the honor of the Army. [end recording]     "

Several banks have been interviewed. Mr Etienne Calitz, director-general of the department of finance, said yesterday the multi-party Transitional Executive Council (TEC), which is in charge of government policy leading up to next month's elections, had compiled a shortlist of candidates. He declined to name the banks involved. However, they are thought to include First Boston, Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, J. P. Morgan and Salomon Brothers. The first task of the successful applicant will be to guide the new government through the delicate process of obtaining a credit rating from the two leading international rating agencies, Moody's and Standard  Poor's. Discussions with the agencies are expected to begin once the elections are over. South Africa is thought to be keen to obtain an investment-grade rating, as this would facilitate its access to the international bond market and to the Yankee market, the US domestic bond market for foreign borrowers. An investment-grade rating would also reduce South Africa's funding costs and allow a broader range of investors to buy its bonds. The adviser will be selected by the technical committee of the TEC's finance sub-council, which has the responsibility of drawing up a foreign loan finance strategy for the new government. The first foreign debt issue of a new government will be an important test of international confidence in South Africa's new administration, and of the ANC's economic policy in particular, given its likely victory in the April elections.

0,FT942-10568 ,"FT942-10568 _AN-EEJC9AD1FT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Leading Article: School testing   The government's proposals for streamlining the national curriculum in English schools, published yesterday, have been welcomed by teachers and educationalists. Mr John Patten, education secretary, has broadly accepted the reforms recommended by Sir Ron Dearing, his astute curriculum adviser. It remains to be seen, however, whether he can deliver the other half of the package: comprehensive and objective testing to ensure that all children achieve higher educational standards. In line with Sir Ron's recommendations, the new national curriculum aims to fill no more than 80 per cent of school time for most children. It is closely focused on basic skills such as literacy and numeracy. The controversial technology curriculum has also been revised to emphasise the importance of work skills and specify a coherent body of knowledge. There remain, however, disquieting signs of Mr Patten's recurrent desire to harness schools to populist causes. The streamlined curriculum gives greater weight to team games and competitive sports, even for older children who might prefer fitness activities or individual pursuits. And Mr Patten's repeated interference in sex education has irritated health professionals who say that his guidelines will do nothing to curb the growth in teenage pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases. This penchant for publicity-grabbing initiatives alienates teachers and alarms parents. And it unnecessarily draws education into short-term political controversy. That makes it harder to win acceptance for the curriculum proposals which are essential to raising the quality of education. Successive reports have indicated the failure of English schools to equip a large minority of school-leavers with even basic skills. Inspectors' reports too often find that pupils are not sufficiently challenged by the teaching they receive, particularly in inner-city schools. Getting the curriculum right is only one step in addressing these shortcomings, however. It is just as important to ensure that schools are teaching the new curriculum properly. The new independent schools inspectorate can contribute to that with its more frequent inspections and well-publicised reports to parents. Equally important is the regular testing of schoolchildren to see whether they are reaching satisfactory standards. Yet testing remains disrupted by a boycott by the National Union of Teachers, the largest teachers' union. The boycott is largely ideological in motive - it is against the principle of objective, external testing. Unlike last year, it is opposed by unions representing the majority of teachers. Yet this year's tests appear to have been severely disrupted by the minority's action. Mr Patten's priority now must be to restore momentum to the testing programme so that parents and employers can have confidence that the national curriculum is more than just good intention.

0,FT941-7981 ,"FT941-7981 _AN-EBVDKAF5FT 940222   FT  22 FEB 94 / Technology: Africa's need to keep in touch - Technically Speaking      By EMMANUEL OHAJAH   To communicate with my sister Joyce in North Carolina is simple. l can telephone from a public call box using a plastic card. l can send her a fax. When l was a student, l would use electronic mail. Soon, l will be able to talk to Joyce face-to-face, using the latest in video-conferencing systems. We can share access to current real-time and on-line communication systems, such as Internet. To communicate with Esi, my uncle in Lagos, is much harder. Although Nigeria is one of the most advanced African nations, communicating can be difficult. Even in the most cosmopolitan places there can be problems. In April 1992, the international phone service connecting the Ivory Coast, Nigeria and Europe was down for nearly a week. In fact, there is a distinct feeling of remoteness whenever I try to contact my Nigerian relatives. Nigeria, like many developing countries, is not part of the new communications order. Along with many others in the west, I enjoy the latest in communications technology. Most Nigerians, however, do not have easy access to a telephone or computer - never mind the infrastructure of a modern global communications network. In the west, the humble telephone is taken for granted. In Africa, the few that do exist are expensive to use. Cheap local calls are an important feature of western countries, while international rates, although pricey, are within the budgets of most people. By comparison, local calls in most African countries are expensive. The other building block of today's information technology (IT) revolution is the personal computer. The PC is a window to the modern communications world; but it is difficult to talk of a 'personal' computer in the African context. For example, Zimbabwe, a relatively developed African country, has only 10,000 microcomputers. In Zambia, a PC would cost six years' wages. The 1993 edition of Telegeography, which tracks communications around the world, reveals their uneven global distribution. Tunisia has the only Internet host computer in Africa (excluding South Africa). In the entire African continent, only South Africa appears under Telegeography's national telecommunication indicators. The rest of Africa is so lacking in telephone lines, Internet host computers, mobile phones and fax machines that it does not even feature. At a time when IT is becoming integral to every area of western society, there is a danger that the developing countries will become further marginalised and impoverished. In all the fervour that greets each new advance in communications technology, the very partial application of IT in Africa has, in effect, created a digital fence around many of its regions. Instead of helping the developing countries overcome the gap between north and south, IT appears to be applied in a way that will cut them off from the more advanced economy of the developed nations. Yet during the 1950s and 1960s, communication technologies were seen as an essential counterpoint to decolonisation. Radio, telecommunications and television were supposed to assist in restructuring unequal relations between north and south. The US, after the Cold War, no longer feels the need to win hearts and minds in developing countries. Although South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are eagerly being plugged into the global networks by multinational companies, Africa is largely an IT desert. We are witnessing the creation of a new, more marginalised 'Third World'. This is a great shame because, potentially, IT could be used to close the gap with the developed world. Computers, perhaps provided under international investment programmes, could help to develop more modern industries or generate models for better understanding of climatology to help improve agricultural production.

In the next few weeks the chancellor can expect the usual pre-Budget avalanche of special pleading. This year, much of that pleading will be aimed at preventing an extension of VAT to more goods and services. The public will not escape the propaganda either. On buses, at airports, railway stations and in shops, the battle to fend off VAT on fares and the printed word is well under way. Among the most active campaigners is British Airways, which fears it could lose up to 500,000 passengers. Last week BA executives went to the Conservative party conference in Blackpool to press the airline's case to MPs and ministers. They pointed out that if VAT is applied at the full rate on air fares, a typical business return fare from London to Glasgow would rise by Pounds 40. Leaders of the Periodical Publishers Association were also present to warn ministers of the effect on education and literacy of a tax on the printed word. The association last week published a special edition of Magazine News devoted to VAT. It has also launched a national advertising campaign to reinforce publishers' claims that imposing the full VAT rate on magazines would cost more than 4,000 jobs and close as many as 1,700 titles. The newspaper industry is mounting its second national campaign in eight years against VAT on newspapers. The industry calculates that 245 local and regional papers would close which, it points out, could deprive some MPs of the most important constituency outlet for their views. The books sector, too, is putting up a fight. The National Book Committee, representing authors, booksellers and publishers, says the imposition of VAT would cut book sales by 5 per cent while raising only a 'paltry' Pounds 270m in tax revenue. Mr Tim Godfray, chief executive of the Booksellers Association, says 3,500 sales outlets have been asked to join an anti-VAT campaign. In spite of the political sensitivities, the prospect of VAT on children's clothes and some food items has not been ruled out. The British Retail Consortium, representing high street traders, will restate its views to Mr Clarke when it meets him this month. The overriding need for Mr Clarke to seek new sources of revenue means that all the arguments against the extension of VAT may fall on deaf ears. The best chance opponents have of winning the day may lie in the government's slim majority and the apparent readiness of some Tory backbenchers to spoil ministers' best-laid plans.

AFRICA BLACKS, STUDENTS PROTEST ON EVE OF VOTE      By SCOTT KRAFT, Times Staff Writer      JOHANNESBURG, South Africa      Police using whips and dogs broke up a protest march Tuesday in the sleepy  white college town of Stellenbosch, and hundreds of thousands of voteless  blacks nationwide began a two-day strike on the eve of elections that will be  the most severe test of white support for the government since it came to power  41 years ago.    South African whites will cast ballots today in parliamentary elections that  have been upstaged internationally by attempts to crush a monthlong black  defiance campaign organized to discredit the voting and protest apartheid laws  and police curbs on peaceful protest.    Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk's National Party is favored to extend its  rule for five more years with a slim majority in the controlling white chamber  of Parliament, which includes less powerful houses for mixed-race Coloreds and  Indians but no representation for blacks.      Could Lose Quarter of Seats    The National Party's own leaders predict that it could lose up to a fourth of  its seats to the right-wing Conservative Party and the liberal Democratic  Party. Such a swing would affect De Klerk's pledge to lead the country away  from the ""distrust, suspicion and fear"" that grip white and black South  Africans.    At stake in the elections is the pace of reform in South Africa, where 26  million blacks are ruled by 5 million whites under the system of racial  segregation called apartheid.    Many blacks consider the elections meaningless, and the call for workers and  students to stay away capped a campaign of civil disobedience that has touched  off dozens of bloody confrontations with the police, 1,600 arrests and, the  government says, 70 unrest-related deaths.    ""Any political activity that ignores black people is doomed,"" said Anglican  Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who has been  arrested twice in the past week. ""The driving force of change in this country  lies among the disenfranchised, not in Parliament.""    On Tuesday, police dispersed more than 500 white students and black workers who  marched from the University of Stellenbosch, the alma mater of most of South  Africa's white leaders, to the center of that town in the lush wine country  near Cape Town. Demonstrators ran screaming through the streets when the police  unleashed dogs. Some protesters were beaten with whips, and dozens were  arrested.    In Pietermaritzburg, 450 college students and faculty members were arrested in  a similar march, organized to present a petition calling for an end to police  violence against peaceful protest.      Predict Spread of Strike    Black union leaders predicted that the worker strike would spread today, and  most black, mixed-race and Indian students across the country were boycotting  classes as well.    In an open letter to De Klerk on Tuesday, the Mass Democratic Movement, a loose  affiliation of most anti-apartheid groups in the country, said the elections  ""still symbolize apartheid and the perpetuation of white minority rule. We  therefore demand that our right to peaceful protest be respected. . . .""    The Mass Democratic Movement began the defiance campaign Aug. 2, when 270  ailing blacks sought treatment at whites-only hospitals. Since then, it has  targeted whites-only beaches and schools as well as state-of-emergency laws  that prohibit most anti-government activity from meetings to marches.    Meetings in churches were generally allowed by the government until Monday,  when riot police blocked the doors of two churches in downtown Cape Town and  arrested a dozen leading clerics, including Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, the  mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches. They were  released after a few hours in jail.      Tutu Reconsecrates Cathedral    Tutu reconsecrated his cathedral Tuesday, telling parishioners that the police,  in ""a scandalous breach of religious liberty . . . sank to new depths when they  desecrated my cathedral.""    The government has attempted to justify its crackdown by contending that the  defiance campaign is orchestrated by the outlawed African National Congress to  violently disrupt the elections. However, defiance leaders say they are using  nonviolent protests to highlight the plight of the black majority.    Although the escalating unrest has sullied South Africa's image overseas, many  political analysts believe it may actually help the National Party in the  elections by driving whites fearful of a black revolution away from the more  liberal Democratic Party.    However, it may also slightly boost the far-right Conservative Party, which  says the unrest is an example of the trouble the government can expect if it  makes good on promises to dismantle apartheid.      Controls 123 of 166 Seats    The National Party now controls 123 of the 166 seats at stake in the white  chamber of Parliament, while the Conservatives have 22 seats and the Democrats  20. National Party leaders concede that they may lose 20 to 30 seats, reducing  their majority from the current 74% to as low as 56%.    Government opponents have predicted an even greater swing of seats, which would  create a ""hung Parliament"" in which no party has an outright majority. In that  case, the National Party would be forced to form an alliance with the right or  the left, analysts say.    The Conservatives' platform calls for stricter enforcement of apartheid and the  partitioning of South Africa into separate white and black states. The  Democrats support a one-person, one-vote system that would bring blacks into  government on an equal footing with whites.    The National Party, which came to power in 1948 on a platform of strict racial  segregation, has sought the political middle ground. While De Klerk remains  committed to racially segregated schools, hospitals and residential areas, he  has promised to start negotiations with black leaders and draw up a new  constitution to share power but prevent ""black domination.""      Voting for All 3 Houses    The voting is for all three houses of Parliament, the white chamber as well as  smaller chambers representing the country's 3 million mixed-race Coloreds and 1  million Indians.    Black leaders have declined to endorse any party.    ""The elections are a non-issue,"" said Hilda Ndude, Western Cape publicity  secretary for the United Democratic Front, the 2-million-member anti-apartheid  coalition banned from political activity.    ""We've got our own program of action, election or no election,"" Ndude said in  an interview. ""There's no difference between the parties. Things will still be  the same.""

It also follows on the U. S. President's  earlier initiative to encourage his private sector to invest in  the new South Africa. It is therefore clear that the Clinton  administration is busy putting words into action and reaching  out a helping hand as no recent U. S. administration has done.  This -- hopefully with the enthusiastic support of the G- 7  countries -- could provide the spark which the South African  economic engine desperately needs, and which could eventually  contribute to sustained growth. This new, constructive approach  is most welcome.""

BEELD  continues: ""These words by Bishop Tutu encapsulate the positive  new dynamic which is moving into so many areas of South African  society."" ""That Bishop Tutu can now, together with all South  Africans, speak of `our police' is not due to changes to the  force, but is due to the birth of the new constitutional  dispensation. The police are no longer enforcing the laws of a  minority government, but of a generally accepted government of  all South Africa. There is still a long road ahead for the  development of real loyalty to institutions of authority and new  symnbols. It can be achieved. A divided nations needs to heal  the wounds of the past in order to strengthen itself. In fact,  it's not only `our police' or `our defene force' or `our flag,'  it's `our country.'""     "

If the agricultural sector does not sustain annual growth averaging at least 4 per cent a year, needed to outpace population increase and to make up lost ground, the region's crisis will deepen. Failure would mean stagnating export earnings, a widening food deficit, and further inroads by Asian countries into Africa's falling share of world commodity markets. Given the right policies, properly implemented, it can be done, say planners, who take encouragement from China's achievement of 6 per cent agricultural expansion in the 1980s. But they acknowledge that given the record of the past 25 years, and the obstacles ahead, it will be a target hard to meet. Natural and man-made disasters, weak management, and wrong policies have taken a heavy toll of what is the heart of Africa's economy, accounting as it does for about a third of the region's GDP and around 80 per cent of export earnings. The average rate of agricultural growth has stayed between 1.7 and 1.9 per cent since 1965, well behind population expanding at about 2.7 per cent between 1965 and 1980, rising since then to just over 3 per cent. Per capita food output has declined, food imports have increased at nearly 4 per cent a year since 1974, and food aid has risen 7 per cent annually. Meanwhile, Africa's share in developing country exports of food and agricultural products has halved between 1970 and 1990 - from 17 per cent to 8 per cent. Nor has the region's export base diversified. Most African economies still rely on one or two primary commodities, which altogether account for about 80 per cent of Africa's export revenues - roughly the same as 20 years ago. The fall in the share of the world market has cost Africa dear. Earlier Bank analysis has shown that if Sub-Saharan countries had maintained their 1970 market share of non-oil primary exports from developing countries and prices had remained the same, their export earnings would have been Dollars 9bn-Dollars 10bn a year higher in 1986-87, equal to the region's total debt service payments in this period. Africa's leaders place at least part of the blame for their countries' poor performance on external factors, but as the 1990 UN report, Africa's Commodity Problems, commented, 'other developing countries in other regions have had to face similar market problems and they have progressed while Africa has fallen behind'. Recovering the market share will be difficult. Africa's competitors have invested export proceeds more productively, and now maintain economic reforms and hone their competitive edge more effectively than Africa. Two startling examples can be found in south-east Asia, as World Bank researchers point out. In 1965 Indonesia's GDP per capita was lower than Nigeria's. In both countries oil has been the dominant export. 'Who could have predicted then that Indonesia's GDP in 1990 would be three times that of Nigeria. Or that Thailand (an agriculture-based economy whose GDP per capita in 1965 was lower than Ghana's) would be one of the best-performing countries in the world, while Ghana struggles to regain its position as a middle income developing country?' comments the Bank in a draft report. Nevertheless, reforms ranging from realistic exchange rates to improved producer prices are bringing results in Africa, says Mr Kevin Cleaver*. Ten countries 'already have met the (4 per cent) target or have come close to it in the late 1980s and early 1990s, although with considerable annual fluctuations' citing Nigeria, Uganda and Kenya. Given that the list also includes Botswana, Comoros and Chad, it may be too soon to draw profound conclusions. The most striking success story cited is also a salutary tale. Nairobi's city market is an African cornucopia, stalls piled high with mangoes and passion fruit, avocados and french beans, carnations, roses, chrysanthemums and orchids, bound for the tables of Europe and elsewhere. From modest beginnings in the 1970s, Kenya's horticultural business boomed in the 1980s, and now brings in more than Dollars 100m a year in much needed foreign exchange. But only about 7 per cent of this trade is accounted for by Kenya's African companies: 'Kenya's Africans have had difficulty maintaining viable enterprises due to low capitalisation, management weaknesses, and lack of links to foreign investors. . . Where African companies have worked, family members living in Europe have been important in managing imports,' continues the study. 'Long-term trading relationships between exporters and importers are therefore critical', it concludes, in the provision of foreign know-how, market knowledge and investment. As Mr Cleaver points out, private sector investment in African agriculture and agro-industry is essential, but this in turn depends on successful implementation of macro-economic reforms. * A Strategy to Develop Agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa, Kevin Cleaver, World Bank technical paper No 203  ------------------------------------ SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA: % SHARE OF PRIMARY AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES (AFRICAN SHARE OF WORLD PRODUCTION)  ------------------------------------ Commodity          1969/71   1989  ------------------------------------ Coffee                  32     21 Cocoa                   72     59 Tea                     12     17 Sugar                    7      8 Bananas                  6      3 Citrus fruit            10      8 Rice                     2      2 Coarse grains            7      8 Palm oil                55     14 Groundnuts              32     18 Cotton                  11      7 Rubber                   7      7  ------------------------------------ Source: World Bank  ------------------------------------   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister, had been expecting the recession-hit economy to expand by 1.5 per cent this year. However, Mr van Niekerk said: ' As a result of agriculture's low production in summer rainfall areas, there is a great possibility the expected growth rate could be practically obliterated in the second half of 1992.' His predictions followed warnings on Wednesday that drought in southern Africa could cause famine in much of the region. The United Nations Food and Agriculture organisation said hot and dry conditions in January and February were expected to reduce the total cereal harvest in 11 southern African countries to 16m tonnes, 25 per cent down on the average. It said Zimbabwe and South Africa, which normally offset shortages in the area with their own surpluses, would themselves have to import food. Other than these two countries, Mozambique and Zambia were likely to be most seriously affected. The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for southern Africa this year. Total food imports for the region could be as high as 6m tonnes, three times more than in a normal year. Logistical constraints could further exacerbate the problem, the FAO said, with port handling capacities stretched by unprecedentedly large cereal imports and neighbouring countries sometimes competing for limited rail wagons. It said meeting food aid needs could be difficult as international attention was focused on emergencies in the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, Iraq and the Horn of Africa.

One is the run-up during  which groups with low political tolerance try to intimidate one  another, as well as other parties whose tradition of tolerance  is perceived as weakness. This has already begun, the process  already marked by events such as the Johannesburg massacre, the  intensification of communal violence in kwaZulu/Natal and on the  East Rand and -- on a decidedly lower key -- the breaking up of  NP [National Party] and DP [Democratic Party] meetings.    Next is the polling period when intimidation is likely to  intensify (especially if the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] stays  out of the election and the very act of voting becomes a public  political statement). Confusion and panic are possible at the  polling stations, where most voters have absolutely no  experience of the process. Attempts to interfere with the  polling process are possible, while tensions could be created by  people marching in large groups to cast their vote, out of a  sense of insecurity.    A period of over-exuberance could threaten public order  immediately after the results are made known. It would be  exacerbated if the ANC should register the kind of runaway  victory that could encourage some of its supporters to press for  a scrapping of the power-sharing mechanisms of the interim  constitution. It is possible elements of the disadvantaged  classes will have totally unrealistic expectations and will  stream into the suburbs to claim their houses, swimming pools  and cars. And the losers could seek to give forceful expression  to their rejection of the outcome.    Finally, a phase of disillusioned anger is almost certain,  and this could occur after the military reservists have been  demobilised.    Chris de Kock and Charl Schutte, of the Human Sciences  Research Council, examine this question in depth in an empirical  study of the question of violence over the elections. They note  that posters promoting voter literacy pose the question: ""Why  vote?"" then answer: ""Education, housing, jobs and peace."" They  ask if the compilers are ignorant of the theory of rising  expectations or whether they want to pass on a subtle message  stimulating such expectations.    ""Whatever their reasons, there can be little doubt they are  doing an elected transitional government a great disservice.  Expectations of immediate gratification in terms of housing,  education, work and peace are being aroused in the largest  segment of the South African population.""    They say no transition government could meet such  expectations in a short period, which will cause high levels of  frustration and aggression to be exploited by enemies of the  transitional government. ""One should also not lose sight of the  fact that the black population in particular, after a decade of  ungovernability and not paying for services and alternative  structures, will not recognise the authority of a transitional  government that does not 'deliver the goods' overnight.""

0,FT943-811 ,"FT943-811 _AN-EI0DNAGJFT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Survey of Mauritius (1): Tiger in the making - Successful as a manufacturing base, Mauritius needs to develop new skills and a stronger service sector      By TONY HAWKINS and MICHAEL HOLMAN   Within a generation, Mauritius has gone from gloom to boom. Some thirty years ago an eminent economist warned that the Indian Ocean island faced 'ultimate catastrophe' unless its rate of population growth was checked. Today Mauritius prospers. Once a sugar mono economy, beset with high unemployment and rampant inflation, it has developed a thriving, labour-intensive, industrial sector, heavily reliant on clothing exports, and a highly successful tourist business, while a start to the development of offshore financial services has been made. Population has stabilised at 1.1m, unemployment is negigible, and per capita income has doubled in 13 years. It should be a role model for Africa; instead it is leaving the mainland trailing in its wake. Ethnically, politically, culturally, and especially economically, Mauritius is not part of Africa. Attitudes could scarcely be more different: contrast Mauritian industry minister, Jean-Claud L'Estrac, extolling the virtues of foreign expertise, skills and investment, with the suspicion of expatriates displayed in so many parts of the continent. While Mauritius is anxious to be part of Africa - much store, especially from a marketing viewpoint, is laid on its membership of the Preferential Trade Area of East and Southern Africa (PTA), and it is negotiating entry to the (overlapping) Southern African Development Community - the island is far more outward-looking, in economic policy as well as in political attitudes, than its African counterparts. Today Mauritius is closer to newly industrialising country (NIC) status than to sub-Saharan Africa. The UN's Human Development Report lists the island in the top 25 developing countries, ahead of Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Since the mid-1980s, gross domestic product growth has averaged 6.5 per cent annually, and inflation 7.5 per cent; unemployment is estimated at 1.6 per cent, and the budget deficit is a modest 2.2 per cent of GDP. Finance minister Ramakrishna Sithanen's recent budgets bulge with first-world supply-side ideas designed to improve market efficiency, offer new incentives for savings and investment and improve the infrastructure. Refreshing, too, is the country's ability to pay its own way. The ubiquitous 'donors', dominating such discussions in Africa, seldom feature in Mauritius. External debt will fall to 30 per cent of GDP this year, while the debt-service ratio will be only 6.5 per cent of exports. Since 1982 Sir Aneerood Jugnauth, the prime minister, has presided over the transformation, based on economic measures to which all the main parties subscribe, ensuring policy continuity irrespective of who wins the next general election, to be held by 1996. All this means that the yardstick against which Mauritius must be assessed is Asian rather than African, although whether it can make the leap to NIC status will depend on practicising what it preaches. Most agree that the Export Processing Zone is unlikely to maintain its existing dominance of the economy. Mauritian businessmen accept the need to develop new skills and a capital-intensive growth path, while retaining their competitive strength, especially in garment manufacture, built up over the past decade. Some companies, the Floreal Group being the flagship, have taken the multinational route, setting up a labour-intensive plant in nearby Madagascar, while looking further afield to the possibility of manufacturing in China or India. Others, such as the New Island Clothing group, are manufacturing to Marks and Spencer specifications for the UK market. The strategy is crucial. Mauritius is increasingly at a competitive disadvantage, not just because it is a full-employment economy, where wage costs have doubled in the past four years, but also because of its location. The choice is between importing labour, going offshore as Floreal has done, or sharpening its competitive edge in manufacturing. Devaluation - 25 per cent in the past five years - has helped maintain competitiveness, but the zone must now implement structural solutions rather than temporary palliatives. 'We have to redesign the Mauritian citizen,' says a businessman, referring not just to the need for better and more relevant education and training, but also for a change in attitudes. Mauritius may be ahead of Africa in terms of work ethic, but when it comes to the Asian tigers it is not in the same league. Nor does investment efficiency measure up to 'tiger' standards. While ratios are high, an estimated 30 per cent of GDP in 1994, the capital-output ratio of 19.4 per cent in recent years is well below Korea's 29 per cent and Taiwan's and Thailand's 35.5 per cent. This is explained partly by weaknesses in the financial system, some of which were tackled in this year's budget, but also by structural factors - especially an inefficient labour market. Welfarist attitudes die hard, reflected in the readiness to abolish exchange control and to liberalise money markets, while retaining restrictive labour laws. With much underemployment, labour market deregulation would allow better use of scarce resources. Immediate growth prospects are good. GDP will grow 4.5 per cent in 1994-5, slower than the past two years because of the impact on sugar production of cyclone Hollanda early in the year. The current account deficit last year of MRs700m (1.2 per cent of GDP) will increase sharply to 4.2 per cent in 1994-5, but if aircraft purchases are excluded, it will be slightly lower at 1 per cent. With net capital inflows of some MRs3bn the balance of payments will be in healthy surplus. Inflation is expected to fall from 9.5 per cent to 5 per cent by mid-1995. Real interest rates are positive, with bank rate, tied to the treasury bill rate at 11.2 per cent, and the savings ratios (24 per cent of GDP) should be boosted by budget measures designed to increase the flow of investible securities. This includes privatising five parastatals, starting with Air Mauritius later this year. At the same time, the Stock Exchange is being opened up to foreign investors. With the EPZ facing a more competitive international environment, including the loss of Lome preferences ,growth will slow, while sugar prices will fall in response to Uruguay Round agreement. While tourism is most likely to fill the gap in the short term, physical and environmental limitations, mean the potential for tourism-driven growth beyond the turn of the century is hard to assess. This is why the drive to develop the services sector - embracing offshore banking, the free port, offshore companies, data capture, pre-press services for the printing industry, computer software - has assumed such importance. The number of offshore companies has risen from 150 a year ago to more than 1,000. Leaders, both in government and business have few illusions. Business and government are working more closely than in the past, while in the political sphere there is a shared vision of the future. But while the centre will hold, it is vital that the service culture, increasingly evident in tourism, becomes more entrenched in the economy, because that is where the island's future lies.  -------------------------------------------------- GDP PER HEAD (CONSTANT 1987 PRICES)  -------------------------------------------------- Year                        Dollars                       (1987 prices)  -------------------------------------------------- 1980                          1,650 1981                          1,750 1982                          1,825 1983                          1,820 1984                          1,900 1985                          2,000 1986                          2,170 1987                          2,350 1988                          2,475 1989                          2,560 1990                          2,710 1991                          2,800 1992                          2,975 1993                          3,100  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Central Statistical Office, Port Louis  --------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  MUZ  Mauritius, Africa.

The court ruled that the section of the Law and Order  Maintenance Act that made demonstrations illegal, unless they  had the approval of the police, was in conflict with the  Zimbabwean Bill of Rights which guaranteed freedom of  association. The challenge to the law was brought by members of  the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions who were arrested in  1992 for staging a procession in Harare after police refused to  approve it.    They pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the law  infringed  their constitutional rights and the case was referred to the  Supreme Court.     "

The homeland's commissioner of police, Major General Manyane  Noqayi, has been taken hostage by striking policemen and is  being held along with about 30 of his officers at the police  college in Bisho. A spokesman for the striking policemen said  Brigadier Gqozo would be taken to the Bisho Independence Stadium  this morning to address the armed forces. The estimated 3,000  policemen who commandeered the police college said earlier that  they would only accept the fact that Brigadier Gqozo had  resigned if he informed them in person. The policemen, whose  ranks were bolstered by Ciskeian soldiers who refused an order  to surround the college, are sticking to their demands before  releasing the hostages. The demands include pension payouts and  an investigation into corruption among senior police officers.    Earlier, Brigadier Gqozo resigned and asked that South  Africa  take over the administration of Ciskei. South African minister  of defense, Mr. Kobie Coetsee, said SADF [South African Defense  Force] troops along the border with Ciskei have been put on  standby in case they were needed to be deployed in Ciskei. The  number of hostages being held by the striking policemen has  grown to 42, and includes five women. A spokesman for the  striking policemen said they had asked the ANC [African National  Congress] to send marshals to protect businesses and government  buildings in Ciskei. He said they did not want a repeat of the  disruption which had occurred in Bophuthatswana.    The Transitional Executive Council [TEC] has decided that  two  administrators should be appointed to run Ciskei. The council  would appoint one administrator and the government the other.  The TEC said that the administrators would be assisted by the  chief secretary of NEHAWU [National Education, Health and Allied  Workers Union], the director general of foreign affairs, and the  minister for administration.    The policemen on strike are demanding that their pensions be  paid out and that steps be taken against administrative  corruption.     "

The two sides  exchanged views on bilateral relations and international issues  of common concern.    Qian Qichen said: The Chinese and Angolan peoples have  enjoyed a traditional friendship. Since the two countries  established diplomatic relations, their relations have developed  smoothly. China is willing to further enhance friendly relations  and cooperation with Angola. China has always paid close  attention to Angola's peace process, and supports the Angolan  Government's policy of national reconciliation and the efforts  it has made to achieve that goal. China sincerely hopes that  the peace talks in Angola will produce a final agreement at an  early date and will help realize domestic peace and stability.    He said: China has never interfered in Africa's internal  affairs and has done all it could to contribute to Africa's  development. China hopes that African countries will realize  peace and stability and develop good-neighborly and friendly  relations.    Qian pointed out: Big countries, instead of interfering in  Africa's internal affairs, should let African nations build  themselves according to their own situations. If big powers  really care about Africa, they should not fill out a  prescription and force Africa to accept it. They should offer  aid to Africa to promote its economic development.    Moura briefed Qian Qichen on the current situation in  Angola.  He expressed his thanks for the long-term political and  economic support that his country has received from the Chinese  Government and people. He said: During Angola's struggle for  national independence, the Angolan and Chinese people stood on  one side. Following major changes in the international  situation, the two peoples have continued to stand together.    Moura reaffirmed that Angola firmly adheres to its stand  that  there is only one China, and that it will never develop any  official relations with Taiwan. He expressed the belief that  economic relations and trade between the two countries will be  further enhanced after Angola has realized peace.     "

0,FT942-4204 ,"FT942-4204 _AN-EFJCMAF0FT 940610   FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Chemicals vital for African agriculture'      By DEBORAH HARGREAVES   Africa will have to start using large amounts of chemical fertilisers if the continent is ever to solve its own food problems, according to Mr Norman Borlaug, a prominent agriculturalist, who won the Nobel Peace prize in 1970 for engineering India's 'green' revolution. Mr Borlaug told a meeting at the Overseas Development Institute yesterday: 'Some people say that Africa's food problems can be solved without the application of chemical fertilisers. They're dreaming. It's not possible'. He said that the environmentalists advocating traditional farming methods failed to recognise the rapid growth in population expected in the continent. The population of sub-Saharan Africa was set to double in the next 22 years, he claimed, which would put a considerable strain on non-chemical farming. China had managed to transform its production of cereals in the five years between 1975 and 1980, increasing yields by a tonne a hectare by using chemical fertilisers, Mr Borlaug said. China's output of cereals had risen from 238m tonnes to 285m tonnes during that period even though farmers had already been using organic compost on the land. Today China produced the most cereals in the world with average yields of 4 tonnes per hectare, Mr Borlaug said. Sub-Saharan Africa had the lowest use of fertiliser in the world and soil nutrients were so low that other efforts to raise crop productivity would not be successful until fertility was improved. Mr Borlaug said, however, that it was extremely expensive for African countries to import fertiliser, and he called on industrialised nations to provide the continent's farmers with access to adequate inputs.

But Mandela, who has drawn criticism from members of Congress for his support  of violence as well as Cuba's Fidel Castro, Libya's Moammar Kadafi and the  PLO's Yasser Arafat, said such a democratic society could not be built until  violence by the white South African government ends.

[Velayati] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. Before the revolution, the regime did not pay much  attention to ties with Africa in its foreign policy. After the  revolution, for various reasons, that attention was considerably  increased. There was first the expansion of diplomatic ties.  The next step was the expansion of cultural, economic,  commercial, and industrial ties. By the expansion of industrial  ties, I mean those countries are eager to use Iran's industrial  goods. During that period there were very good examples of  cooperation with those countries in that field. The inception  of temporary or permanent trade and industrial exhibitions in  some countries was one of the first steps taken and was very  successful in those countries.    One of the main reasons for the extraordinary welcome by all  the African countries in which we opened exhibitions is that not  many countries can compete with Iranian prices, while the  quality of our goods is relatively high, particularly the  quality of goods offered there. In some commercial and economic  fields, the private sector could definitely be more active, and  in some other fields the public sector. Without exception all  the African countries we visited asked for the expansion of  economic and commercial cooperation.    [Correspondent] To what extent could cooperation with Africa  help our presence on the international scene?    [Velayati] Because of the end of the cold war, some Western  countries are today interfering more blatantly in the internal  affairs of Third World countries, particularly African  countries, without any consideration for their endemic  characteristics. They have disturbed the situation in some  African countries. The people of Africa are wise to this and,  therefore, seek cooperation with countries that have  particularly more influence on the international scene.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.    [Velayati] Thank you.     "
0,FT942-11797 ,"FT942-11797 _AN-EEDEHADIFT 940504   FT  04 MAY 94 / Leading Article: South Africa looks forward   South Africa's transition from minority rule to democracy is something to celebrate. Not even the painfully inefficient election count can spoil an event of such moment and one whose significance extends well beyond the region. A stable, democratic and economically successful South Africa might yet offer hope for a continent debilitated by debt, disaster and disease. It could even become a model for other countries where ethnic and racial tensions present seemingly insuperable barriers to economic progress. Fulfilment of these hopes will be as difficult as the transition itself, but South Africa has made an encouraging start. President FW de Klerk has left office with a grace that has enhanced his reputation and augurs well for his expected role as second vice president. General Constand Viljoen, the former armed services chief, steered the conservative right away from confrontation and into the election. He deserves credit for defusing what could have been a destabilising clash. Above all, the president-elect, Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the victorious African National Congress, is preparing for office with the pragmatism and compassion that is his hallmark. With the grim legacy of apartheid all around him, he was right to strike a note of urgency in his victory speech on Monday night, promising that he and his team will roll up their sleeves and get South Africa back to work. Cabinet places He was also wise to offer places in his cabinet to parties which failed to reach the 5 per cent that would give them automatic representation in a government of national unity: the liberal Democratic party, the radical Pan Africanist Congress and Gen Viljoen's Freedom Front, which seeks reassurance that Afrikaner culture will survive. It would be wise to extend a similar invitation to Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, although his Inkatha Freedom party may have attracted sufficient votes to secure it a cabinet seat. Chief Buthelezi's difficulties with the ANC and its leader are well-known. Yet nothing can be lost by attempting to bring this prickly personality into the fold. In selecting his cabinet Mr Mandela must also look beyond his domestic constituency. A careful balance is needed to reassure international investors, who look for stability. They will wish to see continuity of the sound economic policies that have characterised the transition. The retention of Mr Derek Keys, the present finance minister, in one of the main economic portfolios would constitute a clear signal that this is understood. Mr Chris Stals, the governor of the Reserve Bank, should be asked to stay in his job. It may be difficult for Mr Mandela but room should be found for both men, not as token whites but as key players in South Africa's new economic team. Investment code Mr Mandela must also be on his guard against those who argue for an investment code. Rev Leon Sullivan, the US-based campaigner, achieved some success in urging foreign companies who decided to maintain their operations in the old South Africa to end discrimination on the shop floor, introduce training programmes and accept social responsibilities in the black community. He and others now advocate similar terms for would-be foreign investors. These objectives are well-meant, but to make them a condition displays a misunderstanding of the tough competition for investment. No lobby urges the same conditions for other developing nations. Some investors are showing strong interest in post-apartheid South Africa, whether as a market in its own right, or as a base for operations in the rest of Africa. Yet the new government is in no position to lay down terms that might drive investment capital to more attractive Asian homes. Indeed, Mr Mandela should bear Asian lessons closely in mind as he looks to the future. That implies a market-driven exchange rate, a competitive business environment, a close partnership between government and the private sector, trade liberalisation, encouragement of multinationals with their worldwide marketing facilities, technology and management skills and an efficient civil service. He will best serve the new South Africa if he applies these principles. He might also then galvanise the rest of Africa, for whom he is already an inspiration.

Mandela, a political storm already was  brewing over whether the move warrants relaxation of U.S. sanctions against  South Africa.    From his retreat at Camp David, Bush telephoned South African President  Frederik W. de Klerk and ""pledged U.S. willingness to help create a climate for  negotiations"" between the nation's white minority leadership and its black  majority.    Bush also invited the South African leader for talks at the White House, adding  that Mandela would also be invited after his scheduled release today from 27  years of imprisonment.    In a separate statement, Bush praised De Klerk for showing ""bold and  imaginative leadership in recent days, which has earned the admiration of many  of us who hope for swift and peaceful evolution in South Africa.""    Under De Klerk, South Africa has legalized the African National Congress and  about 60 other banned political groups, freed leading black prisoners and  pledged to negotiate a new constitution. In his dramatic announcement Saturday,  De Klerk also said that a nationwide state of emergency would be lifted if no  further violence accompanied Mandela's release.    Although Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman J. Cohen said  De Klerk's initiatives could lead to the lifting of U.S. sanctions ""within the  next few weeks,"" black leaders and key lawmakers cautioned the Administration  not to move too fast.    California Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley), chairman of the Congressional  Black Caucus, said the United States ""should continue to use the moral and  economic lever of even more stringent sanctions as a vehicle for helping to  accelerate the end of apartheid in a nonviolent context.    ""While I welcome the release of Nelson Mandela from almost three decades of  imprisonment for his political beliefs,"" Dellums said, ""I am concerned that no  mention has been made about the release of more than 2,000 other black South  Africans still in prison because of their struggle to end apartheid.""    The issue of imprisoned blacks has been controversial because many held on  criminal charges are considered by black opposition leaders to be political  prisoners.    Sanctions imposed by Congress in 1986 over President Ronald Reagan's veto  prohibit new U.S. investment and bank loans in South Africa; bar imports of  South African iron, steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products; outlaw  sales of computers to South Africa, and prohibit U.S. landings by South African  Airways.    Under the terms of the law, Bush is empowered to modify or suspend the  sanctions if political prisoners are freed and if South Africa meets any three  of four other conditions.    The four conditions are:     -- Repealing the 1986 state of emergency.     -- Lifting a ban on democratic political parties and allowing all races to  participate in the political process.     -- Repealing the Group Areas Act, the apartheid law dictating where blacks can  live and work.     -- Negotiating with the black majority without preconditions.    The 3 1/2-year-old state of emergency allows South African police to detain  suspects for up to six months without charging them or bringing them to trial.  It also allows the government to restrict protests and to bar the press from  areas of unrest.    Rep. William H. Gray III (D-Pa.), House majority whip and author of the 1986  sanctions legislation, also indicated his opposition to a quick lifting to  sanctions.    ""Just because we freed one man doesn't mean that we freed an entire nation,""  Gray said.    Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica, an anti-apartheid group,  also argued against lifting sanctions.    ""Clearly, the U.S. has played a significant role in bringing the South African  government to this historic point,"" Robinson said. ""Progress could be seriously  stalled by the failure of the U.S. and European governments to maintain  sanctions and continue pressure for further reform.""    Robinson termed Mandela's release ""a tiny step on a long road to dismantling  the apartheid system.""    Last week, President Bush hinted that he was interested in lifting sanctions.    ""I think when people move in the right direction, it is certainly time to  review all policy,"" he said.    Administration sources stressed that Bush would not move precipitously without  consulting Congress. But a congressional source involved in the issue expressed  concern that the White House might try to loosen sanctions before serious  negotiations between South Africa's blacks and whites are under way.    Among the possible first steps would be lifting the ban on landing rights for  South African Airways, the source said.    Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), chairman of a Senate subcommittee on African affairs,  announced that he was ""indefinitely suspending"" further action by his  subcommittee on a bill that would expand existing sanctions. But Simon also  noted that Mandela's release and the conditional pledge to lift the state of  emergency in South Africa ""still fall short of an end to apartheid, and it is  premature for the United States to begin lifting sanctions at this point.""    Rep. Howard Wolpe (D-Mich.), chairman of a House subcommittee on Africa who met  with De Klerk in South Africa last month, urged the Administration to be ""very  careful"" in handling the issue.    ""There are still hundreds upon hundreds of political prisoners in South African  jails, and the emergency is still in effect,"" Wolpe said in an interview. ""The  situation must be created in South Africa where anti-apartheid activists are as  free as the government party to organize, to move about the country and to  speak freely. Then we can talk about beginning negotiations.""    Wolpe also called on the White House to use as a model America's recent  approach to events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.    ""We did not move prematurely in relaxing pressures in place (in Eastern Europe)  until we believed that the process of change was irreversible and that  fundamental change was occurring,"" he said.

'We are in a position that when it is appropriate we can apply,' he said, welcoming a favourable US State Department pronouncement. The statement had been long in preparation but was made 'more pointed' after the by-election defeat of the National party at the hands of the right-wing Conservative party on Wednesday. It acknowledged that economic conditions in South Africa, with severe unemployment, will 'have a direct and decisive impact on the success of the new democracy which emerges from the current negotiations'. The State Department, while vague on its IMF policy, said the US was 'prepared to consider a proposal' for an IMF facility. A provision of law, the Gramm amendment, prohibits US support for an IMF facility unless four conditions are met. A Department spokesman said three had been, but it was not yet clear the fourth had. That requires South Africa to seek balance of payments support from the private markets before going to the IMF. Mr Michael Christie, Washington director of the South Africa Foundation, a private-sector South African group, said he had been privately assured the US would now back an IMF facility. The timing was subject to debate because inflation was now 15 per cent. But he said the country, which now desperately needs to expand its economy through imports, had the option of going to the IMF. A formal finding by President Bush earlier this week that South Africa has made 'significant progress toward the elimination of apartheid' has paved the way for new Eximbank lending to the South African government. 'We are also encouraging US exports to non-governmental South African importers who have endorsed and proceeded toward the implementation of fair labour standards,' the state department added. 'If the Secretary of State certified that a South African firm meets these standards, US exporters to such a firm would also be eligible for Eximbank support.' Companies owned by non-whites are exempt from any requirements.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

In the 11 months since becoming finance minister, Mr Keys has used it to advantage. He has used common sense - the moral good sense of the Bible, from which he quotes liberally, and the commercial acumen developed over 30 years as one of South Africa's top businessmen - to induce sanity among the country's fractious politicians. At a time last year when they had sunk to new depths of squabbling, Mr Keys told them a few choice economic truths - that unless they moved quickly, South Africa would not be worth fighting over; it would become a wasteland of high unemployment and low growth, decaying industry and departing skills. The politicians listened, and democracy talks began in earnest. The message is reinforced, if anything, by last weekend's assassination of African National Congress leader Chris Hani. 'I'm the minister of the bloody obvious,' he says. 'I see myself as someone who jollies people along to do what common sense dictates they ought to do.' He is someone (he does not say it) who has not only the clarity of vision to see what needs to be done but the political skill to persuade the ANC, the black trade unions, the business community and the cabinet that they saw it first themselves. He relies on candour, confidence and his commanding presence - critics call it arrogance - to carry the day. When he speaks, people listen. The message he delivers is a tough one: the economy must undergo radical restructuring; government consumption spending must fall sharply to boost critically low investment; civil service numbers and pay have to be cut sharply; unions must agree a virtual wage freeze; interest rates must remain high to tame inflation. The first difficult steps have already been taken. Last month's budget raised value-added tax by 4 percentage points to 14 per cent and cut government current expenditure significantly in real terms, in an attempt to wrestle down a budget deficit equal to nearly 9 per cent of gross domestic product. In his first budget, Mr Keys reduced the corporate tax rate from 48 to 40 per cent to boost investment - though much of it will be clawed back through a new company tax on profits distributed to shareholders and the abolition of other company tax breaks, making the effect more psychological than real. That is scarcely surprising, for Mr Keys' campaign is overwhelmingly psychological. Put simply, he aims to persuade South Africa to believe in itself. Investors must believe in investing; bureaucrats must believe in giving the civil service their best efforts by cutting waste and inefficiency; the liberation movements must believe in the virtues of a free market; the unions must believe they have a stake in growth; and all of them must believe in Derek Keys. So far, he can boast a surprising degree of credibility even in the most radical circles. The ANC's economic policy chief, Mr Trevor Manuel, is known to respect him, and Mr Jay Naidoo, militant general-secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest union federation, happily tolerates him, after viciously attacking his predecessor. Mr Keys repays the compliment. He often invites Cosatu to 'correct' his economic plans, and says he thinks the behaviour of organised labour in the tripartite economic negotiating body, the National Economic Forum (involving business, unions and government), has been 'outstanding'. Business is delighted to have a voice in Pretoria. (Mr Keys came to the job from the post of executive chairman of Gencor, the country's second-largest mining house.) The technocrats of the Finance Ministry seem somewhat in awe of him. Never before have they had a minister who had no desk. ('A desk is separation, assertion of authority, subservience to constraints, secretiveness.') Or a boss who throws away every report they give him. (Keys says he hates filing and so reads and discards nearly every paper put before him.) The Keys mystique has yet to impress taxpayers, however. They have already felt the pain, and many doubt there is pleasure to follow. Winning over the people will ultimately determine whether Mr Keys can complete the difficult economic restructuring task he has set himself, at a time of great political upheaval, and under a multi-racial power-sharing government (due to be phased in from later this year) which could prove weak and divisive. 'Government is in a typically feminine role,' he says, sheepishly acknowledging that some might find the comment sexist. It is 'trying to create a situation attractive enough to stimulate some initiative from another party (the private investor). Once you commit yourself to relying on the private sector because only it can produce the investment directions with adequate yields, then you put yourself in this situation. How can I be more attractive? That's the heart of the problem.' Investors, both domestic and foreign, must start investing, growth must resume (after four years of recession), jobless totals must drop (some 40 per cent of the labour force is without a formal job) or the Keys structural adjustment programme is dead. 'The guide has to have some credibility,' the minister volunteers. 'I've been in this job nearly a year and I don't have anything to show. If I'm in this job for another year with nothing to show, what are the grounds for confidence?' His basis for optimism is, oddly for a businessman and government minister, partly religious. Mr Keys consults the Living Light, a publication which provides daily lessons from scripture, every night before retiring and upon rising every morning. He acts according to its guidelines. That, he says, is his recipe for health. 'When I was at Gencor I had to go for the annual check-up and the doctor said to me: 'I'm impressed. How are you handling this stress so well?' I said: 'It's my daily exercises.' He said: 'Oh, what do you do?' I said: 'On my knees, twice a day.'.' His faith in Mr F W de Klerk is also unshakeable. He describes the South African president as 'a political genius'. But his confidence in the entrepreneurial skills of the South African businessman, white or black, is less strong. 'You once became an industrialist (in the highly protected South African economy) by taking an existing stream of products that came into the country, stopping it and replacing it with a stream of your own. That doesn't require an enormous amount of marketing sense,' he says. But the export-oriented growth areas 'that we now have to benefit from are totally dependent on marketing sensitivity,' he points out. 'There are also community attitude problems. Who wants to be rich in a community where wealth is a stigma,' he asks, noting that both the Calvinist ethic of the Afrikaner and the communal ethic of Africans act against the pursuit of wealth. So how will South Africa prosper, in an atmosphere of low labour productivity, social strain and potential economic conflict? 'The question is not, can these people be like the Japanese,' he says somewhat irritably, 'but can they improve? And they can improve, and they are here and so are we, so I think if I were to approach my job on the basis that I had to produce Korea in three years, of course I'd be on the wrong tack. But you say you have to produce something noticeably better in three years, then we're away.' In the end, Mr Keys says, it's all 'a function of hope and faith . . . You don't stay in this business unless you believe in God'.  ------------------------------------------------------------------                             PERSONAL FILE  ------------------------------------------------------------------ 1931     Born in Johannesburg. 1950     B Comm, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg. 1954     Qualified as chartered accountant. 1956     Joined Industrial Development Corp, SA. 1965-86  Worked as management consultant. 1986-91  Executive chairman, Gencor.

The major outcome of the meeting was the signing  by the heads of state of the act establishing the Central  African Economic and Monetary Community [CEMAC] similar to the  West African Economic and Monetary Union [UEMOA].    A new act has just been enacted in the subregion, a new  forum  for reflection and a new economic framework. UDEAC heads of  state are determined to transform their monetary zone into a  veritable monetary and economic union.

Concerning the conventions of the monetary and economic  union  which were not finalized, the heads of state have decided to set  up a committee of plenipotentiaries consisting of ministers of  economy, finance, external relations, and justice, as well as  the governor of the Bank of Central African States, and the  UDEAC secretary general. This committee is expected to finalize  these conventions before the next UDEAC summit slated for  Yaounde in December under the chairmanship of President Paul  Biya.    The council of heads of states also decided to convene a  meeting of the CEMAC and donors to study the means of mitigating  the negative effects of the devaluation in the countries of the  subregion. An act approving the restructuring of UDEAC was  signed by the heads of state. Gabon is expected to apply for  the post of deputy UDEAC secretary general which was declared  vacant during the summit. Other decisions were also made  especially in the air, land, and river transport sectors. The  heads of state decided to reactivate these sectors by reopening  the river route between Bangui and Brazzaville. The European  Union has granted 7 billion CFA francs for the reconstitution of  this waterway.     "

The document by the London-based African Rights is timed to coincide with the handover today of Washington's leadership of the international force to the United Nations. The authors say fighting and banditry have become worse in some areas, and claim aid workers are unanimous in describing the security situation as having deteriorated since western intervention. The report maintains that the overall food supply problem had been overcome as early as October 1992, before the US troops landed. Over-supply of food has damaged the agricultural sector, says the report. Efforts at disarmament of rival factions have been 'sporadic and half-hearted', and both the UN and the US have failed in the peace process by giving warlords an 'unwarranted legitimacy' and not consulting a cross-section of civil society. The highly critical analysis is by Ms Rakiya Omaar and Mr Alex de Waal, co-founders of African Rights. The small, UK-charity funded organisation was formed last December after they resigned from Africa Watch, part of a US-based international network of human rights monitors. The experience of the authors in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa will give weight to their analysis. Their judgment is also likely to be backed by several of the charities working in Somalia. The report calls for a UN commission of inquiry into the operation, disarmament of warlords, and greater attention to long-term economic rehabilitation and the peace process.

0,FT934-7745 ,"FT934-7745 _AN-DKRC7AGJFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (10): Disliked but 'still necessary' - A look at the financial rand, the investor's torment      By PHILIP GAWITH   NEXT TO violence, political instability and concerns about ANC economic policy, what investors like least about South Africa is exchange control. In fact, outside of a few lawyers and tax advisers, it is difficult to find anyone who likes it. Even the Reserve Bank, which administers the policies, never tires of saying that it would like to rid the country of this albatross. Earlier this month Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, commented: 'An early end to the dual-currency system is not in the offing.' He also noted, that 'the financial rand will remain as long as the domestic political and social instability . . . continues'. With South Africa facing an election on April 27, 1994, and the immediate aftermath a great unknown, few believe the financial rand will go before the end of 1994 at the earliest. While most exchange control regulations are aimed at stopping people taking money out of the country, it is the dual-currency system that most affects foreign investors. In terms of this system South Africa has a commercial rand, the official rate of exchange used for all normal commercial activities; and the financial rand which is basically a currency for non-resident investment or disinvestment. The aim of the financial rand is to protect the country's foreign reserves. The system is designed to ensure that when foreigners repatriate their investments, they do not do so at the expense of the country's reserves. Foreign investors need to pay close attention to the financial rand as it is a highly volatile currency easily capable of negating any gains made in, say, an investment in equities or bonds. Indeed, many foreigners suffered heavy losses in the second half of 1992 when the currency weakened dramatically. Although turnover in the market has increased, it remains a very thin market, skittish and difficult to predict, and easily moved by a large order. Financial rands are created when a non-resident sells his South African investment to a South African. He must be paid in rand, which rands are then deposited in his account with an approved dealer in foreign exchange (all of the main banks). Once in his account, the rand becomes financial rand which can only be sold by the non-resident owner to another non-resident against payment in a foreign currency. By definition, residents can never own, and hence sell, financial rand (though, in very limited circumstances, locals may use financial rand for offshore transactions). Residents are also not allowed to buy financial rand as this would require foreign exchange - precisely what the system is supposed to avoid. In considering when the financial rand might be abolished, it must be remembered that this subject is inextricably bound up with South Africa's debt standstill arrangements. These were introduced in 1985 and covered the country's repayable foreign debt (then Dollars 13.6bn, now down to Dollars 5bn in terms of a final agreement reached last September). The government's position was that it would have been unfair if a restriction had been placed on repayment of foreign debt at that time without also restricting the repatriation of foreign investment in South African equities. This would have led to undesirable arbitrage transactions  -hence the introduction of the financial rand. Likewise, it is most unlikely that the Reserve Bank will scrap the financial rand system while foreign creditors remain subject to a debt repayment scheme. The latest scheme is due to run for eight years. For South Africa to consider ending it before then - that is, repaying the affected debt - will either require that it manages to roll over a substantial amount of the Dollars 5bn still subject to the scheme, or that its reserves grow to the position where it feels they can withstand a sizeable capital outflow. Current levels, which cover only about six weeks of imports, are a long way short of the required level. The best indicator that the financial rand is ripe for abolition will be when the discount to commercial rand, currently about 20 per cent, either narrows considerably or disappears altogether. This is unlikely before South Africa is seen to have achieved a stable and sustainable transition.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT932-8571 ,"FT932-8571 _AN-DERDAAF8FT 930518   FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: China appears ready to remove barriers against foreign miners      By TONY WALKER      BEIJING   AFTER YEARS of procrastination, China at last appears willing to begin dismantling nationalistic barriers against foreign involvement in its mining sector, including gold prospects. Participants in a conference held in Beijing last week, among them representatives of some of the world's biggest mining houses, came away convinced that change was in the wind; although it was unclear how quickly China would replace existing legislation. Mining company representatives, used to sterile discussion on the need for liberalisation, were surprised when, on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials, responding to international pressure, halved the rate of gold royalties in draft legislation. While the proposed 10 per cent royalty rate is still outrageously high by international standards, especially compared with those in developing countries where rates of between 2 and 3 per cent apply, apparent Chinese flexibility was regarded as a good sign. Chinese regulations at present ban foreign companies from involvement in the exploitation of gold reserves, but China is anxious to secure capital and perhaps more important the advanced minerals treatment technology required to exploit this lucrative area. Mr Graham Reid, a senior manager of CRA of Australia, said that although the Chinese had a 'fair way to go' in their efforts to attract foreign miners, he had found attitudes displayed by officials of the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources 'very encouraging'. He noted that Chinese officials responded with alacrity to suggestions by the foreign participants, who included representative of Newmont Mining of the US, Cominco of Canada, De Beers of South Africa, and BHP of Australia; although he also observed that substantial change to legislation would require the approval of the Chinese parliament. Among the more positive developments was a Chinese undertaking to study a proposal that the country should adopt a model 'contract of work' allowing prospective mining ventures to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, thus facilitating much greater flexibility. Mr Reid, CRA's general manager for exploration, noted that this approach was operating successfully in parts of Africa and in Indonesia  - a contract of work's main appeal is that it overrides existing laws - where it had proved an effective means of 'kick starting' mining exploration and development. Chinese mining officials have made it clear that they are under pressure to boost activity in the mining sector, which is lagging far behind the rest of the economy. China's economic boom has heightened demand for a whole range of minerals, both ferrous and non-ferrous. Mr Reid said that foreign miners would, however, proceed cautiously and would want to be sure that any new mining regulations were consistent with domestic laws. 'Western mining companies like laws that are drafted with particularity and clarity,' he observed. Western miners were also likely to insist that disputes be settled by international arbitration and not within the Chinese system. This was a concept that was fairly alien to the Chinese. Foreign mining representatives also pressed the Chinese last week on the need to make available larger areas for exploration, but at the same time urged regulations that would oblige exploration companies to surrender prospective areas that were not being exploited, thus ensuring 'turnover'. Other issues that preoccupied the conference, jointly organised by the United Nations, included access to foreign exchange, and guaranteed unlimited rights to export product. The Chinese were also pressed to clarify a tax regime that might apply to new mining ventures   Countries:-  CNZ  China, Asia.   Industries:-  P1099 Metal Ores, NEC.     P1041 Gold Ores.

Mr. Meir Shumer, 48, an Israeli citizen, is in police  custody  after appearing in the Kempton Park magistrate's court on  Tuesday.    Police say this is the fourth time in 18 months they have  seized diamonds or gold smuggled on El Al flights from  Johannesburg to Tel Aviv.    Immigration records show that Mr. Shumer's arrest came on  his  thirteenth trip to South Africa since 1990.    On most of his visits, police said, he stayed for between  one  and three days before returning to Israel -- almost always  choosing to fly El Al.    Police say El Al's Saturday-night flight appears to have  become a hot favourite with professional smugglers and dishonest  emigrants in spite of El Al's reputation for having the  strictest security in the world.    The possibility that airline staff may be colluding with  smugglers has not been ruled out.    Last year Reserve Bank investigators working on a  R179-million fraud case were told by an informant in a sworn  statement that the airline's staff were helping wealthy South  Africans get their riches out of the country.    Within weeks of this, Germiston diamond and gold unit  detectives arrested El Al security officer Derek Joel Niss, 35,  for trying to smuggle a suitcase filled with more than 670  Krugerrands into a plane cargo hold.    Niss said after his conviction that he suspected a cartel of  emigrating South Africans had paid him the R5,000 cash bribe he  received for each coin-filled suitcase he slipped on the plane.    He said he had handled about 20 consignments before his  arrest.    Niss's arrest was the second time police had seized gold  coins destined for Israel on an El Al flight. Last February  they found a suitcase containing 1,100 Krugerrands which had  been checked in for transport to Tel Aviv. The owner has still  not been traced.    And in another diamond-smuggling case, police arrested  Israeli courier Moshe Landman when he tried to board an El Al  flight 18 months ago with R55,000 in diamonds hidden in one of  his boots. Landman had travelled to South Africa 15 times --  mostly with El Al -- before being caught.    Last Saturday police swooped on passengers travelling  overseas on various airlines at Jan Smuts.    Diamonds and gold unit detectives Colonel Clement Jackson  and  Captain Henk van Rensburg picked out Mr. Shumer from the line of  passengers moving through passport control.    Mr. Shumer, who claims to be a diamond consultant, was taken  to a cubicle and asked to strip down to his underwear, said  police. He was then arrested.    Police said Mr. Shumer arrived in South Africa with his wife  -- it was her first trip -- two weeks ago and the two apparently  took time off to holiday in George and Cape Town.    Mrs. Shumer, who was also searched, went on to Tel Aviv. Mr.  Shumer was not asked to plead when he appeared in the Kempton  Park magistrate's court on Tuesday. A bail hearing has been set  for February 23.    If convicted, Mr. Shumer faces a maximum sentence of 10  years' imprisonment and R250,000 fine.    Police says they are now obliged to carry out more frequent  and more thorough searches of passengers using El Al.    Explaining how smugglers were slipping past his security  officers, an El Al security spokesman said the airline was  mainly concerned with apprehending potential hijackers and  terrorists.     "
0,FT942-6829 ,"FT942-6829 _AN-EFBDVAG7FT 940527   FT  27 MAY 94 / South Africa aims to double arms exports      By PATTI WALDMEIR and MARK SUZMAN      JOHANNESBURG   South Africa hopes to double arms exports over the next year following the lifting of the United Nations arms embargo, which spurred previous governments to develop a sophisticated arms manufacturing industry. Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, said yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Dollars 270m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. Mr de Waal noted, for example that South Africa sold a variety of weapons - rifles, grenades, mortars - worth R100m to Rwanda over a five-year period. He said the deal was terminated late last year because of evidence the weapons were used against the Rwandan people. In recent weeks, Rwandan Hutus loyal to the government have been blamed for horrific slaughters of minority Tutsis and other Hutus that killed tens of thousands of people. Mr Peet Smith, Armscor general manager for imports and exports, said the new government's policy permitted arms exports to countries only to defend their sovereignty and not where the weapons might be used to violate human rights. Despite anxieties about exports to the rest of Africa, South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future. Selling more of its respected military hardware is the key to Armscor's survival, Mr de Waal said. The company currently more than R800m of arms per year, which he said represented less than 0.5 per cent of the international arms market. Products that could sell well abroad include sophisticated Rooivalk helicopters, frequency-hopping radio transmitters and receivers that avoid interception, landmine-proof armoured vehicles, advanced mine detection equipment, and G-5 and G-6 long-range artillery. Mr de Waal identified Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Europe as potential markets. This will be eased by Tuesday's UN Security Council decision to lift a mandatory ban on the sale of arms to South Africa. President Mandela said this week Pretoria should be allowed to sell weapons if it wanted to and Defence Minister Joe Modise, a former guerrilla fighter, said expanding weapons exports could create 20,000 jobs.

A statement from the administration said aid would be concentrated on the poorest 50 countries, which received three-quarters of bilateral aid in 1993-94. 'Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of know-how to countries in transition remain particular priorities for the ODA's work,' it said. The statement was disputed, however, by the World Development Movement which recently won a High Court challenge over the funding of the controversial Pergau Dam in Malaysia. It said the channeling of more aid through Europe and to commercially tied projects would leave fewer funds for poverty-focused country-to-country aid. Ms Harriet Lamb, development movement campaign officer, said Africa in particular would suffer as, on the ODA's own calculations, the percentage of total British aid to Africa was set to fall from 14.4 per cent in 1994-95 to 12.1 per cent in 1997. Mr Ben Jackson, the movement's campaigns co-ordinator, complained that the chancellor had had to stump up Britain's share of the Edinburgh summit's commitment to increase European aid by 60 per cent by the end of the decade. He said: 'Unlike some of his European counterparts, he has failed to match this promise with extra funding for the overall aid budget. 'Britain is punching well below its weight as an aid giver.

It will be the first time the two sides have met for formal constitutional negotiations since multi-party talks broke down last May at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Since then, the gap between the two sides on the crucial issue of power-sharing has narrowed, with the ANC proposing this week that South Africa be ruled by coalition even if one party wins a majority of votes in the first elections under a permanent constitution. ANC officials tried to force the pace of next week's meeting, which will be held over three days at a secret location, by rejecting as too slow the timetable announced on Thursday by President F W de Klerk, who forecast elections for an interim government by April 1994. Amnesty International human rights group has released a report documenting physical abuse of prisoners in ANC camps outside South Africa. The victims were often labelled as South African government spies, but most appeared to have been genuine ANC members, imprisoned because they raised grievances or policy differences, it said.

0,FT933-7680 ,"FT933-7680 _AN-DHTCQABFFT 930820   FT  20 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Focus of S Africa reforms shifts to trade  -The revised offer to be presented to Gatt      By PHILIP GAWITH   WHEN South Africa started on the road of political reform in 1990, this was as much a function of the crippling economic cost of apartheid as it was a reflection of the moral and political bankruptcy of that policy. Since then, the country's faltering political fortunes have hogged the limelight. Later this month, however, South Africa will present a revised trade liberalisation offer to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which forms part of a revision of trade policy as fundamental as the political reform under way. Mr Stef Naude, director general of the Department of Trade and Industry, comments: 'Without a doubt, this is the biggest reform of trade policy ever undertaken in this country.' The aim of the reform is simple: the transformation of the existing industrial base, fed for decades on a diet of political isolation, import substitution and strategic self-sufficiency, into an internationally competitive, export-led manufacturing sector. The Gatt offer is but the first of many initiatives which include reform of export incentives, investigation of export processing zones, more efficient anti-dumping legislation, a trade agreement with the EC and the future of the South African Customs Union. Pursued against the background of a weak economy, unemployment running at over 40 per cent and fundamental political transition, it is a Herculean labour. No longer can government unilaterally decree policy changes. Democracy, transparency and consultation are the new watchwords. When it comes to economic policy, the imprimatur of the National Economic Forum, the tripartite body where business, labour and government are represented, must be sought. At least in the area of trade policy, there is fairly broad consensus among these three groups as to the way forward. Nobody would argue with the premise, contained in the government's recently published Normative Economic Model, that 'Much of the country's future economic prosperity will be determined by its ability to play a bigger role in international trade in industrial goods.' This clearly requires conformity to Gatt, whose signatories all benefit from 'most favoured nation' status and 'national treatment' - the first ensuring that any tariff cut offered by one country to a second must automatically be extended to all other trading partners, and the second guaranteeing that an exporter is treated just as a local company is treated. 'There is no way South Africa can fully reintegrate into the global economy outside Gatt,' said Mr Stef Naude. Conformity to Gatt is not the only reason for lowering tariff barriers. It is also necessary to remove the anti-export bias in South Africa whereby protection makes the local market more profitable than exports. It also raises input costs for local exporters, making them uncompetitive compared to exporters elsewhere who can obtain inputs at world prices. A recent World Bank study of South Africa's trade policy found that it was not overly protective, 'but far too fluid and complex, and biased against exports.' Compared to developing countries, the protection level is fairly average. According to NEM, South Africa's tariff barrier (weighted by import values) stands at 21 per cent, though this rises to 27 per cent when account is taken of special import surcharges  - which survive for fiscal rather than protection purposes. South Africa's revised Gatt offer will thus have two main features: first, it will involve a one-third reduction in average tariff rates. Second, it includes a dramatic rationalisation of the tariff structure which is virtually unmatched in its complexity. Instead of the current high degree of dispersion, tariff levels will range, at 5 percentage point intervals, from zero to a maximum of 30 per cent (with the exception of the motor industry). Also, almost all tariffs will be bound - which means, in theory, they can never be raised, only lowered. This compares with only 55 per cent in its original offer. South Africa has also committed itself to phasing out emergency dumping formula duties, - a measure which has been the main instrument to counter disruptive competition. to be replaced by proper anti-dumping measures, further reducing the overall level of protection in the country as formula duties often resulted in an increased overall level of protection. The Gatt offer - particularly the lowering of import tariffs - should not be seen in isolation. All parties agree that it will have to be accompanied by supply-side support measures to assist local industry to improve its competitiveness. With unemployment already at alarmingly high levels, the social and political costs of simply dropping tariff barriers, without other policies introduced in parallel, are unthinkable.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: ESTIMATES OF EFFECTIVE PROTECTION (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                        Protection on Subsector                            Inputs     Output     Effective                                                           Protection  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Food, Beverages and Tobacco            15.2       13.7           8.8 Textiles, Apparel,  Leather           27.8       43.6          93.6 Wood  Wood Products                   14.0       21.7          39.7 Paper  Paper Products                  9.5       13.3          22.2 Chemicals                               7.5       18.9          50.6 Non Metallic Minerals                   5.2       19.8          34.3 Basic Metal                             4.7       11.2          23.2 Metal Products  Equipment             17.1       18.2          20.3 Other Manufacturing                     2.8       10.9          62.8 Manufacturing                          12.6       17.8          30.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Industrial Development Corporation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT932-9794 ,"FT932-9794 _AN-DELCNAEDFT 930512   FT  12 MAY 93 / Break-up signals overhaul of corporate South Africa      By PHILIP GAWITH      JOHANNESBURG   GENCOR's announcement that it plans to unbundle came as no surprise, but this does not diminish the significance of an event whose political and business ramifications are likely to be widespread. It almost certainly heralds the beginning of a gradual, but far-reaching, overhaul of corporate South Africa. Over the next 10 years and beyond, groups such as Anglo American-De Beers, South African Breweries, Rembrandt, Anglovaal, Old Mutual and Sanlam, which dominate South African corporate life, are likely to be significantly restructured. Two factors will determine the pace and extent of this restructuring: the vigour with which a future government might pursue anti-trust policies, and the extent to which corporate South Africa voluntarily restructures, for reasons either of self-preservation or economic self-interest. The African National Congress, likely to be the largest partner in any future government, is committed to introduce anti-monopoly, anti-trust and mergers policies weaken the influence of the country's largest groups, and promote private sector efficiency. There is also considerable support for unbundling in the investment community where many hold the view that the economy has become too concentrated, stifling initiative in the process. With the exception of Gencor, however, corporate South Africa has shown little enthusiasm for unbundling. Most captains of industry are not convinced unbundling has economic merit. Anglo American, in particular, has defended its size with vigour, sophistication and some success. Ultimately, however, these arguments, couched mostly in economic terms, are unlikely to sway the ANC, which objects to the degree of corporate influence exercised by a few whites. Yesterday's announcement is only the first salvo in a long debate. And practical barriers to unbundling have to be addressed - most obviously, who, other than the existing large groups, will buy the assets of companies that unbundle. Gencor's announcement will certainly force some of the other large groups to take a harder look at unbundling, if only because the onus of proof has shifted towards those favouring the status quo.

0,FT943-13 ,"FT943-13 _AN-EI3DUAIQFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - World's Economies - Developing Countries (56): Not growing, but recovering - Africa      By TONY HAWKINS   After a dismal decade of stagnation and decline, sub-Saharan Africa can, at last, see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel. This is the result of firmer commodity prices, faster world trade growth, accelerating economic reforms in many countries, and the remarkably smooth political transition in South Africa. The IMF forecasts growth of 3.4 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1995  -well above the average 2.2 per cent over the past decade. However, this marginally brighter prospect should be seen in perspective. Africa is not growing, but recovering. In the past 10 years, per capita incomes fell 0.8 per cent a year. Nor is the recovery solidly based. Events in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda, ongoing hostilities in Angola and the uneasy mood in Mozambique ahead of the October elections underscore its fragility. Tensions in Nigeria and Zaire could any day spill over into serious regional economic disruption. A recent research paper by World Bank economists William Easterly and Ross Levine* explains the region's poor performance 'statistically' in terms of poor education, political instability, weak infrastructure and financial systems, overvalued exchange rates, ethnic diversity and 'troubles with neighbours'. This last effect is explained in terms of critical mass; the writers argue that if African neighbours act together to reform their economic policies, as indeed is happening increasingly now, there will be positive spillover and demonstration effects across national borders. This leads them to conclude, optimistically, that Africa's poor growth performance is 'very much reversible', even if some adverse factors, such as poor education and infrastructural decay, will have long-lasting effects. Factor into their analysis, a rejuvenated South African economy, and the potential for positive cross-border spillovers is considerable. At current exchange rates, following the 50 per cent devaluation of the CFA Franc in January, South Africa's GDP of Dollars 120bn falls not very short of that of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa - Dollars 135bn to Dollars 140bn. South Africa's economy, too, has stagnated for the past dozen years, and its return to growth of 4 per cent annually, which is not unrealistic, would be a significant boost for the regional economy, especially for southern Africa. There are two distinct schools of thought on this. On one side, it is argued that the South Africans will be so preoccupied with their own internal problems - especially the successful implementation of their social advancement programme, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), that they will pay little attention to the rest of the region in the immediate future. The alternative viewpoint holds that South Africa is on course to become the locomotive for much of sub-Saharan Africa, partly as a growing market for African primary products and some low-price manufactures, but more importantly as an exporter of capital, skills and services. It's no coincidence that South African firms are in the forefront of the privatisation of hotels and cement plants in Mozambique, the planned sell-off of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, involved in tourism in East Africa, manufacturing and mining in Botswana and Zimbabwe and the development of the region's financial infrastructure. While western banks are pulling in their horns in Africa, Stanbic, South Africa's leading banking group, has expanded by taking over the African operations of ANZ Grindlays. Fledgling stock exchanges being set up all over the continent will benefit from South African advice and expertise. There is enormous, largely untapped potential for integrated tourism programmes linking destinations in Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Botswana and Zimbabwe with South Africa. South Africa's Escom is becoming the hub of a regional energy grid, drawing on Pretoria's excess capacity but also electricity imports from Mozambique's Cahora Bassa, and South African investors may develop the Pande gas deposit in Mozambique. The 1992 drought was a reminder of just how dependent southern Africa had become on South Africa's transport system, in spite of ambitious donor-funded programmes which were intended to reduce that dependence. The bulk of the maize and wheat needed came in through South Africa. The trade numbers tell the same largely lopsided story. In 1992, South Africa had an estimated trade surplus of R13.8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) with the rest of Africa. Most of this was with its Southern African Customs Union (SACU) partners - Botswana, Lesotho, Swaziland and Namibia - which between them accounted for R9bn. But it also had sizeable trade surpluses with Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mauritius and Mozambique. While such a one-sided trade pattern - African exports to South Africa were worth R2.6bn compared with imports of R16.4bn - is a cause of concern to both sides, it is likely to get worse rather than better. African countries are finding South African products to be cheaper (in some cases), often more appropriate, and frequently more readily available with shorter lead times. The Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum development in Zimbabwe announced last month will source much of its capital equipment from South Africa. At the same time, there is little appetite in South Africa itself for the rest of the region's goods, which are largely poor quality, and cannot compete with imports from Asia. The signs are that the existing south-north trade and payments gap will widen, despite increased purchases of African primary goods - Kenyan coffee, Malawian tea, Botswana soda ash, Angolan oil, Zimbabwean tobacco and Zambian copper - by South African firms and increased tourist spending by holidaymakers from the south. Southern Africa, in particular, has much to gain from closer co-operation in transport, energy, tourism and even education, but hopes of a regional free trade area and of broadening the existing rand monetary area to include other countries, are almost certainly premature. The hearts are willing, the rhetoric is there in spades, but harsh economic reality speaks otherwise. At the end of the day, few African leaders are prepared to surrender an ounce of what little of economic autonomy they have managed to salvage from bilateral and multilateral donors, and multinational corporations. Whether South Africa's re-emergence will be the catalyst providing the neighbourly spillover for the rest of the region is highly problematic. President Mandela and his largely untried team have to prove that they can break the African mould, delivering the east Asian cocktail of rapid growth with improved equity, that has eluded the often-feeble efforts of the rest of the continent. History, and hard economic numbers are against them, but at the tail-end of a decade of wasted aid and often-ineffectual policy reform in sub-Saharan Africa, the new South Africa is the region's best bet. * Africa's Growth Tragedy.

However, as Derek James now  reports from Gaborone, the locals of Botswana have also been  making their own panic moves.    [Begin James recording] Botswana is attractive to South  Africans because of its closeness, stability, and peace.  Already stories abound and are confirmed by top Bank of  Botswana officials of large amounts of South African rands being  handed over to banks here. Monday's (?free) fall of the South  African currency is not only a message of a collapse in overseas  confidence, but also a strong signal to those who have money to  get it out of South Africa. One such person handed over 300,000  in South African rands, that is 50,000 pounds, into a Botswana  bank account last week. Most South Africans are still not rich  enough to afford top Botswana hotels and are staying with  friends, but in Zimbabwe and Namibia the caravan parks are  already filling up. Some South Africans will simply be making  temporary use of neighboring countries.    Botswana itself is stocking up in preparation for a dramatic  drop in supplies of food. Over 80 percent of our food comes  from South Africa and traders have been warned that strikes,  hijacking of vehicles, and the celebrations will mean limited  supplies for at least four successive weeks. A senior Bank of  Botswana official assured (?journalists) last week that  Botswana's currency will be protected, but a dramatic 6.8  percent drop in the South African rand since January is bound to  affect the Botswana pula, which is partly linked to the rand.  People in Botswana are filling their cupboards with tinned  food, as they hear of South Africans' advice to stock up with  food and water, gas cookers, candles, and matches, as the great  days of election and freedom approach.    The shortages of food will hit the neighboring countries  first, although the influx of money will be a temporary  blessing, as Botswana is merely being used a conduit for the  outflow of cash.

0,FT943-13714 ,"FT943-13714 _AN-EGRD8AFPFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (32): Generous Gatt 'window' - Exporters are finding new markets open for trade      By MARK SUZMAN   South African exporters are a little overwhelmed by their new-found international respectability. After years of developing expertise in such arcane skills as transhipping and re-labelling to try and counteract sanctions imposed as a result of apartheid, companies find that many countries are now rolling out the red carpet, and new markets from Asia to eastern Europe to Latin America - long out of bounds - are now open for trade. As part of this new order, the South African government is starting to formalise its trading relationships. At the top of the list comes readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. South Africa's formal submission to the Uruguay Round was accepted late last year and a fundamental restructuring of its tariff structure will shortly get under way to bring the country more in line with international norms. The adjustments required by Gatt will involve pain for some highly protected industries but, by securing classification as an 'economy in transition', South Africa has managed to get a generous eight-year window for leading employment-oriented industries, such as textiles and motor vehicles, to adjust to the new arrangement. The deal also allows some leeway in the reorganisation of South Africa's contentious, and widely abused, General Export Incentive Scheme. Meanwhile, new trade agreements are giving further impetus to trade growth. President Clinton gave South Africa GSP status in May, allowing preferential access to the US market for a wide range of goods, and the European Union has announced its intention to do the same by the end of the year. A more formal, separate trade treaty with the European Union is under discussion, as is the possibility of some kind of associate member status with the Lome aid group. Also on the agenda are a set of new regional trade arrangements. At the World Economic Forum meeting last month, President Mandela and other southern African leaders signalled their intention to work towards a regional free trade agreement. As a first step towards this goal, in August South Africa will join the South African Development Community, a grouping of 10 southern African states originally formed to try and reduce dependence on South Africa. In the shorter term, Mr Trevor Manuel, trade and industry minister, has already signalled his intention to restructure the South African Customs Union, which South Africa shares with Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland and in which it currently pays out some R5.6bn of a customs and excise revenue pool of R16.3bn to its partners. It is also seeking to renew a bilateral trading arrangement with Zimbabwe. Reflecting all this activity, exports have been soaring, and in 1993 totalled R78.3bn as the country ran a current account surplus of R5.9bn  - although this year's surplus is likely to be lower due to a higher import bill. But despite this success, the majority of exports are still primary products and while the proportion of manufactured goods has been increasing there is still a lot of room for improvement. A survey of exporters by the South African Foreign Trade Organisation estimates that South Africa's manufacturing industry is at a 15 per cent cost disadvantage to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, with its only comparative advantage in electricity. In addition, the report notes that after years of focus on the domestic market, local manufacturers have a 'tendency to blame external factors' for failures, and many fail to take export promotion and planning seriously. 'South African manufacturers still lack an export culture,' acknowledges one senior trade official. 'Until that changes, growth will be disappointing.'   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

On the third day of anti-govermnent protests, riot police  fought running battles with protesters, firing buckshot and  teargas to put down the unprecedented unrest in the homeland.    To add to political woes besetting President Lucas Mangope's  government, the African National Congress [ANC] called for a  mass stayaway from work in Bophuthatswana on Thursday and the  launching of a consumer boycott.    Pule Sekwana, speaking for civil servants who have embarked  on a widespread strike that has triggered much of the unrest in  the homeland, said on Wednesday: ""The strike will continue and  we will bring down the government down.""    In the first death in the unrest, the homeland's information  service said the policeman was shot dead ""by members of the  public"" in the Bophuthatswana township of Mabopane, north-west  of Pretoria. The policeman was at a police post when gunfire cut  him down.    A doctor at a Mafikeng surgery told SAPA he had treated 35  people for gunshot wounds on Wednesday afternoon and another  victim for other injuries. Those treated were apparently victims  of police shooting protesters late on Wednesday afternoon around  the capital Mmabatho and in neighbouring Mafikeng. Another man  was treated for gunshot wounds at Mafikeng's Victoria Hospital.    ""Most of the people we treated were shot in the torso and  upper body, and we removed buckshot from many of the wounds. We  also treated a number of grazes which could have been caused by  sharp ammunition,"" said Dr Anwel Hoosenmia, who treated the 35  victims at his surgery.    Earlier, riot police clashed with students at the University  of Bophuthatswana, firing volleys of teargas shells as the  students erected barricades with rocks and tree branches and  hurled stones at the police. No injuries were reported. The  street outside the university campus resembled a battle field  with streets signs and huge garbage skips blocking the road and  access to the campus still being controlled by heavily armed  police.    The Independent Electoral Commission [IEC], meanwhile,  failed  on Wednesday in its bid to impose its authority in the homeland,  after two-hour talks with President Mangope and his cabinet.  ""The government of Bophuthatswana stated it is unable to  accede to the iec requests as this would be tantamount to  acceptance of the non-recognition of Bophuthatswana's  sovereignity,"" said a joint statement released after the  meeting. The IEC delegation was headed by its chairman, Mr  Justice Johann Kriegler.    The IEC requested the homeland government to permit  electioneering and voter education campaigns and to allow voting  facilities for South African citizens.    Mr Justice Kriegler said the meeting had clearly failed to  achieve its objectives and delegates would have to continue  trying to negotiate an agreement. he told reporters after the  meeting that the Transitional Executive Council and the South  African Government might take ""such action as they see fit""  following Bophuthatswana's rejection of its demands.    The TEC said on Tuesday it would cut diplomatic ties with  the  homeland, cut financial assistance and restrict the movement of  the homeland's officials in South Africa if Bophuthatswana  failed to allow free political activity within a week.    Bophuthatswana's Economic Affairs Minister Ephraim Keikelame  accused South Africa on Wednesday of ""aggression and  intimidation"" and ""denying the rights of Bophuthatswana citizens  of self-determination"". He said south african citizens living  in Bophuthatswana had ""the right to vote freely if they want to  campaign on the soil of South Africa but not in Bophuthatswana"".    But the homeland's striking civil servants, demanding  protection for their pensions in the face of political  developments in South Africa, said they were now also pressing  for the immeditae reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South  Africa. The homeland is to be reincorporated into South Africa  after the April 26-28 elections.    The strike has triggered the worst unrest seen in  Bophuthatswana in its 17 years of ""independence"". Schools have  been closed and health services and general government  administration severely disrupted.    And a day after striking employees of the homeland's  broadcasting corporation took President Mangope's son hostage,  the president on Wednesday fired all workers and announced the  closure of radio and television broadcasts. The striking  Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation workers are demanding a  50 per cent pay increases.    ""The Bophuthatswana cabinet today decided to close Bop  Broadcasting Corporation's [BBC] two television stations, Bop-TV  and Mmabatho TV, and the three radio stations, Radio Bop, Radio  Mmabatho and Radio Sunshine, until further notice,"" BBC Chairman  Eddie Mangope announced in a statement.    President Mangope, who survived a military takeover in 1988  after South Africa sent in troops to put down the rebellion, has  accused Foreign Minister Pik Botha of stoking unrest in  Bophuthatswana to justify his ouster and military intervention.    Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance Movement]  leader Euguene Terreblanche, joining the fray, on Wednesday  offered to send his militants to the homeland to help Mr Mangope  withstand what Mr Terreblanche called an African National  Congress/SA Communist Party/Pik Botha plot. On Tuesday the  Conservative Party charged the chaotic events in the homeland  were a ""communist textbook case"".    In another development striking teachers marched to the  South  African Embassy in Mmabatho on Wednesday to demand South  Africa's military intervention in the homeland.    Following the late afternoon clashes around Mmabatho, Dr  Hoosenmia said he and his wife, Dr Sumedha Munim, spent most of  the afternoon treating victims at their Mafikeng surgery. A  police armoured personnel carrier Hippo was parked outside. Dr  Hoosenmia said patients in the surgery were prevented from  leaving the premises by the police. Two of those treated in the  surgery were sent to hospitals in South Africa as their wounds,  both in the stomach, were too serious to be treated in the  surgery.    The centre of Mafikeng on Wednesday night still showed signs  of the running battles with dirtbins thrown on streets and  garbage littering most of station street in the city centre.  Many store windows shattered in the unrest had been been  replaced while glazers were working in the dark to repair other  damaged shopfronts.    Staff at PG Glass in Mafikeng went on strike at 4pm, leaving  only one company, Motorglow, to repair the many broken plate  glass windows. Motorglow also replaced more than 100 car  windows and windscreens on Wednesday afternoon.     "

Having based its foreign policy on defending rights of the  world's oppressed, from the triumph of the Islamic revolution in  1979, Tehran, which severed ties with racist Pretoria, is to  resume its economic and political relations now that a popularly  elected government has come to power in South Africa.    The Iranian Cabinet approved establishment of  economic-political ties with South Africa in January 1994 with  the collapse of apartheid and commissioned the Foreign Ministry  to pave the way for removing the sanctions against the country  and set up relations with it.    Economic and political experts anticipate establishment of  firm and multilateral relations between Iran and South Africa  and foresee steady expansion in the future.    According to informed sources, South Africa, which was once  the main consumer of Iranian oil, intends to resume its economic  ties with Iran by importing crude oil, and the first official  agreement to be signed between the two countries is expected to  include the supply of Iranian crude oil for South African  refineries.    Iran expressed interest in improving its economic and trade  ties with the country a month after the lifting of United  Nation's economic sanctions against it.    Now it is expected that Iran would play an active and  substantial role in South Africa's economic programmes and that  the two countries' volume of exchange would rise to dlrs.  [dollars] 100 per annum very soon.    The valuable experiences of Iranian experts and specialists  over the years of reconstruction following the victory of the  revolution would enable them to have an active part in  development of housing and power generation in South Africa  which declared it would spend dlrs. 108 billion on housing,  electricity and employment within the coming five years.    [Word indistinct] the lack of a clear prospect in Iran's  economic relations with South Africa, experts believe that  mutual interests and connections between the two nations and  their leaders provide a proper foundation for Tehran and  Pretoria to build up deep political, economic, cultural and  social ties.

I want to tell you that Commander in Chief Fidel  Castro will be leaving for South Africa this morning to  participate in the inauguration of President-elect Nelson  Mandela tomorrow.    Fidel Castro arrived in Accra at 2230 and was welcomed by  his  friend Jerry Rawlings who gave him a hearty, friendly embrace at  the foot of the stairs as Castro deplaned at the international  airport. Castro and Rawlings then left for Rawlings' guest house  and had a long talk there, during which they discussed bilateral  and international matters, as well as Cuba's current situation.  I believe that because of the two presidents' admiration for the  South African cause and for President-elect Mandela, South  Africa is also a main point of their conversation.    Relations between Cuba and Ghana have been very close over  the past few years, especially since Jerry Rawlings' has been in  office. Rawlings has visited Cuba twice: in 1979 to attend the  sixth summit of the nonaligned countries and again in 1989, when  he carried out a broad program of activities that included  participating in the 26 July celebrations in Cienfuegos Province.    The two countries have also adopted, at different  international forums, common positions on just causes, when  firmness and willingness were indispensable, for facing up to  great enemy pressures.    Here in Ghana, Cuban cooperation has been noted in the  spheres of health and education, among others, which strengthens  our relations and spirit of cooperation. Also, dozens of young  Ghanaians are studying in Cuba.    Presidential delegation members Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon de Quesada, and Rosa Elena Simeon met with Cuban  personnel here and learned about their work in Ghana. Also, the  delegation members reported on the main activities taking place  in our country.    We are now ready to leave for Pretoria, South Africa, where  the Cuban delegation is to participate in Nelson Mandela's  inauguration. Many officials here in Ghana said Fidel could not  be absent from such a significant event in South Africa. The  Cuban ambassador to Ghana told us this, and that the presence of  the Commander in Chief in South Africa is greatly appreciated.  [passage omitted]     "

Here are their answers:    The National Party Keeps Its Promises    [NP leader F.W. de Klerk] This week heralds the beginning of  a new life for all South Africans. The quality of that life  will depend on how you vote -- that is the heartbeat of  democracy. Before you vote I want to share a few ideas with you:    I have had the honor of serving as state president for the  past five years. As the leader of the National Party I have  promised to lead our nation into a new period of freedom. I  have kept that promise. I have promised to end apartheid, and I  have. I have promised to release Nelson Mandela and to unban  political parties, and I have done that. I have promised to  hold free elections in which all people would be allowed to  vote. I have kept that promise. I have promised to lay down  the basis for justice. That has been done. I have kept all my  promises.    After the election we will have a government of national  unity. This means that the most important political parties will  share power. It is in the best interest of the country that the  National Party leads that government. If we can get the  majority of your votes then I can continue my work for a  prosperous and peaceful South Africa. It is not just enough to  have free and fair elections. The elected government should act  in the best interest of the people:     -  We must create job opportunities so that all our people  can support their families and can be independent of the state.    -  We must build houses so that all our people can be  accommodated.    -  We must ensure that effective standards of education and  health  care is available to all.    -  To achieve all these things we have to manage the economy in  such a way that businesses, large and small, can flourish.    -  Above all we must have respect for law and order so that  violence, crime, and intimidation, can be wiped out from society.    -  We must replace racial tension with harmony. We must replace  hate with goodwill. We must promote strong family values.       In this way this huge nation of ours -- all its people --  will remain the richest nation in Africa and occupy a front seat  in the league of nations. The National Party stands for the  same plan which has ensured the prosperity of several nations  throughout the world. The ANC would like to do all these  things, but can they? They do not have any experience in  government. They make promises they cannot keep. They are in  alliance with communists (SACP) [South African Communist Party)  who have totally unacceptable ideas on how to manage the  economy. Their plans will ensure the collapse of the economy.  They were involved in violence far too often to be trusted to  end it. The only safe option for you -- those desiring peace,  reconciliation, and a prosperous future -- is to vote for the  National Party. With your help I promise that we will build a  great new South Africa. And as you know, the National Party  keeps its promises.    The ANC Has a Plan for South Africa    [ANC leader Nelson Mandela] South Africa is in a mess as a  result of the National Party's policy of apartheid. Nearly 50  percent of all South Africans are unemployed, there is a  shortage of at least 6.5 million homes, and three times more  money is spent on educating white children, compared to that  spent on black children. South Africa is being torn apart by  violence and crime, directly linked to unemployment and the fact  that many people are hungry. The only way to address these  problems is to give our people hope and to ensure that they will  have a better life after 27 April. This cannot be done with  vague promises and by spending most of the time attacking other  parties, like the National Party and Democratic Party are doing,  without a plan on how to save South Africa from the present  decline.    The ANC has a plan:     -  We have a plan to create 1.5 million job opportunities  within the next five years through a public works program,  similar to the ""New Deal"" [preceding two words in English] so  successfully applied by Franklin D. Roosevelt in the U.S. after  the Great Depression. Such a public works program will be  labor-intensive and will help to build houses and roads, and  will provide electricity and running water in townships  [preceding word in English], denied to the people for years.    -  We will support small business development and also create  new  job opportunities.    -  The apartheid system of education will be rationalized and  one  National Department of Education will be created in order to  effectively use funds to ensure 10 years of free education for  every child.       These are just a few of the concrete plans we have to ensure  a better life for all in our country. No other party has such  an extensive plan. Our children and grandchildren should never  experience the violence and suffering, the injustice and pain,  that we have experienced. They should enjoy their childhood and  should feel safe with their families. They should be raised  with equal opportunities so that they can explore all  opportunities. I call on all South Africans to build on  reconciliation, peace, and a better life for all. Now is the  time. Vote ANC.    Self-determination can lead to a better life for all    [Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi] In spite  of their differences, I beleive that Zulus and Afrikaners have  one thing in common -- a fundamental belief in the principle and  practise of self-determination. Self-determination does not lie  at the root of conflict and of competition, but it is a  complementary factor and could lead to a better life for us all.  Because we blacks comprise the majority of the country's  population, self- determination will guarantee for us all  freedom from domination. I say this without rancor or reproof,  but if we want to be fair toward one another, and if we really  wish to find one another, we must accept that we suffered  terribly under the Afrikaners. They misused their power to  dominate others mercilessly.    We, the blacks, are now on the threshold of becoming the  'dominant' group in the country. But I cannot emphasize enough  that we are a people with a long history of accomodating other  people -- a history of cooperation and coexistence. We are  people whose commitment to reconciliation knows no bounds. We  can not forget, but we can always forgive. It is for this  reason that I can state with absolute certainty that we are  prepared to promise, indeed, guarantee, that we have no desire  whatsoever to dominate any other group, and specifically not the  Afrikaner.    Despite the horrors of our tragic past, now is the time to  look forward to a brighter common future, as brothers and  sisters. It may be that the Afrikaner dominated us, but they  were also dominated by others, and that is what gave rise to  Afrikaner nationalism and apartheid. We will not repeat that  mistake.    Support the FF [Freedom Front] for a homeland    [Freedom Front leader General Constand Viljoen] The Freedom  Front is not ashamed to say we are a Christian party working for  the maintenance of Christian values and the survival of the  Afrikaner in South Africa. Many Christians in this country are  concerned about the strong influence being exercised by the  communists within the ANC. A vote for the FF will give us the  opportunity to unashamedly testify to our Christianity in the  highest assemblies of the land. This does not mean we are giving  recognition to a communist constitution, but rather it offers us  the chance to fight communism and this imperfect constitution in  the political arena.    The argument is used that one should rather vote for the  National Party to vote against the ANC. That is totally wrong,  and does not take into account the new system of proportional  representation. Under the new electoral system the results are  calculated in percentages. So it could happen that in the Cape  the ANC might get 40 percent, the FF 30 percent, and the NP or  the Inkatha Freedom Party 30 percent. Should the anti-ANC  parties then agree on certain issues, they would together have  60 percent and they, not the ANC, would govern the region. So  no vote is lost, as was the case in the old system.    The FF stands for the same freedoms as the NP, but offers  you  self-determination as a further assurance for the future. If  the NP leaders are unable to keep a check on the ANC as a  government, how are they going to do so as an opposition? The  ANC dominated the NP in the negotiations, and used them to get  rid of opponents such as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei. Venda and  Transkei are not troubled because they support the ANC.  Self-determination as a modern concept must form part of any  future solution in South Africa. There are those for whom this  is not important. The 34th principle in the constitution makes  self-determination for our people and for other communities  possible. The proviso is that there must be sufficient support  within that community for self-determination. Without  self-determination for those peoples who desire it, we will have  no peace, but will simply become another African state with a  strong, dictatorial central government.    Prevent that by voting for the FF. That will also make it  possible for us to establish a homeland council. According to  Article 184 of the constitution, this homeland council will be  established after the election. That will become the most  important instrument for constitutionally making a homeland  possible in the new constitution.    The DP Promises Human Rights and Democracy    [Democratic Party leader Zach de Beer] The election campaign  is now nearing an end, and the Democratic Party [DP], after a  difficult beginning, is doing better and better. There are  several reasons for this. --- Human rights: There are fears  that the human rights which were so trampled upon during the  years of NP rule will again be in danger under a future  government which wants to hold too much power. Just as the NP  was a party of and for whites, so too an ANC government may feel  that its first duty is to see to its 'own people', and that  causes concern among South Africans about their personal rights.  The DP and its predecessors have shown for 35 years that they  can be trusted with the rights of the indivudual. In contrast  to other parties, the DP has never been identified with any  particular ethnic group, and offers a place to every South  African as an individual. We want to protect the citizen against  the misuse of power.    Economic management: The NP government intervened in the  economy on a large scale by, for instance, setting prices and  interest rates and by trying to manage the flow of labor. That  led to disastrous deterioration. The ANC, given its strong ties  with communism, will also be under pressure to apply central  planning methods. That, as current history has shown, never  succeeds. What does succeed is liberal democracy and free  enterprise--as has always been propagated by the DP. And people  are increasingly realizing this.    Prevent one-party domination: Opinion polls have indicated  that the ANC could achieve a two-thirds majority, which would  mean that to a large degree it would draw up the constitution  according to its will. That would be dangerous, and we must  prevent them from getting that kind of majority. The DP, which  has opposed apartheid for all these years, is a party which can  effectively compete with the ANC, as shown by Prof. Maki Mandela  who decided that she could not vote ANC and chose the DP as her  alternative.    Peace: Among the important parties, the DP is the one which  has never been accused of being in any way involved in violence  -- except as a victim. Our hands are clean, and people know it.  So peace, which leads to stability and investment; democratic  values which create confidence; and lively political debate.  Liberal democracy with free enterprise. That is why the DP  deserves support.     "
0,FT944-16265 ,"FT944-16265 _AN-EJND7AB7FT 941014   FT  14 OCT 94 / The Conservatives in Bournemouth: Vouchers plan for nursery education - Major to guarantee schooling for four-year-olds      By JAMES BLITZ   Mr John Major is expected to say today that his government will introduce a voucher system for nursery education - guaranteeing schooling to every child at the age of four. Following strong pressure from parents, educationalists and teachers the prime minister is due to announce in today's speech to the Conservative conference that the parents of every four-year-old will be given a voucher to fund a place at a nursery or at a reception class in a primary school. The reform, which will affect 600,000 children, is expected to cost the government well over half a billion pounds. It is understood that in spite of the stringency of this year's public spending round the Treasury has approved Department for Education plans to introduce such a scheme within the next two years. There was speculation last night, however, that there would be no provision for three-year-old children, as has been promised by the Labour party. The pressure to extend nursery education built up amid signs that the UK was trailing behind France, Belgium and the Netherlands in providing schooling to three and four-year-olds. However, the UK's provision is slightly ahead of the US and Japan. Britain's public-sector nurseries provide places for 38 per cent of three-year-olds and 56 per cent of four-year-olds. Late last year the prime minister called for nursery education to be provided for all children, but acknowledged that there was a short-term funding barrier. On primary and secondary education, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, yesterday announced tougher standards for teaching English in England and Wales. Mrs Shephard told Tory representatives at Bournemouth that a tougher curriculum for English language teaching would be introduced next year, amid widespread concern that standards of literacy have slipped sharply in recent years. She also launched an initiative to raise public consciousness about the need for good communication skills, inviting leaders of business and industry to tell the government about their experience in this area. She said: 'I want to put together a national campaign, inviting politicians, industry, the media and business to raise awareness about the need for clear communication. It is very important that people in business understand the importance of communicating clearly with the customer.' Mrs Shephard assured representatives that the government would impose a period of stability in primary and secondary education in the next few years to allow its recent reforms to take root. She made clear that the workload on teachers imposed by the national curriculum would be sharply reduced following the implementation of a report by Sir Ron Dearing, the chief curriculum adviser. Announcing that she would accept Sir Ron's report in full, Mrs Shephard told journalists that 20 per cent of the timetable for primary school teachers would be flexible and 40 per cent for secondary schools.

But it stopped short of blaming senior ANC officials for the abuses, writes Patti Waldmeir in Johannesburg. In a report released yesterday, a three-man commission appointed by ANC president Nelson Mandela echoed criticisms from an earlier internal commission of inquiry, saying that ANC security officers had beaten, tortured, detained without trial, and in some cases executed detainees. But it named only two senior ANC officials and accused them of relatively minor abuses. More serious findings were made against members of the ANC's security branch, and the commission recommends that they be disciplined under the ANC's internal code of conduct.

In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television  that  was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: ""The  effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's  independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the  elimination of apartheid.""    Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle  waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their  objectives, saying: ""Sooner or later, Namibia would have been  independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway.""    Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's  leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban  leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to  reach ""this political miracle,"" which I view as a very great  victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the  progressive forces.    The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of  Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the  high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded  yesterday.    When asked about conditions for normalizing relations  between  Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the  economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than  30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel.    Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for  the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and  sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the  political, economic, and social system they consider best must  be respected.    Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and  that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install  socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro  affirmed: ""We have nothing against the United States.""    The Cuban president praised the recently concluded  conference  in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and  industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the  degradation of the environment.     "

Qian expressed his satisfaction with the smooth growth of  bilateral ties, adding that China and Zaire enjoy a traditional  friendship which he believed has stood the test of time.    He stressed that China places great importance on developing  its ties with Zaire and intends to make concerted efforts  together with Zaire to enhance bilateral cooperation in every  field.    Qian said he appreciates and supports the efforts that Zaire  has made in safeguarding its state independence and sovereignty  and its stand opposing foreign interference, which speaks highly  of Zaireans' efforts to overcome difficulties and resume  national stability.    He noted that Zaire is an important country in Africa and  its  stability and development will be of great importance to Central  Africa and the whole continent.    Qian pointed out that dramatic changes in the international  situation has brought many new difficulties and problems to  Africa.    Meanwhile, he said, they also stimulate the African people's  new awakening.    Qian noted that more and more African countries have come to  realize that their common aspirations are to oppose foreign  interference, safeguard political stability and seek economic  development.    He said it is of great importance for African countries and  other developing countries to strengthen unity and cooperation.    The Chinese Government supports African countries' efforts  toward the realization of peace and development on the continent.    Qian asked Ngbanda to convey the Chinese leaders' greetings  to Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.    During the meeting Ngbanda conveyed a letter from President  Mobutu to Chinese President Jiang Zemin, adding that Zaire and  China have a very good relationship and that it is his hope that  such ties will grow in a wide range of areas.

Rand Merchant Bank, one of South Africa's three largest investment banks, is to borrow Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.4m) from a syndicate of international banks within the next two weeks, according to Citibank, the US bank which is arranging the deal. Although the amount is relatively small, larger deals are likely to follow. Gencor, the South African mining company, is expected to come to the syndicated loans market at the end of this year with a seven-year Dollars 537.5m loan to help finance the company's acquisition of Shell's Billiton metals and minerals business. These loans are emerging as South Africa seeks a debt rating from the international rating agencies, and follow the completion in July of the first global offering of convertible bonds by a South African company, a Dollars 300m deal for Liberty Life, the country's largest life insurance company. South Africa plans to tap the international bond market, when it has acquired a rating. Many international banks are keen to lend to South Africa which is viewed as a high growth area but which has been largely closed as a result of sanctions. In a syndicated loan, one or two banks arrange a transaction and parcel out portions of the loan in order to share the risk. Citibank, which is in the process of sounding out interest among other banks, said the loan will have a final maturity of one year with individual drawings maturing in 90 to 180 days. It said European banks are expected to be the main participants but also reported strong interest from the Middle East.   Companies:-  Rand Merchant Bank.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Profits for the 53 weeks to September 30 of Pounds 552m against Pounds 508m also benefited from an extra week of trading. Turnover for the year was flat at Pounds 4.45bn. Current trading was encouraging, however, said Mr Ian Prosser, chairman. UK consumer spending was picking up in areas such as pub retailing and soft drinks, although brewing was 'just grinding along'. The continental economy was showing some signs of improvement. Overall, the City was encouraged by the results and a few analysts raised their forecasts slightly for the current year. The shares, which had been weak in recent weeks on fears of mixed news from the group, rose 15p to 519p. Holiday Inn operating profits rose by 18 per cent to Pounds 151m. US hotels, contributing Dollars 203m (Pounds 124m), enjoyed increased occupancy rates and a modest improvement in room rates. Holiday Inn's best region was Europe, the Middle East and Africa with profits up 57 per cent to Dollars 22m thanks to aggressive promotion and UK growth. Brewing was Bass's only setback. Profits fell by 10 per cent to Pounds 140m (Pounds 156m). The company stressed, however, that the latest period included an extra Pounds 12m in duties and Pounds 16m in restructuring charges. The underlying fall in profits was about 3 per cent, one analyst calculated. Beer volume was up 1 per cent with Bass maintaining its position as the largest UK brewer with some 23 per cent of the market. However, analysts believe volume was down 1 per cent, adjusting for the extra week's trading. Bass reported strong growth in its national brands such as Carling and Grolsch lagers and a 6 per cent rise in cask ales. Pub profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 220m. The number of managed pubs fell by 10 per cent but beer volume per pub was up 3 per cent and food takings rose 5 per cent in the Toby chain and 20 per cent elsewhere. Profits from leased pubs rose 3 per cent. Bass's leisure division reported a Pounds 2m rise in profits to Pounds 74m. Coral was the best performer, benefiting from a new format in some of its betting shops. Gala, the bingo chain, was ahead only Pounds 1m at Pounds 40m but will benefit this year from a trend towards much larger clubs. A final dividend of 14.5p is proposed for a total of 21.1p, up 6.6 per cent. Earnings per share were 40.1p, up 10.5 per cent from 36.3p. COMMENT Bass deserves full credit for progress at Holiday Inn which will likely continue for the foreseeable future. However, it is underperforming its competitors in UK brewing and pub retailing and it is finding it hard to grow turnover in a low inflation environment. A slow improvement in consumer spending will help it achieve pre-tax profits this year of about Pounds 580m for earnings of 42.3p. This puts the shares on a realistic discount of 8 per cent to the market multiple. Other stocks exposed to consumer spending or restructuring of the UK brewing industry offer better earnings growth than Bass.   Companies:-  Bass.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

Once considered a luxury, rice has become the chief staple food and major source of calories for some 70m of West Africa's 200m people. Output in the 17 countries that make up the region has risen by more than 5 per cent a year since 1980, doubling to a record 6.6m tonnes last year, the highest increase for any of the major cereal crops. The popularity of rice in West Africa, particularly among urban dwellers, means that consumption has shot up at an even faster rate than output, exceeding 9.5m tonnes in 1992. Some 3m tonnes had to be imported last year at a cost of Dollars 600m, putting a severe strain on scarce reserves of foreign exchange. While countries in the region are trying to encourage yet higher output, and cut down on imports, farmers are facing a number of problems that could put a brake on expansion. Rice is still a relatively new crop in West Africa and high-yielding varieties suitable for the region have yet to be developed. A research institute, the West Africa Rice Development Association, based in Bouake, Ivory Coast, which is trying to develop improved varieties of rice and encourage sustainable farming practices, is facing a funding crisis. Warda, which was set up in 1970, was recently forced to close one of its stations in Sierra Leone because of the withdrawal of funds by USAid, The US government aid organisation. Two other research stations, at Bouake and at Saint Louis in Senegal, are down to skeleton staffs. The World Bank, one of Warda's largest donors, last year cut its annual funding from Dollars 1.785m to Dollars 1.5m, while the European Community slashed support from Dollars 532,927 to Dollars 324,000. Only two of the regions's 17 countries contributed funds for Warda's research, despite their interest in producing more rice from their own fields. 'If the countries who spend so much money importing rice, divert only a tiny fraction for us to do research it would help solve the problem,' said the association's director-general, Dr Eugene Terry. A panel of rice experts that conducted a review of Warda's work said that it had been 'reduced close to the level of critical mass, and in some aspects may already be below it. This is an extremely serious and urgent situation'. Most rice in West Africa is not grown in Asian-style paddies but by small farmers in upland areas without the benefit of irrigation. Africa's existing upland rice varieties are hardy but yield less than a tonne per hectare, compared with a global average of about 3.5 tonnes. Upland farmers in West Africa who apply fertiliser are averaging more than two tonnes a hectare, but fertiliser is not widely available. When Warda was first established, it concentrated on adapting high-yielding rice varieties developed in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere to West African conditions. It was hoped that these varieties could give Africans the benefits Asians were enjoying. But Warda admits that this approach proved 'misdirected'. In the hot dusty winds and extreme temperatures of West Africa the Asian varieties fared badly, and researchers are now trying to improve local varieties. Higher yielding varieties could have an important environmental spin-off, enabling farmers to allow longer fallow periods in between rice cultivation. Much of the expansion of rice output in West Africa has taken place because farmers have shortened these fallow periods, but at the risk of serious land degradation. Researchers point out that provided the right varieties can be found there is considerable potential to expand the output of rice from West African inland valleys. These valleys cover about 19m ha, and rice now only grows on about 5 per cent of them.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.   Industries:-  P0112 Rice.   Types:-  MKTS  Production.

The deal will be financed through a share-swap, and the price - estimated at about IPounds 20m (Pounds 19m) - will be calculated on the average share price of the first 28 days of trading of Argus Newspapers when the group is floated in April this year on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Independent is purchasing its stake from the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company and the Anglo-American Corporation. The deal will give the two companies around 4m new shares in the Independent group, equivalent to a 5 per cent stake. Independent will have effective control of Argus with its 31 per cent stake. Mr O'Reilly, who is also chief executive officer of Heinz, added that the smoothness of the transaction confirmed the commercial sense of doing business in South Africa. A team from Heinz was evaluating partnerships with local companies. Last week Independent Newspapers acquired a 24.99 per cent stake in Newspaper Publishing in the UK which publishes The Independent and Independent on Sunday. It also owns 20 per cent of APN, the Australian regional newspaper group. In 1992 it failed to acquire the Fairfax publishing group in Australia, and later failed to buy Mirror Group Newspapers in the UK. Argus Newspapers turned in pre-tax profit of R53m (Pounds 10m) on sales of R685m in 1993. The group's interests include the Star and the Sowetan, the country's most popular daily newspapers, as well as publications in Cape Town and Durban. Mr O'Reilly's ties with South Africa go back to his first visit in 1955 as a member of the British Lions rugby team. He shunned investment in South Africa during the apartheid era, but cultivated close links with Mr Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe's president, and then Mr Nelson Mandela. His commercial activities in southern Africa have been restricted so far to Olivine Industries, a joint venture with the Zimbabwe government.   Companies:-  Independent Newspapers.

That is  their intent. They even included this in a document known as the  New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with  Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We  have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we  are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding  anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with  a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow  circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the  establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at  this time, we could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son.  However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe  that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with  the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with  the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately  established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a  request from us.    However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be  established quickly because there are few countries with whom we  have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with  ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am  convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but  out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be  fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but  on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties  are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation  could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest  between Cuba and South Africa?    [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South  African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we  notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at  times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a  fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an  incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there  been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them  and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's  condition, on one hand they have great development and high  living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for  example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling,  and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was  introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told  they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with  the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task  ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even  though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed  country. It has important technology, important industries; yet  it has a large population that for many years has lived under  apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better  life.    Therefore, the government is faced with having to find  solutions to those problems. When you speak with the  transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you  speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great  needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about  their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public  health minister, you see their dreams of improving their  people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on  which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations.  This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on  our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on  their experiences, and technological development.    [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have  great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is  talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to  understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation  between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most  developed country in southern Africa.    You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the  transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough  means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have  good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the  wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a  superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world.    With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such  prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and  Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study  possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and  warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken  notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every  social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and  mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the  white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a  multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic  backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves.  Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation.    Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part  begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the  period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think  his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have  developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw  today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future.  Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved,  they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I  think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is  no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to  lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he  has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so  far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This  is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will  be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a  convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the  progressive forces?    [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of  the South African peoples, the African people, and all the  progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and  hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a  great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a  renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be  achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world  and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and  South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you  ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the  former capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments  in  history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a  certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South  Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace,  harmony, respect, and affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its  independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning  of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our  support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a  strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could  not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the  problem.    In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba  fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to  the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do  not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to  criticize. Perhaps history will record this.    This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to  me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words  from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct]  meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of  Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving  words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find  nothing to reproach.    In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to  make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct  decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to  be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be  strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In  such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if  you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it  happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was  possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives.  Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has  been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help  the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision  was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult  situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad  to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not  want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the  Angolans; it was others.    We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult  situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final  situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all  the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan  people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that  afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which  Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of  Resolution 435.    I think this helped accelerate the process of the South  African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and  decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action  might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see  it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We  should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The  South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless  and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived  diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as  they happened.    To date, I see the events and development of the situation  in  South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what  happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace,  harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for  and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and  sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to  the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones  experienced here.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that  this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to  the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I  quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle  many nations helped us, nations represented here today.    [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled  their blood.    Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt  to  history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting  on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or  19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it  began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of  Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese  colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago.    The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full  commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have  to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that  struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions  would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution.    All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that  information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban  Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history  of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and  solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of  Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are  independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation.  That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had  extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said  that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the  smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had  ulterior economic and material motives in Angola.    He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was  truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It  pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this  celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today.  There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a  day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no  longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that  their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we  are seeing.    Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more  supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection  with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I  believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our  cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of  solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence,  their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just  causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe  future generations will always remember this with pride.    However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by  ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down  history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write?    [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of  apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we  experienced it this morning at the inauguration.    [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the  birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the  extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity  among the South African people, among every sector, and every  ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that  this process continue developing in that direction.    There are many things remaining in this world to be buried,  however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the  increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words  indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural  resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number  of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number  of midwives of good.     "

In a message released in Pretoria by the Caribbean  delegation, Castro told the South African president-elect of the  Cuban people's joy over the establishment of a multiracial and  democratic government in South Africa.    The Cuban head of state said in brief statements to PRENSA  LATINA he wishes Mandela peace, harmony, and unity in the great  task he must fulfill as of tomorrow when, during a solemn  ceremony, he takes the oath as president of South Africa.    Castro had earlier expressed joy at being in South Africa  for  Mandela's inauguration. The two men will meet for the first  time in Pretoria tomorrow, during the solemn ceremony.    Castro added this is an important day: ""It is an opportunity  to experience an event of historic importance for the peoples of  Cuba and the world,"" he said.    The Cuban president is one of 42 heads of state who have  announced they would attend the event, which will also be  attended by many well-known figures.    The Caribbean statesman arrived in Pretoria by highway from  Johannesburg, where he arrived on Monday on a flight from Accra,  where he spent a 12-hour technical stopover en route from  Barbados.    Castro was welcomed in Ghana by his friend Ghanaian  President  Jerry John Rawlings, who within the past few hours also traveled  to South Africa where the presidents of Nigeria, Angola,  Zimbabwe, Sudan, and Palestine have already arrived.    A source close to the Cuban delegation disclosed Castro has  already received several requests for interviews and meetings  from heads of state and government, and from journalists who are  in South Africa.    Among the earliest requests were those from the presidents  of  Sudan, Nigeria, the PLO, and South African television stations.    It is expected the period following Mandela's inauguration  will be one of intense work for Castro, the source added.    The Cuban high-level delegation is lodged at the Arcadia  Hotel and consists of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Ricardo  Alarcon, president of parliament, and Environment, Science, and  Technology Minister Rosa Elena Simeon.

0,FT942-16902 ,"FT942-16902 _AN-EDGDVAGAFT 940407   FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (1): Service now worth having  -While recovery in the hotel market has been patchy, the message of the past few years is clear: hotel guests are demanding better service for less money. Even when the world economy has fully recovered, this trend is likely to survive      By MICHAEL SKAPINKER   During the 1980s, hotels around the world treated their guests so lavishly that people joked that the next treat would be a BMW on your pillow. By the early 1990s, hotel executives had stopped smiling and so had their guests. The Gulf War was followed by recession in the US and Europe. Hotel room rates fell, managers in many businesses lost their jobs, other feared they would do so, and everyone started cutting their travel expenses. Hotel business has now picked up in North America, London, and in much of Asia, where the downturn had not been so severe. The question hotel executives are asking is whether their guests will return to the free-spending habits of the 1980s, or whether their behaviour has changed for good. Mr Peter George, chief executive, of the Ladbroke Group of the UK, which owns the Hilton International chain, believes that hoteliers should not lose sight of the principles of supply and demand. Hotel rates have been depressed because rooms have been empty. When rooms are full again, rates will rise, he says. Mr Darryl Hartley-Leonard, the British-born president of Hyatt Hotels, believes, however, that hoteliers need to be aware of a more fundamental change. It is not just that hotel guests have been unable to afford additional luxuries over the past few years. Even when they have more money in their pocket, they will not want those luxuries, he believes. In a speech to a conference three years ago, Mr Hartley-Leonard recounted the BMW joke, and admitted that Hyatt had been as responsible as any other organisation for the hotel excesses of the 1980s. He said: 'The excesses of the 1980s have become socially unacceptable. We simply need to wake up and take advantage of new times. 'Less is more' doesn't mean quality has to deteriorate. It means that when you serve a Bloody Mary, you don't have to serve a vegetable garden on top of it. Hyatt, as much as any company, was responsible for growing that vegetable garden. It seems that all of us kept piling more and more on to the customer until it became crude.' Three years on, Mr Hartley-Leonard believes the reaction against hotel excesses will continue after an upturn in business. 'What happened in the US and what is happening in many parts of the world is that an element of conservatism is coming in. In the 1970s and 1980s matters got out of control. We created an unstable business environment. That has caused a rejection of waste. Anything that is reminiscent of the excesses of the 1980s is rejected as inappropriate,' he says. Mr Michael Stajdel, senior vice president for marketing and strategic planning at Inter-Continental Hotels, agrees, arguing that the change in hotel guests' attitudes mirrors developments in sectors such as retailing. Customers are not necessarily looking for the cheapest offer but they are considering their purchases more carefully. Mr Stajdel says: 'I don't think any consumer today shops the way he or she used to. We have all changed the way we shop in the supermarket. I look at the labels, the freshness of the goods, and at the overall cost.' Mr Stajdel, who is based in London, believes hotel guests will pay for services, if they believe they are worth having. So what services do hotel guests value? Hyatt's research shows that while hotel guests want choice, they do not need an excessive amount of it. They expect hotel restaurants to have enough staff to ensure they can be served promptly. Indeed, they want to spend less time in the restaurant than in the past. Offered a choice between a wine list with 100 bottles on it and one with 30, Hyatt says its guests opt for the smaller list. There are some new services that hotels need to introduce because guests constantly ask for them. Because 63 per cent of calls to its housekeeping departments were for an iron and an ironing board, Hyatt decided it was simpler to put these items in every room. Hotels in North America, Europe and Asia agree that hotel guests want less hassle and more time in which to work. Business travellers are expected to do more work on their trips than ever before and they are even prepared to pay extra for an environment which enables them to work more efficiently. This has led to the appearance in hotels of a service which airlines have been selling for years: special business sections for those prepared to pay for them. Business floors in hotels appeared in Asia some years back. Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, has such floors at its establishments in Singapore, Manila and Jakarta, where guests have their own check-in and check-out facilities and lounges, as well as facsimile machines in every bedroom. Inter-Continental, which also has business floors in Asia, has now begun to introduce them in Europe. The first was in Frankfurt, and the second is in London. Mr Stajdel describes the floors as having 'the ambience of a private club. It's intimate and clubby. There's a complimentary continental breakfast, a business centre, and a library with reference books and magazines.' Guests pay Dollars 25-Dollars 30 a night extra for the privilege. Mr Stajdel admits that one of the incentives for introducing business floors is that small, intimate 'boutique' hotels had been taking business away from the large chains. He argues that business floors provide guests with the intimacy and service of a small hotel, while still providing access to facilities only available in a large establishment, such as a choice of restaurants and a fitness centre. Even those hotel guests not paying to stay on the business floors have higher service expectations. Mr Hartley-Leonard says that they now want efficient business services rather than lavish gifts, and they want messages delivered on time and access to telephones and facsimile machines. If hotels are to deliver these services while still achieving acceptable levels of profits, they need to turn to technology to help them to do so. Technology can help to reduce the amount of time that travellers waste in hanging around. At Hyatt's hotels at O'Hare airport in Chicago and in Atlanta, the company has been testing automated check-in machines which, if successful, will be introduced throughout North America. Mr Hartley-Leonard says the machines are not designed to replace the reception desk, but to provide an alternative for guests who want simply to collect their keys and go straight to their rooms. The device looks like a bank's automated teller machine. A guest with a reservation inserts a credit card. Check-in information appears on the screen, the guest taps a series of Yes or No buttons, and the machine dispenses a room key. Guests can also check out of the hotel by inserting a credit card into the machine, which shows the expenses they have incurred during their stay and prints out a copy of the bill. Some people might regard the hotel checking-in machine as providing too impersonal a welcome after a long trip. Mr Hartley-Leonard argues that the same was thought about automatic cash dispensers. In time, these caught on.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- OVERALL PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS* 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Income                                       Average                Before                           Occupancy     Daily      Total      Fixed                                Rate      Rate    Revenue    Charges                                   %   Dollars    Dollars    Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All hotels                     61.6     72.20     32,968      8,469 Africa and the Middle East     60.8     65.82     30,666      8,329 Middle East                    72.4     66.21     42,683     13,288 Africa                         60.8     65.40     27,265      4,067 Asia and Australasia           69.7     77.93     34,937      9,735 Asia                           71.0     84.51     36,985     14,130 North Asia                     83.4     65.19     35,4593    10,889 Australia                      58.3     85.53     33,138      4,539 North America                  60.1     55.13     18,183      3,551 Canada                         54.3     69.85     21,427      3,620 United States                  60.1     54.33     17,794      3,551 Europe                         60.6     77.16     38,363     10,019 Continental Europe             62.4     104.3     44,570     10,243 United Kingdom                 58.0     70.41     36,431     10,325 Latin America                  58.7     58.05     19,645      2,455 Mexico                         60.4     66.31     24,285      2,552 South America                  50.1     44.73     15,747      2,775 Caribbean                      72.3     29.36     17,639      1,422  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on medians  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Howarth International  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

0," LA041790-0097   205592    April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition      Part A; Page 7; Column 1; Foreign Desk      508 words      STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUE, MANDELA SAYS;    APARTHEID: A SELLOUT CROWD OF 72,000 IN LONDON GATHERS TO CELEBRATE HIS FREEDOM  FROM PRISON.      From the Baltimore Sun      LONDON      African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela on Monday declared to a  potential worldwide television audience of 1 billion that apartheid in South  Africa will be ended only by ""struggle,"" including international sanctions.    Speaking from the stage of a sellout concert before 72,000 people at London's  Wembley Stadium to celebrate his freedom, he told television viewers in 60  countries: ""Reject any suggestion that the campaign to isolate the apartheid  system should be wound down.""    But expressing surprising optimism at the pace of reforms, he predicted: ""It  will not be long now before we see an end to the apartheid system. The dreams  of millions of people to see our country free and at peace will be realized  sooner rather than later.""    Calling for the transformation of South Africa from being ""the skunk of the  Earth"" to an ""exemplary oasis"" of democracy, good race relations and freedom  from poverty and human degradation, he said: ""It will be a proud day for  humanity when we are able to say that the apartheid crime against humanity is  no more.""    He reminded his audience that there are still political prisoners in South  African custody, saying: ""We should, therefore, treat this day of celebration  as one of re-dedication to the continuation and intensification of the struggle  for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners.""    The program was not televised in the United States, where it was deemed too  political, or in South Africa.    In a thinly veiled attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who  eased sanctions on South Africa earlier this year in response to political  reforms there, Mandela said:    ""It is only those who support apartheid who can argue that the Pretoria  government should be rewarded for the small steps it has taken, such as our  release, and the unbanning of the ANC and the other organizations.""    Thatcher lifted a ban on new British investments, without waiting for the  approval of her partners in the 12-member European Community.

From the Baltimore Sun      LONDON      African National Congress leader Nelson R. Mandela on Monday declared to a  potential worldwide television audience of 1 billion that apartheid in South  Africa will be ended only by ""struggle,"" including international sanctions.    Speaking from the stage of a sellout concert before 72,000 people at London's  Wembley Stadium to celebrate his freedom, he told television viewers in 60  countries: ""Reject any suggestion that the campaign to isolate the apartheid  system should be wound down.""    But expressing surprising optimism at the pace of reforms, he predicted: ""It  will not be long now before we see an end to the apartheid system. The dreams  of millions of people to see our country free and at peace will be realized  sooner rather than later.""    Calling for the transformation of South Africa from being ""the skunk of the  Earth"" to an ""exemplary oasis"" of democracy, good race relations and freedom  from poverty and human degradation, he said: ""It will be a proud day for  humanity when we are able to say that the apartheid crime against humanity is  no more.""    He reminded his audience that there are still political prisoners in South  African custody, saying: ""We should, therefore, treat this day of celebration  as one of re-dedication to the continuation and intensification of the struggle  for the emancipation of all the remaining political prisoners.""    The program was not televised in the United States, where it was deemed too  political, or in South Africa.    In a thinly veiled attack on British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who  eased sanctions on South Africa earlier this year in response to political  reforms there, Mandela said:    ""It is only those who support apartheid who can argue that the Pretoria  government should be rewarded for the small steps it has taken, such as our  release, and the unbanning of the ANC and the other organizations.""    Thatcher lifted a ban on new British investments, without waiting for the  approval of her partners in the 12-member European Community.

0,FT942-9045 ,"FT942-9045 _AN-EERD0AA5FT 940518   FT  18 MAY 94 / Harare sows seeds for an investment harvest / Review of the progress and potential of an ambitious structural adjustment programme      By TONY HAWKINS   Political transition in South Africa and economic reform in Zimbabwe are transforming the regional business climate, suggesting that Zimbabwe's investment promotion conference, starting in London tomorrow, will prove far more successful than its predecessor five years ago. Then, Zimbabwe had not embraced structural adjustment, and South Africa appeared headed for long-running, bloody confrontation. After a slow start in 1991, economic reform in Zimbabwe has accelerated over the past 18 months with two substantial tranches of exchange control and foreign payments liberalisation. This was complemented by price deregulation, labour laws and investment regulations, the commercialisation  -though not yet privatisation - of some state enterprises, the freeing of interest rates and a partial exchange rate float. In January, the Zimbabwe dollar was devalued by 17 per cent and quantitative import controls were abolished. A two-tier exchange rate system was created with exporters allowed to retain 60 per cent of their foreign earnings, selling the balance to the Reserve (central) Bank of Zimbabwe at the official exchange rate. Initially, the free market rate traded at a discount of some 5 per cent below the official rate of ZDollars 8 to the dollar, but the gap has since narrowed to less than 1 per cent, and the market is to be unified later this year when exporters will retain all their earnings and all current account transactions will have been liberalised. This cannot come too soon for some of the multinationals attending this week's meeting. In an effort to attract new investment, Zimbabwe has - mistakenly - favoured the relatively few newcomers (Tony O Reilly's Heinz and Algy Cluff's gold mines being the two most notable) over the long-standing players such as Unilever, Dunlop, Carnaud Metal Box, Barclays and Standard Chartered Banks . For the past decade, pre-independence investors were not allowed to remit more than 25 per cent of after-tax profits, while new arrivals were allowed 50 per cent. These regulations have since been loosened allowing post-1993 investors 100 per cent repatriation, while existing companies are allowed to remit 50 per cent of profits. Zimbabwe is committed to levelling the field, almost certainly this year which, with the eventual release of blocked funds, will stimulate increased investment activity by existing companies. Portfolio investment was liberalised last year when foreign investors were allowed to trade on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange. In the nine months since this reform took effect, foreigners have injected some Dollars 80m into the market contributing to the 300 per cent surge in share prices over the past year. All this is very different from the 1980s when foreign direct investment averaged a mere Dollars 20m a year. Inflows have since accelerated markedly averaging Dollars 60m a year since 1990. Two big new projects are in the pipeline; the Dollars 225m BHP-Utah platinum mine at Chegutu and a proposed Hong Kong-financed airport hotel and casino close to Harare. The Zimbabwe Investment Centre (ZIC), set up to facilitate and promote investment, approved 843 projects worth some ZDollars 5.6bn (Dollars 1.4bn) between 1989 and 1993. Of these, 100 were foreign and a further 159 were joint-ventures, valued at Dollars 470m, though not all of this represented foreign inflows. In the first quarter of 1994, a further 67 projects were approved, representing new investment of almost Dollars 200m, of which Dollars 63m was foreign or joint-venture. Zimbabwe needs much more; the most disturbing aspect of the ZIC numbers is the number of jobs created. Investment of some Dollars 800m in the last two and a half years has generated less than 35,000 new jobs. With an annual net addition of about 200,000 school-leavers to the labour market, the implication is that the country needs to invest nearly Dollars 5bn annually, or 25 per cent more than its GDP, merely to peg unemployment at its present level of around 30 per cent. Clearly, that is not going to happen, implying a combination of higher levels of unemployment and enhanced reliance on the informal sector. Higher investment levels are also needed to kick-start the sluggish economy. Since independence in 1980, real GDP growth has fallen behind the 3.1 per cent rate of population increase, expanding at 2.8 per cent annually. As a result real income per head is lower than at independence and 16 per cent below its peak of the mid-1970s. Assuming the economy can grow at a steady 5 per cent a year, it will take a decade to regain 1975 living standards. Policy reform is a significant part of the solution, but weak commodity prices, adverse weather conditions, and regional political instability have left their mark on the economy. With commodity prices seemingly on the upturn and the regional political environment better than any time for over 30 years, investment prospects have brightened considerably. Regional investment should improve with the political climate, but there are fears that investors, motivated as the International Finance Corporation notes, by market size more than anything else, will plump for South Africa's Dollars 112bn market rather than Zimbabwe's Dollars 4bn. For Pretoria's neighbours, it is a swings and roundabouts situation. Market size, infrastructure and logistics dictate that a stable South Africa, accounting for more than 80 per cent of southern African GDP, will attract the lion's share of new investment. But Zimbabwe with its relatively efficient infrastructure, its plentiful cheap labour and close proximity to the South African hub of Pretoria Witwatersrand-Vereeniging, should be able to exploit new and different market opportunities. For this to happen Zimbabwean business will have to rethink its strategy, seeking niche markets and going for joint-venture opportunities in alliances with South African business rather than risking head-on competition. None of this will happen without continuing, and urgent, policy reform and a stronger commitment to an economy, that welcomes foreign capital and skills and facilitates cross-border commerce and investment.

0,FT911-1316 ,"FT911-1316 _AN-BEGBDACGFT 910507   FT  07 MAY 91 / South African Bonds: Reform sparks interest among investors      By SIMON LONDON   MR F. W. DE KLERK, the South African president, appeared to gain few concessions from the dozen top bankers he met in London last month. However, the gradual reform of South African society is rekindling interest among international investors in the country's bond markets. At present, buying remains limited and confined mainly to retail investors looking for high-yielding assets. 'We saw a lot of financial institutions taking positions in the market in the early 1980s but now interest is mostly confined to retail client and retail trusts,' said Ms Marilyn Visser, head of gilt sales at Simpson McKie stockbrokers in Johannesburg. But, expressions of interest were sufficient for Credit Suisse to include a selection of rand-denominated bonds on its list of recommended bonds for the first time last week. Many of the investors committing funds to the South African market are betting on a convergence of the financial rand (in which international financial flows are transacted) and the commercial rand. The financial rand was re-introduced in 1986 precisely to attract overseas capital into the domestic economy. Overseas investors buy government bonds at the financial rand exchange rate, but coupon payments are paid at the commercial rate. The 20 per cent discount of financial rand (currently at around R3.35 against the dollar) against the commercial rand (currently at R2.78) has the effect of boosting yields. For example, Republic of South Africa bond issue No. 153 maturing 2010, currently yields 15.65 per cent to a South African resident, but 18.8 per cent to a non-resident. With inflation running at about 14 per cent, real yields would not be attractive but for this dual exchange rate. Moreover, if the financial rand continues to appreciate, international investors make a healthy capital gain. The differential between the two currencies was as high as 50 per cent in late 1986 but closed in the last year as foreign investment began to return to South Africa. The government expects the differential to continue to narrow and hopes to abolish the financial rand within three to five years. But this narrowing of the dual exchange rates may not necessarily come in a direction which benefits overseas investors. Rather than a further appreciation of the financial rand, some analysts are expecting a depreciation of the commercial rand. 'High inflation, the pursuit of growth and a weaker gold price will cause the commercial rand to fall towards the financial rand exchange rate,' argues Mr Richard Grey, bond market analyst at UBS Phillips  Drew in London. 'While the nature of political risk has changed in South Africa, the economic risks are still substantial.' The gold price is important to the exchange rate because the commodity accounts for almost half of South Africa's annual R42bn exports. These underlying risks have held back recent market performance. After an encouraging start to the year, prices have fallen as inflationary pressures in the economy have re-emerged and the political outlook has deteriorated.

In a report on Kenya*, Africa Watch accuses the government of instigating tribal clashes in which 1,500 people have died and hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes since the advent of the multi-party system in 1991. 'There is clear evidence that the government was involved in provoking this ethnic violence for political purposes and has taken no adequate steps to prevent it from spiralling out of control,' the report says. 'The conflict has been deliberately manipulated and instigated by President Moi and his inner circle and has undermined attempts to create an atmosphere conducive to political pluralism in Kenya.' 'The culture of violence that is taking root has made real the alarming possibility of civil war in Kenya,' the report says. The majority of the victims of the ethnic clashes are peasant farmers of the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and wealthiest ethnic group in Kenya, who are distrusted by President Moi, a Kalenjin, and his coalition of minority tribes. The report comes at an embarrassing time for Kenya, which is due to meet donors next week to discuss the restoration of financial aid. Although President Moi recently announced a Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) programme to resettle displaced victims, co-sponsored by the UN Development Programme, Africa Watch urges Kenya's donors to continue withholding aid until the government takes effective steps to curb the violence. 'These steps should include, at a minimum, the full and public investigation of allegations of the involvement of government officials in the violence, and the bringing of charges where there is evidence of wrongdoing,' it says. *Divide and Rule: state-sponsored ethnic violence in Kenya, published by Africa Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10017-6104, tel: 1 212 972 8400.

0,FT943-17084 ,"FT943-17084 _AN-EGAEGAA6FT 940701   FT  01 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japan set for Dollars 1.3bn South Africa package - Aid and trade deal will pave way for reinvestment      By GERARD BAKER and GORDON CRAMB   When he takes his seat at the Group of Seven summit of leading industrial nations in Naples next week Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, will not come entirely empty-handed to the table. One particular offering that Japanese officials have been preparing for their premier to bring - an aid and trade package worth as much as Dollars 1.3bn for South Africa's new democratic government - may assume added significance as a signal of Japan's desire to be a good world citizen in spite of the country's internal political upheavals. This will focus on investment projects linked to the reconstruction and development programme set out by the all-race Pretoria government in sectors such as telecommunications, medical and educational facilities. It will pave the way for Japanese companies to reinvest in South Africa at a time when their funds will be welcomed as an indicator of confidence. Last week an official Japanese mission flew to Johannesburg to seek out aid targets. The Tokyo foreign ministry yesterday declined to confirm the figures, but if the package is on the lines of that planned by the previous government of Mr Tsutomu Hata, it could comprise some Dollars 300m in official development assistance, up to Dollars 500m in Eximbank loans and a further Dollars 500m in trade and investment insurance cover over the next two years. The Japanese corporate sector rapidly reined back when the ministry of international trade and industry had to confess at the height of the sanctions era in the late 1980s that Japan had suddenly emerged as white-run South Africa's leading trading partner - ahead of countries such as Germany which had previously headed the rankings. In the same way, private enterprise may now follow the Tokyo government's lead in rebuilding ties with the country under President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress-led government of national unity. Part of the new aid will anyway be tied to trade with Japanese companies. Japan is currently South Africa's fourth largest trading partner as the high value of the yen has continued to push Japanese multinationals towards production abroad, but there have so far been few signs that Japanese companies are ready to invest heavily in South Africa. Licensing agreements largely maintained a Japanese presence in South Africa through the sanctions era and in some cases for many years before. The question now is whether Japanese companies, which until now have been content to provide parts and brand names to local manufacturing units in which they have no equity stake, are willing to contemplate closer operational or shareholding links. No big rush looks likely. One prime example is Toyota South Africa, the country's biggest car maker, a family-controlled company quoted on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in which Toyota of Japan has no direct holding. It obtained franchise rights to use the Toyota name as far back as 1961 and has imported components ever since - currently representing some 35 per cent by value of vehicles produced. In the same way, Mazda vehicles are produced by Samcor, controlled by Anglo-American, the country's leading conglomerate. The automotive sector is overcrowded and Mr Peter Arthur, a partner at Webber Wentzel, a Johannesburg law firm which has recently acted for several multinationals investing in the country, says that 'we are not seeing new motor manufacturers coming in'. Toyota of Japan said yesterday it had no plans to take a stake in Toyota South Africa which 'is and will remain a completely independent local company'. But in Johannesburg recently Mr Brand Pretorius, managing director of the local operation, said it was 'essential for our company to become part of the global Toyota network'. What a South African manufacturing base can offer, as never before, is a bridgehead into the African market as a whole, and to others beyond. As Japanese companies seek out lower-cost manufacturing sites to escape the high yen, they are also able further to refine their markets and target the developing world, where reliable brands carry a similar cachet but pricing needs to be keener and the product can be more basic. South Africa's high tariff regime will be eroded only gradually as a result of the phased accord the outgoing government struck with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade before conclusion of the Uruguay Round. Partly because of a lack of previous capital investment under sanctions, a lag in relative productivity also serves as a disincentive to inward investment. Japanese investments so far have centred on exploiting the country's mineral wealth. In May Sumitomo Corporation, one of Japan's leading trading houses, became the first Japanese company to invest in South Africa since Mr Mandela's election when it bought a modest 1 per cent stake in Associate Manganese Mines. Last year the rival Mitsubishi Corporation advanced a Dollars 28m loan to Western Platinum for mining development and Nippon Denko, an offshoot of Nippon Steel, linked with the local NST Ferrochrome to produce high-carbon alloys for the Japanese market. Beyond the mining sector, Marubeni Corporation established a joint telecoms venture with the British-linked Plessey Tellumat. But in all, just 30 Japanese companies have offices in South Africa compared with 130 US groups. And most show no immediate desire to expand. As a Sumitomo official in Tokyo puts it, 'South Africa is a very distant, very unfamiliar country, not just for us but for most Japanese companies. We remain very cautious about major commitments.'

In the first speech by a secretary of state exclusively devoted to Africa policy since the end of the cold war, Mr Warren Christopher said the US-led effort, in which it expected co-operation from others in the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, would begin once a transitional executive council has been put in place and a firm date for elections set. Before that, Mr Christopher went on: 'We have urged the World Bank and the parties in South Africa to begin planning now the projects that will lead to economic growth.' He hoped US businesses would be in the vanguard of investment in South Africa. He had special praise for both Mr Nelson Mandela and President F W de Klerk for the 'monumental achievement' of making free and fair elections possible. 'That election will echo around the African continent and across the world as a roaring triumph of human rights,' he said. Mr Christopher placed his commitment to assist the South African economy firmly in the context of the promotion of democracy throughout the continent. 'That is why President Clinton chose to invite the first president of a democratic Namibia, Sam Nujoma, as the first African head of state to be recognised at his White House.' Elsewhere in his speech, he bluntly referred to President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire as an example of 'corrupt dictators' but he singled out no other African autocrat, preferring instead to praise unnamed 'courageous democrats' from Senegal to Benin and Madagascar to Mali, and to warn that 'the US will take human rights into account as we determine how to allocate our scarce resources for foreign assistance'. The Christopher speech, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Africa-America Institute, was to have been the stage for announcing US recognition of the former Marxist government of Angola. That, however, was pre-empted by Mr Clinton earlier last week.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela ended a two-day visit to Natal province yesterday, urging an end to conflict between supporters of the ANC and the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom party, Reuter reports. At least 8,000 people have been killed in clashes between the groups in Natal since 1986. Mr Mandela's plea came a day after at least 13 people were killed in clashes between ANC supporters, Inkatha hostel dwellers and police in Thokoza township, east of Johannesburg. The ANC and Inkatha both demanded a judicial inquest into the killings. Mr Mandela also said the date for the first all-race elections would be announced before the end of this month. The 26 parties to multi-party talks have already agreed the poll will take place no later than April next year and have been debating a precise date. ANC activists devised a plan to rescue Mr Mandela from Robben Island prison in 1981 in a basket dangling from a helicopter, but the attempt was called off by ANC leaders in exile because it was too risky, Reuter reports. Mr Mandela was freed in February 1990 after 27 years' detention.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.     USZ  United States of America.

0,FT931-16992 ,"FT931-16992 _AN-DADBPAALFT 930104   FT  04 JAN 93 / The Year Ahead: Taking sights at prosperity - and for some merely survival      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   After 12 months of setback and disappointment, most people in the industrialised world will be hoping that 1993 will be a year of economic recovery and prosperity after slowdown and recession in 1991 and 1992. Many millions more outside that relatively small group of most favoured nations will have their sights set lower - on mere survival and an end to conflict. The new year begins with some favourable aspects. With luck, the start of the European single market and the inauguration of president Bill Clinton later this month may boost business confidence in Europe and the US and so help restore growth. But the uncertainties are daunting and cover the globe. Many industrial countries are still shackled by high real interest rates. Further tensions are likely in the European exchange rate mechanism, threatening the EC's ambitious plans for economic and monetary union. Germany, supposedly Europe's economic powerhouse, has difficulty finding the right mix of budget and wages policy to tame inflation. Japan is held back by debt deflation. Constitutional problems beset Canada. Little wonder, therefore, that late in 1992 the International Monetary Fund revised down its forecast for industrial country growth this year to 2 per cent from the 3 per cent forecast less than three months before. Such growth will not stop further increases in unemployment. Problems abound elsewhere. 1993 will see a continued struggle to bring economic reform to Russia and the other republics of the former Soviet Union. But eastern Europe's experience since communism's collapse holds out little hope that victory for reform will swiftly bring prosperity. Large parts of Africa face further economic decline. It is unlikely that harrowing pictures of famine will be banished from the television screens of the developed world. Where prosperity beckons, as in China, political freedoms often remain chained. Yet there are glimmers of hope. A rush of upbeat statistics and confidence indicators at the end of last year could signal a clear recovery phase for the US economy after many false dawns. The UK, now freed of the need to hold its interest rates at German levels, stands a good chance of escaping from its longest recession since the second world war. But both countries will need strong political leadership if they are to reduce their swollen budget deficits and make recovery a prospect for the long term. The world will still face difficulties adjusting to the end of the cold war: both the industrialised democracies and the former communist powers have yet to convert their military-industrial complexes to peaceful uses. But local wars apart, the globe is becoming a safer place. Nuclear disarmament continues apace. Elections will be frequent in 1993, testifying to the strength of democracy and its growing importance in the third world. If the IMF is to be believed, developing countries as a whole will grow by a creditable 5.75 per cent, largely because some countries, notably in Latin America, have adopted the free market policies and principles that their industrialised competitors are spurning at their peril. But this year, like 1991 and 1992, will be one in which world leaders find they are at the mercy of unpredictable developments. In so far as foreseeable events affect their lives and ours, the important ones are listed below.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.   Industries:-  P96  Administration of Economic Programs.

If only he'd grow a twin. We could have used one.""    For nearly a half-century, South African officials have been walked out on,  stood up, snubbed, burned in effigy and even assaulted by foreigners at  international forums.    What they have never been is in demand.    But almost every leader attending Namibia's independence festivities this week  wanted to meet De Klerk, who has released black political expression and  scheduled ""talks about talks"" with the African National Congress, the  government's primary black-nationalist opposition.    In three days, De Klerk met with the presidents or foreign ministers of 19  countries, most of which have no diplomatic ties with Pretoria.    Not since the apartheid system of racial segregation became the law in South  Africa, shortly after World War II, ""has there been such a demand from so many  world leaders to see a South African head of state,"" South African Foreign  Minister Roelof F. (Pik) Botha said, clearly enjoying the brief diplomatic thaw  occasioned by Namibia's independence.    De Klerk's meetings marked an important turning point for South Africa's  white-minority-led government, which has chafed for years under diplomatic  isolation.    ""In the past, people didn't even want to be seen having contact with South  African politicians,"" said Michael Hough, director of the Institute for  Strategic Studies at the University of Pretoria. ""But it's not a disgrace to  talk to them any more. That is an important psychological barrier that's been  crossed.""    None of the foreign leaders promised to establish formal links with South  Africa or to end international sanctions, imposed because of the apartheid  system. But there was great interest in De Klerk and his desire to launch  negotiations with the voteless black majority.    ""I told them that our aim was a new constitution, which will have the support  of the majority of all South Africans,"" De Klerk said. ""While white domination  should come to an end, care should be taken to avoid a situation where one form  of domination is replaced by another.""    However, the recently legalized African National Congress has renewed its call  on foreign powers to sever diplomatic relations with Pretoria. And ANC Deputy  President Nelson R. Mandela criticized Secretary of State James A. Baker III  for traveling to South Africa to see De Klerk this week.    Mandela, who met Baker and many others in Namibia, maintained that such a  high-profile visit by Baker, the first by an American secretary of state in 12  years, would suggest that De Klerk has dismantled key parts of the apartheid  system, which he hasn't. Baker replied that De Klerk needs to be encouraged to  continue reform.    However, most world leaders preferred the neutral ground of Namibia, which  celebrated independence after 75 years of South African colonial rule, to meet  De Klerk. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was among those who  held lengthy talks there.    Some of the more diplomatically significant meetings were those with South  Africa's harshest critics. These included the chairman of the Organization of  African Unity; Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak; the chairman of the Nonaligned  Movement, Janez Drnovsek, of Yugoslavia, and Nigerian President Ibrahim  Babangida.    The willingness to talk to De Klerk indicates that Pretoria's image is slowly  beginning to improve, analysts say. But increasing contact with foreign  governments also invites pressure on South Africa to move faster on reform,  they add.

0,FT943-5505 ,"FT943-5505 _AN-EIDAYABXFT 940903   FT  03 SEP 94 / Money, kids and family rows: Debate at the UN's population summit is about how, not whether, to curb growth in numbers      By BRONWEN MADDOX   In the past two years Dr Nafis Sadik has travelled to more than 150 countries, some more than once, while preparing to chair the United Nations' conference on population and development which begins in Cairo on Monday. Her grandson, she says, assumes she must have a tyrannical boss who orders her to travel constantly. Dr Sadik is amused by the irony, as the conference's aim - and the target of bitter attacks from governments and religious groups - is to give women more control over their lives. This weekend, as more than 10,000 delegates, lobbyists and journalists from 170 countries gather in the African continent's most populous city, battle lines have been drawn. In an unlikely alliance against the UN's draft policy document, Pope John Paul II has accused the conference of promoting abortion as a means of contraception, while Egypt's Al-Azhar University mosque, influential in the Moslem world, has criticised the draft agenda for condoning homosexuality, pre-marital and adolescent sex. Apparently moved by such concerns, Saudi Arabia and Sudan, both Moslem countries, have announced they are boycotting the conference. The decision of Turkey's prime minister, Tancu Ciller, and Bangladesh's prime minister, Ms Begum Khaleda Zia, not to attend may also have been influenced by the mounting religious opposition. Such reactions are unsurprising: the issues bring to the fore the sorest divisions between governments, cultures and religions. Two years ago, Britain's Prince Charles accused the Rio Earth Summit of ducking population control and contraception issues because of their contentiousness, despite their relevance to environmental concerns. Yet Cairo opens with a greater level of international consensus on the desirability of lower birth rates than was imaginable 10 years ago at the UN's last population conference in Mexico. This partly reflects a new recognition of the scale of the problem. The UNFPA - the UN population fund, of which Dr Sadik is executive director - estimates the world's population will nearly double to 10bn from 5.7bn by the middle of next century. In the light of such projections, many African countries, which appeared uninterested in curbing population growth a decade ago, have undergone a sea change in attitude. Part of the reason has been the impact of rapid population growth on over-stretched health and education plans. Moreover, some such as Dr Fred Sai, Ghanaian president of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which promotes family planning services around the world, argue overcrowding has been a factor in Rwanda's turmoil. But the greater consensus also reflects a new confidence among countries that family planning can work. That optimism is based on the sharp falls in fertility rates - the average number of children borne by a woman - in most developing countries since the Mexico conference. To demographers' surprise, rates have fallen even where economic development has been slow, confounding conventional wisdom. Easy access to contraception (see chart) is one of the most important factors leading to smaller families, experts now argue. Countries which have not shown such declines in fertility rates and are still ambivalent or sceptical about family planning tend to be relatively affluent with small populations, particularly Moslem countries in north Africa and the Gulf. But even Pakistan, which for years made little attempt to curb high fertility rates, has recently begun to promote family planning programmes vigorously. Despite the new agreement on goals, however, there is still wide disagreement about how to get there. Cairo delegates expect fierce debate on two fronts: the final wording of the UNFPA's policy guidelines on family planning; and its proposal that financial support for family planning should treble to Dollars 17bn a year by the year 2000. The UNFPA wants at least a quarter of this funding to be supplied as international aid, the rest via national programmes. In the countdown to Cairo, the noisiest criticism has centred on how the final text will view abortion. Dr Sadik, who calls the row a 'red herring', believes the Vatican is using the issue of abortion to rally support for its opposition to any contraception. She points out the draft agenda mentions abortion only as a threat to women's health; the UNFPA estimates 250,000 women a year die from badly-performed operations. The UNFPA is currently barred from promoting abortion or helping doctors perform the operation, even where a lack of medical skill endangers women's lives. She says the conference 'should accommodate the Vatican only as one state which speaks for 800 people, not for the 1bn Catholics of the world, most of whom are not behind their church on contraception'. Behind that headline-grabbing row, however, many religious groups as well as governments have begun to show a wider unease about the agenda's proposals for improving sex education for teenagers, and for more general education for women and girls. The Iranian Health Minister, Mr Ali Reza Marandi, has criticised the conference for 'ignoring Islamic values' and promoting 'sexual liberty'. According to Dr Sadik, 'in the preparatory committee meetings, every government wholeheartedly endorsed empowerment of women, outdoing even the language of women's groups. But now they are starting to recognise what it means'. As well as trying to settle such controversial points, governments will have to tackle the funding question. It will hardly be plain sailing. Some developing countries are wary of having to adopt western values to receive international aid. Others are concerned that some of the western contribution to total funding will be taken out of other aid budgets. According to Dr Sadik: 'I will not count it as failure if we don't get it (the Dollars 17bn), but I will be very disappointed.' But however stormy next week's debate becomes, it is population growth, not the Cairo agenda, which presents governments with difficult choices. On the one hand, if they tolerate present fertility rates, they face the threat of social disruption: strains on natural resources will increase and people will leave the countryside in search of jobs in crowded cities. If they need any reminder of those threats, China provides a graphic example: even though the Beijing government has taken tough measures to bring down family size, a projection two weeks ago estimated half of its population would be living in cities by 2010, against less than a third today. On the other hand, if governments promote easier access to contraception, they can expect big changes in women's social role. Those are, notably for conservative countries, uncomfortable options. But however many amendments are made to the Cairo agenda, demographers' arithmetic shows governments cannot expect their societies to stay the same.   Countries:-  XAZ  World.

Mr Lewis Preston, the Bank president, is to visit South Africa next week, his first trip to Africa since he took up the job last September. For months, World Bank officials have pursued informal contacts with the various political parties and groups in South Africa. Several teams have been to research an economy which has been virtually unknown to the Bank since lending was suspended for political reasons in 1967. Now, relations seem set to assume a higher profile. Immediate access to Bank funding is not in prospect, however. The Bank is expected to resume lending only when a multi-party interim government is in place. Even then, there will be room for disputes within the Bank's board over what constitutes an interim government. Would a multi-racial executive with only limited powers (one option) qualify for renewed access, or will the board demand more fundamental change? In practice, it seems likely that the board will follow the advice of the African National Congress on the issue. Once formal relations are restored, debate will begin in earnest over whether South Africa should qualify for heavily subsidised loans from the International Development Association (the Bank's soft loan agency which lends to the world's poorest countries), or only for the mildly concessional loans available to middle-income countries. Income per capita in South Africa, at Dollars 2,520 a year in 1990, far exceeds the limit of Dollars 740 normally imposed on IDA recipients. However the grossly unequal distribution of income between whites and blacks might mean that South Africa could be treated as a special case for soft loans. But with the IDA's funding already under serious pressure from claimants worldwide, officials in Pretoria seem resigned to doing without heavily subsidised finance. The size of any World Bank programme for South Africa would thus be determined by demand from Pretoria: how much would a new government wish to borrow, given that the terms are only mildly concessional? South Africa could benefit indirectly from IDA finance by participating in regional projects aimed at low income countries such as neighbouring Mozambique. South Africa's electricity utility, Eskom, is keen to develop a regional electricity grid and various energy projects involving South African companies are under discussion. But the recipient government in such cases would be Mozambique, not South Africa. Government officials say no project plans have yet been drawn up for South Africa itself, nor have amounts been discussed. But World Bank lending is likely to focus on education and urban development, the two areas already researched by Bank officials. With 7m people living in informal settlements countrywide - including millions in squatter shacks - urban development will be a high priority for the new government. Education, too, is in crisis, with black schools desperately overcrowded, facilities poor and teachers poorly qualified. Already, the Bank is ready to provide informal technical assistance to black South Africans, with plans afoot to train those who might be officials of a future government through the Bank's Economic Development Institute. The ANC, for its part, remains deeply suspicious of international financial institutions such as the Bank and the International Monetary Fund, with some officials adopting the rhetoric of the 1960s to condemn them as neo-imperialist organisations. But ANC officials have met previous World Bank teams, and two of the movement's senior leaders are to see Mr Preston during his visit. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), another World Bank finance affiliate, is likely to be active in the South African private sector. Once lending resumes, the IFC is expected to focus its efforts on helping non-white entrepreneurs, selling management consultancy services and setting up an 'enterprise fund' aimed at small businesses, as it has done elsewhere in Africa. Eventually, the IFC could become involved in project finance in areas such as mining and chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

'African economies have been typified by low skill levels, inferior infrastructure, wasteful public expenditure and ineffective institutions,' the report says. As a result, the ODA has moved the balance of British aid to Africa towards supporting economic reform programmes 'designed to improve the policy and institutional environment,' the report says. In an separate assessment of more than 200 completed projects from 1966 to 1989, the ODA also reveals that 45 per cent of the projects were either failures, or only partially successful. Evaluation reports 'highlighted the difficulty of succeeding at the project level if the policies of the developing country at sector and national level are unsatisfactory.' The ODA identifies a stark contrast with Asia, where significant problems are confronted in just 10 per cent of projects. When the value rather than the number of the problematical projects is measured, the problem is even worse. In Africa, which accounted for projects worth Pounds 324m assessed in 1989-90 and 1990-91, overruns and other 'major' problems affected projects worth about Pounds 140m - or about 42 per cent. In contrast, Asia attracted funding worth Pounds 100m, but ran into complications in just 10 per cent.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "
0,FT942-12077 ,"FT942-12077 _AN-EECCXAA7FT 940503   FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Next chapter unclear after fairy-tale start      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   South Africa has emerged triumphant from the most perilous stage of a revolution without precedent, and its citizens seem bemused by their achievement. After more than three hundred years of supremacy, the white minority last week finally, irrevocably and peacefully surrendered power at the ballot box to the country's black majority. The full details of this astonishing - some say miraculous - event are not yet known, for the election commission is still grappling with mountains of ballot papers. And one major obstacle which could jeopardise the prospects of a stable South Africa may yet emerge: the outcome of voting in KwaZulu/Natal, stronghold of the Zulu leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Nor, at this stage, is it clear what may be the next step of the white right, whose extremists could yet destabilise South Africa with an assassin's bullet. But, as an exuberant president in the waiting, Mr Nelson Mandela celebrated the ANC's achievement at last night's victory party, taking satisfaction in a fairy-tale start to the new South Africa. And, as he pressed ahead with the critical process of reconciliation, South Africa's remarkable political metamorphosis continued. In the television studios and televised press conferences, on radio and on newspaper front-pages, one leader began assuming the mantle of power, and the other, incumbent President FW de Klerk, began shedding it. Before its eyes, South Africa watched a process unfold which has neither precedent nor parallel in Africa, and perhaps the world. Mr Mandela, never less than a monumental personality, seemed to gain further stature as the results trickled in; almost perceptibly, the aura that comes with office seemed to desert Mr de Klerk. Nothing so became the two men, and the country in their charge, than this transfer of power, which is due to to be made formal at next week's inauguration in Pretoria. 'For the first time I envy South Africans, for the first time I wish I could call myself South African,' said one hard-bitten observer of many years standing last week. He had been moved almost to tears as he watched black and white embrace at a moving ceremony that took place at midnight on Tuesday. Seldom, if ever, can the advent of democracy have been the instrument of catharthis so profound, so liberating, for rulers and ruled alike, as South Africa's unforgettable and moving experience last week. Millions suffered under apartheid. But apartheid's victims extended beyond its borders. Hundreds of thousands died in Angola, Zimbabwe and Mozambique, the front-line states in the proxy battles to defend white rule. But last week, for a precious few days, the pain of the past seems to have been eased, even thrust briefly out of mind. A truce, undeclared and unspoken, in the political fighting that has cost more than 14,000 lives over the past 10 years was broken but not spoilt by the bombs of the extreme right. In the 24 hours that ended yesterday morning, police reported that there had not been a single death from political violence. Joyous as the election was for blacks, it also became liberating for whites. As they cast their votes, many spoke of having the sense of casting off the burden of apartheid, whether or not they had supported the policy. Many were taken aback by the simple - though unprecedented  - experience of going to the polling booths, black, coloured and white, as equals, to chose a government that for the first time will reflect the will of the majority. The orange, white and blue flag of the old South Africa was lowered at centres across the land, and the new one raised while choirs sang the region's hymn of liberation, now adopted as one of the official anthems of post-apartheid South Africa: Nkosi sikelel i'Afrika (God bless Africa). For black South Africans in particular it was a proud moment, but for many Afrikaners it must have been a poignant, painful one. As that flag entered the history books, the other official anthem carried across the night air, sung in Afrikaans, and no doubt giving comfort to those fearful of what the future holds: Die Stem von Suid-Afrika (At thy call we shall not falter, firm and steadfast we shall stand. At thy will to live or perish, O South Africa, dear land). Over the past week at least, most white South Africans overcame their apprehensions. And whatever may happen in the future, for a few days, South Africa has basked in the glow of pride asserted, and pride recovered.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

0,FT942-10460 ,"FT942-10460 _AN-EEJC9AG6FT 940510   FT  10 MAY 94 / Survey of Kenya (22): Disease strikes at the heart of business - A report predicts a huge increase in deaths from Aids      By ANDREW JACK   It may not yet be as severe as in some of its neighbouring African states, but one of the most dangerous threats to economic growth and social stability in Kenya is Aids. To the casual visitor, evidence of acquired immune deficiency syndrome is limited - a TV advertisement warning, 'Say no to unwanted sexual advances; say no to Aids'; a poster with a prostitute tempting a well-dressed Kenyan, her face a grinning skull offering the prospect of death. To the policy-makers, the concern runs far deeper. A recent report prepared by the National Aids Control Programme of Kenya suggests that one in every 18 adults aged over 15 is HIV-positive. In urban areas, the proportion is twice as high at 10 to 11 per cent, or 220,000 people. It estimates that more than 130,000 Kenyans have developed Aids, and that two years ago about 730,000 people were carrying the human immunodeficiency virus that causes the disease - most of whom are expected to develop Aids and die within the next 10 years. This includes 30,000 children. The report projects that, by 2005, there could be 1.9m HIV-positive Kenyans, and that the cumulative number of Aids deaths would increase from 100,000 today to over 2m in the same period. A vicious corollary of Aids, not seen elsewhere in the world, is that the deaths caused by the disease may often be the result not of esoteric ailments but of common and highly infectious tropical killers such as tuberculosis. This not only conceals the fact that Aids may be the root cause, but also risks engendering a national TB epidemic among those not infected by the disease as well as those who are. Equally, some researchers believe that the relatively high incidence of other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and syphilis within Kenya may boost HIV-infection rates by between 10 and 100 times. One problem is that many who are HIV-positive do not know they are infected, since it can take several years before any signs develop. In the meantime, they may continue to transmit the virus to others. There is certainly some stigma to the discussion of homosexually-transmitted Aids in Africa. However, it appears that in Kenya most transmission comes through heterosexual contact, particularly in groups where the social structure has broken down: it spreads along trucking routes, in war zones and among rural migrants to cities. More controversially, some academic researchers believe there is a higher incidence of infection among uncircumcised men - a growing group representing about 20 per cent of the population. A smaller proportion may come through blood transfusion where screening systems and equipment break down, although the government insists that most blood is now screened for HIV. More worryingly, many children are becoming infected from their mothers  - either during pregnancy or through breast-feeding. Up to half of the children of infected mothers in Kenya are estimated to be infected. Those children who are not infected do not escape the effects of the disease: many will become so-called Aids orphans, being left without parents by the time they are 15. Official estimates suggest there will be 600,000 such orphans by 2000 and almost 1m by 2005. This will place additional burdens on extended families, boost demand for support services and trigger unstable social structures. Aids is beginning to have a fundamental impact on the economy more generally. Three-quarters of cases affect the most economically productive group within the population: adults aged 20-45. Companies may be threatened with survival, and agricultural systems disrupted. A study by US researchers two years ago suggested that the average cost of hospital care for an Aids patient was Ks27,200, and the average length of time in hospital far more than for other ailments at 60 days. Aids patients were estimated to be occupying up to 15 per cent of all hospital beds in the country. At current growth rates, this suggests total hospital costs on Aids Ks3.7bn by the year 2000, and Ks4.8bn by 2005 - up to half of public expenditure on all health care, and about half of all hospital beds, in a threat to provision of services to the rest of the population. Separately, a 1992 World Bank study on AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa suggested that if Aids affects the better-paid, better-educated economic elite, and consumes medical and funeral costs from savings, investment and economic growth will suffer. As to the future, the government says it estimates 'conservatively' that adult HIV prevalence will stabilise at about 9 per cent by 2000. Some practitioners remain rather more pessimistic. Dr Francis Plummer, a visiting lecturer at the University of Nairobi over many years, says: 'There is no evidence that infection rates are slowing. There is still exponential growth.' He says that surveys within Kenya suggest that education has been remarkably effective, with a high degree of knowledge of Aids. But this has not been translated into changes in sexual behaviour, except in some limited groups such as prostitutes.   Countries:-  KEZ  Kenya, Africa.   Industries:-  P80   Health Services.

Their wait to enter the polling booths was lightened by cheers and chanting as anti-apartheid luminaries arrived, and by a dose of spring sunshine which would not have been felt amiss in the Cape. The line, one of dozens in cities around the world yesterday, comprised visitors to London and expatriates. The all-race poll was the final step in eradicating that bleak and previously numerous third category: no one needed any longer to call themselves exiles. Although the embassy was only one of seven polling stations in the UK, nearly 8,000 voters were thought to have passed through its doors alone. One of their number was Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, who pronounced the election 'a miracle - I truly believe it has been miraculous.' Afterwards, in an embassy library with walls bearing the coats of arms of colonists Dutch and British, and shelves of bound records of the white parliament since union in 1910, the 80-year-old archbishop said he would 'never ever forgive the evil of apartheid'. While branding as 'traitors' those whites who opposed change, he said a new administration, led by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, for which he had voted, 'must be a government of all South Africans.' The first South African to cast a vote yesterday, in Wellington, New Zealand, was Ms Nomaza Paintin, a niece of Mr Mandela. South Africans form one of the largest immigrant groups in New Zealand. There was an upsurge of last-minute interest among the South African community in Australia, which at some 60,000 ranks alongside that of the UK. Local newspapers there and in other countries had run advertisements on behalf of the Independent Electoral Commission publicising the poll. The 700 or so South Africans in Hong Kong turned out in such force that the consulate ran out of ballot papers. Among those who managed to vote was Ms Elizabeth Dikgale, a domestic helper who is the only Zulu resident in the colony. 'South Africa is a golden country, and now we can get back to golden times,' she said. The 20,000 or so Jewish South Africans who have emigrated to Israel find themselves caught between two peace processes, each of which has taken a heavy toll in violence. But as one in the long queue to vote at Tel Aviv Show Grounds put it: 'If the whites and blacks in South Africa can get it together, we should be able to do it here too.' Pockets of South Africans elsewhere in Africa were also able to vote, even though full diplomatic relations with much of the continent do not yet exist. The polling station for Kenya was a sports club in the outskirts of Nairobi where Mrs Nomtha Nkolombe, a 62-year-old physiotherapist who left Cape Town 30 years ago, said: 'It is an opportunity both my parents missed.' In New York, two polling stations were set up in tents on a lawn outside the United Nations building. One white voter maintained: 'Every South African I know will be voting today. This is one hell of a vote.' That much is indisputable. It was taking two to three hours in the Trafalgar Square queue yesterday to get to vote. Some, however, had been waiting all their lives.

A spokesman for the KwaZulu Police says the latest victim  was  among the 10 canvassers who had sought refuge at the police  station. He said he died after being shot, apparently as the  refugees were being taken to safety. A search for eight ANC  supporters missing since the incident has so far proved  fruitless. It's still unclear what exactly happened at the  police station after the arrival of IFP leader Mangosuthu  Buthelezi to deal with the problem. One of the ANC members who  escaped to the police station said he was rescued by white  policemen from almost certain death. ANC provincial election  candidate, Welcome Mthimkulu, alleges that the KwaZulu policemen  were ready to hand the ANC members over to the mob outside.    He said a number of white policemen, however, had taken them  in armored vehicles to a place of safety until they could be  transferred to Eshowe.     "

Then Defense Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was very mad at you for  this.    [Beilin] Well, yes, but he has changed his mind since.  Also, there were sanctions against South Africa, and Israel was  not too enthusiastic about taking steps against South Africa.  Eventually, in March 1987 we joined the international club that  imposed the sanctions, and I was very happy with this. I  believe this is one of the reasons that today we are able to  hold a dialogue, as we do, with Nelson Mandela, who was then  still in prison, and with the ANC.    [Rosen] Do you believe that over the past two or three years  we corrected the mistakes made over the past decades?    [Beilin] I believe so because up to 1987, Israel was, in  fact, the only country to openly admit that it disregarded the  sanctions the United Nations imposed on South Africa in 1977.  This created a very negative sentiment against Israel among the  black South Africans. They seriously supported the  Palestinians, hence, their unbalanced attitude toward the PLO  all these years. It was very difficult for us to make the  change, and I cannot say that today they are completely balanced  and that we will continue our passionate love affair with South  Africa. The new regime will certainly be different from the  previous, very pro-Israel, white regime.    [Rosen] We had very good defense relations. Was this  eliminated?    [Beilin] In 1987 we decided not to renew defense contracts.  That meant that existing contracts which still were in effect  were followed through to the date set for their termination. No  new contracts were signed. Therefore, the defense relations  between us have completely decayed.    [Rosen] Are there other areas of cooperation which will  continue? Are there contacts now with Mandela's men on this?    [Beilin] Primarily, there is trade between the two  countries. We import coal and other raw materials, and we export  there. We naturally have very close ties with the Jewish  community there. Also, there are contacts, established about a  year ago or so, with the ANC, which is a very broad coalition,  and with Mandela. He was due to visit Israel some time ago, and  he postponed it and will probably visit here in the future.  Hence, certainly we have the beginning of a very interesting  dialogue, which carries many opportunities, with the new South  African leadership.    [Rosen] Is there a possibility of an Israeli-South African  cooperation regarding black Africa in general?    [Beilin] We have asked ourselves this very question, though  I doubt it is possible. There is a big question: What kind of  country will South African become? So far, it has been a  Western country with a black population that could not even  vote. Today, it will be very different. Will it become another  Third World country with the symptoms of such countries,  including the big disappointment with past African leaders; or  will it be a very different country, which uses the enormous  wealth at its disposal? There is a chance the latter will be the  case, but I find it hard to believe it will have the time or the  ability to even consider cooperating with a country such as  Israel in other Third World countries or black Africa. We will  continue our efforts in Africa. We are in the midst of a very  intensive campaign of economic cooperation with African  countries. If the new South African regime would be willing to  cooperate with us, we would certainly welcome this. I, however,  doubt this is a realistic option at this time. [passage omitted]     "
0,FT931-13355 ,"FT931-13355 _AN-DAXAVAEYFT 930123   FT  23 JAN 93 / Muddling towards democracy: Truth of the Matter - Patti Waldmeir on the problems that face South Africa and Russia      By PATTI WALDMEIR   OF ALL the nations struggling toward democracy, few seem to have less natural aptitude for the task than Russia and South Africa. Neither is politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants. But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often as it draws nearer. Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of civil liberties. So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia for authoritarian certainty. But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth and race decreed by apartheid. For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic elections. As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.' But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition. Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy. That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism', which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the 'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all the institutional supports necessary to capitalism. South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity which is essential to bolster democracy from below. Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party'; indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band. Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts managed to preserve much of their independence. But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic associations in black townships could prove a further check on central government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious, the churches will remain a major political force. What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails Moscow. So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship. But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy. Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root. But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The future can scarcely be worse.

When it is said here and there that  France is ditching Africa, France is abandoning its friends, and  that a new page has been turned -- that is all baseless. You  are not abandoning your friends when you give 30 billion francs  to help them go through a delicate transition for the  relaunching of real growth and development. That is not true.  So, indeed, not only have we taken considerable measures --  during a difficult period for us -- to support this courageous  decision from the African countries -- and it will be seen  within a few months that all of us within the franc zone made a  good decision -- but even the backup measures have to be  negotiated between the various parties.    We have also put strong pressure on international  institutions so that everybody, taking into account the efforts  made by Africa, in turn, comes to Africa's aid. On 22 February,  I will be going to Brussels to see EC chief Jacques Delors and,  there too, champion Africa's cause and explain the efforts that  have been made, so that Europe can also participate in assisting  Africa. You talked about the backup measures [words indistinct]  minister with whom we met this morning, well, France will make  additional efforts. You know, in addition, we have constituted  a special fund to help -- in countries where this will be  necessary -- the most underprivileged people during this  transition period following the devaluation decision, until the  point arrives where economies start picking up again under the  new conditions.    [Unidentified correspondent] You talked about 30 billion  francs, how will these funds be distributed among the various  countries?    [Roussin] These 30 billion francs represent general aid from  France. In effect, it constitutes the cancellation of Africa's  debt. Africa owed France 25 billion francs, and we are  canceling that debt. There is 5 billion in project assistance  -- France wants to keep this rate up in cooperation efforts,  efforts made by the government and which are accepted by the  National Assembly and the Senate -- which is continuing. In  addition, we have this special social assistance fund. [passage  omitted] Therefore, France does not intend to ditch Africa.  France without Africa would not be the same. We are bound, we  are united. The success of these current operations will be the  success of Africa, it will be that of the Central African  Republic, and also that of France. We are closely bound within  the franc zone family and nobody can [words indistinct].  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] [passage indistinct]    [Roussin] I know that on 15 February an agreement was signed  between the appropriate minister and the head of mission. I  myself have signed other agreements that [words indistinct] were  very considerable and that apparently have been disbursed. The  French Cooperation Fund has been given very specific directives.  The Cooperation Mission has been given very specific  directives. The IMF has committed itself. The World Bank has  committed itself -- the first disbursements of the World Bank  for some countries are already under way -- and we have never  joined hands as much as now in order to manage a problem of such  dimensions.

0,FT933-5761 ,"FT933-5761 _AN-DIAB3AGJFT 930901   FT  01 SEP 93 / Survey of Africa - A continent at stake (11): In search of a kick-start - Private sector      By TONY HAWKINS   ONE of the most important challenges facing Africa in the 1990s is that of kickstarting the private sector. But as Sir William Ryrie, retiring executive vice-president of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), says, Africa is the only region in the developing world where public sector investment exceeds that of private enterprise. More than half the region's investment is funded from aid. This low level of private investment cannot be attributed to a shortage of entrepreneurship, says Sir William, noting that since the African Project Development Facility was launched in 1986, over 2,000 entrepreneurs have sought its assistance, The IFC - the World Bank group's private sector arm - has launched four main initiatives in the region: More than 23 governments have been advised by the IFC's Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) on how to attract direct investment from abroad. The IFC itself has invested in large energy sector projects in Cameroon and Nigeria and in the Ashanti Gold Mine in Ghana. Much is expected from small enterprise development programmes, seen as a partial solution to the region's escalating unemployment problem and also as an area where Africa has comparative advantage. In Ghana, for example, small enterprise accounts for more than 80 per cent of manufacturing employment. Access to finance is probably the main constraint on small firm expansion and the IFC's African Enterprise Fund targets its lending and investment activities on small businesses, funding some 58 projects in 18 countries since its inception. The IFC has assisted 10 countries in privatisation programmes, though progress has been slow. The fourth initiative is fostering capital market development. The World Bank's private sector programme has a broadly similar focus. Initially, its support for private sector development targeted infrastructural investment to complement industrial and agricultural projects. This changed in the 1980s as the Bank focused on specific obstacles to private sector growth, launching its Private Sector Development Programme in 1989, with three main objectives - creating an enabling business environment, restructuring the public sector and promoting financial sector development. In the 18 months to mid-1992, it financed 42 projects in 24 sub-Saharan countries. In addition to its support of privatisation, the Bank is working to strengthen the role of the state through capacity-building and institution-building investments. In the financial sector, its main task has been regulatory reform, including liberalising interest rates, allied with institutional reform including restructuring ailing banks, and establishing appropriate systems for prudential regulation and bank supervision. Yet there remain formidable obstacles. In Kenya, for example, a study found that the average company needs 15 licences a year to operate, taking some 223 staff hours to acquire. Backhanders add 66 per cent to legal fees while total costs including 'irregular charges' amounted to more than a fifth of incremental profits. Given the scepticism over an early return of foreign investment, the donors are right to bang the small enterprise drum. But in a world where retailers and consumers want increasingly sophisticated quality products, and where modern technology and scale economies demand heavy investment, it is difficult to see small business playing more than a residual role.

0,FT921-1173 ,"FT921-1173 _AN-CCYA1AE8FT 920325   FT  25 MAR 92 / Insurance Ombudsman's Report: Compensation to complainants totalled Pounds 5m last year      By JOHN AUTHERS   MONEY paid to people who complained to Mr Julian Farrand, the insurance ombudsman, totalled Pounds 5m last year, he disclosed yesterday. The number of cases dealt with by his staff rose 64 per cent to 4,334 in the year, and he said he expected the total to rise to some 5,000 this year. Cases dealt with were 'the tip of the iceberg,' he continued. There were 13,899 written inquiries last year and 26,048 by telephone. He said the rise had been caused by the recession, which gave consumers more incentive to complain, and the arrival of the Financial Services Act, which has tightened regulation. Complainants were successful in only 32 per cent of cases. In the biggest award, of Pounds 500,000, an insurance company queried whether its policyholder, a woman reported dead while on a visit to Kenya, had indeed died. A private detective sent to Africa reported that she was dead, but the company then claimed that she could not have been of sufficient means to justify covering her life for such a large sum. Mr Farrand said no question had been asked about her means when she took out the policy, and called on the company to pay the full Pounds 500,000. In another case, a salesman was asked to explain why he had sold a life assurance policy, with no savings element, to an unmarried 18-year-old with no children who wanted to save. 'The reason I did not attempt to sell a capital accumulation plan (a 10-year savings plan) is because in February 1988 I was unaware the plan existed,' the salesman said. 'Perhaps if my training had included the plan, I would have marketed it more often.' The ombudsman decided the entire sale had been unsuitable. In another case where the ombudsman found for the complainant, an independent intermediary had forged his client's signature on a form allowing him to surrender an endowment policy written in his client's name. He took the proceeds and disappeared. The insurance company involved refused to reinstate the endowment because it said that the signatures were apparently genuine. The rates by which the insurance company's original decision was revised varied according to the type of insurance. Only 25 per cent of general insurance complaints were upheld, while life assurance had a greater rate. Mr Farrand pointed out that life policies were more complicated than general insurance. He did not believe the complaints about life insurance indicated any widespread scandal. The Securities and Investments Board published the results of its review of investment retail regulation two weeks ago, recommending that many details should be made clearer at the point of sale. SIB hopes this will reduce investor confusion and reduce the number of complaints. In two thirds of cases, the insurance company's decision was upheld, and the report includes several examples of dishonest claims. A pensioner said a breakdown ruined 93lb of meat in his freezer. An investigation showed that the freezer could hold only about 42lb. The Investors Compensation Scheme has paid out Pounds 10.8m so far in the present financial year compared with only Pounds 1.7m in 1990-91, SIB said yesterday. SIB believes pay-outs are being affected by the effects of new regulations and by the recession, which is depriving intermediaries of the commissions they earn when long-term policies are renewed.  --------------------------------------- INSURANCE OMBUDSMAN: CASES COMPLETED  --------------------------------------- Type                 1990    1991                      total   total  --------------------------------------- Life ass              510     809 Motor                 346     568 Household bdgs        308     383 Household conts       289     341 Travel                155     227 Pensions               91     183 Legal expenses          8      29  --------------------------------------- Source: Insurance Ombudsman  ---------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page 9  "

0,FT921-2391 ,"FT921-2391 _AN-CCSBEAFKFT 920319   FT  19 MAR 92 / Financial markets cheered but remain cautious      By Foreign and Financial Staff   CLOSER trade, investment, and financial links with South Africa were predicted in the financial and business community yesterday following the referendum, although there was caution about the future. Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest commercial banks, said it would proceed with a bond issue for Escom, the electricity utility, which had been postponed during the referendum. It will lead an international consortium for the issue. German banks have already paved the way for South Africa's return to the international capital markets after a six-year absence. Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, was the lead manager in a DM400m (Pounds 139m) issue for the republic last September, increased from DM300m because of strong investor demand. Deutsche Bank yesterday welcomed the outcome, as did Mercedes-Benz, one of Germany's largest corporate investors in South Africa. Mercedes said the vote was a vindication of its decision to stay in South Africa  - where it employs nearly 5,000 people. Corporate America's initial reaction was muted. A handful of companies and banks surveyed said it was too early to plunge back into major investment in South Africa. Ms Jennifer Kibbe, an official at the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre, which tracks US investment in South Africa, said US companies regarded the referendum vote 'as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for them to go back in.' Citicorp, the biggest US bank, bank indicated it would need to see what type of interim government came to power before it could consider changing its position. Citicorp which closed its office in South Africa in 1987, does have a limited business in South African ADRs (American depository receipts), but it is unlikely to expand that business immediately. After sanctions were lifted Citicorp said it had no plans to resume lending and that position has not changed. The Ford motor company, which withdrew in 1988, said it would conduct a full review before changing its position. Among British companies, Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa in 1986 in response to student protests, said it was a positive result but that it would wait to see how the situation developed. 'As the political situation and economic climate becomes clearer .. it is possible that in the future Barclays may establish some representation in South Africa to look after large corporate business in that country and to service the bank's global clients,' the bank said. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it was 'delighted'. It saw 'nothing but good coming out of the complete integration of southern Africa.' On the international bond market, the result was widely seen as likely to bring forward further bond issues from the republic. Bankers said further political headway would have to be made before there was fresh fund-raising. South Africa has launched three international bond issues since last summer, two in the name of the republic and one in the name of the Development Bank of South Africa. All have been sold mainly to German private investors, rather than institutions. Concern about political risk, and ethical or legal obstacles, still loom large. The republic's Ecu250m (Pounds 178m) of bonds, launched in January, were trading at a yield of 10.63 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point above offer price  - a reflection that demand for the bonds, though reported to have picked up yesterday, has yet to affect the price.

The documents --  transcripts from the secret trial of a South African Air Force  officer and from the government's classified submissions to the  International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) -- show that much  vital information has been kept from the public. They also show  that President Frederik de Klerk's statement to parliament on 23  March 1993 that the government had built then destroyed just six  crude nuclear devices fell far short of the whole truth.    The sophistication of the securocrats' nuclear ambitions in  the 1970's and 1980's was grotesquely at odds with the disarray  and venality among the government officials involved in the  project, as evidence given in the secret trial of Air Force  Brigadier Johann Blaauw in 1987-88 at the Supreme Court in  Capetown makes clear.    Classified documents from the trial obtained by Africa  Confidential trace how Brig. Blaauw, who negotiated a deal with  Israel for the supply of tritium (a key ingredient required to  make thermonuclear weapons) fell out with former Minister of  Labour and Mines Fanie Botha. Blaauw claimed that Botha had  promised him diamond concessions in Namaqualand, on South  Africa's western seaboard, in return for his work on the nuclear  programme but then failed to deliver. Botha denied this but  said that Blaauw ad threatened to make public details about the  nuclear programme and the alleged improprieties linked to it. By  the time of their falling out, Botha had incurred substantial  debts and had his assets sequestrated following his resignation  from ministerial office and parliament on 15 November 1983 after  some highly critical press reports.    In November l984, the police in Pretoria arrested Blaauw on  charges of attempted extortion against Fanie Botha and  possession of secret data concerning the Koeberg nuclear power  reactor. However, Blaauw was acquitted in September 1988 and he  is still pursuing his claim for the allegedly promised mining  concessions through the civil courts.    Blaauw had an exemplary Air Force career which began in  World  War II and included service with Western forces in Palestine,  the Korean War and the Berlin airlift. Following his retirement  from the Air Force in l975, Blaauw was the messenger in some of  Pretoria's most sensitive military transactions with Israel.    It is difficult to see how De Klerk, who took over the  mining  portfolio from Botha, would not have been briefed about the  tensions between Botha and Blaauw and the nature of Blaauw's  work on the nuclear programme with Israel.    In fact, De Klerk testified at Blaauw's trial, saying that  Fanie Botha, a political rival, approached him after a cabinet  meeting and told him he had been in the process of awarding a  mining concession to Blaauw and asking if a way could be found  to grant it. There is absolutely no evidence linking De Klerk  to the illicit transactions surrounding the nuclear programme  and sources close to the highest levels of government have told  Africa Confidential that De Klerk got in and out of the ministry  as quickly as possible. By the end of the 1980's, De Klerk was  said to be unable ""to come to terms philosophically"" with the  securocrats' plans to develop thermonuclear weapons whose  primary target would be African civilians.    However, De Klerk's apparent ""road to Damascus"" on the  nuclear weapons programme still has not facilitated a full  admission of the extent of the government's nuclear programme.  This lack of frankness about the nuclear programme concerns  senior officials in Western governments particularly at a time  when South Africa is negotiating a delicate transition where the  loyalties of some senior officials in the security forces appear  uncertain.    Blaauw's errand to secure tritium from Israel is  significant:  Tritium is a gas used to boost the power of nuclear weapons  creating fusion or thermonuclear bombs. In information  submitted to the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency],  which monitors compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty (NPT) for the United Nations, the government admitted  that its weapons programme had involved lithium-6 separation, a  means of producing tritium. So sensitive is this information  that senior African National Congress (ANC) officials, some of  whom will be holding ministerial office after the April  elections, have been refused access to it.    According to a September 1993 IAEA document obtained by  Africa Confidential, the programme had also progressed by the  early 1980's to planning a 150 megawatt reactor capable of  producing tritium and plutonium. The reactor, which was to have  been built at Gouriqua, near Mossel Bay, never got beyond the  basic engineering preparations. But Pretoria continued to work  on developing thermonuclear weapons until 1985 or l986,  according to Wynand de Villiers of Pretoria's Atomic Energy  Corporation and Roger Jardine, the ANC's science policy  coordinator. Pretoria began dismantling its nuclear weapons  programme in 1990, in preparation for signing the NPT the  following year.    In his 24 March 1993 speech De Klerk also insisted that ""at  no time did South Africa acquire nuclear technology from another  country."" Apart from United States intelligence reports  attesting to Israeli-South African nuclear collaboration,  additional information would have been available to De Klerk,  during his tenure at the Mines Ministry, to indicate that  tritium production is the result of a highly sophisticated  technology, one which South Africa had not mastered.    At his trial, Blaauw testified that he negotiated for the  supply of 30 grammes of tritium from Israel in exchange for 600  tonnes of ""yellowcake"" (uranium oxide). The tritium-yellowcake  exchange deal is described in some detail in a recent book by  William E. Burrows and Robert Windrem.  Footnote    ""Critical Mass"" by William Burrows and Robert Windrem (Simon  and Schuster) 1994). They write that the sensitive arrangements  were jointly overseen by South Africa's then intelligence  agency, the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) and the Israeli  intelligence division Lish Ka le-Kishrei (Lakam) which  specialised in nuclear and technological procurement and came to  public attention when it was linked to the Jonathan Jay Pollard  spy scandal in the USA in 1985.    Blaauw testified at the trial that he had established South  Africa's Israeli connection through a South African who had  emigrated to Israel. In this way Blaauw was able to make  high-level military contacts in Israel. Initially the two men  arranged the emergency supply of South African spare parts for  Mirage aircraft, needed by Israel after the 1973 war.    Then Blaauw arranged a deal with an Israeli front company in  Wiesbaden, Germany, through which he obtained British tanks and  Browning machine guns for South Africa, according to the trial  documents. Finally, Blaauw said he was approached by one  ""Benjamine"" of Lakam (almost certainly Benjamin Blumberg, chief  of Lakam between 1957 and 1981), who asked if South Africa would  sell Israel yellowcake which can be enriched to make fuel for  nuclear weapons or power reactors.    Through his service in South African military liaison during  the Rhodesian war, in which he took part in many joint covert  activities with Salisbury and helped set up a meeting between  white leader Ian Smith, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and  South African Prime Minister John Vorster, Blaauw became a  confidant of General Hendrik van den Bergh, then head of the  security police -- and subsequently the head of BOSS. He told  the court that he then approached Van den Bergh with Lakam's  request and Van den Bergh got the go-ahead for the deal from  John Vorster. In April 1976 Vorster visited Israel and signed a  comprehensive set of military and economic cooperation pacts.    According to Burrows' and Windrem's book, Israeli and South  African officials, including director of Lakam Benjamin Blumberg  and then Information Ministry Secretary Eschel Rhoodie travelled  as escorts on the twelve flights which brought the tritium --  2.5 grams at a time -- to South Africa. Small as the quantity  was, it would have been enough to make one bomb every six weeks.    Piet Koornhof, Minister for Mines at the time the yellowcake  deal was struck, was replaced by Fanie Botha in a Vorster  reshuffle. Fanie Botha's interest in the Defence portfolio was  known by Vorster: Blaauw testified that arrangements were made  for Botha to tour secret Israeli military installations in  preparation for his elevation to the defence portfolio. Blaauw  said he handled the details of Botha's itinerary and accompanied  him to Israel.    Botha was a hit with the Israelis. ""Look after Fanie Botha,""  Blaauw's contact in Israel told him. He explained to the court  that Israel wanted to keep Botha at the Mines Ministry until the  yellowcake shipments were complete. After that, they were eager  for him to become Defence Minister, hoping that he would be more  cooperative than Pieter W. Botha, who held the post at the time.    Blaauw testified that he began diverting funds to Fanie  Botha  from a US$1 million ""gift"" he had received from Israel. The  objective was not to sweeten Botha, Blaauw explained, but to  keep his political career from being destroyed by mounting  personal debt.    Botha's trusted administrative secretary Frances Peter van  Ravensway Whelpton, however, was an outright crook. He pocketed  all but Rand [R] 110,000 ($34,000) of the R. 420,000 that Blaauw  provided for Botha between 1977 and 1980. The funds were  channelled through Whelpton so that Botha would not know the  source and to distance him from the source, which was kickbacks  from Pretoria's arms deals with Israel, according to Blaauw.  Additionally, Blaauw admitted making small payments to  Whelpton, who apparently conceived and facilitated the grant of  mining concessions on state-owned land (Sea Areas 1 and 2 on the  West Coast) to Blaauw's company Ondombo Beleggings which  precipitated the fall out with Botha. Whelpton pleaded guilty  to extortion and illicitly possessing state secrets and was  sentenced to five years in prison. It was several months before  Blaauw realised that Botha was slow to hand over the mining  leases because those areas had already been promised to others.    As an interesting sidenote, two senior officials from Anglo-  American submitted testimony to the trial. According to the  presiding judge's interpretation of the testimony of Harry  Oppenheimer (Chairman of Anglo-American from 1957 to March 1983)  was that Oppenheimer undertook to do what he could to assist  Fanie Botha and in fact had an interview with Tertius Myburgh,  the editor of the Sunday Times, as a result of which no  information about Fanie Botha's financial position was published  in that newspaper [sentence as published].    However, the judge's interpretation is at variance with  Oppenheimer's recollection of his testimony. Oppenheimer told  Africa Confidential on 2 February 1994 that although he had no  control over what was published in the English press in South  Africa he had ""said he would pass on to Myburgh what Botha had  told him. He subsequently told Myburgh the substance of his  conversation with Botha, but he did not ask Myburgh whether he  intended to publish any story relating to the Minister's  affairs. Myburgh did say he was aware of rumours surrounding  Minister Botha's affairs, and that these were being investigated  by his reporters. Oppenheimer did not ask, nor did Myburgh  undertake, not to publish any information regarding Botha's  financial position."" According to Oppenheimer, nothing was  published about Botha at that time for fear of libel.    The current Chairman of Anglo American, Julian Ogilvie  Thompson, has given his version of the events surrounding the  applications for the mining rights on Namaqualand sea areas l-5.  Blaauw testified that he had disputed with Ogilvie Thompson  about which concessions Anglo American should pursue. Ogilvie  Thompson has told Africa Confidential that he first met Blaauw  in June 1979 in Anglo American's offices where Blaauw ""advised  De Beers (Anglo American's sister company) of a change in the  Namaqualand sea areas from discouraging to encouraging  applications for rights to prospect for diamonds."" De Beers  subsequently applied for mining rights in sea areas 1-5 but the  forms were mislaid. Ogilvie Thompson says that the last time he  met Blaauw, who he says was trying to negotiate the concessions  for himself, was in March 1980 at a rendezvous on the N1  highway, when he gave Blaauw a duplicate set of the mining  rights applications which were to be delivered personally to the  Minister. Ogilvie Thompson added: ""No payment was asked for or  made by De Beers to any person in connection with these  applications.""    The Namaqualand sea areas 1-2 were awarded to State Alluvial  Diggings and UK-based Selection Trust Company respectively, and  sea area 3 to US-based Sedco. Areas 4 and 5 went to De Beers:  Setrust, Sedco and De Beers have subsequently joined together  in a joint venture.    In 1981, after attempting to secure the promised leases by  legal action, Blaauw joined by Whelpton began to pressure Botha,  who in turn began lobbying the Van Winsen Committee which had  begun reviewing the leases. According to the court documents,  Blaauw and Whelpton also began threatening to expose how, during  the power struggle sparked by John Vorster's fall in the 1978  information scandal, Fanie Botha, a weak contender for the  succession, agreed that Blaauw should eavesdrop on the phones  and conversations of some his rivals including Foreign Minister  Pik Botha, De Klerk, I.S.J. Schoeman, A.J. Raubenheimer, and A.  P. Treurnicht.    Blaauw and Whelpton also planned to allege publicly that  Fanie Botha plotted with them to implicate two National Party  MPs in illegal diamond transactions, according to testimony in  the case. Another alleged plan, to circulate stories in  Parliament about a sex scandal involving Pik Botha, also made  its way into the court record. More seriously and perhaps a  harbinger of the corruption exposed in the 1990s, the court  entered as evidence a document, which according to Blaauw  testimony, contained a list of Swiss bank accounts opened by  senior officials in the government. The document passed through  the hands of Whelpton and Blaauw, although it is not clear for  what purpose.    When Blaauw threatened to release this information, Botha  called in the police, who began taping telephone calls and  meetings. Botha, who never flatly confirmed or denied that he  had granted the concessions, later admitted to Judge G. Friedman  that he had erased parts of the tape of his meetings with Blaauw.    Friedman cleared Blaauw of extortion and appeared convinced  that Fanie Botha had promised him the concessions in July 1979.  It was proper for Blaauw to have the classified document  concerning Koeberg's fuel requirements, ruled Friedman, because  he was working closely with Wynand de Villiers, director of the  Atomic Energy Corporation, to obtain enriched uranium for the  reactor.

Andre Jordan spoke to South Africa's [RSA]  ambassador Maseru, Gerhard Visser, and asked him whether it  would be correct to describe yesterday's events as a coup  attempt.    [Begin recording] [Visser] It is difficult for me to say so,  I have also heard that the prime minister said that it could  have been a coup. It phased out last night with the release of  the four ministers, but the fact that the deputy prime minister  was killed, it's difficult to place it in the category of a  coup, because there was no follow-through. But as I've already  mentioned, and also that it is the policy of the South African  Government, as well as the TEC [Transitional Executive Council]  that South Africa will not recognize any other government in  Lesotho, but the BCP [Basotholand Congress Party] which was  democratically elected in April 1993.    [Jordan] Do you think a statement from our Department of  Foreign Affairs yesterday reiterating that position could have  had any effect in dampening what might have been a developing  coup?    [Visser] This is not the first time that we've made this  statement, Foreign Minister Botha visited Lesotho on the 15th of  January this year, where he made it very clear on television, on  radio, and in public that South Africa will not support any  military coup in Lesotho, or for that matter, any group or  persons who try to overthrow the BCP government by violent  means. It will not be recognized by South Africa, and will  receive no support whatsoever from the outside world.    [Jordan] Is there any indication of just what faction or who  in the army might have been behind yesterday's events?    [Visser] No, all I can tell you is that it is the RLDF, the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force, the soldiers were from the  Makoanyane Barracks, as far as I could gather, and that the four  ministers who were detained were also detained at the Makoanyane  Barracks.    [Jordan] The soldiers at the other barracks on the opposite  side of town, are they likely to take any action. Are they  loyal to the government. Do we see an army split into two  factions, pro and anti-government?    [Visser] That's also a tough question for me to ask as a  diplomat. Yes, I would think the army was split into two  factions in the February and March problems, but it seems to me,  as far as I could gather, and news is difficult to come by in  Maseru, that this time it was the Makoanyane Barracks, and not  the headquarters people that apprehended and detained the  ministers. But I would not say there are two factions in the  RLDF at the moment.    [Jordan] But you say we're not looking at the likelihood of  clashes as happened earlier in the year?    [Visser] It's very difficult to say. I hope not, let me put  it like that, I hope not. I think it's time for the soldiers now  to accept the present government, to discuss their problems with  the present government, and to look at the future of Lesotho per  se. You know these actions by soldiers or individuals or groups  cause tremendous harm to the economy of Lesotho and also to  tourism, etcetera, etcetera. The fact that Foreign Minister  Botha has already told South Africans not to travel to Lesotho  will have an adverse effect on the economy and tourism.    [Jordan] And yet the situation today looks quite normal?    [Visser] It's always been, it's always been very difficult  to  describe to people who have never been to Maseru how it looks  here. I mean even at the heights of the shooting of the 23d of  January this year, well, the soldiers were shooting at each  other on the surrounding hills, the man in the street just went,  more or less, on with his daily life.

General Ibrahim Babangida, the Nigerian president, showered Mr de Klerk with extravagant praise during his visit, the first by a white South African leader to Nigeria. At a state banquet on Thursday night, he declared that Mr de Klerk deserved a place among the most famous black South African anti-apartheid fighters: Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), Mr Steve Biko, the black consciousness leader who died in police custody under a previous white government, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the anti-apartheid cleric. These were extraordinary words from a Nigerian given the open hostility which has characterised Nigeria's relations with South Africa for decades. But Gen Babangida went beyond mere rhetoric to physical embrace: he grasped Mr de Klerk's hand and the two men stood swaying to the strains of Nigerian music, a remarkable demonstration of their new-found reconciliation. Nigerian officials say President Babangida wants to establish diplomatic relations with Pretoria and to sponsor South Africa's entry into the Organisation of African Unity, of which he is currently chairman. This would be possible only after a multi-racial interim government is established in South Africa, likely within months. Reconciliation with South Africa is likely to prove the largest foreign affairs achievement of President Babangida's career. He is due to hand over to a civilian government at the year end. Both President Babangida and Mr de Klerk repeatedly stressed their joint vision of a brave new future for Africa built around a Lagos-Pretoria axis which they hope will give the continent new clout in international relations. There were frequent protestations of African brotherhood from both sides, with each eyeing the economic benefits of closer co-operation. President Babangida said: 'We are delighted that we have at last found someone in South Africa with whom we can do business.' Indeed, the real prize of the trip will be normalised commercial relations between Africa's two regional superpowers. The leaders of South Africa's three largest business organisations accompanied Mr de Klerk to Nigeria, where they met Nigerian business leaders to discuss renewing trade ties. They said clandestine trade with Nigeria had carried on throughout the sanctions period but could be much increased, perhaps to more than R200m (Pounds 40.2m) a year. Nigerian crude oil is not suitable for South African refineries, but Nigerian manufacturers are keen to import South African steel and industrial chemicals.  The Financial Times   London Page 32  "

If success is measured in gross domestic product, developing Asian countries have been and continue to be pre-eminently successful examples of how to manage high-speed industrial revolutions. According to the Asian Development Bank, per capita income in developing Asia grew at an average rate of 4.4 per cent a year between 1970 and 1992, compared with 1 per cent in Latin America and virtually nil in Africa. Last year, growth in the developing Asian economies was almost 10 times as high as in Africa and more than twice as high as in Latin America or the Middle East. There is no sign that growth is slowing. Cambodia is mired in a messy civil war, but the communist-run economies of Vietnam and Laos are being liberalised and are expanding. Economists predict that growth in China will moderate after the double-digit expansion of the past two years, but average GDP growth in the four south-east Asian economies of Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore should rise to more than 8 per cent this year from 7.8 per cent in 1993 and 6.9 per cent in 1992. Even the Philippines and Burma, Asia's laggards, are recovering. Behind the rosy statistics lie some extraordinarily rapid industrial and social changes. Retailing, for example, is being transformed in south-east Asia. Giant, western-style shopping malls - Seacon Square, said to be the largest mall in Asia, was opened in Bangkok in August - are starting to replace markets and small shops. As international communications improve and Asian countries industrialise at an ever-increasing speed, Asians are leap-frogging whole stages of development experienced in previous industrial revolutions. Some people use cellular telephones before they know what it is to have a fixed telephone. Exports of rice and tapioca are replaced by exports of microchips, allowing western companies to exploit niche markets by exporting to Asia intermediate industrial goods. Asia's success has spawned a clutch of reports seeking to explain what Asia is doing right and what other regions of the world might emulate. The findings are not particularly startling: successful Asian countries have encouraged foreign investment, been fiscally responsible, and kept inflation low; their citizens save much of their income and do not have too many children. Predicting which factors might limit Asian growth in the future is more problematic. Several Asian countries lack the transport and communications infrastructure required to support their increasingly modern industrial economies, but such difficulties will probably be overcome in time with the help of money from foreign investors and fast-growing local capital markets; even Thailand, which has been notoriously lax in developing its infrastructure, is building new roads and is now installing millions of new telephone lines, although work on a mass transit system for congested Bangkok has yet to begin. The environmental damage caused by population growth and uncontrolled pollution and commercial exploitation could be another factor limiting Asian growth, especially since several of the region's economies still depend heavily on exports of natural products such as timber and fish. Environmentalists say the recent growth rates of high-performing Asian economies would be several percentage points lower if the benefits from asset-stripping of environmental resources were excluded from the figures. Another problem is the shortage of skilled labour that is already increasing costs in some fast-growing Asian countries, and the lack of home-grown technical skills. And although intra-Asian trade and investment are increasing, the worsening mood of Asia's international trading partners in the US and Europe could yet turn out to be the most important determinant of Asian growth rates. As the World Bank noted in a report* published in July, east Asia's exports have risen more than thirtyfold in the past quarter of a century to about Dollars 850bn, increasing the east Asian share of all world exports to 21 per cent from seven per cent. The result of this - industrialised countries' imports from east Asia have been rising by 15 to 20 per cent a year without their receiving greatly improved access to Asian markets in return - is a series of probably unsustainable Asian trade surpluses and rising trade tension between the US on the one hand and China and Japan on the other. The World Bank recommends that Asian exporters, for their own good, should therefore accelerate the liberalisation of their trade regimes. Import tariffs, for example, should be halved, bearing in mind that countries such as China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam have sometimes been protecting manufacturing with effective rates of more than 40 per cent. Much of the industry protected for nationalistic reasons is not domestic. In Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, the ADB says, foreign companies account for more than half of manufactured exports. 'Import protection is no longer justified by the old infant-industry arguments,' the World Bank report says. 'Many of the protected industries are no longer infants, and much of the protection is costly.' A number of Asian governments have already embarked on a new round of tariff-cutting and liberalising of foreign investment laws. Economists in Asia, for whom optimism has become a way of life, are betting that the region's dragons and tigers will once again adapt successfully to the international climate and that GDP will continue to grow both in absolute and in per capita terms. * East Asia's Trade and Investment: Regional and Global Gains from Liberalisation.

0,FT942-802 ,"FT942-802 _AN-EF1DKABCFT 940628   FT  28 JUN 94 / White House irritates advocates for Africa      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   Americans interested in sub-Saharan Africa are a small and beleaguered band, who generally welcome any attention from the administration with desperate gratitude. Yet a two-day White House conference addressed by President Bill Clinton, Vice-President Al Gore and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa, not to mention secretary of state Warren Christopher and national security adviser Anthony Lake, has accomplished the remarkable feat of irritating even Africa's most devoted advocates. Several experts who had been told they would be asked did not receive invitations, and most members of the congressional black caucus stayed away, partly in protest at the administration's policy towards Haiti, and partly because they felt they had been asked as an afterthought. The conference, due to be addressed late yesterday by Mr Clinton, was billed by the White House as an attempt to refocus attention on issues such as sustainable development, responses to internal conflicts, support for democracy and human rights, and enhancing bilateral trade and investment ties. But the idea of an occasional gathering of the great and the good has drawn criticism as being no substitute for continuous attention to the continent's problems. 'It is the typical Clinton method: you get 150 of the brightest minds you can find into the same room, and come up with the lowest common denominator,' sniffed one Washington diplomat. And while Mr Mandela, in a videotaped message, called on the US to become 'the leading partner in the most novel and challenging project since the Marshall Plan', Mr Lake warned the US's willingness to get involved was constrained by lack of budget resources and by the US public's doubts about overseas intervention. Although Mr Lake acknowledged that genocide had taken place in Rwanda - a question on which the State Department has equivocated, to the outrage of human rights groups - he offered little prospect of future US action. With the end of the cold war and South Africa's transition to democracy, as well as the unhappy experience of humanitarian intervention in Somalia, the US has been pulling back from Africa. The Central Intelligence Agency, for example, plans to close 15 stations in Africa, which it says existed not to gather information about Africa but to monitor and recruit eastern bloc officials.

In Pretoria, the official line is that apartheid is dead.    On the streets, the goverment is as busy as ever in its crackdown on people  protesting apartheid.    Today, several million whites may vote in the national elections. None of the  more than 25 million blacks even has the right to vote. Under the Group Areas  Act, black people are still required to live in so-called ""townships,""  remarkable for their squalor and dreariness and for the ease with which they  can be sealed off militarily.    People who demonstrate against these segregated and inferior conditions are  gassed and arrested. Black and white leaders who oppose the system and seem to  be effective are either detained or restricted under so-called emergency  regulations, which the entirely white courts have declined to review.    If it weren't for international sanctions, the government wouldn't even offer  the pretense of change. Leaky and ineffective as they are, sanctions aggravate  the economic decline of the country, under way since the beginning of the  decade. Blacks know that external sanctions are now their best hope, because  internally opposition is neutralized by an efficient security apparatus while  externally the military arm of the African National Congress, always  overestimated, has been deflected.    The extra-parliamentary opposition, as it is called, presses allies abroad to  maintain and increase sanctions. The white government is also obsessed with  sanctions. It seeks to have them lifted by creating the illusion of change.    The dynamics of the Pretoria government militate against real change. A  characteristic of autocratic states is that officials seek to conserve the  party, the system, their constituencies and their careers, even though the  economy and the social infrastructure may be slowly disintegrating. Where even  the enfranchised cannot dismiss rulers who have failed to perform well, there's  no incentive to undertake initiatives that might fail.    True, initiatives might reverse the decline, but they will hurt some  constituents. More to the point, they can fail, which would spell the end of a  career. Staying on course has no risk. Things will decline further, but  imperceptibly to those who count. Meanwhile, one's career can flourish.    This is how it works in South Africa. Like bureaucrats in the Brezhnev era,  Pretoria's officials make the smallest concessions, just enough to get by.  Words are changed. Apartheid is dead. (But it's not.) Many people are executed.  (That continues.) The government is ready to negotiate. (But not with the  enemy.) The voice is now Jacob's, the hands are still Esau's.    They may be unaware of it, but white racists are also victims of their system.  They were taught to hate in school, in their families and, until four years  ago, by the church. All their information is controlled. Everything they hear  and see validates the hatred. In an odd way, the men and women who have taken a  stand, even if they're detained or restricted, are freer.    In my talks with black people in the townships, I was struck by their  understanding of the situation and their extraordinary tranquility. It comes, I  suppose, from a sense of the human dignity of all, from courage and from the  deep conviction that history will vindicate them.    The saddest people in South Africa are the ""in-betweeners,"" mostly whites, in  business, the universities and even government, who have some moral  consciousness and recognize the evil of the system but who accommodate it and  are rewarded with wealth, comfort and respect.    The in-betweeners are skilled at the double-entry bookkeeping of all moralizers  and rationalizers. They may pay their domestic servants a wee bit more, protect  a friend who has trekked to Dakar or Lusaka to meet with the ANC, bemoan the  government privately and tell themselves they're working from within to change  the system while they tolerate and benefit from it. They always tell you  apartheid is dead and things are getting better. They are the damned of South  Africa.    So the king is dead. Long live the king. The ruling National Party, the  government that proclaimed the death of apartheid, is campaigning on a platform  of ""group rights."" That means that different groups should have their own  facilities and the option of living separately, with no group controlling any  other.

The government in Pretoria may capture the minds of its people. It must not  capture ours. Apartheid is not dead.      Opinion    "," LA090689-0010   103642    September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition      Metro; Part 2; Page 7; Column 1; Op-Ed Desk      975 words      APARTHEID'S DEATH: REPORTS ARE GREATLY EXAGGERATED      By MICHAEL REISMAN, Michael Reisman, professor of law at Yale University,  lectured on human rights in South Africa for the U.S. Information Service.      In Pretoria, the official line is that apartheid is dead.    On the streets, the goverment is as busy as ever in its crackdown on people  protesting apartheid.    Today, several million whites may vote in the national elections. None of the  more than 25 million blacks even has the right to vote. Under the Group Areas  Act, black people are still required to live in so-called ""townships,""  remarkable for their squalor and dreariness and for the ease with which they  can be sealed off militarily.    People who demonstrate against these segregated and inferior conditions are  gassed and arrested. Black and white leaders who oppose the system and seem to  be effective are either detained or restricted under so-called emergency  regulations, which the entirely white courts have declined to review.    If it weren't for international sanctions, the government wouldn't even offer  the pretense of change. Leaky and ineffective as they are, sanctions aggravate  the economic decline of the country, under way since the beginning of the  decade. Blacks know that external sanctions are now their best hope, because  internally opposition is neutralized by an efficient security apparatus while  externally the military arm of the African National Congress, always  overestimated, has been deflected.    The extra-parliamentary opposition, as it is called, presses allies abroad to  maintain and increase sanctions. The white government is also obsessed with  sanctions. It seeks to have them lifted by creating the illusion of change.    The dynamics of the Pretoria government militate against real change. A  characteristic of autocratic states is that officials seek to conserve the  party, the system, their constituencies and their careers, even though the  economy and the social infrastructure may be slowly disintegrating. Where even  the enfranchised cannot dismiss rulers who have failed to perform well, there's  no incentive to undertake initiatives that might fail.    True, initiatives might reverse the decline, but they will hurt some  constituents. More to the point, they can fail, which would spell the end of a  career. Staying on course has no risk. Things will decline further, but  imperceptibly to those who count. Meanwhile, one's career can flourish.    This is how it works in South Africa. Like bureaucrats in the Brezhnev era,  Pretoria's officials make the smallest concessions, just enough to get by.  Words are changed. Apartheid is dead. (But it's not.) Many people are executed.  (That continues.) The government is ready to negotiate. (But not with the  enemy.) The voice is now Jacob's, the hands are still Esau's.    They may be unaware of it, but white racists are also victims of their system.  They were taught to hate in school, in their families and, until four years  ago, by the church. All their information is controlled. Everything they hear  and see validates the hatred. In an odd way, the men and women who have taken a  stand, even if they're detained or restricted, are freer.    In my talks with black people in the townships, I was struck by their  understanding of the situation and their extraordinary tranquility. It comes, I  suppose, from a sense of the human dignity of all, from courage and from the  deep conviction that history will vindicate them.    The saddest people in South Africa are the ""in-betweeners,"" mostly whites, in  business, the universities and even government, who have some moral  consciousness and recognize the evil of the system but who accommodate it and  are rewarded with wealth, comfort and respect.    The in-betweeners are skilled at the double-entry bookkeeping of all moralizers  and rationalizers. They may pay their domestic servants a wee bit more, protect  a friend who has trekked to Dakar or Lusaka to meet with the ANC, bemoan the  government privately and tell themselves they're working from within to change  the system while they tolerate and benefit from it. They always tell you  apartheid is dead and things are getting better. They are the damned of South  Africa.    So the king is dead. Long live the king. The ruling National Party, the  government that proclaimed the death of apartheid, is campaigning on a platform  of ""group rights."" That means that different groups should have their own  facilities and the option of living separately, with no group controlling any  other. In other words, forget ""one man one vote"" and majority rule. In other  words, apartheid.    Even that change of vocabulary could cost the ruling party the election, for  the right-wing Conservative Party claims to reject any accommodation.

The stigma of doing business with South Africa will at last have been removed. Yet this signal, for which investors have waited years, risks being being undermined by a damaging dispute between the government and the ANC over cellular telephone licences. The issue has become so serious that Mr Mandela and President F W de Klerk this month held a meeting purely on this subject. The cabinet was yesterday preparing to authorise the issue of the two licences which on Tuesday Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC secretary general, warned would be reviewed and possibly revoked by a new government. Vodafone of the UK has a 35 per cent stake in Vodacom, one consortium expected to win a licence. The public utility Telkom has a 50 per cent stake and Rembrandt 15 per cent. The other consortium likely to be successful includes Cable  Wireless. The two winners will run competing services. Although the ANC says it is not opposed to cellular telephone networks, it has raised numerous objections to the way in which the government is issuing the licences. The ANC maintains the government is proceeding with 'unilateral restructuring' of the economy, that is trying to privatise the telecommunications network, and that the technology chosen is too expensive and unsuitable for South Africa. Within the government and the business community these reasons are widely dismissed as a fig-leaf for objections that are purely political  - that government money should no longer be spent without the ANC's agreement. There is also a more insidious suspicion that the ANC is trying to delay the issue of the licences in order to allow various US and Scandinavian companies to participate when sanctions in those countries are lifted. There have even been unsubstantiated suggestions that the ANC expects financial contributions from successful bidders. On the ideological level, the ANC believes cellular phones should be run by the state - and subsidised if need be - while the government sees them as a means of introducing competition into the telecommunications sector. It also sees a cellular network as the cheapest and quickest means of offering most South Africans access to a telephone. The message to foreign investors will be clear and unpalatable: the ANC remains an organisation that favours state over market, and South Africa remains a country where political interference can be expected in business decisions. If the government presses ahead with awarding licences, there must be some doubt as to whether those chosen will proceed while the security of their investment remains in doubt. Each licence is expected to involve the investment of about R1bn (Pounds 193m), with an estimated R700m of this coming from abroad. In South Africa telephone penetration (fixed phones per 100 people) is only 9.6 (about 2.4 in the black community; ten times that among whites). This compares to only 1.5 for the rest of Africa but to an average of about 50 for developed countries. The tender documents stressed that a criterion which would 'weigh heavily' was the extent to which the applicant was prepared to provide telephone services to the underdeveloped part of the community, almost certainly at subsidised tariffs. Vodacom's plans include introducing at least 22,000 subsidised card-operated community telephones to over 60 township and rural areas.

The owners of Firestone East Africa (1969), the only tyre manufacturer in Kenya, are offering 20 per cent of the company's shares for sale in the biggest initial public offering in Kenya to date. If the offer for sale is fully subscribed, it will raise Ks1.4bn (Dollars 27.9m) for Bridgestone/Firestone Inc of the US and Sameer Investments of Kenya, which own 19 per cent and 81 per cent of the local tyre manufacturer respectively. The offer has been priced at 10 times 1993 earnings, which is comparable with other manufacturing companies listed on the NSE. The Kenyan stock market is still officially closed to foreign participation regulations but Firestone East Africa obtained a special exemption due to the size of the share offer. 'We believe the government is using Firestone as a test case to assess the interest and the impact of overseas investors in our stock market,' said Mr Issa Timamy, group company secretary at Sameer Investments. With at least two local banks planning flotations before the end of the year, Mr Timamy believes the central bank will gradually relax the rules of foreign participation. The restrictions on foreign portfolio investment are virtually the last foreign exchange controls to remain following a year of steady deregulation. The Kenya shilling is fully convertible for all current account transactions. Exporters can retain proceeds in foreign currency and multinationals can remit profits and dividends. Nevertheless, the central bank is proceeding cautiously. Only 8m shares  - one-fifth of the offer - will be available to overseas bidders, who must be institutional investors. Underlying central bank concern is possible disruption caused by large flows of foreign funds on a small, illiquid stock market. Daily turnover on the NSE rarely exceeds Ks21m and the NSE index, although volatile, is up by 50 per cent since the beginning of the year. Nairobi stock brokers believe Firestone's issue will be of interest to overseas investors wishing to obtain a toe-hold in one of Africa's emerging markets.

0,FT943-1170 ,"FT943-1170 _AN-EIZD8ACFFT 940926   FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (28): Surprises are inevitable - Good project management still relies on tried and tested principles      By PHILIP MANCHESTER   Building software applications is a little like carpentry, writes Philip Manchester. Although the principles of shaping wood are universal, every piece of wood is unique and the craft is in learning how to cope with the unexpected. Software development follows the same process and no matter how concise the development method is, there are bound to be surprises. Modern project management techniques aim to keep surprises to the minimum and be ready with contingency plans if something goes wrong. Over the past 30 years, software developers have found a variety of ways to manage the construction of software. From the rigorous 'methodologies' and computer-aided design tools to management and project reporting systems, there is no shortage of tools for the job. But despite the availability of the tools, good project management still relies on tried and tested principles: 'There are plenty of tools around but it is hard to stop people being a slave to them. We use the tools to gather information and see what works and what doesn't. But there is no substitute for experience and skills,' says Mr John Millar, technical director of Logica UK. 'The key to successful project engineering is to improve the literacy of our staff and instil discipline.' Logica's approach to managing large-scale projects aims to take the best management practice and combine it with good automated tools: 'We focus on what we call micro methods. We have a framework which covers the life-cycle of the project and make use of tools where necessary,' Mr Millar explains. However, he is, like many others, sceptical about an overly formal approach to managing software development projects: 'At the end of the 1980s there was a lot of talk about methodologies solving development problems. I think of them as the 'Lose fat while sleeping' approach and I don't believe that it works. Some parts of the methodology can be useful  - but I think it naive to see a simple way to solve the problem,' Mr Millar says. He goes on to say that Structured Systems Analysis and Design Method (SSADM), one of the more successful methodologies, at least brought the users of the system into the design approach. 'SSADM showed how important it was to get users involved and it has turned out to be a useful way to describe systems.' Other software developers are also finding user input during the project design phase to be a significant step forward. Mr Keith Turner, a divisional director software developer for Hoskyns Group, sees this as an inevitable result of a change in the way software is built: 'Software development is more iterative now. Users have to be involved because you need some form of open relationship with the customer. The more you can work as a team, the more likely you are to be successful,' says Mr Turner. 'Tools and methods can help but they cannot compensate for incompetence. You must get the people right and the balance of team skills.'   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

OKS FUNDS FOR NAMIBIA FORCE      From Associated Press      UNITED NATIONS      The General Assembly on Wednesday approved $416 million for the U.N.  peacekeeping mission to help free Namibia from 74 years of South African rule.    On April 1, the United Nations is to begin implementing a one-year plan to  create the world's newest independent nation, thus settling the last major  colonial problem in Africa.    South Africa has run Namibia, or South-West Africa, since World War I, when it  captured the former German colony. In December, Pretoria finally agreed to the  plan to make the territory a sovereign state.

0,FT932-12217 ,"FT932-12217 _AN-DD2CUAEEFT 930429   FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Diagnosing Africa's ills   WHEN OXFAM, one of Britain's leading aid agencies, warns that Africa's economic crisis has put the continent on a knife edge, the world should take note. From Ethiopia in the mid-1980s to Somalia in the 1990s, Oxfam and other non-government organisations have sounded alarm bells that have aroused public opinion and jolted western governments out of complacency or indifference. This time, says Oxfam, the continent, not just a country, is in jeopardy. If its fledgling democracies are to survive and fragile peace agreements are to hold, sub-Saharan Africa needs more help. Much of its external debt should be written off; aid flows must be increased; and structural adjustment programmes reformed, Oxfam argues in its recovery plan for the region. Oxfam's proposals would be enhanced by a more detached and comprehensive examination of the causes of Africa's crisis. It puts most of the blame on external villains: the IMF and the World Bank; the banks that lent money to Africa in the 1970s; western governments which spend too much on defence and too little on aid; industrialised nations which defend protectionist trade regimes. A markedly more cautious and inhibited approach characterises Oxfam's analysis of Africa's shortcomings, past and present. Zaire's Mobutu and Malawi's Banda are roundly and rightly condemned; but there is no appraisal, for example, of ex-president Julius Nyerere's disastrous pursuit of African socialism in Tanzania. Harmful omissions The report is right to note that the slump in world commodity prices has cost Africa dearly. But it overlooks the fact that domestic policy failures caused Africa's share of the market to fall. Western defence budgets may be too high; but Africa's own military spending is still excessive. These omissions undermine Oxfam's assertion that the structural adjustment policies urged on Africa by the World Bank and the IMF have not halted the continent's decline. Its analysis suggests that this 'failure' is almost entirely the fault of the doctor and has little to do with the behaviour of the patient. Yet in Nigeria and Kenya, World Bank-supported reforms have been undermined by vested interests and endemic corruption. Oxfam barely touches on Africa's compelling need to attract foreign investment. The rate of return on foreign investment dropped from around 30 per cent in the 1960s to 2.5 per cent in the 1980s. Today, Africa's share of global foreign direct investment is 0.6 per cent. Alarming symptoms Whatever the dispute about the cure, however, the symptoms of the disease are alarming. The external debt crisis is getting worse not better, while rescheduling has done little more than prolong the agony. Africa's debt was Dollars 56bn in 1980, 29 per cent of GNP. Twelve years later, further enervated by war and drought, it owes Dollars 180bn, over 100 per cent of annual gross national product. The IMF and the Bank are hard-pressed to find an African country where structural adjustment has led to a sustained recovery that has not been supported by continuing aid. Recovery is made all the more difficult by trade hurdles. The average tariff on cocoa beans, an important African export, is only 2.6 per cent, on chocolate nearly 12. Such tariff escalation reinforces Africa's dependence on primary commodities by discouraging investment in local processing. However serious the constraints imposed by an unfavourable external environment, there can be no excuse for the way that Oxfam underplays domestic shortcomings. This may have something to do with the fact that it has to live with the governments it criticises. But the report's inhibited treatment of Africa's faults suggests some members of Oxfam are still fighting under the banner of a discredited ideology, reluctant to surrender a vision that harks back to the heyday of African socialism. Oxfam weakens its own case. Its warning that Africa is in peril is timely. But to the extent that its assessment of structural adjustment is inadequate, the alternatives it proposes lose credibility. If Oxfam allows erring African governments to avoid shouldering their share of the blame for the continent's crisis, it does a disservice to Africa's citizens.   Countries:-  XMZ  Africa.

Built by the  Indonesian Army, it is home to 550 people who formerly carved  out a subsistence life in the mountains. The village is part of  the army's attempts to win the hearts and minds of the East  Timorese. It features electricity, safe drinking water, a  health centre, school, church, and satellite television, foreign  and local. But despite such efforts to upgrade their living  conditions, the East Timorese remain far from happy about  Indonesian rule.    ""It will take a generation to integrate with Indonesia,""  says  Marcus Wanandi, an Indonesian Jesuit priest who heads East  Timor's largest school and the scion of a well-known Sumatera  family.    Indonesia's development spending in the province since it  took over in 1975 from Portugal has borne some fruit; literacy  has doubled from only 22 percent in 1980 to 44 percent in 1990.  From a low of 61 schools under Portuguese rule, there are now  more than 1,000. But 45 percent of the workforce are unemployed  or underemployed and skilled people must migrate to find jobs.  Much-needed investment from the rest of Indonesia is stymied by  the perceived security problem and from outside because of East  Timor's disputed status. The United Nations does not recognise  Indonesia's takeover of the territory in 1975 after Portugal,  the colonial power, left in a hurry.    An even more fundamental problem blocking both development  and successful integration into Indonesia is what the East  Timorese see as Indonesia's failure to understand East Timor's  culture. ""Life for us did not begin in 1975,"" said Florentini  Sarmento, head of Dili's largest grassroots aid organisation.  ""We have a different identity and a long history. East  Timorese feel deeply misunderstood and mistreated by Indonesia.""    Bridging the cultural gap is not made any easier by the loss  of virtually the entire Timorese educated elite, now resident  overseas, mainly in Portugal and Australia. Senior Indonesians  from other areas may find it difficult to believe that the poor  who remain behind are anything more than an extremely backward  native ethnic group similar to the many others found in the  archipelago. [passage omitted]    There are now hints, however, that Indonesia is coming to a  realisation after almost 20 years that the approach used so far  in trying to integrate East Timor is not very successful. At  the same time, some formerly hardline Timorese an also willing  to explore ways of moving forward. The recent discovery of oil  offshore in the Timor Gap area could spur efforts to improve the  political climate as it holds out the promise of higher economic  growth. [passage omitted] But the development of East Timor will  need to take into account cultural differences far more than is  normal in Indonesia if it is to be successful. These need not,  however, be a barrier. Indeed, to a foreign tourist, Timor's  cultural differences would be seen a an asset, not a burden.    If the East Timorese were treated as a potential asset and  as  partners in their own development, it is far more likely that  they would appreciate Indonesia's efforts on their behalf. If  not, their cultural pride could create major problems for  Indonesia for some time to come.     "
0,FT934-7737 ,"FT934-7737 _AN-DKRC7AGRFT 931118   FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of South Africa - Open for investment (13): A quantum leap - Johannesburg Stock Exchange      By PHILIP GAWITH   BACK in 1986 when sanctions began in earnest, the US sold and Europe bought. Now, at least as far as the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) is concerned, the positions are reversed. Europe is cautious, the US euphoric. Down on Diagonal Street, home of the JSE, brokers groan pleasurably at the stampede of US investors knocking on their door - a veritable Wall Street who's who. Of course, the US presence on the JSE has already been highly visible in 1993, being largely responsible for driving the bull markets in bonds and gold shares. But since ANC president Nelson Mandela called for the lifting of economic sanctions in September, interest has soared. Once limited to speculators, hedge funds and specialists, especially on the gold board, the heavy artillery is massing just over the brow. It will be some time yet before the debris of US state and municipal sanctions is finally cleared, and fund managers who are responsible to trustees will keep a watchful eye on political developments before making any significant decisions. The view on Diagonal Street, however, is that it is now a question of when, rather than if, funds flow. A broker comments: 'If you aggregate the figures we've heard, there'll be a lot of sheep trying to get through a very narrow gate.' One Hong Kong fund manager visitingJohannesburg said he was convinced investors would drive the price/earnings ratio of the JSE from 15 to 25, as they have with other emerging markets. As JSE-watchers point out, it is hardly a typical emerging market - more than 100 years old and with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 145bn (at the financial rand exchange rate of R4.30/Dollars 1), it is one of the 10 largest in the world. There are about 80 stocks with a market capitalisation of more than Dollars 200m, the cut-off point often used by international fund managers to identify stocks they are prepared to hold. Hence the preference among analysts for describing the JSE as a 're-emerging' market. Two caveats need to be entered about the bull scenario for the JSE. First, if the main international stock markets crack, the Dow Jones industrial index in particular, then the JSE is sure to follow. Second, South Africa must achieve a relatively stable political transition. Assuming these hurdles are cleared, then the case for the JSE is easily developed. US investors and fund managers are looking to invest an increasing portion of their assets outside the US to improve returns. Given the JSE accounts for about 0.9 per cent of total world stock market capitalisation, and most US fund managers hold little if any SA stock, it is reasonable to assume a flow of funds. Until recently, virtually no US analysts followed South African stocks. As they start to cover them, so funds are likely to follow. A recent study of 47 global emerging market funds (mostly UK and US) by the UK group Micropal shows that as at June 30, 1993, only 0.07 per cent of their Dollars 8bn assets were invested in South Africa. This process will gather impetus when Morgan Stanley develops a South Africa index for inclusion in its world index, and should the International Finance Corporation grant the JSE emerging market status. (SA stocks qualify because domestic per capita income is below the Dollars 7,910 cut-off). The case for the JSE is considerably hardened by fairly reliable talk of six to seven South (or southern) Africa country funds being established. Alliance Capital Management Corporation, one of the largest investment management funds in the US with about Dollars 110bn of funds under management, and backed by Merrill Lynch, has already lodged a prospectus with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch The Southern Africa Fund - a closed end investment company. These funds could easily raise Dollars 500m. Dollars 500m The chief concern about any large inflow of funds is whether the JSE, with its notoriously poor tradeability, can manage them. Latest JSE figures show annualised liquidity at about 7 per cent, but in recent years this has been closer to 4 per cent. Figures from Johannesburg brokers Ivor Jones, Roy  Co show the most liquid domestic industrial stock, SA Breweries, has a monthly turnover of only Dollars 12m. The most liquid stock, by a long margin, is De Beers, with a monthly turnover of about Dollars 57m. The main cause of the low liquidity is exchange control. South Africa's large institutional cash flows - about R40bn per annum, of which at least a quarter will make its way into equities - are forced to chase a small pool of domestic quality scrip. Understandably, the good stock they get they are inclined to hold. If strong buying pressures do materialise, then the upward trend of prices will help loosen stock. The yield-driven, short-term focus of some of the speculative funds already in the JSE will make it more volatile, and also boost liquidity. South African bonds will also attract attention. Real yields on long bonds of around 8 per cent for foreign investors compare favourably with the returns available in industrial countries. South Africa is a good risk not to default, the market is well organised and liquid, with more than Dollars 1bn daily trading volume common, the bonds offer prospective capital gains from the fall in inflation, and there is the possibility of currency gains from the appreciation of the financial rand. Investments on the JSE are done through the volatile financial rand, whose movements are capable of wiping out gains in the underlying investments. For investors coming into the bond market in particular, where volumes are quite large, they have to buy the currency before the bond. As one broker commented: 'The currency leg is the narrow gate, not the bond.' Political stability will help stabilise this market, but investors should treat it with caution.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH AFRICA: COMPARABLE EQUITY MARKETS*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Country                  Market             Turnover                             cap                (% of                  (USDollars bn)              mkt cap                                              traded)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hong Kong                   231                   23 South Africa                189                    4 Australia                   153                   19 Brazil                      144                   11 Mexico                      130                   15 Taiwan                      121                  155 Korea                       119                   91 Malaysia                    111                   36 Thailand                     62                   39 Singapore                    60                   38 Chile                        34                    3 Argentina                    27                   19 New Zealand                  18                   11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Markets ranked by market capitalisation, 1993 data Source: SG Warburg Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FOREIGN TRADING ON THE JSE EQUITIES MARKET (Rm)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 1988     1989     1990     1991     1992     1993* Purchases      2,970    8,498   10,471    6,644    4,808    8,606 Sales          2,909    5,116    5,999    2,544    4,801    6,636 Net purchases     61    3,382    4,472    4,100        7    1,970  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Up to October 31 Source: Johannesburg Stock Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

A panel for The Athletics Congress, the national governing body for track and  field, may also decide the length of the suspensions for all the individuals  who participated. The length has yet to be specified.    Among the athletes requested to attend today's hearing are Carol Cady, the U.S.  record-holder in the discus; John Powell, bronze medalist in the discus at the  1976 and 1984 Olympics; Ruth Wysocki, a 1984 Olympian at 800 and 1,500 meters,  and James Robinson, the 1979 Pan American Games champion at 800 meters. The  case of Skip Robinson, track coach at Pasadena City College, also will be  heard.    In addition, two athletes who were suspended at the first hearing, in Chicago  Nov. 18, will have their cases heard today. Neither long jumper Tyrus Jefferson  nor pole vaulter Tom Hintnaus was able to attend the Chicago hearing.    Eleven athletes and coaches have been suspended indefinitely for participating  in the tour, which went to three South African cities last October. Track and  field athletes are prohibited from competing in South Africa because the  country is not a member of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the  sport's world governing body. South Africa was suspended from the organization  in 1976 because of its official policy of racial separation.    According to Rich Nichols, a panel member, the case of Ted Banks, track coach  at Riverside City College, may also be heard. Banks' case was deferred from a  Dec. 15 hearing in Covina after a legal disagreement about TAC's jurisdiction  over a college coach.    Four athletes from Riverside competed on the tour, and Banks is under fire from  student groups at the school for his role as a tour organizer.    The fallout continues for Banks. This week, a prominent African athlete, under  pressure from his government, withdrew from Riverside City College. Julius  Kariuki of Kenya, the Olympic gold medalist in the steeplechase at Seoul, was  reportedly told that because of Banks' participation in the South African tour,  Kariuki could no longer compete for the school. Kariuki set several national  junior college records at Riverside last season.    Nichols said that if time permitted, the panel would set forth the specific  penalties for each participant. The sanctions are expected to vary according to  the extent of the individual's participation and his knowledge of the  ramifications of going to South Africa.

The IMF's figures show that the investments  of the large U.S. investment firms in the portfolios of the  developing nations rose from $1.5 billion to $120 billion during  the last five years. Furthermore, Morocco has greatly benefited  from the interest of private investors, and has come to be  called ""the EC's Mexico.""    In an IMF study dealing with the flow of investments to 46  developing nations over the course of five years, it was  reported that this flow of investments was accompanied by a boom  in direct foreign investments, and that, after the value of  investments had totalled $25 billion, they came to total of $50  billion, according to an IMF newsletter that is published from  time to time and that was published in Washington last Wednesday.    Analysts working for the IMF make a connection between the  big influx of foreign investments and the economic reforms  adopted by a large number of the developing nations which have  strengthened the economies of these nations, and the fact that  about 40 percent of the economic growth experienced by the world  at the present time is taking place in the developing nations,  since a large number of the industrial nations themselves are  drowning in the swamp of an economic recession.    Guy Pfeifermann, a high-level economics expert in the IMF,  points out that ""investors who are looking for investment  opportunities are closely examining and scrutinizing these  markets, and this is something that is only natural.""    Most of the increase in private investments is attributable  to domestic sources, but the huge increase in direct foreign  investments in the developing nations, in Pfeifermann's opinion,  represents a ""historic turning point"" in which investors are  showing that they have complete confidence in the economies of  the developing nations, and this is a confidence which did not  exist five years ago.    Pfeifermann also calls our attention to the fact that the  investment portfolios in the developing nations, during the last  two years, have experienced a vertical upswing. This fact is  closely related to the attractive investment climate that exists  in a large number of the developing nations, and is closely  related to the lowering of U.S. interest rates and decisions by  the large U.S. investment firms to diversify their investment  portfolios.    The IMF's figures indicate that these firms' investments in  the portfolios of the developing nations have increased from  $1.5 billion to $120 billion during the last five years.  However, in view of the fact that these investments constitute  only 0.5 percent of their total investment portfolios, observers  find no reason to worry about whether or not these investments  will continue.    The big surge in private investments appeared mostly in East  Asia and Latin America. The flow of investments to the nations  of North Africa and the Middle East remained average or below  average in relation to the 46 nations covered by the IMF study,  but there was a great discrepancy in the amount of the  investments that flowed into each of these countries (in North  Africa and the Middle East).    Morocco benefited greatly from interest on the part of the  private investors. It has recently experienced great improvement  in this regard and has become, or almost become, ""the EEC's  Mexico,"" because clothes-producing firms have set up plants in  Morocco in order to export their products to the EEC, according  to Pfeifermann.    Lebanon has stood out among the other nations, and the IMF  believes that the beginnings of prosperity exist there.    Pfeifermann points out that a recently-published government  report indicates that the rate of economic growth in Lebanon  surpassed 7 percent last year. He says: ""There is no doubt that  Lebanon is once again having an economic boom after its civil  war came to an end. One positive sign is that a number of  Lebanese companies have asked the IMF for financial aid of the  type that the IMF usually provides.""    But Egypt, on the other hand, earned no praise from the  analysts working for the IMF. Robert Miller, one of the chief  analysts who contributed to the study, says that ""Egypt was far  less promising than the other nations in the area because of the  enormous number of state-owned establishments, which are moving  only very slowly in the direction of privatization.""    Miller is worried about the negative effect that political  problems in Egypt are having on the investment climate there.    Those participating in the study say that the Middle East,  as  a whole, has been hurt by the world's falling oil prices.    The study was confined to 46 nations, chiefly because the  information utilized was not available in the case of the other  developing nations. The study analyzes in detail the situation  in five Middle Eastern and North African nations, which are  Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Iran, and Turkey. One of the criteria  used by the study to evaluate the capability of any of the  economies to attract foreign investments was that of comparing  these investments to the GNP.    In Egypt, private investments were 7.8 percent of the GNP in  1992. This is a low percentage in comparison with the  percentages in Thailand (32 percent) and Korea (25 percent). The  rate of private investments in Tunisia was 10.7 percent of the  GNP, and in Turkey this figure was 11.7 percent. The average  rate for the 46 nations covered by the study was 13.2 percent.    Taking the above-mentioned into consideration, Morocco's  rate  of private investments to its GNP was 13.4 percent (that is,  above average). Perhaps Iran's good performance, which was  accompanied by a noticeable increase in public investments, was  in response to the reforms that in 1992 appeared to evidence  considerable success. But it is also possible that this good  performance is attributable to false information or statistics,  according to officials in the IMF.    The study draws attention to the influx of private  investments in a number of nations in the Middle East or nations  adjacent to it. The performance of the Turkish stock market was  the strongest performance shown by any of the young markets  during the last few years. But this stock market has lost 60  percent of its value in U.S. dollars during the last few months,  a fact that indicates that its performance has been similar to  that of a great many of the young markets in that it is  capricious and not subject to controls.

Several diplomats in the region said right-wing opponents of South African  President Frederik W. de Klerk's efforts to end his country's racial separation  policy of apartheid are also backing the Renamo guerrillas fighting the  Mozambique government.    ""The people trying to stop the internal revolution in South Africa are the same  people destabilizing Mozambique,"" the European diplomat said. ""If you believe  the revolution in South Africa is irreversible, you must believe peace will  come back to Mozambique. War doesn't make sense anymore.""    The head of the U.N. development program in Mozambique, Peter Simkin, warned  that the country faces mass famine. Diplomats estimate two-thirds of the  population already live in absolute poverty and malnutrition is endemic.    More than 5 million people have been driven from their homes, while the United  Nations estimated there were 900,000 war-related deaths in eight years  beginning with 1980.    ""Mozambique is living on a knife edge that could easily become a disaster area  of major proportions . . . it could translate into famine later this year or  early next year and we have no resources to fall back on,"" Simkin said in an  interview. ""We are not in a position to prevent disaster or to mount a massive  relief campaign.""    Diplomats said pledges of aid dropped sharply this year due in part to the  Persian Gulf crisis, reconstruction demands for Eastern Europe and ""donor  weariness.""    Government and church leaders in Mozambique were optimistic in early September  that a peace agreement with Renamo was possible after two rounds of talks in  Rome. President Joaquim Chissano, who has promised the country's first-ever  multi-party presidential and parliamentary elections for next year, even talked  about peace by Christmas.    But Renamo's refusal to attend a third round of talks in September has deadened  optimism, with Chissano throwing the blame squarely on the rebels.    Diplomats note the ruling Frelimo Party in Maputo has basically preempted all  Renamo demands by ditching its socialist ideology and agreeing to a market  economy, political pluralism and a free press.    ""You know if you have an open multi-party system, Renamo has no hope of gaining  power,"" one diplomat said.    The shadowy rebel movement demanded withdrawal of Zimbabwe troops from  Mozambique and an end to attacks on Renamo base areas as a prerequisite for  further talks.    Diplomats estimate Zimbabwe has 6,000 troops in Mozambique, primarily to  protect the so-called Beira corridor rail link from Zimbabwe to the Indian  Ocean port of Beira.    "" . . . The achievement of peace would mean a quick withdrawal of all Zimbabwe  troops,"" President Chissano told journalists at the United Nations in New York  recently. ""All those interested in seeing the country free of foreign troops  should cooperate so that we can achieve peace as soon as possible -- tomorrow  if possible.""    Renamo, the Mozambique Resistance Movement, originally was set up by the white  minority government of Ian Smith in what was then Rhodesia as a destabilizing  force after Mozambique achieved independence from Portugal in June, 1975.    Diplomats in southern Africa said the Rhodesians recruited Renamo guerrillas  from among black members of Portugal's former colonial forces. They were used  primarily against black nationalists operating out of Mozambique against  Rhodesia.    When Rhodesia became Zimbabwe with independence in 1980, the former white  security forces handed Renamo over to South Africa, which continued to use it  against Maputo.    Pretoria and Maputo signed the Nkomati Accord of nonaggression and  good-neighborliness in 1984 and the South African government subsequently cut  all official links with Renamo.    Chissano himself has said he trusted Pretoria's good faith.    Diplomats also believe South Africa severed ties with Renamo, cutting it off  from weapons and communications supplies.    But they said it appears right-wing groups in South Africa, including  Portuguese emigres hoping to recover property they left behind in Mozambique,  continued to support the rebels.    They believe other support came from groups within Portugal -- Renamo's  official headquarters are in Lisbon -- and also Britain, West Germany and the  United States.

0,FT932-14415 ,"FT932-14415 _AN-DDSCSADTFT 930419   FT  19 APR 93 / Conspiracy fears mounton eve of Hani funeral: 15 are shot dead as tension rises in South Africa      By PATTI WALDMEIR   FIFTEEN people, including three children, were killed and 12 wounded in shootings in a black township near Johannesburg last night, as tension in South Africa rose on the eve of today's funeral of the assassinated activist Mr Chris Hani. Tens of thousands of grieving blacks yesterday paid their last respects to Mr Hani, whose body lay in state near Soweto. His funeral, one of the largest political events ever in South Africa, comes as evidence is emerging that his death may have been part of a right-wing conspiracy to destabilise democracy talks. In last night's shootings, black gunmen opened fire on people in the township of Sebokeng. Police said the shootings started when the men killed two people and stole their car, which was later found burnt out. A motive for the attacks was not known. The shootings heightened the atmosphere of emotion and turmoil as South Africa prepared for Mr Hani's funeral, to be held in the mainly white, working-class town of Boksburg, where he was shot by a white assassin on April 10. Boksburg residents have been barricading their homes and putting up razor wire for fear of clashes between black mourners and local whites. A crowd of 30,000 gathered to honour Mr Hani as his body lay in an open casket at a soccer stadium outside Soweto. They sang songs in praise of Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), the African National Congress military wing. ANC leaders filed past the coffin of the man who once commanded Umkhonto in exile. Some touched the body which was dressed in military fatigues and surrounded by flowers. Police meanwhile interrogated a prominent right-wing white, Mr Clive Derby-Lewis, who they said was a suspect in Mr Hani's assassination. Mr Derby-Lewis is a leading figure in the Conservative party, the official parliamentary opposition, and member of the advisory President's Council, part of the government's executive branch. He regularly made news headlines for racist comments, including an incident in 1989 when he commented 'what a pity' on hearing that an aircraft had braked to avoid a black man on the runway at Johannesburg airport. His arrest raises fears that the murder was part of a conspiracy extending beyond the lunatic white fringe to the top of the right-wing establishment. The other suspect, Mr Janusz Walus, is a member of the ultra-right Afrikaner Resistance Movement. Political analysts say involvement of the Conservative party, which polled 800,000 votes in last year's white referendum, would be far more worrying than that of the AWB, a militarist organisation which has vowed to carry out a 'Third Boer War' against blacks. As well as Mr Derby-Lewis, police held a second right-wing supporter, who shot two black protesters on Saturday. The murder of Mr Hani has proved a strategic coup for the ultra-right. The resulting violence has pushed whites further to the right, weakening the ruling National party, and the ultra-right has lost its image of inactivity.

WE MUST DO WHAT WE CAN TO NOURISH AND ENCOURAGE IT.      By HERMAN J. COHEN, Herman J. Cohen is assistant secretary of state for African  affairs.      Although overshadowed by events in Eastern Europe, the political climate in  South Africa, too, is undergoing significant change. South Africans, black and  white, are shaking off old assumptions and rigidities and contemplating fresh  approaches to differences that seemed irreconcilable even a year ago. The  evolving process is still fragile and uncertain, but there is new hope on all  sides that it may yet prove possible to reach agreement on a peaceful  transition to a non-racial, democratic society in South Africa.    Last summer's meeting between then-President Pieter W. Botha and Nelson  Mandela, imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, was a signal of  the South African government's recognition that the country's future cannot be  settled unless there is dialogue with credible opposition leaders. Internal and  external pressures, among which sanctions are only one element, have helped  persuade South African leaders that the well-being of the white minority cannot  be sustained without a negotiated political settlement that results in  political equality for all South Africans.    Claiming a mandate for change after last fall's elections, President Frederik  W. de Klerk has taken a number of encouraging steps to get this process under  way. He has permitted peaceful anti-apartheid demonstrations and rallies, freed  leading political prisoners, announced plans to discard the Separate Amenities  Act, scaled down the state security apparatus and met with credible black  leaders, including Mandela. It is premature to predict whether these steps will  lead to a continuing dialogue, but they constitute tangible evidence that  things are changing, and they offer reason for hope.    The United States has long regarded dialogue among all South Africans as the  most important first step in the process of change. Moves that would further  enhance prospects for dialogue include: an end to violence on all sides; the  release of all political prisoners, including Mandela; the lifting of the state  of emergency and associated restrictions on political activity and freedom of  association for the black opposition, and the unbanning of all political  organizations, including the African National Congress.    U.S. policy toward South Africa is guided by five basic principles:     -- Unequivocal opposition to apartheid;     -- Commitment to building a post-apartheid democratic South Africa through  assistance to black South Africans;     -- Active U.S. diplomacy to resolve conflicts and support economic development  throughout southern Africa;     -- Cooperation with our allies and other concerned nations in a multilateral  approach to South Africa;     -- Maintenance of a bipartisan consensus with Congress on our general approach  to the region.    For its part, the anti-apartheid movement must look beyond the rhetoric of the  past to find creative ways of responding to the unexpected opportunities that  may now be arising. Anti-apartheid activists should work to achieve consensus  among diverse and often hostile opposition elements, and to formulate  constructive principles for the negotiating process that may be emerging. There  are signs that such an effort, with the support of the international community,  is already beginning.    The ANC has indicated that it is taking the possibility of dialogue seriously.  Its expressed preference for the path of negotiated and peaceful settlement was  endorsed in 1989 by the Organization of African Unity. The consensus  declaration adopted at the conclusion of the United Nations special session on  apartheid Dec. 14 not only urged the people of South Africa to join together to  negotiate an end to apartheid; it also postulated fundamental principles that  could constitute the basis for an internationally acceptable solution in South  Africa.    Clearly, a non-racial, democratic South Africa is not yet at hand. While their  overall numbers have diminished, political detainees, including Nelson Mandela,  are still in custody, the state of emergency remains in effect and  black-on-black violence has not abated. But there is a growing sense that the  majority of South Africans of all races may be ready to seize this opportunity  to break out of the isolation imposed by apartheid and rejoin the international  community of free nations.    The United States stands ready, through contact with all parties, to do  everything possible to promote this process. And we hope that negotiations and  peaceful change, as called for in the recent U.N. declaration, will become the  norm for the international community's approach to South Africa.

Castro made the remark as he boarded an airplane in Accra,  the capital of Ghana, after a 12-hour stopover en route to  Pretoria, where the first black president in South African  history will take office on 10 May.    ""I am very pleased to have stopped over in Ghana and to have  met with the Ghanaian people,"" said the Cuban leader, whom  Ghanaian President Jerry John Rawlings welcomed last night at  Katoka Airport.    Concerning his meeting with Rawlings, a longtime friend,  Castro said he was very pleased, although the meeting was very  brief, because Rawlings was also traveling to South Africa.    Castro's trip to South Africa is an important, historic  event. Mandela was in jail just five years ago for trying to  eliminate the system of apartheid and when Cuban troops were  fighting in southern Angola against the South African Army.     "

In an emotional ceremony held just after dawn at the Ohlange High School in the black township of Inanda outside Durban, Mr Mandela repeated the eloquent words with which he addressed the court which in 1964 sentenced him to what were to be 27 years in prison: 'I have fought very firmly throughout my life against white domination and I have fought very firmly against black domination . . . I cherish the idea of a new South Africa where all South Africans are equal and where all South Africans work together to bring about security, peace and democracy.' The stately Mr Mandela, dressed in a simple beige shirt buttoned tight at the neck and casual trousers, flashed his radiant smile for the cameras as he held his ballot poised above the polling box for several seconds before dropping it in with the cry, 'Going, going, gone.' Nonetheless, the grey-haired African National Congress leader appeared visibly strained by the three-month election campaign. Surrounded by at least 20 security guards, he looked tired and drained, and every bit his age. 'This is for all South Africans an unforgettable occasion. It is the realisation of the hopes and dreams we have cherished over the decades: the dream of a South Africa that represents all South Africans. It is the beginning of a new era,' he said afterwards. Speaking outside in the school yard, Mr Mandela repeated the message he stressed incessantly in the final days of campaigning. 'We are very concerned about minorities, especially about the white minority,' he said, adding in a radio interview only seconds after his vote: 'We would like the white community to realise that we cannot build this country without them. We are appealing to them to regard themselves as an essential part of the transition' to democracy. It was a good start towards the goal of a non-racial nation. There is a hard road ahead.

Mr Nelson Mandela, glowing with the energy that comes from victory, led the joyous high-stepping celebration of black South Africa's emancipation from apartheid. It began in the ballroom of a Johannesburg city hotel bedecked with bunting and balloons in the black, green and gold of the African National Congress. By mid-evening it had spread through the exuberant black townships. 'Free at last, free at last, thank God free at last,' declared South Africa's next president, in the immortal words of Martin Luther King. The famous phrase rang across South Africa and around the world as the 75-year-old Mr Mandela reached the final, triumphal summit of a journey that began when he was a young advocate, and has taken him via Robben Island's cells to leadership of his country. Mr Mandela's declaration of victory included graceful acceptance of departing President F. W. de Klerk's declaration of defeat but had a steely undertone of single-minded dedication to his goal. 'I stand before you humbled by your courage, with a heart full of love for all of you,' he said. 'Tomorrow the entire ANC leadership and I will be back at our desks, rolling up our sleeves to begin tackling the problems our country faces . . . let's get South Africa working. This means creating jobs, building houses, providing education and bringing peace and security for all.' Behind Mr Mandela the ranks of the ANC choir broke into song, the packed audience joined in and the dancing began. Mr Mandela's elbows sawed the air. The former boxer, moving like a cross between Mohammed Ali and Michael Jackson, led the dancing of a night to remember. From the stage came the resonant baritone of ex-president Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, whose country paid such a high price for its role as ANC headquarters and who was an honoured guest. On the dance floor the audience contained almost as many whites, coloureds and Indians as blacks. Groups in the hall began the toyi-toyi, the universal dance of black South Africa - knees raised high, a sort of dancing on the spot, once performed at the barricades of Soweto and black townships around the land but last night an exuberant celebration of the new South Africa.

0,FT941-11128 ,"FT941-11128 _AN-EBFAAAD9FT 940205   FT  05 FEB 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Shelling out on growth - Partners faced with losing Pounds 1m find their fortune in the garden      By DAVID SPARK   When Derek Spice and Jane Hanckel moved to Afton Manor on the Isle of Wight in 1988, they needed to make money. They were in the process of losing more than Pounds 1m - Pounds 200,000 on their former home in Virginia Water, Pounds 500,000 at Lloyd's where Spice was a Name, and Pounds 500,000 in shares in a motor-accessories company from which he resigned when it went public in 1986. It went into liquidation in 1991. At Afton Manor they offered bed and breakfast, opened a camp site and imported a lorryload of cocoa shell as a mulch for their own and other gardens. B  B meant breakfasts at 7am, and campers kept turning up at any time, including weekends. This experience focused their minds: 'We decided that the business with the least aggro and most potential was cocoa shell,' said Hanckel. They called the shell Sunshine of Africa and it has proved a winner: it was made a 'best buy' in a Which? survey which compared it with garden mulches based on tree bark, and it was used last February in a BBC gardening programme. The partners expect to sell more than Pounds 1m-worth in their current year. The shells used are stripped from cocoa beans during the cocoa-making process. When applied to the garden, they preserve moisture in the soil and, when they break down, supply plant nutrients. Cocoa makers normally sell the shell ground up for cattle food but gardens need it to be as undamaged as possible. Unbroken shell takes up four times the volume and so needs more lorries to move it - and it can require cocoa factories to amend their manufacturing processes to avoid damage. Spice and Hanckel financed the business themselves by selling their Porsche and some life assurance policies. A picture of the Porsche hangs nostalgically in their office. The pair moved to the Isle of Wight because they liked the sense of community: 'People were here because they wanted to be here. We had been living near the M25 where, not surprisingly, we had the feeling people were just going round in circles,' said Spice. He had always used cocoa shell on his own garden, following the advice of his father, a former managing director of Gill and Duffus, commodity traders. After leaving Gill and Duffus, Spice's father had set up WG Spice and Co, a cocoa processor at Hook in Hampshire, and Spice worked there for a while. And so Spice initially went to Hook for cocoa shell supplies. In February 1989 he and Hanckel advertised their produce, offering a minimum of two 140-litre bags at Pounds 5 a bag and the Isle of Wight proved an ideal test market. Gardeners used it and then their neighbours wanted it too. Soon, Ventnor Botanic Gardens and the horticultural department at the island's college became customers. In a year, the partners sold 1,500 bags, five lorryloads. Articulated lorries visited Afton Manor and unloaded the shell on the tennis court where the gardener and two helpers shovelled it into sacks. The next step was to sell Sunshine of Africa through garden centres. They designed their own waterproof bags and a display stand, which helped Spice to persuade four garden centres to order 150 bags on his first day of selling. They soon had deals with garden centres in all the main urban areas and by March 1992 were advertising Sunshine of Africa nationally. One difficulty was to match sales to the supply of cocoa shell: garden centres like to place orders in September and take delivery and make payment the following spring. The company now takes out bank loans, secured against business assets, to help bridge this gap. Spice and Hanckel lost an important supplier when the WG Spice plant at Hook ceased production. A replacement supply was found when Nestle, the food and drink group, agreed to sell the shell from a new processing unit at York. The company expects to sell Pounds 1.6m-worth of cocoa shell in the year to July, against Pounds 650,000 in the last year, and aims for a net profit of between 10 and 12 per cent. Shell prices have risen but the volume of business makes up for smaller margins. The price in a garden centre is currently Pounds 9.99 to Pounds 12.50 for a 120-litre bag. It is also sold in three smaller sizes. Other companies now supply shell for British gardens but Spice and Hanckel were prepared for this, which is why they have sold Sunshine of Africa as a brand, not cocoa shell as a commodity. With 90 per cent of the market, they also expect interest from the bigger companies whose mulches were beaten into second place in the Which? survey.

In a wide-ranging interview during lunch at the Financial  Times, Mr de Klerk stressed the importance of economic growth to  meet the needs of what he called ""a lost generation"" of South  Africans.    But he also gave a sharp warning against any attempt to  undermine the status of the Afrikaans language, saying it would  drive many of his National Party supporters into the arms of the  far right.    A relaxed and good-humoured Mr de Klerk, showing no signs of  strain after a gruelling election campaign made clear that he  looked forward to contesting the presidency in the next  election.    The National Party, he said, had won support from about l  million black voters in addition to over 3 million votes from  whites, coloureds and Indians. He was determined to help  make the coalition led by President Nelson Mandela work, he  said, adding that the National Party would be able to claim a  share of success when contesting the next election. The party  accepted the need to tackle housing backlogs and improve health  and educational facilities for black South Africa -- any  difference with the ANC was ""not about the needs of the people,  but how you fund the programme.""    This in turn depended on sustained economic growth, partly  through export promotion and encouraging foreign investment.    He insisted that the Reconstruction and Development  Programme  drawn up by the ANC should be treated as the policy not of a  single party, but of the government of national unity. ""But we  must be assured that we will not give way on the need for fiscal  discipline"", he said.    How, Mr de Klerk was asked, could he reconcile support for  the coalition government and the need for a watchdog opposition  role? ""I am on a learning curve on this,"" replied Mr de Klerk.  But from discussions with leaders of coalition governments in  Europe, he went on, it seemed there were two options. ""You can  either have a continuing argument in a coalition or you can do  your homework initially... and agree in detail what joint  policy will be, and then test everything that happens against  this (agreement)"" -- and this was the approach he had adopted.    He accepted that there had been some hard bargaining over  the  composition of the cabinet, but welcomed the reappointment of Mr  Derek Keys as finance minister as one of the critical  portfolios, in addition to agriculture, constitutional affairs,  as well as his own role as executive vice president.    Asked whether the government of national unity could become  ""more or less permanent"", Mr de Klerk replied: ""Not necessarily  in this form.""    ""Power sharing"", he went on, ""should be a feature of the  final constitution (to be drawn up by the country's National  Assembly)"" arguing, as he has done frequently in the past, that  a party that gets 51 per cent of the vote should not get 100 per  cent of the power.    But he stressed that ""there are other ways of achieving it  than though an enforced coalition. One would be to give to the  regions more powers, though not necessarily more functions,"" he  said.    ""For certain types of important decisions the president  might  not be able to take them on his own, he must call in the  premiers of the nine provinces"". Alternatively, Mr de Klerk  suggested, ""the senate could more effectively represent minority  interests, to control the power of the party with the majority.""    But he underlined the fact that ""it is not about vetoes --  it  is about effectively preventing the misuse of power to the  detriment of language, religion, certain black minority groups"".    ""I don't think we should have enforced coalitions,"" Mr de  Klerk went on, ""but when (the current system) falls away, we  need to broaden the package of how to share power in other ways,  through local government for example.""    ""We have got to balance the situation between the fears of  minorities and the democratic need to have real power which  comes with being a majority (party).""    ""An enforced coalition"", he continued, ""will not wash, it  won't work either. But I predict we are going to have  coalitions any way.""    Turning to the role of post-apartheid South Africa, Mr de  Klerk urged the international community ""not to remove us from  their agenda. They need us, they need to address the problems  of Africa. We have a pivotal role to play -- but only if we are  successful (at home) can we play that role (in Africa) to the  full.""    ""We need sustained dynamic economic growth,"" said Mr de  Klerk. ""We will be focusing on exports and developing the new  markets that have become available to us, we have to get our  productivity up, and develop the potential of tourism, with lots  of jobs.""    Mr de Klerk was at his most passionate, however when he  responded to questions about the future of Afrikaans. It was  ""very dangerous"" he warned, to undermine the language, pointing  as an example to the dropping of announcements in Afrikaans on  board South African Airways.    ""It was the language issue which made the Afrikaner the  force  that they are today...if you want me to lose their support, rub  them up the wrong way about the language. You will drive back  into the arms of the far right.""    Mr de Klerk was reluctant to give reasons for the last  minute decision of Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the  Inkatha Freedom Party, to take part in the election.    ""Realism took over,"" he said. ""If Chief Buthelezi didn't  come  aboard we might have faced a very serious security situation"".  All parties, including Chief Buthelezi, realised this.    Mr de Klerk dismissed reports in the South African press  that  he had struck a deal to secure Chief Buthelezi's participation,  giving extra land to the former Kwazulu homeland within Natal.  ""At no time was I involved in any discussion on that issue that  was election related""    Turning to the need for land redistribution, Mr de Klerk  said  it was ""at tremendously emotional issue with conflict potential""  but it ""can be managed in an orderly way."" The government has  ""already identified vast tracts of land"" which could be made  available to people dispossessed during the apartheid era.    But Mr de Klerk cautioned against expectations that South  Africa could play a major role in Rwanda. First the country's  security forces had successfully to conclude the integration of  regular units and members of the ANC armed wing. South Africa  also needed to help resolve disputes closer to home, he said,  notably the war in Angola.    Mr de Klerk was in London to deliver the Sunday Times Nobel  Laureate lecture. The combination of a strong economy and a  large middle class placed South Africa ""qualitatively and  quantitively in quite a different league from any other African  society,"" he told the audience. ""We will be able to break the  cycle of Third World poverty and despair and we will ensure that  many of our African neighbours share our success.""     "

Mandela signed the proclamation in Umtata on Tuesday night  which gives a further period of temporary immunity from  prosecution for politically motivated ""crimes"".    The proclamation was published in a Government Gazette  Extraordinary the same night after the Minister of Justice  requested the President to extend the terms from yesterday until  May 17 1995.    Returned exiles who re-entered South Africa and whose names  appeared in three government notices published in May 1993 and  February and March 1994 will be covered in the proclamation.    The previous indemnity period, authorised by former State  President FW de Klerk, expired on Tuesday.    Its objective was to allow exiles who admitted to ""political  crimes"" committed before October 8 1990 to return to South  Africa to engage in constitutional negotiations.    First promulgated in 1990, the Act became the Further  Indemnity Act after it was amended in 1992.    However, the new dispensation will not cover those who have  committed criminal acts, whether political or not, since May  1993.     "

Franco, who is 62, sent Mandela a 62-line message stating  that his victory revitalizes freedom, and represents a sign of  hope for humankind and a historic deed for South Africa that  will have repercussions over the entire African continent.    Franco told Mandela: ""The long epic battle Your Excellency  and the African National Congress have fought against racial  discrimination has been closely followed from this side of the  Atlantic Ocean, with a profound spirit of solidarity.""    Franco pointed out that the new political panorama will make  it possible to promote bilateral relations and cooperation, the  potential of which he considers to be unexplored.    In a note sent to current South African President Frederick  de Klerk, Franco praised his stature as a statesman, which made  possible the transition process culminating in the installation  in South Africa of a multiracial democracy.    Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will represent the Brazilian  president at Mandela's installation ceremony, which will be held  in the South African capital on 10 May.     "

By MICHAEL HOLMAN   RHODESIANS NEVER DIE by Peter Godwon and Ian Hancock Oxford Pounds 35, 400 pages SMALL WARS, SMALL MERCIES by Jeremy Harding Viking Pounds 18, 442 pages HIGH NOON IN SOUTHERN AFRICAby Chester Crocker W W Norton Dollars 24.95, 384 pages 'Rhodesian born, Rhodesian bred, strong in arm, thick in head'. This disparaging ditty appears in Rhodesians Never Die, a fascinating and learned analysis of the tribe to which I belong, albeit as a renegade member. Strong of arm, certainly. At one stage Rhodesia had enough cricketers in English county sides to have made up a decent Test XI. Not so thick in head. Those who have made their intellectual mark abroad include the former editor of The Economist, a senior member of the British government, and a host of businessmen, writers and academics. Not bad for Surbiton in Africa. Nevertheless the ditty could well serve, broadly speaking, as the conclusion to a demolition of the myths and delusions which sustained white Rhodesia in the 1970s. Also revealed is the skullduggery and rivalry in the ranks of the security forces during the last days of white rule. The remarkable transition to peace and independence in 1980 was closer to disaster than most people realised. Much of the tribe is now scattered around the world, a harmless post-colonial diaspora. A contact magazine offers nostalgia, army memorabilia, and the news that Jock and Hazel, ex-Fort Victoria, offer a bed and beer to 'Rhodies' passing through Vancouver. Yet for nearly 15 years Jock and Hazel and their like defied the world. Never more than 275,000 of them, and outnumbered 15 to 1 by blacks, they were eventually ground down by sanctions and a guerrilla war. Over 20,000 people died - 468 white and 7,790 black civilians, 1,361 members of the security forces (just under half of them white) and 10,450 guerrillas. By comparison South Africa is getting off lightly. Apartheid's death toll over the past decade is under 10,000. On a deaths-to-population ratio, South Africa would have to endure 120,000 fatalities before reaching a settlement. The Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 brought out the best and the worst of white Rhodesia, caught up in the myth of a frontier society of pioneer stock which defended Christian values. Most were not Rhodesian-born; the majority were immigrants, as Godwin and Hancock point out. But they kept Morris Minors on the road, and Viscounts in the air, longer than anyone thought possible. They broke sanctions with ingenuity, and either manufactured what they formerly imported, or managed without. The dark side is that white Rhodesia tortured its enemies, executed jailed guerrillas in secret and lacked the decency to tell next-of-kin, and compulsorily regrouped thousands of peasant families in 'protected villages' which became urban slums. All this was known. Other truly terrible deeds have since been revealed. Ken Flower, Smith's intelligence chief, recruited a black church minister to supply poisoned clothing to youngsters who thought they were joining the guerrillas. Hundreds died a horrible death; Flower had the minister assassinated to avoid exposure, but recounts the tale in his autobiography. As Donal Lamont, the deported Catholic bishop observed, white Rhodesians became moral pygmies, and Godwin and Hancock put them under the microscope. It was Flower and his colleagues who helped cultivate civil war in neighbouring Mozambique, one of the African battlefields so vividly and intimately covered by Jeremy Harding in Small Wars, Small Mercies. Rhodesia helped arm and train Renamo, retaliation for Mozambique's support for guerrillas. Harding picks up the story from later on, when Flower's work had been taken over by South Africa. Mozambique became part of the front-line in the battle against apartheid, as did Angola, also on Harding's itinerary. If one takes their death tolls into account, the cost of ending white rule in Southern Africa is measured in the hundreds of thousands. His account is not a catalogue of despair, however. Whether in Eritrea or southern Africa he finds an extraordinary resilience, 'people contriving to live beyond the wars, or in spite of them.' Harding draws on his own expertise, but one of the merits of his book is that he lets Africans do most of the talking. Small wars, millions dead: who cares? For a while Washington did. Patient, skilful diplomacy by Chester Crocker, the US assistant secretary of state for Africa for much of the 1980s, extricated South Africa and Cuba from their entanglement in south-western Africa. With the vital help of Moscow, the process secured independence for Namibia and also paved the way to what should have been a lasting peace in Angola. Crocker moved on in 1988 and began writing what is an engrossing and invaluable handbook on diplomacy in southern Africa. The tragedy is that the book came too late to instruct his successors under President Bush. The lessons it contains have been ignored. Washington bears as much of the blame for the disaster in Angola today as the hapless United Nations monitors.   Countries:-  GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.     USZ  United States of America.

Following a decline in GDP of 3.6 per cent in the first quarter and a rise of only 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, the latest figures mean that the final growth rate for 1994 is likely to be about 2 per cent, only slightly up on last year's 1.1 per cent. The announcement is a blow for the government, which earlier in the year had been forecasting growth of 3-4 per cent for 1994. However labour unrest and political uncertainty surrounding the country's April elections appear to have dented growth in the first half of the year. The news, which came as the administration presented the latest version of its centrepiece economic plan, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), to parliament, may also make it difficult for the administration to meet its revenue targets for the year. The White Paper on the RDP is predicated on a 3 per cent annual growth rate for South Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

0,FT934-8916 ,"FT934-8916 _AN-DKLCNAGNFT 931112   FT  12 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Out of the continent of need - An African is to head the UN's food agency      By JOHN MADELEY   FOOD deficit countries in Africa can expect a higher priority following the election of Mr Jacques Diouf, a 55-year-old Senegalese diplomat, as the next director-general of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation. Chosen on Monday by FAO's 168-member countries, Mr Diouf takes over at the start of 1994 for a six-year term. But he is taking a 'wait and see' attitude to reforms in the UN's largest and probably most bloated agency. With a mandate to help increase food output, and an annual budget of about Dollars 7m a year, the FAO employs 6,200 people, about half of them at its Rome headquarters. The candidate who ran Mr Diouf a close second in this week's election, Mr Geoff Miller of Australia, wanted to get many of the Rome staff out into the field. Mr Diouf appears to have no such plans. 'I don't want at this stage to say what I will cut and what I will not cut; this would be completely irresponsible,' he said after his election. His first action would be 'to make sure I have all the facts - facts concerning the operations, programme, management, financial aspects, scientific quality and governance. Once I have all these elements, then I will be able to know what I should do and if reforms are needed.' FAO's management under its present director general, Mr Edouard Saouma, has come under strong criticism for an alleged dictatorial style and this has led some countries to withhold their contributions in the last few years. Mr Diouf will be the first African to hold the post and believes that the significance of his election is that the continent with the 'greatest need for a solution to the agricultural problem is Africa'. Over the last 10 years, worldwide food production has increased by 24 per cent and population by 20 per cent, he pointed out, while 'in Africa production per capita went down by 5 per cent. We have to correct that.' With degrees in tropical economy and agricultural economics, Mr Diouf is a former executive-secretary of the West Africa Rice Development Association which is trying to increase rice output in the region. FAO has to face challenges of food production, equity and justice, he says. 'We have 780m who do not have adequate access to food, 190m below the age of five who have protein deficiency, and we expect by the year 2000 to have a 90m tonne cereal deficit in Africa and Asia. We have to get the organisational, financial and human resources to face those challenges.' He discounted the idea that land set aside for farming in North America and Europe should be used to grow food for the third world. 'My main concern will be to ensure that food deficit countries manage to produce enough for their own security - that is the priority.' Solutions to food problems do exist, he stressed: 'There are grounds for hope and many countries are successful; if we can take the example of successful countries we can move forward.' Promising to eradicate any corruption he found within the FAO, Mr Diouf said the 'most important thing about this organisation is its credibility'. Its funds come from member nations, he said, who want to be assured that they are well used. FAO's new chief is likely to be given a honeymoon period by western countries that contribute most of its funds. The United States plans to clear off Dollars 80m of arrears to the FAO by the end of 1995. The daunting task facing Mr Diouf is to improve the efficiency of a cumbersome organisation to enable it to make a more substantial contribution to overcoming food shortages.

Five  Frenchmen and a Beninese were injured in the Togolese capital  last night when a grenade thrown into a restaurant in the Be  district exploded. The six victims are not in danger of death  and the Togolese police have declined at this stage of their  inquiry to speculate on the reasons behind the attack. The  targeted restaurant belongs to a Frenchman and is known to be  mostly patronized by Europeans.    Politically, problems are piling up in the country. Edem  Kodjo, the prime minister appointed by General Eyadema and who  is still finding it difficult to convince his opposition allies  to join him, hinted yesterday that he may resign if his allies  continue to refuse to take part in the government he plans to  form. From Lome, Olabire da Cruz reports for Africa No.1:    [Begin da Cruz recording] The negotiations begun a week ago  between the two parties of the Togolese parliamentary majority  have actually been disrupted following Mr. Agboyibor's Action  Committee for Renewal [CAR]'s restatement of its decision not to  participate in any government to be formed by Mr. Kodjo, a  decision reiterated in a communique issued by the CAR yesterday  evening. The communique stated that at the 3 May meeting  between delegations of the two majority parties, the Togolese  Union for Democracy [UTD] made it clear that if the CAR  maintains its decision, the alternative would be for Mr. Kodjo  to resign. UTD officials do not deny that such a decision is  possible should the CAR drive its ally to the wall, but they add  that they have never maintained that that is the only stand to  adopt. They further explain that the question is whether the  CAR has gauged the consequences of its action and is prepared to  assume responsibility for them.    So, as I said earlier, the CAR has reiterated its decision  to  stay out of Mr. Kodjo's government. Is Mr. Kodjo prepared for a  coalition or an alliance with the former single ruling party,  the Rally of the Togolese People? The UTD executive's answer is  no. In this case, the only way out for Mr. Kodjo -- assuming he  does not resign -- would be to form a government based on the  civil society or on possible deserters from the erstwhile ally,  a situation already experienced by the former prime minister in  forming his last two governments.    In another development, five Frenchmen and a Beninese were  injured last night following the explosion of a grenade thrown  into a restaurant where they happened to be at about 2100. It  is not yet known who committed the act, or their reasons for  their doing so. The injured persons are not in danger of death.  [end recording]     "

The ICJ's ruling is of  course satisfactory to Chadian President Idriss Deby:    [Begin recording] [Deby] The most important thing for us,  under the circumstances, is that the law has been applied and  also that this problem, which lasted too long and cost so many  human lives, has been resolved peacefully. I am therefore happy  with the outcome....    [Mohamed Youssoufou Saliou, interrupting] Mr. President, do  you think that Libya will comply with this verdict, this  important decision by the ICJ?    [Deby] I believe so. Yes, I certainly believe, and, I would  even say, I am convinced that Libya will keep its promises  before the ICJ. From the moment when we jointly agreed to  submit ourselves to the arbitration of the ICJ, we made a  promise. Therefore, based on this promise, I am convinced that  Libya will keep its promises to the ICJ. [end recording]     "

On 15 May, THE  SUNDAY TIMES carried a special dispatch which said that Nelson  Mandela, who has just been elected president, will ""resign from  the post of president of South Africa within two years,"" and  that this would ""cause a power struggle within the African  National Congress."" The next morning, the BBC broadcast a  so-called documentary which had carefully pulled together  various pieces to claim that ""China has 10 million prisoners in  labor camps, who are in a hopeless situation."" When these rumors  came out, they were immediately refuted solemnly and forcefully  by Mandela himself and by a spokesman from our country's Foreign  Ministry.    On the same day THE SUNDAY TIMES carried its strange report,  Mandela issued a statement which said ""that the article is  totally groundless and is sheer rumor, its purpose is to create  instability in the first democratically elected government."" On  17 May, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman listed facts to  point out that the allegations by the BBC were ""sheer  fabrications.""    It is not a coincidence that these two British news agencies  one after the other resorted to this kind of trick to slander  South Africa and China; it is a natural revelation of the dark  side in the minds of a small minority of Britons who hate to see  advancement in the world. South Africa, which was once under  British colonial rule, has got rid of numerous obstacles, cast  off the chains of racism, obtained a new life, and embarked upon  a road of national reconciliation and peaceful and stable  development of the country; China, implementing the policy of  reform and opening up, enjoys economic prosperity, social  stability, and national unity, and is firmly fulfilling the  historic mission of resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong. Some  people in Britain do not want to see any of these things, but  they have no alternative, and although they have tried something  which overrates their strength, these moves resemble a mantis  trying to stop a chariot. Therefore, they have used disgraceful  means and did not hesitate to create materials and spread rumors  in an attempt to cheat the world and create trouble for the  countries to which they are hostile in order to find pretexts to  interfere in their internal affairs.    The BBC and THE SUNDAY TIMES always claim that they are  ""objective and just"" in their reporting. But facts prove that  they say something in one way and do something another way, and  even play a disgraceful role in fabricating rumors to mislead  people. Regarding this, I do not know what kind of explanation  they have to offer to the British public and international  public opinion circles.     "

Mr Piet Welgemoed, South Africa's transport minister, will today announce the approval of proposals for the commercialisation of nine airports and air traffic and navigation services, said Price Waterhouse, the London accountancy firm which helped draw up the proposals, yesterday. The South African government will remain the sole shareholder in the companies but both will be run on a commercial basis. The government should be able to phase out its subsidies, said Price Waterhouse. The biggest of the airports, Jan Smuts at Johannesburg, handles about 12m passengers a year, comparable with Geneva airport. Eight other airports will also be affected, including those at Cape Town and Durban. South Africa is an increasingly popular destination for air traffic: over the past year, 25 airlines which had not previously offered flights to the country applied for access rights. Legislation will have to be passed before the proposal can proceed. 'This could happen by the spring of next year,' said Mr John Wright, who is head of regulation and competition services at Price Waterhouse. A regulation committee will be established by the South African government for the two companies, but will not have authority to intervene in the everyday running of their affairs. Airports and air services are currently run as part of a government department. Mr Wright said that the move was not a prelude to any privatisation. The proposals to run them on a more commercial basis have been drawn up since June 1991.  The Financial Times   London Page 31  "

0,FT921-3179 ,"FT921-3179 _AN-CCPB5ACIFT 920316   FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (7): Why the cap did not fit - The banks must become more professional      By TONY HAWKINS   TEN YEARS ago, a Nigerian import permit was a licence to print money. In the early 1990s, industrialists say sourly, banking licences have assumed that role, primarily because a five-tier foreign currency market provides endless opportunities for profitable arbitrage. Bank licences, issued so freely in 1989 (16) and 1990 (25), were cut off last year, though not until another 14 banks had been approved, taking the total to 120. Although the central bank (CBN) opposes the issue of new licences, so intense is the political pressure from vested interests that a further round of licence approvals is expected soon. UntiI this month, the newer banks continued to thrive against a background of rapid credit expansion and the wholly-artificial foreign exchange auction system in which all are winners. Before the naira was floated in the first week of March, all 120 banks quoted the same buying rate. The Dollars 60m available weekly was allocated among them on a pre-determined basis, which entitled the big three clearers  -First Bank of Nigeria, United Bank for Africa and Union Bank of Nigeria - to Dollars 2.5m each. A second tier of half a dozen banks got Dollars 1.1m each, while at the other end of the spectrum, about 60 of the newer, small banks were each allocated Dollars 242,000. This combination of guaranteed access to foreign currency, a generous spread between deposit and lending rates - estimated at six percentage points last year, down from 7.3 points in 1990 - and easy access to funds, reflected in rapid money supply growth, enabled many banks to report improved earnings last year. But for some - notably the largest banks - the imposition of prudential guidelines translated into a steep decline in profits. Last year, Union Bank's assets rose more than 40 per cent to N13.2bn (Dollars 1.3bn), but its profits collapsed to N14.4m from N127m in 1990 while at UBA profits fell almost N100m to N16.7m. Although UBA more than doubled net earnings to N407m from N186m in 1990, the guidelines meant bad debt provisions of N390m compared with only N69m the previous year. Most of the older banks were forced to make similar, if less dramatic, provisions. The blame for these should not be laid at the door of the bankers. The fact is that the mature banks have long been treated as a kind of political football - their chief executives appointed and removed by federal and state governments and the quality of their loan portfolios undermined by politically-dictated lending. The young banks have the edge in several respects - very little political intervention, and much smaller, more manageable workforces and loan portfolios. Furthermore, they have not been in business long enough to get themselves into the kind of problems that now threaten the viability of some of the state-owned banks. Deregulation, which began in 1987, was partially reversed last year when, in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing, the central bank imposed a cap of 21 per cent on lending rates. It soon backfired; in a system where credit is controlled by way of lending ceilings on banks (except those with advances of less than N50m), credit growth overshot the official target of 10.6 per cent growth by a huge margin, reaching 42 per cent. While some mainstream banks stuck to the 21 per cent cap, many others did not, using front-end fees, commissions and other non-interest charges to lever up their effective return. The authorities ended up the worst of all worlds, positive real interest rates in excess of 20 per cent in the first half of 1991 while money supply was out of control, expanding more than 38 per cent. In January, the CBN abandoned the cap - which it had always said was only temporary - but is now trying to squeeze the spread between a bank's cost of funds and its lending rate to 5 per cent. As a result, prime rates have risen to around 23 per cent for the commercial banks and 27 per cent for merchant banks. With the year-on-year inflation rate having climbed sharply from 5 per cent in the first quarter of 1991 to 20 per cent by the year-end, real deposit rates are now negative, and the same will soon be true of real lending rates. The signs are that inflation will accelerate rapidly during 1992, mainly in response to last year's excessive credit creation and the resumed slide of the naira. A year ago, the CBN set targets of 10.6 per cent for credit expansion during 1991; because the budget was meant to be in surplus, there should have been no public sector borrowing from the banks, while the ceiling for private sector credit provided for growth of 13.2 per cent growth. In the event, government borrowing surged 69 per cent during 1991 while private sector credit was up 26 per cent. In an effort to curb inflation and stabilise the exchange rate, the CBN says it will tighten monetary policy in 1992. The private sector credit growth target has been raised to 16 per cent 'to provide an appropriate stimulus to the economy'. With the public sector borrowing ceiling raised 7.7 per cent, aggregate credit growth is projected at 12.5 per cent - up two percentage points on last year's target, but well below the 42 per cent actually experienced. But credit creation is not going to slow down unless public expenditure - and inflation - are brought under control. Private sector borrowing is rising sharply as working capital requirements increase with inflation and devaluation. During 1992, the CBN is committed to shift increasingly from direct controls to market-oriented techniques for controlling the supply. The abolition of the interest rate cap was a first step in this direction, as was the requirement that banks now hold 20 per cent of their deposit liabilities to the public in treasury bills and certificates. Other instruments of indirect monetary control to be used more actively during 1992 include the 30 per cent liquidity ratio, including treasury bills, and the 3 per cent cash reserve ratio. The CBN plans to expand its open-market activities and to that end - much to the disgust of some bankers  -is calling for the creation of a discount market with up to five discount houses, operating on the London model. In spite of their distaste for discount houses - which banks see as an unnecessary intermediary - some of the top banks are getting together to establish a discount operation and the CBN hopes that at least three discount houses, which it sees as essential cogs in the wheel of indirect monetary management, will be open for business within a few months. The much-predicted shake-out and rationalisation of the banking system will not materialise - bankers say - unless and until the foreign currency market is reformed. If the naira float is even remotely clean, then the new banks are going to face a far tougher competitive environment. In the past they relied on guaranteed access to foreign currency both as a source of profit and a vehicle for attracting deposits. Precisely how the CBN is going to manage the new system is unclear but it appears that it will sell dollars to the market - not necessarily on a regular basis - at market-determined rates. The conventional wisdom is that in the short-term, the naira will stabilise around N15 or N16 to the dollar, but the medium-term prognosis for the currency is grim, with substantial further devaluation probable in 1993/4. Few of the new banks have a deposit base worthy of the name, implying that with the liberalisation of the foreign currency market they will be have to rethink their tactics. This will not be easy at a time when tight money will be the order of the day. Three developments will sort out the men from the boys over the next couple of years - a competitive foreign exchange market, monetary restraint and indirect monetary management. As and when these measures take root, so banking in Nigeria will become more professionalised and traditional virtues, such as a large deposit base, will start to count once again.  -----------------------------------           NUMBER OF BANKS  ----------------------------------- 1980                        26 1985                        40 1987                        50 1988                        66 1989                        81 1990                       107 1991                       120  ----------------------------------- Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  -----------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------            BANK CREDIT (NBN)  --------------------------------------------- Year   Private   Government   Total        Sector      Sector  --------------------------------------------- 1985    13.7       19.0       32.7 1986    17.4       19.4       36.8 1987    19.8       22.3       42.1 1988    25.1       27.0       52.1 1989    30.8       21.6       52.4 1990    36.6       30.4       67.0 1991*   46.0       50.0       96.0  --------------------------------------------- * Provisional  --------------------------------------------- Source: Central Bank of Nigeria  ---------------------------------------------  The Financial Times   London Page IV  "
0,FT943-13713 ,"FT943-13713 _AN-EGRD8AFQFT 940718   FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (35): Net benefit may prove marginal  -Foreign aid      By MICHAEL HOLMAN   Few international aid causes are more popular than South Africa's appeal for assistance in redressing the legacy of apartheid. Raising funds, however, may prove to be easier than putting them to efficient use, and if aid is seen as a substitute for investment the net benefit may prove marginal. If pledges are taken at their face value, South Africa can expect up to R10bn over the next five years, from a variety of bilateral and multilateral donors. Leading the field is Japan, which earlier this month unveiled what it called its largest aid package to a single country - Dollars 1.3bn over two years. Mr Katsumi Sezaki, Japan's ambassador to South Africa, said that almost all the aid was untied, bar a Dollars 100m export-import credit facility aimed at promoting trade between the two countries. But a further Dollars 400m worth of export-import bank loans were untied, he said. Of the balance, Dollars 250m would be in the form of soft loans - seven years' grace and a 25-year repayment period at 3 per cent interest. A further Dollars 500m in the package represented the amount of private investment and commercial credits the Japanese government was prepared to guarantee. Next on the list is the US which has offered R2bn over three years, while a host of other bilateral donors have chipped in including Australia (R700m over three years), the European Union is offering over R400m; the UK will provide R560m over three years. Meanwhile the African Development Bank says it can release between R720m and R1,200m of project-linked finance over five years. Past experience in Africa has shown that aid has mixed results and even allowing for South Africa's considerable pool of skills, handling resources on this scale will not be easy. The amount on offer, however, may not be as much as it seems. As is so often the case, assessing what may be termed the 'real money' - that is assistance that is readily available and which can be rapidly disbursed - is not straightforward. Although trade cover and investment guarantees can be put to good use, including them in the category of 'aid' can give a misleading impression of what is available for conventional aid projects - health, housing, education, and so on. Development packages almost invariably include aid tied to purchases from the donor country, which can prove expensive. A recent study by a British development charity calculated that the resulting lack of competition can add anything from 10 to 15 per cent to the price of the items ordered from the donor country. Another way of boosting bilateral aid figures in press releases is to include the contributions made by western governments to multilateral lending institutions, United Nations agencies, or money that would be channeled through European Union aid schemes. A further device used by some donors is to include estimates of the benefits for South African exporters from introducing favourable tariff changes made in the wake of President Mandela's inauguration. Given the competition between donors as to who will appear the most generous  -which in turn may influence the South African government when it comes to allocating contracts for state-backed or funded projects - the donors themselves are often reluctant to make clear the precise benefits and terms of their offers. In short, the arithmetic of aid is complex and South Africa, unused to being a recipient, may sometimes be too inclined to take promises at face value. Significantly, the World Bank, potentially South Africa's largest multilateral donor, is reluctant to put a figure to planned lending, although some officials have suggested a figure of about Dollars 1bn a year in the initial phase. Mr Isaac Sam, the Bank's resident representative in South Africa, says that foreign aid is 'rather crucial' in South Africa's development. What is more, fund raising 'has to be done fairly rapidly' in order to take advantage of the goodwill South Africa presently enjoys. But Mr Sam cautions that aid alone cannot deliver the economic growth that the country needs. While the Bank plans to provide substantial aid, foreign and domestic investment are the keys to post-apartheid growth: 'The real resources for South Africa are in the international capital market, not donors', says Mr Sam.

This was announced at a  Freedom Alliance meeting in Kimberley today. Speaking after the  meeting, IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu  Buthelezi said the Alliance had agreed that General Viljoen  should resign so that he could lead his Freedom Front in the  election. General Viljoen said that he was prepared to join the  Freedom Alliance as the leader of the Freedom Front. Meanwhile,  the former Conservative Party leader in Natal, Mr. Carl Werth,  has confirmed that eight of the region's 11 executive members  have agreed to stand as candidates for the Freedom Front. He  said that they had taken the decision at a recent meeting.  Leaders of the Freedom Alliance meeting expressed strong  disapproval of the deposing of Dr. Lucas Mangope as president of  Bophuthatswana. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Dr. Mangope had  been betrayed and stabbed in the back. He said there was a need  for the alliance to review its position following the weekend's  events.

This followed a request by the Freedom Alliance that  the deadline should be postponed to give it the opportunity to  examine a set of proposals devised by the ANC [African National  Congress].    Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said after  talks between the government, the ANC and the Freedom Alliance  that the government had made a proposal regarding the future of  the Zulu king and Natal/KwaZulu. A constitutional principle  providing for traditional leadership is to be discussed with the  Zulu king this weekend. However, new problems arose regarding a  volkstaat [homeland] for Afrikaners.    Freedom Alliance Chairman Rowan Cronje said that the  proposals submitted to the alliance were considered to have vast  implications, and that urgent consultations with alliance  leaders were imperative. Discussions were to have begun last  night after the trilateral meeting. Mr. Cronje said the fact  that the state president would be prevented from promulgating  the election date today gave the alliance additional time to  look for an acceptable solution.

A successful deal could pave the way for a spate of financings by South Africa's underborrowed corporate sector; a flop could turn off the tap of international investment before the flow has really started. The deal, for the country's fourth largest company, was approved at cabinet level as a suitable trail-blazer for the return of corporate South Africa to the international capital markets following the first non-racial elections in May. In fact, Robert Fleming, which won the mandate to arrange the offering, did not offer the cheapest terms to the company. But the generous indicated pricing of a 6 to 6 1/2 per cent coupon and a 10 to 12 per cent cent conversion premium for 10-year bonds, non-callable for at least the first five years, was felt to be necessary to attract a broad range of foreign investors. First of all, bearish global market conditions have made international fund managers much more choosy. (In fact, Robert Fleming has indicated that the pricing can be adjusted if the current weakness in world markets worsens.) In addition, South African companies are a little known quantity. The company is doing its best to address this problem, fielding a visit from underwriters and fund managers to Johannesburg last week and hosting a series of roadshows in Asia, Europe and the US this week, when the book-building process begins. In practice, the decision on whether to buy the deal will for many investors be a decision on South Africa. The fiscal discipline of the new government's first budget, presented to parliament by finance minister Mr Derek Keys last week, encouraged investors and the imminent inclusion of the country in the IFC global emerging market index, at 13 per cent, is set to boost interest in South African shares generally. 'Liberty Life is a good proxy for South Africa, and the convertible structure gives it a defensive quality which appeals to more conservative investors,' said one fund manager on last week's trip. For investors viewing the company as proxy, there are several attractive features: its broad range of interests, such as brewing and property, mean that it stands to benefit from domestic economic growth. However, the deal also has a keep-well agreement which gives investors concerned about political risk the added security of Liberty's UK assets, which include Sun Life. Further, the large size of the transaction, which has made some underwriters nervous, is an added incentive for some investors. The South African stock market, with average daily volume this year of Dollars 63m, is not very liquid, and some investors expect the convertible bonds to be easier to trade than the stock. Some fund managers will not be able to buy the bonds even if they want to, because they are not rated. (South Africa itself has yet to be rated.) Further, in the US, where sanctions on South Africa were strongly enforced, some fund managers have not yet received approval to start re-investing. However, the reception of two straight equity offerings for South African companies following May's elections bodes well. A Dollars 67m offering for industrial and mining giant Anglovaal, priced late Thursday at Dollars 27.33, was 2.7 times oversubscribed, according to arranger SG Warburg, with just over half the demand from the US. Meanwhile, a Dollars 70m offering for retailer Pepkor is due to be priced this week.   Companies:-  Liberty Life Association of Africa.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

It is an impressive display, led by Mr Tokyo Sexwale, the premier - a man who proved his conciliatory credentials last year when he pleaded for racial tolerance in the aftermath of the assassination of Chris Hani, the ANC guerrilla leader killed by a right-wing white assassin. True to form as South Africa's most powerful province, the PWV and its leaders have made the biggest splash so far on the provincial scene. Hardly a day passes but Mr Sexwale, or Miss Jessie Duarte, his diminutive police minister, visit a black township to urge residents to co-operate with police, or drop in on a migrant workers' hostel to try to foster peace. Mr Sexwale's performance as premier will be judged largely by how well he implements the reconstruction and development programme. And here, conflicts are already looming. In his inaugural speech to the new legislature, Mr Sexwale promised to build 150,000 houses in the province over the next year - compared with only 30,000 homes built throughout South Africa last year. He is understood to have plans for a grand R4bn house-building project involving massive private and public sector finance. The plan has already caused friction with Mr Joe Slovo, national housing minister, but Mr Slovo appears to have been powerless to prevent it. Mr Sexwale's youthful and inexperienced cabinet - which includes a finance minister who is regional general secretary of the South African Communist party and other noted radicals - certainly does not lack energy. Only time will tell whether it lacks the circumspection necessary to avoid grand and costly development failures.  ----------------------------------------------------- PWV Key Facts  ----------------------------------------------------- Area: 18,700 sq km Population: 6.8m Population growth: 1.3% Literacy: 69% Labour force employed: 54% Contribution to national gross domestic product: 37% Life expectancy: 66 years  ----------------------------------------------------- Source: Development Bank of Southern Africa  -----------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.

Mr Tielman de Waal, chief executive of Armscor, South Africa's arms procurement agency, told a news conference yesterday the company could boost defence exports by more than R1bn (Pounds 180m) in the current fiscal year. His statement comes against a background of calls for sharp cuts in the defence budget to fund new spending on social services under President Nelson Mandela's reconstruction and development programme. Armscor is keen to demonstrate the defence industry can generate as well as consume South Africa's scarce resources, and can earn foreign exchange from goods which are globally competitive. Armscor has come under increasing criticism since the new multi-racial government took over a fortnight ago, reflecting a new public awareness of moral arguments against arms exports. However South Africa's urgent need for foreign exchange earnings, coupled with a desire to capitalise on heavy spending on research and development during the apartheid era, will probably combine to protect Armscor's activities in future.

It was the world's fifth fastest growing country during the 1980s. But it came 120th among 160 countries in the UNDP's human development index. Some of the individual indicators for human develop- ment are depressing. The government estimates that: only 34 per cent of adults are literate; public expenditure on education was 2.3 per cent of GNP last year, significantly below the 3.7 per cent average for developing countries; only 40 per cent of children of primary school age are enrolled in schools; 52 per cent of children suffer from malnutrition and only 55 per cent of the population has access to medical care. Conditions for women are worse than for men. This has been a particular source of concern for foreign aid donors and development experts. To counter this, the federal and provincial governments have committed Rs53bn (Pounds 1.15bn) over the next three years to a Social Action Programme to improve the indicators. 'We feel that we need to have an accelerated programme so that lost time can be made up', says Mr Sardar Asseff Ahmed Ali, minister of state for economic affairs. Under the programme's tar- gets, literacy is projected to rise to 50 per cent from the present 34 per cent. In addition, there should be improve- ments in nutrition, primary health care, family planning, rural water supply and sanit- ation. 'This will be the biggest quantum jump in Pakistan's history in the social sector', says Mr Ali. Despite the programme, there is still concern at some of the obstacles in the way of improving social welfare, especially the high population growth. The present 3 per cent growth rate is among the highest in the developing world. In addition, some developmental experts are concerned that initiatives for improving the status of women can only succeed if more women hold public office. At present, there are only two women members (Benazir Bhutto and her mother) in Pak- istan's 217 seat lower house of parliament and one among the 87 upper house legislators. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif's government plans to introduce a special constitutional amendment which will reserve 20 seats for women in the lower house, Mr Ali says. Some developmental experts argue that more women members in the parliament may in turn strengthen the women's rights lobby, putting more pressure on the government to give closer attention to their development. On this and other areas of social programmes, the next three years will be an important test of Pakistan's ability to match its quality of economic growth with the quality of life for its people.

The official, who talked to a small group of reporters Wednesday on the  understanding that he would not be identified by name, said it now seems clear  that sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations played a role in  the decision by South African President Frederik W. de Klerk last week to lift  many restrictions on several long-banned black and anti-apartheid  organizations.    The sanctions were enacted by Congress over the veto of President Ronald Reagan  in 1986.

Under the terms of the sanctions law, the President may lift the sanctions if  South Africa releases all political prisoners and takes any three of these  steps:    * Repeals the state of emergency.    * Ends the ban on political groups, such as the African National Congress.    * Repeals the Group Areas Act, which imposes residential segregation.    * Agrees to enter good faith negotiations with ""truly representative members of  the black community.""    The official said that De Klerk has complied with two of the standards --  repeal of the ban on political groups and agreement to negotiate. He said he  expects South Africa to move soon, certainly by the end of the year, to free  all political prisoners and end the state of emergency. He said the government  has said it will go slower in repealing the Group Areas Act.

As discussed above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement.       Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 93, 913, 916). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught.       Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being trained. A similar provision was not contained in the proposed rule. OSHA has added this provision in the final rule as a way of ensuring that all employees, regardless of their cultural or educational background, will receive adequate training on how to perform their job safely. OSHA notes that this requirement applies to both logging and first-aid training.       Paragraph (i)(10) requires the certification of training. While this provision was not contained in the proposed rule, several commenters stressed the need to document training (Ex. 916, 918; Tr. OR 137, 55859, 64344). OSHA agrees with these commenters that documenting training is necessary. First, in the final rule OSHA has allowed prior training to be acceptable in lieu of initial training. In the proposed rule, OSHA had required that each new employee, regardless of experience and prior training, receive training prior to initial assignment. In order to accept prior training in lieu of new training, OSHA believes employers must establish a process for determining whether the prior training was adequate. The certification procedure provides that process without imposing a significant burden. Second, several commenters said that many establishments do not currently document training (Tr. W1 95, OR 92). As such, employers do not have any records to indicate whether appropriate training has been provided.       Third, some commenters testified that all training programs should be written programs (Ex. 517, 542). While many large logging establishments already have implemented impressive written training programs, OSHA is also aware that a written training and recordkeeping requirement would impose a paperwork burden and significant burden on small employers in this industry (Ex. 544). OSHA believes that training certification is a less burdensome way of documenting whether employees have been adequately trained. OSHA notes that the time and costs of training certification have been included in the final regulatory impact analysis.       Paragraph (i)(10)(i) of the final rule requires that the employer verify compliance with paragraph (i) of this section by preparing a written certification record. This provision also requires that the written certification record contain the name or other identity of the employee trained, the date(s) of the training, and the signature of the person who conducted the training or the signature of the employer. In addition, this provision requires that if the employer relies on training conducted prior to the employee being hired or prior to the effective date of this section, the certification record shall indicate the date the employer determined the prior training was adequate rather than the date of actual training. The proposed rule did not contain a certification requirement.          "," FR941012-0-00150   FR941012-0-00011        At paragraph (i)(8) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that training be conducted by a designated person. As discussed above, a designated person is an employee who has the requisite knowledge, training and experience to perform the specific duties. The proposed rule did not contain a similar requirement.       Some commenters said that it was important that training be conducted by a qualified or certified person (Ex. 93, 913, 916). OSHA has included this provision in the final rule because the Agency wants to assure that regardless of whether employers rely on their own personnel to conduct training or utilize outside experts, the person providing training must have the necessary qualifications and background in the subject matter being taught.       Paragraph (i)(9) of the final rule requires that training required by this section be presented in a manner that the employee is able to understand. This provision also requires that the employer assure that training materials are appropriate in content and vocabulary to the educational level, literacy and language skills of the employees being trained.

'The menace of widespread suffering and death which hangs over southern Africa is no abstract issue, no idle concept,' the United Nations under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, Mr Jan Eliasson, told the opening session of a two-day aid conference. The UN and southern African nations, excluding South Africa, organised the conference to gather responses to a joint appeal they made last week for Dollars 835m (Pounds 464m) for one of the region's worst droughts. Pledges announced yesterday were difficult to sort out since some of the figures included already scheduled aid, but it appeared more than half the appeal had been met. The US announced it was giving Dollars 382m in drought relief on top of normal development assistance of about Dollars 275m. The European Community announced it was giving Dollars 276m in food aid, about half of which was in addition to normal aid.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

In a statement on Wednesday [1 June] night, a  spokesman for the president's office, Mr Joel Netshitenzhe, said  the decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. He  said further details would be released after consultations with  the UN about the role South Africa could play to help  international efforts to end the conflict in Rwanda.

He told a  crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings  Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos  after elections. He did not elaborate.    ""We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no  looting or interference in people's private property. We're  developing creative programmes in which people are taking part.    ""Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family,  black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South  Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity.""    The ANC president branded as ""prophets of doom"" those  predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to  whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: ""I appeal to  whites in particular not to fear the future."" The ANC  recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the  country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had  become ""the most valuable asset in this country"".    Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving  South Africa and made an ""earnest appeal from a man who has  spent 27 year in jail"" for them to stay.""All of you in this  country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your  country. This is our country.    ""We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under  apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment.""    A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car  bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he  would take up these issues in discussions with State President F  W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did  not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt  elections.    ""We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous  progress despite the attempts of criminals.    ""Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the  security forces.""    The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces  for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out  alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been  among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  KwaZulu/Natal. ""The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP  [South African Police] have done nothing of these things except  to run round in the streets.""    Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he  said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had  committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and  December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for  current violence.    ""I want to state very clearly that those people involved in  killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position  they hold, will be dealt with according to the law,"" he told the  cheering crowd.    ""They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay.""    Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no  chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for  emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the  only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came  while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government  and amounted to stopping the ANC from ""bettering the lives of  all"".    The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa  were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told  a media conference after the rally. ""They are not bluffed by the  National Party.""    He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural  diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural  mix as one of the country's strongest assets.    Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did  not mean ""black majority rule"". ""All of you must pledge to be  part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a  government of the minority and can never be a government of  majority in this country.    ""I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in  the future. Stay here and help us.""    Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South  Africa, he replied: ""I feel elated. At the same time, I feel  sad,"" explaining that many people who had made freedom possible  were not alive to see it happen.     "

He pointed out that the new  government was still finding its feet.    Mr. Mandela's remarks coincided with reports that he is  expected to play a key role in attempts to end the slaughter in  Rwanda. The three-day summit meeting is expected to be  dominated by the Rwandan question.

Acting President of the Republic Franca van  Dunem says the victory of Mandela and the ANC is also a victory  for the Angolan people.    [Begin Van Dunem recording] I am pleased that the ANC  struggle has culminated with its victory at the polls. I am  convinced that my sentiment is shared by the majority of  Angolans, who, for many years now, have rubbed shoulders with  South African nationalists, and have given their best to make  today's celebrations a reality throughout Africa. Likewise, the  efforts of Angolans over the past years, which culminated in the  ANC victory....[changes thought] I am convinced that the victory  of the ANC and the South African people in general will be  beneficial to developments throughout Africa. [end recording]  [passage omitted]    Prime Minister Marcolino Moco is pleased with the outcome of  the South African elections.    [Begin recording] [Moco] It is not an issue that only  affects  Angola. Obviously, Angola will benefit from the new situation  that has been created in southern Africa. I would like to  stress, however, that over the past years this process has  attracted the attention of the whole world, and Africa in  particular. It is not only a question of an ANC electoral  victory, but fundamentally a process of liberation and struggle  against racial segregation and of oppression of men by men. So,  I think the ANC victory is very good for us because the ANC  consists of our friends, who have fought by our side. I would  like to stress the major change that is taking place in the  world right now with the acknowledgment of all the victories the  South African people have scored in the past few years.    [Unidentified correspondent] As South African president,  will  Nelson Mandela ask to play a more important role in the Angolan  peace process?    [Moco] Any country involved in a process like this depends  fundamentally on its own people and on the capacity of its  politicians. That has been proven in South Africa. Like I said  earlier, with the completion of the liberation process and of  elections in South Africa, Nelson Mandela and his country will  know how to make a major contribution to Angola's progress,  including the peace process and development, because we are  aware that South Africa is a major economic power.    [Correspondent] But what about the ongoing Lusaka talks?    [Moco] Well, I think the Lusaka talks have made a great deal  of progress, despite a number of difficulties. What matters  with the South African experience is to specifically consolidate  the peace process in Angola and in southern Africa in general.  I think this will be a very useful experience. The fact that  Nelson Mandela and other South African politicians now have more  time to take part in African meetings, particularly in southern  Africa, will be very useful to us in general.

The announcement of the agreement, the terms of which were not disclosed, came just three days after Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, called for the removal of all remaining economic sanctions against South Africa. Former President Bush lifted federal restrictions against investing in South Africa in 1991, but many state and city governments across the US maintain some form of sanctions against the country. Pillsbury said it would form the new company, called Pillsbury Africa with Foodcorp's Table Top unit, South Africa's leading branded vegetable business and the top producer of frozen vegetables. The joint venture will manufacture Pillsbury's green giant vegetable products and Pillsbury baked goods at Table Top's plants in the cities of George and Port Elizabeth in the eastern Cape province. A 'significant' number of local jobs would be created over the next three years, said Pillsbury. The US group said it hoped the venture would provide a springboard into other African markets.

The Netherlands minister for development cooperation, Mr Jan Pronx, told the annual meeting of the African Development Bank it was difficult to see where resources required to assist growth and attack poverty would come from, without more effective rescheduling of debt. 'In the view of the Netherlands, we still have to strive for a write-off debt of all least-developed countries,' he said. Representatives of other industrialised states stopped short of endorsing a need for new debt relief schemes, but chorused their intention to stand by Africa. 'My country is committed to remaining engaged in this continent,' declared Mr Olin Wethington, assistant secretary for international affairs at the US Treasury. Mr Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, Nigeria's finance minister, said debt relief now provided 'a glimmer of hope', but Africa's economic plight was alarming. He proposed that concessions which multilateral aid agencies allowed to the poorest countries should be extended to the less well-off, middle-income states. But Mr Wethington told a news conference that Washington was reluctant at this stage to agree to such a proposal. He outlined at the meeting a two-pronged approach by his country in its economic relations with Africa in the post-Cold War world. While helping to meet social and economic needs, it would stress the value of democracy and market-based economies, and favour changes to promote the private sector. 'The long-term future lies with encouraging private enterprise,' he told reporters. 'The private capital markets will be able, in the long term, to provide resources that will exceed those available through official channels.' Mr Alhaji urged industrial countries to open their markets. 'At present, excessive subsidies to agricultural products of the developed economies create the double-edged sword which keeps our farm products out of their markets and, at the same time, depresses markets for our products,' the minister said.

It is no coincidence that such attention has been devoted to  AIDS: It is a disease of young people, and its wide spread,  first, threatens to cause the degeneration of the human race  and, second, is a heavy economic burden upon society. Treatment  for AIDS, which can, at best, only prolong life somewhat, is  very expensive -- according to U.S. estimates, approximately  $80,000 a year. The disease is still incurable, with the  majority of patients dying within five to 10 years despite all  the efforts of medicine, and at present just one reliable means  exists against it -- people's education. Information and  literacy relating to all aspects of the problem -- this is one  condition for prevention.    This is why medics urge the press and representatives of  various organizations, including religious ones, to assist them  in propaganda and educational work in everything concerning AIDS.    In Russia, as is well known, the incidence of infection with  HIV is considerably lower than in the West. In the opinion of  Vadim Pokrovskiy, leader of the Russian Center for the  Prevention and Combating of AIDS, its slower pace is connected  with our society's considerable isolation in the eighties. The  situation is changing now. This year 80 cases of infection with  AIDS have been registered.    ""This infection is now recorded in 53 of Russia's 88  administrative territories,"" Valentin Pokrovskiy, president of  the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, said. ""This year 32  people have passed from the infected category to the sick  category -- as is well known, AIDS develops slowly, and it takes  several years for the disease to show itself. In all, we have  registered 692 cases of AIDS infection since 1987, 124 people  have fallen ill, and 96 have died. During the same time 435  HIV-positive foreign citizens have been detected and deported.""    Much has been done in Russia in recent years to organize the  struggle against AIDS. Precisely 748 diagnostic laboratories  are operating, and the Russian Scientific Methods Center, six  regional centers, 73 territorial centers, and 128 anonymous  screening clinics have been set up.    A federal targeted program for 1993-1995 to prevent the  spread of AIDS was adopted this year. Despite all the economic  difficulties, its funding will begin in December. The draft law  ""On Preventing AIDS Sickness"" has been prepared and is already  being examined.    How has the Russian public charitable organization  ""Association for Combating AIDS"" marked World AIDS Day?    ""We have published AIDS references for physicians and  distributed them to many medical establishments in the country,""  Yu. Malyutin, the association's responsible secretary, said. ""A  collection of articles for middle-level medical workers has been  published, as well as masses of brochures, booklets, and other  literature which is being distributed free to the population.  Two special editions of MEDITSINSKAYA GAZETA devoted to the  problem of preventing HIV infection have been published, and an  amateur talent competition for medical establishment students on  the subject of 'All About AIDS and Drugs' has been held in  conjunction with Moscow's Main Medical Administration. The  students' best works -- posters, wall newspapers, photographs --  are being exhibited in the Satirikon Theater.""     "

As a supplement to the CSCE, some of the major European Mediterranean countries  want to create a southern counterpart that would include non-European neighbors  in North Africa as part of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in the  Mediterranean (CSCM).    The still-fledgling idea of Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis and  Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, his Spanish counterpart, is to create an  instrument for resolving conflicts in the Middle East by grouping countries in  a vast area from Iran to Mauritania. To make the somewhat Utopian idea more  credible, they also seek American participation.    France and Portugal would be among the European sponsors of CSCM, although the  French are not persuaded that any such organization should extend beyond the  European and Africa Mediterranean and into the Middle East.    Echoing fears heard throughout southern Europe, Ordonez has warned of a  possible ""collision course between Islam and the West.""

H. WALTERS, Times Staff Writer      Hewlett-Packard, one of a handful of large U.S. companies still operating in  South Africa, said Tuesday that it would sell its subsidiary there to a South  African holding company.    The sale to Siltek Ltd. is only a partial withdrawal from the country;  Hewlett-Packard products, largely computer systems and electronic  instrumentation, will continue to be sold and serviced by Siltek.    However, the move is a marked turnabout from Hewlett-Packard's posture on South  Africa throughout the past half-decade. The company, known in California's  Silicon Valley for its humanistic approach to business, remained a holdout in  South Africa even as scores of U.S. companies bowed to shareholder and public  pressure and pulled out.    Hewlett-Packard officials said the sale of its subsidiary was based on  financial, not moral considerations. Because of its operations in South Africa,  it has become increasingly difficult for the company to do business in the  United States, where many cities, counties, school districts and even some  states have passed laws prohibiting or severely limiting business with  companies that still have South African ties.    Its inability to bid on major municipal contracts has caused a ""severe  financial impact"" amounting to ""tens of millions of dollars on an annual  basis,"" according to a company spokesman. Because its products will still be  sold in South Africa, HP will continue to be barred from doing business with  those governmental entities that have the most restrictive laws concerning  firms with ties to South Africa.    Even so, the estimated lost income stemming from its previous South African  policy was beginning to outstrip the revenue generated by its subsidiary there,  while its policy to work for change from within the South African system was  losing its effectiveness, company officials conceded.    ""We're not taking this action because we feel it will have a beneficial impact  on bringing about the end of apartheid,"" the spokesman said. In fact, HP  officials believe it will ""be more difficult to engage in social programs  without a presence there,"" despite the company's pledge to continue to fund  social responsibility programs in South Africa.    The fact that so many other U.S. corporations have left the country has diluted  the influence of the companies that chose to remain, the spokesman said. ""We  have had a modest impact, but we felt the collective efforts (of U.S.  companies) could have an impact on apartheid. Now so many others have left . .  . and the effectiveness of our own programs has been weakened, our ability to  play a role (in changing the system) has been diminished.""    It was a ""difficult"" decision to leave, John A. Young, HP president and chief  executive, said in a statement.    ""We consistently have said that HP would remain in South Africa as long as we  could sustain an economically sound business, maintain our long-term  commitments to South African customers and contribute, even in a limited way,  to peaceful change and the creation of a more just and equitable society for  all South Africans,"" Young said.    However, he added, ""increasing political and economic uncertainties have made  it difficult for us to achieve these objectives. We are especially disappointed  that there appears to be no significant progress in bringing about an end to  apartheid.""    Throughout its 20 years in South Africa, sales there have generated less than  1% of HP's total revenue. Last year, the company said, its South African  subsidiary accounted for about $62 million in revenue. Total worldwide revenue  last year was $9.8 billion.    Siltek, an operating unit of Johannesburg-based conglomerate Anglovaal, will  offer continued employment to HP's 245 South African employees, the company  said. Other terms of the sale were not disclosed.    Its social programs, aimed at fostering change in the racially divided country,  will continue to be supported through the Hewlett-Packard Foundation. Last  year, through the HP Foundation and South African sales, HP distributed about  $750,000 to the programs.    HP's move comes less than a month after the latest of several successive  attempts by shareholders to force the company's withdrawal from South Africa.  At its Feb. 28 annual meeting, 77% of the company's shareholders voted against  a resolution calling for a complete withdrawal from South Africa, including a  halt to selling any merchandise in the country.    Hewlett-Packard is the second U.S. corporation to pull out of South Africa this  year after the departure of insurance company St. Paul Cos., according to the  Investor Responsibility Research Center, a nonprofit group that tracks U.S.  investment in South Africa. In the past five years, more than 130 U.S.  companies have withdrawn.

Japan will send the monitors in response to a request by the  South African Government, recognizing the historical importance  of the April 26-28 election for the international community,  spokesman Terusuke Terada said.    The election observers to be dispatched by the Japanese  Government will be joined by 10 U.N. volunteers and several  people from the private sector, he said.    A special assistant of the permanent mission of Japan to the  United Nations will also be dispatched as a liaison officer to  the U.N. Observer Mission to South Africa (UNOMSA), he said.    Japan has so far extended a total of about 34.8 million yen  in aid to nongovernmental organizations working in South Africa  to help voter education and provide vehicles for election  observation, he said.    In a related move, a private Japanese aid organization, the  Japan International Volunteer Center, also plans to carry out a  project in connection with the U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) to offer vocational training to assist the  resettlement of returnees to South Africa, he said.    The project is aimed at giving training in woodworking,  welding, plumbing and computer operation, he said.     "

Of course, the political parties are  deeply involved in the campaign. Nonetheless, there is a  dispute within the opposition. Here is Raphael Mbadinga:    [Begin recording] [Mbadinga] There is especially a war of  words among the opposition parties. Those who are in favor of  boycotting the 6 February elections are accusing the moderate  opposition of seeking to legitimize President Gnassingbe  Eyadema's government by taking part in the elections. According  to the radical opposition, President Eyadema's government has  not yet met all the conditions for truly democratic elections.  Zarifou Ayeva is critical of the attitude of the moderate  opposition here:    [Ayeva] Regarding my friends in the opposition who have  involved themselves unashamedly in this affair, I wonder how  they will find their way out. One only has to observe France's  position. Minister Roussin is already withdrawing his support  for the presidential elections. Tomorrow, faced with the  worsening situation on the ground, France will withdraw again.    [Mbadinga] The moderate opposition has reacted by saying,  and  I quote, the Togolese people are tired. They have had enough of  endless political transition. The legislative elections could  therefore be a solution to the Togolese crisis, unquote. These  petty squabbles of the opposition are publicly embarked upon in  the country's privately owned newspapers. [end recording]     "

However, Mr Botha  warned at the end of a one day visit to the tiny mountain  kingdom South Africa would not recognise any Lesotho government  which came to power by force. Pretoria would bring such a  government to its knees, he told a press conference before  jetting out. ""We will make it impossible for such a government  to survive,"" he said. ""We will close the border."" Mr Botha was  confident a new South African Government would also not  recognise a Lesotho Government which came to power by a coup.    He was leaving the enclave confident, however, that the  critical situation had been defused. He had received a  commitment from the two opposing defence force factions which  clashed on Friday that they would negotiate a truce.    The cause of the clash supposedly was a demand by the rebel  group for a doubling of army salaries. But Lesotho and SA  [South African] Government officials told SAPA on Saturday it  appeared the dissidents had political grievances, and were  preparing for a possible coup.    The ruling Basotholand Congress Party swept to power in  March  last year, ousting [words indistinct] on on Friday, but said the  pilots and their aircraft were being looked for. They are  expected to return soon to Lesotho. SAPA was informed four  helicopters landed in Ladybrand across the border in the Orange  Free State. The reason for the pilots' [words indistinct] that  their commander, Lt-Col Patrick Matare [name as received], was  injured in Friday's clash and they feared the rebel soldiers  were after them too.    Mr Botha said he had been assured Col Matare was in a  satisfactory condition in hospital in the capital, and there was  no need to accept a SA Government offer to have him treated in  Bloemfontein. The commander, who was still being held hostage  by the rebels on Saturday afternoon, was reportedly shot in the  shoulder. A civilian doctor operated on him.    Mr Botha first met separately with all the parties involved,  including the two army factions, before bringing them together  face- to-face.    The minister and his hosts were at pains to point out he had  been invited to Lesotho to assist and was not ""barging in"". ""I  did not come here to preach,"" he said, pointing out South Africa  had its own problems with violence. He said his basic message  to the parties was the region could ill-afford more  confrontation if it wanted to attract foreign investment. Any  problems in Lesotho could also affect the highlands water  project.    He had also pointed out the Lesotho Government, like South  Africa's, did not have the money to increase salaries  willy-nilly.    ""The future of Africa and the world will depend very heavily  on economic development,"" Mr Botha said. He added he had urged  the soldiers to tackle the ""real enemy"" -- the social upliftment  of Lesotho's people.     "

The organization has appealed to all  involved to stop the killings and said it was prepared to offer  military or other assistance to help stabilize the situation.  Estelle Pienaar reports that South African President Nelson  Mandela received a hero's welcome on his arrival in Harare to  attend the meeting:    There was a tumultuous welcome for South Africa's President  Nelson Mandela today as he arrived in Harare for his first  official foreign visit as head of state. Zimbabwean vice  president and one of the founder members of the Frontline States  back in 1974, Mr. Joshua Nkomo, was there to meet him, but at  the conference center in the city delegates of the Global  Coalition for Africa who have been meeting in the Zimbabwean  capital since yesterday, together with the Frontline States, had  depressing matters to address.    The ravaging Rwanda civil war was addressed during a brief  informal discussion of the seven Frontline States' presidents  and South Africa's head of state, President Nelson Mandela. All  were very concerned about the current situation in Rwanda.  Afterwards the Frontline States met for the first time  embracing South Africa into the brotherhood of the subcontinent.     "

Speaking at Rustenburg during  his election campaign visit to the Western Transvaal, President  de Klerk said the East Rand was faced, not only with a security  problem, but with a socioeconomic issue. The solution had to  make provision for a socioeconomic upliftment program. He said  consultations were still being held with the ANC [African  National Congress] and the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] on the  multiparty plan.    President de Klerk said he was not worried about Mr. Nelson  Mandela's personal attacks on him because they were not based on  fact, but that it did concern him that somebody of Mr. Mandela's  status acted so irresponsibly. He said Mr. Mandela was making  personal attacks on him instead of condemning the activities of  the Self-Defense Units on the East Rand.    President de Klerk said the election was not centered on  freedom, because South Africans were already free, but that it  suited the opposition to talk about freedom as they did not have  a real message for the future.    He said right-wingers had no justification for threats of  war. The CP [Conservative Party] had lost two referendums and  two elections and would have to accept the majority decision.     "
0,FT944-17975 ,"FT944-17975 _AN-EJED5AG7FT 941005   FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (16): Experience and relationships are vital - Winning contracts in Africa / In South Africa, UK exporters face intense competition from German, Japanese, and US companies      By JON MARKS   Longstanding social and business links between the UK and South Africa were underlined during the visit of prime minister John Major to the republic in September - see the regional focus, on the facing page. 'The strength of the relationship is a very important factor,' emphasises Ian Robinson, chairman of the engineering division of Trafalgar House, who was a member of Mr Major's mission. Many of these links pre-date South Africa's emergence from apartheid and sanctions. Trafalgar House subsidiary Davy International has been supplying equipment to the region's metals processors for over two decades. It won an order in early 1993 for some Pounds 200m worth of hot and cold rolling mills to the Columbus stainless steel plant, 'where UK technology and UK finance are pivotal,' says Mr Robinson. Davy has since secured another contract for the supply of aluminium smelting furnaces for the smaller Alusaf project for which the UK's Export Credits Guarantees Department (ECGD) announced a Pounds 15m project supply line in conjunction with Hill Samuel in April 1994. Experience in the South African market and established links are still critical factors - 'it's a conservative country,' says a banker active in providing trade finance for South African buyers. Other companies such as John Brown Engineering and Rolls Royce have enjoyed a presence there for much of the last 30 years, with involvement in areas such as offshore hydrocarbons development and sales of aerospace engines. Over this period, trade has become increasingly linked to investment. The Industrial Power Group of Rolls Royce operates a local subsidiary company NEI South Africa to tap into the market for industrial power products. The transfer and application of new technology is now a prime feature of UK export contracts to South Africa, says Chris Cox, the Department of Trade and Industry's export promoter for South Africa. 'There has been a lack of investment in machinery,' adds Mr Cox, who spent 13 years at Cable  Wireless (CW) before secondment to the DTI, and has lived much of his life in southern Africa. Bronx Process Engineering, a UK firm which is involved with the Columbus project, has been selling to South Africa for 25 years. Mr Malcolm Roberts, the company's managing director, says that relationships, developed over many years, have formed the most crucial element in the company's success in the region, though he also emphasises that it adopts a competitive pricing strategy. Bronx specialises in processing equipment for the steel and aluminium industries. It was a nominated sub-contractor to the main Columbus contractor Davy for a Pounds 14m sub-contracting deal. The contract involved the refurbishment of old machinery and the delivery of new equipment - currently being installed at Columbus - to prepare coils for the rolling mills. Long-term financing played a key part in negotiations for the Colombus deal, says Mr Roberts - 'it was eventually done by Davy, through Kleinwort Benson.' Bronx has also won another South African contract, worth Pounds 5m, for equipping Trident Steel, part of the large Anglovaal group. The development of local infrastructure is a source of contracts, but significant orders often call for a commitment to invest. East Midlands Electricity (EME) has injected working capital of Pounds 200,000 into the Phambili Nombane joint venture signed at the end of 1993 with South African and French partners. The consortium expects to deliver electricity by 1996 to the township of Khayelitsha, 30 miles from Cape Town. EME acts as the agent for its South African partner Eskom, which will meet the costs of the project. EME is overseeing the construction, operation and maintenance of the distribution system and provides customer services such as meter reading and billing. In a small, but growing, mobile telephone market, CW has taken a 25 per cent stake in Mobile Telephone Network (MTN), which received a 15-year operations licence in 1993. The network began operations in April in Pretoria, Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg, and is in competition with the Vodacom network involving fellow UK concern Vodaphone. Part of the deal involves installing pay-phones in townships, which then connect to the MTN network to become static cellular phones. CW expects eventually to invest around Pounds 25m in MTN, and has awarded a sub-contract to a UK company for the supply of a digital access cross-control 'running into millions of rands,' says CW. Accompanying networks include communications software. Network Designers (NDL) has a deal with Telkom, the South African state telecommunications corporation. The order includes the supply of over 5,500 workstations and was secured against tough local and international competition as NDL could meet Telkom's requirements for 'connectionless' network implementation. Software companies did well selling into the cellular market, observes Mr Cox. Smaller exporters have also developed niche sales: Weybridge-based STT Badalex was awarded a Pounds 3.5m contract in June by Consolidated Lamp Manufacturers Pty (CLM) for the delivery of its specialised manufacturing equipment for lamps. CLM, whose shareholders are GEC Alsthom, Barlow Rand and Philips, will site the equipment in Port Elizabeth. For all the region's potential, there are still substantial problems facing exporters to South Africa. One, now being tackled by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is the question of high import tariffs. There is also intense competition from German, Japanese, US and other exporters. While UK companies have 'an inside track to some extent, they cannot rely on the empathy factor,' says Chris Cox. South Africa is a focus for UK official financial support for exporters. Fifteen ECGD-backed credit lines are in place, including, for example, a Pounds 30m line, funded by Kleinwort Benson. By August this year, ECGD exposure to South Africa stood at Pounds 1.35bn and UK government sources indicate that over Pounds 1bn in unused capacity is still available. This makes South Africa the third most important market in the world for ECGD, after China and Hong Kong. The late September trade mission 'opened up some very significant industrial contacts,' says Mr Robinson of Trafalgar House. Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, has hailed South Africa as the gateway to the rest of the continent for UK investment and trade. Certainly in terms of contract awards, it dominates. And in many cases, companies active in the republic are also operating elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa: Davy International, for example, is 'actively pursuing' business in Zimbabwe, CW has a management deal in Botswana, Badalex recently landed its fifth national contract in Nigeria. EME is active in Zanzibar and Zambia.   Countries:-  ZAZ  South Africa, Africa.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.     P6153 Short-Term Business Credit Institutions.
