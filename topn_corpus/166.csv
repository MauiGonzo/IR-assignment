Among Russia's biggest creditors are  Germany (4.5 billion dollars), the US (1.8 billion dollars),  Italy (1.05 billion dollars) and France (554 million dollars).    This information was given in a paper circulated among the  State Duma deputies on Wednesday. Today the State Duma will  consider the draft law on state foreign borrowings on the part  of Russia and on state credits given to Russia by foreign  countries and on the upper limit of foreign borrowings and  credits which may be granted to Russia by a foreign country in  1994.    The paper underlined that the total sum of the received  credits had been reduced to 4.46 billion dollars during 1993.  Germany remained the biggest creditor (2.4 billion dollars).  France had second place with 680 million dollars. The US was  the third biggest creditor - 671 million dollars. Italy was the  fourth - with 228 million dollars.    During this year Russia expects to receive 2.8 billion in  foreign credits, including 850 million dollars from Germany, 525  million dollars from Italy, 485 million dollars from the US, 350  million dollars from Japan. Great Britain will allot 190  million dollars, the EEC 150 million dollars and France 85  million dollars.    In 1993 the foreign credits were distributed among different  sectors of the Russian economy as follows: the agriculture and  the food industry received 2.02 billion dollars; industry - 817  million dollars; the transport and communications 724 million  dollars; the municipal economy and environment 482 million  dollars and the medical industry 295 million dollars. A total  of 120 million dollars were spent on purchasing medicine.    In 1994 the foreign credits are expected to be distributed  as  following: the agriculture and the food industry will receive  490 million dollars; industry - 1.97 billion dollars; the  transport and communications - 450 million dollars; the  municipal economy and environment - 140 million dollars and the  medical industry - 280 million dollars. A total of 370 million  dollars will be spent on purchasing medicine.    Another paper cited the terms of credits allotted by the  former USSR and Russia to India, Cuba, Algeria and Pakistan.  For instance, India was allotted 830 million dollars in 1992  for the delivery of Russian ""special property"" and services.  The term of the credit in 1994-1995 proceeds from a 5  pct-annual rate. Repayment of the credit by India provides for  a ten pct-advanced payment. A total of 90 pct of the sum will  be repaid over seven years through the delivery of goods from  India.    In accordance with the agreement on economic and technical  cooperation between Russia and Cuba signed in July 1993, Cuba  received 350 million dollars under a 4 pct-annual rate. The  credit is to be paid in 1993-1995. Cuba must pay the credit  through goods deliveries over 10 years.     "

The weekly OPCIONES, which circulates in Cuba to provide  information to tourists and foreign residents, said in its  latest edition that Cuba and Russia ratified an agreement last  December to exchange Cuban sugar for Russian petroleum. Through  this agreement, Moscow would send 2.5 million tons of petroleum  to the island this year in exchange for 1 million tons of  unrefined sugar.    A few days ago, Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello  revealed both countries had signed a letter of intent to  exploit, under a joint enterprise scheme, some 60,000 barrels of  petroleum at the Cienfuegos refinery on the southern coast of  Cuba, and to produce petroleum byproducts for sale on domestic  and world markets.    If the accord signed by Havana and the Mexican state-owned  company Mexpetrol advances favorably, the refined product would  be sold in the Cuban market and the oversupply in other nations.  The origin of the current Cuban economic crisis is related to  energy following the reduction in petroleum supplies from the  defunct Soviet Union, which in 1989 supplied a little more than  13 million tons.    Cuba has been forced to get its economy going with only half  of this amount, because it does not have the financial reserves  to purchase all of its petroleum needs. For similar reasons,  Cuba mothballed its electronuclear program launched with the  Soviet Union in 1980, when investments exceeded $1.2 billion.  For the time being, this has eliminated the possibility of  reducing dependence on imported petroleum. Cuba does not have  plentiful rivers, large forests, or significant coal deposits,  and it only exploits wells of heavy petroleum, whose production  last year hit a record of 1.1 million tons.    National crude oil is used in industry, the production of  cement, and power-generation. Additionally, the country has  resorted to foreign investments to explore new fields of light  petroleum by granting risk contracts. The results of these  contracts will only be known in the future.    Even if the agreements with Russia and Mexico bear fruit,  not  all of the country's needs will be met. Nevertheless, annual  payments on imports would be reduced by using petroleum refined  at the Cienfuegos installation, in addition to securing the  Russian supply in exchange for Cuban sugar.     "

A reportage by our correspondent Vladimir Izotov has the  details.    [Izotov] (Felix Leon Carabello), consul general of the  Republic of Cuba in St. Petersburg, did not conceal the fact  that the main aim of the news conference was to attract the  attention of Russian and, in the first place, St. Petersburg  businessmen toward cooperation with his country.    In the early 1980's trade turnover between Cuba and the  Soviet Union was some 7 to 8 billion rubles [R] per annum, Mr.  (Caraballo) recalled, in terms of the ruble exchange rate at  that time. Now it would be excellent if the target of R1.5 to 2  billion could be achieved, he added.    After the break-up of the Soviet Union and the Council for  Mutual Economic Assistance, considerable changes took place in  Cuba, the consul general said. Circulation of foreign currency  has been legalized in the country. Joint enterprises, in the  first place in the sphere of tourism, have undergone development.    The most hurtful thing, Mr. (Caraballo) added, is that the  place of the Soviet Union in the development of such sectors of  the Cuban economy as the nickel and oil refining industries has  been taken not by Russia but by Canada, Sweden, and other  western countries.    In reply to a question by the Radio Rossii correspondent  about trade cooperation with our country, Cuba's consul general  remarked that not very long ago an agreement was signed on the  delivery of 1 billion tonnes of Cuba sugar to Russia in exchange  for 2.5 billion tonnes of Russian oil. The government of St.  Petersburg and Leningrad oblast is showing an interest in  developing partner relations with Cuba, Mr. (Caraballo)  remarked. The joint (Petrokub) firm is already in operation --  it is engaged in exporting Cuban tobacco to St. Petersburg. A  joint enterprise for the delivery of Cuban medicines to Russia's  northwestern region will start functioning soon.     "

It is the main hardship of the so-called special period  in the aftermath of the sudden fall of eastern European  socialism, particularly the fall of socialism in the former  Soviet Union. This lack of oil has had a widespread effect on  all types of transportation services, because Cuba has largely  relied on automotive transportation, which requires not only  fuel, but also lubricants and other important products.    The sugar industry, the most important industry in Cuba,  which is the world's largest sugar exporter, cannot run without  petroleum. However, many sugar refineries are using bagasse as  the main source of fuel for their boilers.    In addition, the country's electrical industry also needs  hydrocarbons to generate energy. Cuba, a small country that  lacks large rivers and waterfalls needed to build hydroelectric  plants, has only two alternatives: thermoelectrical plants,  which also need oil, and nuclear plants. The construction of  the nuclear plant in Juragua, in the central region, was halted  when it was almost finished, because the mighty Soviet state,  which was helping Cuba build its first nuclear plant, suddenly  disappeared. Thus, the Cuban Government is feverishly  negotiating with other countries to complete this project vital  to the national economy. This lack of electricity introduced a  new predicament to the Cuban population, which is exposed to  daily power outages that last several hours, usually at times  when it is most needed.    These brief examples allow us to visualize the problems the  Cuban nation is currently facing, because the world's largest  power is economically blocking and harassing it to subjugate the  political resolve of the Cuban population. Cuba, along with  several European and American countries, has given oil  exploration a large impetus. Cuba has also been able to  significantly increase national crude production since 1959,  when the revolution succeeded.    Oil production is expected to amount to 1.3 million tons  this  year and will continue to grow in the future. Large amounts of  this oil used to generate electricity are too heavy and require  special treatment to reduce the number of breakdowns in the  industry's already worn-out equipment.    Cuba also signed an important agreement with Russia to  exchange 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of sugar  this year. In addition, a joint operation with Mexico is  already under way to jump start the Cienfuegos oil refinery,  part of whose output will be bought by and consumed in that  country.    After the incident of an alleged meeting that Colombian  guerrillas held in Havana, which jeopardized the recently  established relations between the two countries, there is a  possibility that Colombia will sell some 120,000 barrels of  crude oil daily to Cuba within the framework of a transaction  exclusively regulated by international trade guidelines. Other  efforts are already under way but have yet to materialize. It  is expected that the Cuban economy will experience some kind of  relief this year and will begin surmounting the crisis caused by  the latest political upheavals.     "

The cut in supplies to a country which once enjoyed the closest links with the former Soviet Union is expected to further damage the recession-hit Cuban economy. The decision is in line with Russia's attitude to other countries which once enjoyed oil imports for barter, or at prices far below the world market level - including former Soviet states which are now independent countries. Mr Davydov said Russia had exported 1.5m tonnes of oil to Cuba, but had received only 500,000 tonnes of sugar - 550,000 tonnes short of the amount agreed. He said Russia would sell the remaining 1m tonnes of oil it had agreed to ship to Cuba on the world market, 'adding around Dollars 120m to the national budget'. 'If after our own sugar harvest the need arises to import more sugar cane, then we are prepared to open negotiations again with Cuba on this issue in 1995,' Mr Davydov said. He added, however, that the barter of sugar for oil was unprofitable. An official of the Cuban sugar organisation, Cubazucar, said the deal, agreed last December, was still active - although only partly fulfilled. 'It doesn't mean the accord has stopped.' However, Cuba would not be able to deliver sugar until December or January, after this year's harvest.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

0,FT921-9644 ,"FT921-9644 _AN-CBKBQACWFT 920211   FT  11 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Low Cuban sugar crop forecast      By DAMIAN FRASER      MEXICO CITY   CUBA'S SUGAR crop is at best likely to be 6.5m tonnes in 1991-92, about 1.1m tonnes less than in 1990-91, according to a group of sugar experts who gathered together in the Dominican republic under the auspices of the (moderate) Cuban exile group, Sociedad Economica de los Amigos del Pais. The experts - who included a senior official from the US Department of Agriculture, analysts from FO Licht, the German sugar statistics agency, Scudder Group, Czarnikow, the London trade house, and assorted academics - believed that Cuba failed to harvest any sugar in the last two months of 1991. This would reduce the seasonal (November-June) harvest by between 300,000 and 1m tonnes. In January harvesting appears to have been very slow. Even if the weather holds up, the experts agreed that Cuba would be lucky to produce 6.5m tonnes this year, given the shortages of spare parts, poor maintenance of equipment, and problems in the field. The onset of rain would push the forecast even lower, said Mr Gerry Hagelberg, of FO Licht. In November the USDA estimated that Cuba's production would reach 7.3m tonnes. Mr Peter Buzzanell, the official responsible for estimates, suggested that the department would formally revise its estimate downwards as early as this week. The drop of production, if it materialises, will hit Cuba's battered economy hard - for the first time it is having to sell sugar (usually 75 per cent of exports) at world, rather than preferential prices. But it will come as welcome news to the world sugar market, which has been bracing itself for a flood of sugar after the collapse of Cuba's barter trade with the former-Soviet Union. In the nine months to last September, Cuba exported 6.15m tonnes of sugar, of which 3.7m tonnes went to the Soviet Union, 740,000 tonnes to China, about 500,000 tonnes to Japan and Canada and the remainder to assorted countries. In the full year Cuba promised to send the Soviet Union 4m tonnes of sugar in return for 10m tonnes of oil and other products. (An exchange that valued Cuban sugar at about 24 cents a lb, compared with a world price of 8 cents a lb). This year, however, Cuba has had to renegotiate with ex-Soviet Union states. So far Russia has agreed to buy (with oil) 500,000 tonnes of Cuban sugar, with an option to buy another 500,000 tonnes; Kazakhstan will take another 200,000 tonnes, with an option for 200,000 tonnes; and Latvia 50,000 tonnes. Cuba will thus have to find a home for about 1.5m tonnes of sugar that in the past went to the Soviet Union, assuming production at the lower 6.5m tonnes (and exports at around 5.4m tonnes), and the options fully taken up. Some of this excess sugar will go to other ex-Soviet states that have yet to sign trade agreements with Cuba, and, says Mr Hagelberg, perhaps as much as 400,000 tonnes to Iran and South Korea. Nevertheless the world markets could still be expected to absorb about 1m tonnes of extra Cuban sugar this year - unless Cuba's crop deteriorates still further.

0,FT923-10781 ,"FT923-10781 _AN-CG2ASAASFT 920729   FT  29 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Investors find the door ajar in Cuba - Businessmen report limited but growing foreign involvement      By STEPHEN FIDLER   FOREIGN involvement in the Cuban economy is growing significantly, according to British businessmen recently returned from a trade mission to Cuba. Their conclusions, described in a restricted circulation report, are that the government is trying to move towards a state that is 'managed rather than intimately controlled' by the Communist Party. The report, 'Cuba opens its doors to British business', says a kind of 'creeping privatisation' - with the notable exception of land ownership - is under way in a bid to re-orient the economy following the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union and east Europe. Competition is being encouraged between autonomous and older state enterprises, as is profit, and the retention of hard currency earnings is allowable through an independent banking system. The Cubans are seeking to re-orient export production, obtain new markets and find new sources of convertible currency. The report suggests companies from Spain, Italy, France, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and Argentina are taking the lead in investment in Cuba. The report points to two main growth areas: biotechnology and tourism. In biotechnology, the aim is to link laboratories to the production and commercialisation of advanced research finished or nearing completion. Biotechnological research is likely to be marketed in the EC through joint ventures with Spanish, Dutch and Hungarian companies. In tourism, already the country's largest foreign exchange earner, the development of new facilities has become the highest priority. In 1991, Cuba received more than 400,000 visitors and expects to receive more than 500,000 this year, projected to reach 1m by 1995 of which 80 per cent will come from Europe. Cuba plans to build a further 3,000-4,000 rooms a year to 1995. Based on projects already implemented and other feasibility studies, foreign partners can recover investment in three years. Spain has been the most aggressive investor in tourism, while Austrian, Italian, German, Swiss and Mexican companies have also shown interest. Projects are being discussed with Ramada, Inter-Continental, Camino Real, Lonhro Metropole Group, Club Med and other companies, including some from the US. A recent decision to encourage joint ventures and commercial arrangements in other sectors may in reality be somewhat limited. The report notes that the government is not interested in joint ventures in the production of sugar, health care, education, tobacco or in infrastructure outside Havana. Cuba has, however, proposed to the Russian government a joint venture in Russia to refine sugar. Cuba is also looking at the possibilities of providing health care, hospital clinics and other social services to republics of the former Soviet Union. The report suggests changes made thus far are likely to be followed by yet more dramatic changes and innovation in developing new commercial relationships and towards acquiring more advanced technology. 'Almost every aspect of traditional Cuban central planning has been abandoned in the autonomous sector and for joint ventures and there are signs that this process is now spreading to the internal sector,' the report says. Already all enterprises and government agencies are meant to cover expenditure from income. Even the sports ministry now has to earn its hard currency requirements from its training and other activities in third countries. The State Committee for Economic Co-operation, whose historical role was as co-ordinator of government-to-government negotiations and with which the predominant responsibility for joint ventures now lies, says some 50-60 joint venture agreements or other forms of economic association have been signed, and about 200 are under discussion. However, the report says Cuban ministers acknowledge that most investment opportunities will be through economic association since a true joint venture is difficult to structure. There are other difficulties too, not mentioned in the report. Some British businessmen considering business with Cuba say they have received hints that it might have adverse consequences on their regulatory treatment in the US. The Administration has already tightened regulations on shipping goods to Cuba. Congressional proposals to tighten the economic noose around Cuba are causing concern as they could trigger a row with the British and other governments over the extraterritorial ambitions of US law. 'It is for the British government not the US Congress to determine the UK's policy on trade with Cuba,' one UK official warned. Companies have also experienced not-so-subtle pressure from Cuban exile groups, which sometimes have significant knowledge about companies' investment proposals in Cuba.

The new rapprochement was documentarily consolidated in  trade-economic agreements and in a general Russian-Cuban  memorandum on the results of the intergovernmental negotiations  that were signed last Friday. The latter was signed by Mr. Soto  and First Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Government  Vladimir Shumeyko. Besides this, Mr. Soto and First Deputy Prime  Minister of Russia Oleg Soskovets signed an agreement on the  same day about the founding of the Russian-Cuban economic trade  association Roskuba, whose founders on the Russian side are  already prepared to come out with about 30 large domestic  financial-industrial and banking groups, including the  association Rosneft, Tatneft, certain Urals plants, a number of  nickel producers, and others. Commenting on this agreement for  the INTERFAX agency, Mr. Shumeyko declared that it ""lowers the  rank of economic and trade relations from interstate relations  to relations between producers.""    Mr. Shumeyko did not rule out that ""the signed agreements  affect the interests of third countries""--those who are buying  up raw sugar in Cuba in order to sell it to Russia later, but  now, naturally, at other prices, and those who for political  considerations would like to hinder the rapprochement of Russia  and Cuba. He added that he was not interested in political  assessments of the signed agreements, no matter where they came  from, and he expressed the hope that Russia henceforth will  select its economic partners out of economic and not political  considerations. ""We have a lot in common with Cuba, despite the  political disagreements, and we have found that golden mean  which will make it possible for us to develop relations with  this country that are mutually beneficial,"" Mr. Shumeyko  generalized.    Indeed, Russia has already lost a lot of money by rebuying  Cuban sugar from third countries. It also happened that Russia  acted at the bidding of the interests of ""still other"" third  countries--the same ones who, for their own political reasons,  wanted to obstruct the Russo-Cuban rapprochement. And, for  example, it shamefully abstained last year in the UN during  voting on the declaration calling on the United States to remove  the anti-Cuban embargo.    Thus, the obstacles in the form of political prejudices have  been overcome. Not entirely, of course, because however  paradoxical, the statements themselves of Mr. Shumeyko, as well  as those of Mr. Soskovets, who declared that for Russia Cuba is  the same as ""the near abroad,"" contain a lot of superfluous  political fervor and a desire to ""rebuke"" recent opponents of  Russo-Cuban cooperation.    In accordance with the signed agreements, Russia will buy  1.5  million tonnes of raw sugar from Cuba next year (given an annual  consumption of about 7 million tonnes and its own  production--2-2.5 million tonnes). In exchange for this, it will  deliver 4 million tonnes of oil to Cuba in two stages. This  ratio is considerably less profitable for Russia than that which  was planned originally--2 million tonnes of Cuban sugar in  exchange for 3.3 million tonnes of Russian oil and oil products.  It can be assumed that the change in the proportion is  associated with the catastrophic results of the Cuban sugar  harvest campaign, not the least reason for which was the present  departure of Russia, which was retrieving its losses, with its  equipment, spare parts, and diesel oil, from the Caribbean  island. It can be supposed that Cuba should be advanced at least  a little money so that it could restore its production of raw  sugar, which has fallen almost by half. Only in this case would  it be good to explain the change in the original conditions of  the agreement, so that doubts would not creep in about whether  Mr. Shumeyko in fact did find the golden mean.    There is one more result of the last negotiations. After  they  were over, Oleg Davydov, the minister of foreign economic  relations of Russia, if one is to believe the television program  ""Vesti,"" made a statement for all to hear about the problem  between the two countries in the form of the Cuban debt to  Russia. And he even divulged its approximate size: More than $20  billion. It seems that this was the first time that such an  imposing figure had come out of the mouth of a highly placed  Russian government person--it had previously circulated in  unofficial circles and was refuted by the Cuban side and called  a fantasy. This time there were no denials, and it could be  assumed that this approximate figure ""was adopted as a basis.""  Indeed, having reported it, Mr. Davydov then and there made the  reservation that he understands that Cuba is insolvent today,  especially with respect to such large sums. It is difficult not  to agree with him, if one has in mind only the direct monetary  servicing of the debt. But, after all, besides it, other forms  exist. Why not address them and receive from Cuba on account of  debt servicing not sugar, of course--otherwise what will it use  in exchange for Russian oil--but citrus fruit, and the wonderful  Cuban rum, liqueurs, and tobacco articles, long forgotten here?  And is it not worth it in this case to wait a little with  ""lowering"" Russian-Cuban relations from the state level to  ""producer levels?"" It is precisely the state level that is  necessary to resolve this problem.    But, in general, summing up: This new rapprochement has to  be  employed with discretion, so that it is not transformed into a  new edition of an old friendship, which did not make either of  the two countries rich. Russia has many interests in Cuba, which  in the past two years have been abandoned and neglected and have  gone off to foreign, tenacious, and solicitous hands.    And in conclusion, there is this apocrypha. When Boris  Yeltsin in 1986 stopped over in Cuba on his way to Nicaragua,  where he was going as the head of a Soviet party-government  delegation, Fidel himself came to the airport to meet him,  although party protocol did not envision such an honor for a  Politburo candidate member. Castro liked Yeltsin very much; he  looked after him incessantly, drove him around Havana himself,  showing him the city--an honor that he had not bestowed on far  more highly placed guests--and in the end he said about him to  someone: ""He is the only real Leninist in the present Soviet  leadership."" Well, then, old sympathies have now received an  incentive for revival.     "

This was Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets's proposal to Cuban Deputy Prime Minister Lionel Soto  [title as received], with whom he had a working meeting today.    Oleg Soskovets said Russia was interested in selling a large  batch of military helicopters to Colombia to fight the drug  mafia. In a deal like this Russia could offer Colombia very  competitive conditions. As is known, Colombia today is facing a  need for this type of aviation technology. Cuba for its part  has very close links with Latin American countries and also  knows the situation on the local market and could offer  considerable support to Russian firms trying to export their  products to Latin America. Russians have so far had to try to  operate on their own on the Latin American continent and often  suffered losses as a result, Soskovets said.    The interstate company RosCuba, set up recently, is playing  an important role in promoting cooperation between Cuba and  Russia in bringing Russian goods and technology into Latin  America, Oleg Soskovets and his colleague Lionel Soto believe.

The Russian Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations told  Interfax that the two states were to increase mutual deliveries  of oil and sugar in 1994. Russia would export 4 Mn [million]  tons of oil by the end of 1994 (instead of 2.5 Mn tons, the  delivery of which was coordinated in late 1993) in exchange for  2.5 Mn tons of cane sugar, exceeding the earlier expected volume  of deliveries by 2.5 times.    According to Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister  Oleg  Davydov, ""Russia is very interested in importing Cuban sugar  since it has big industrial capacities specially established for  processing of cane sugar.""    Russia and Cuba also intend to develop bilateral cooperation  in other spheres. An International Russian-Cuban Trade Economic  Association Roskuba was established last week in accordance with  the inter-government agreement of December 24, 1993. The  association includes more than 10 Russian state and commercial  structures, for instance the joint stock companies  Aeroflot--Russian Air Lines, Ingosstrakh, Vneshtreidinvest,  Rosdetspetsprodukt, the state committee Rosvooruzhenie and the  Russian Federation Trade Industrial Chamber.    The association's main purposes are to contribute to the  development of trade, direct relations between enterprises and  organizations, mutual utilization of industrial capacities and  investment and to establishment of trans-national commercial,  finance and industrial structures.

Such a deal  can only be carried out if the Cuban Government offers a letter  of credit to Colombia -- that is, if an international bank  finances its debt.    According to a study to which EL TIEMPO has gained access,  the banks are not interested in backing Cuban debts. In fact,  countries such as Iran and Libya suspended their supply of crude  because of a lack of financial guarantees.    Although the situation improved somewhat after Russia  resumed  the commercial exchange of oil with Cuba in January 1994, Cuba  still is not in any position to pay for imports. Russia will  sell Cuba 4.0 million tons of unrefined crude in exchange for  1.5 million tons of sugar this year.    The government of Fidel Castro prefers to offer Colombia a  three-way exchange system. This means that the companies to  which Cuba sells sugar would, in turn, pay Colombia for the  crude. Many of the countries that receive sugar in exchange for  oil have suspended these kinds of deals because of Cuba's  enormous debts and because there is a surplus of sugar, and  future production is in jeopardy. This suspension of imports  heightens the already difficult energy situation. Cuba only has  resources to supply 40 percent of its oil needs.    Even with Colombian oil, the crisis would not be resolved.  Rather than crude, what Cuba needs is fuel, particularly fuel  oil and diesel, to generate electricity and to compensate for  its lack of hydraulic sources of power. This is because Cuban  refineries are also in a state of crisis.    The plants in Havana and Santiago (built by Exxon and Shell)  reportedly produce 30,000 bpd but are currently at a standstill.  The Havana plant requires investments in the order of $100  million, while the Santiago plant needs a $75 million investment  to operate efficiently. Another Soviet-built plant, with the  same capacity, and another located in Matanzas (which reportedly  generates 5,000 bpd) are also at a standstill because of a lack  of maintenance.    The new refinery located in Cienfuegos has the capacity to  produce 60,000 bpd, but it is not operational right now and  requires an investment of approximately $200 million to produce  commercially viable gasoline.    Difficulties in generating electricity have forced Cuba to  obtain gasoline through four international companies (Marc Rich,  Vitol, Mabanet, and Totisa) which receive sugar and nickel as  payment for their exports. According to the document, however,  even refined imports have been reduced. These are now limited  to the volumes of sugar and nickel that Cuba can offer. For  this reason, the document questions Colombia's willingness to  sell oil to Cuba ""while other countries have decided to suspend  sales.""     "

Officials viewed political and economic agreements signed in  December as ""logical"" and ""mutually beneficial"" in furthering the  development of bilateral relations.  Media commentators welcomed the  economic agreements, citing the need to pursue investment and trade  opportunities in Cuba, and emphasized Russia's moral responsibility  to continue its long history of friendship with the Cubans.  This  Foreign Media Note draws on press items selected from FBIS reports  and articles not published elsewhere.      Russian officials and media commentators in recent articles in  the Russian press have endorsed the revitalization of Russian-Cuban  relations, including two bilateral agreements with Cuba signed in  December.  After a period of waning economic and political contacts  in the early 199O's, marked by Russia's voting for a UN resolution  condemning Cuban human rights violations and abstaining on a  November 1993 resolution to lift the economic and financial blockade  of Cuba, Russia now appears ready to renew and develop cooperation  with its longtime political and economic client.      Agreements Signed      On 3 December 1993, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy  Mamedov and his Cuban counterpart Isabel Allende signed agreements  on reciprocal visa-free travel and scientific and cultural  cooperation.  Mamedov stated that.""the agreements became a logical  link in the onward development of relations between Russia and Cuba""  and noted the documents ""are in keeping with the trend toward  greater openness and democracy to which both Russia and Cuba are  moving"" (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1426 GMT 3 Dec 93, Daily Report  FBIS-SOV-93-233 7 Dec 93 p 11).

Shumeyko declared upon signing the memorandum: ""Despite political  differences, we have much in common with Cuba, and we have found the  golden mean which enables us to develop relations with this country  on a mutually beneficial basis.""  Shumeyko asserted in an apparent  de-emphasis on the level of government involvement in economic  decisionmaking that the ""Roskuba"" agreement ""lowered the level of  economic and trade relations to that between manufacturers.""  Trade  terms in the memorandum state that Russia will receive about 1.5  million tons of Cuban raw sugar in 1994 in exchange for four million  tons of oil.  Shumeyko noted it was possible that the agreements  would affect ""the interests of third world countries"" that purchase  Cuban raw sugar to resell it later to Russia ""at other prices"" and  ""those who would like to impede the rapprochement of Russia and Cuba  on political grounds"" (Moscow INTERFAX in English 1738 GMT 24 Dec  93, Daily Report FBIS-SOV-93-246 27 Dec 93 pp 28-29).

However, he warned  that ""this new rapprochement must be employed wisely, so that it  does not turn into a replay of the old friendship, which made  neither of the two countries rich.""  Velekhov noted that after the  negotiations Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg  Davydov became the first Russian government official to openly  divulge the amount of Cuba's debt to Russia, announcing a debt of  more than 2O billion dollars during the television program ""Vesti.""  While Davydov stated that Cuban insolvency would preclude repayment  of such a large sum, Velekhov pointed out the advantages of  servicing the debt with commodities, expressing a fondness for  ""citrus fruit, the wonderful Cuban rum, liqueurs, and tobacco  products long forgotten by us.""

Through this agreement Russia will supply up to  70,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the European market, and  Petroven will supply an equal amount to the Caribbean island.  Under a similar agreement, which was suspended in 1992, Russia  and Venezuela saved $1 per barrel in freight expenses.    Russia supplied Ural crude to the Ruhr Oel refinery system,  a  Veba Oel and Petroven company, in Germany, while Petroven  supplied Cuba with reconstituted crude. Vitali Zeleakin,  president of the Committee for Economic Reform of the Russian  Federation Council, and Vladimir Turdenev, Russian Foreign  Ministry director for Central and South America, said that only  a few technical aspects remain to be resolved before deliveries  to Europe and Cuba can resume. The two officials said that, far  from reflecting ideological positions, this is basically a trade  agreement beneficial to the two parties. Currently, Russia  trades 2.5 million tons of oil for 1 million tons of Cuban sugar.    A delegation of Russian parliamentarians is visiting  Venezuela this week. They have expressed the political desire of  the federation of republics to strengthen bilateral relations in  areas such as oil. Yesterday they held meetings with Energy and  Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta and Petroven President Luis Giusti.    Another interesting Russian proposal regards their  willingness to cooperate with OPEC. Russia is considering  joining OPEC because it considers the organization an important  agent in maintaining market stability. Moreover, the Russians  offer the possibility of exchanging mining and petroleum  technology with Venezuela.    Russia is of interest as an oil-producing country despite  the  sharp drop in its established production capacity of 12 million  barrels per day in the 1970's to 7 million barrels per day at  present, a volume which it wants to increase by opening the  market to national and foreign private investors.

The Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said the accords, including provision for a possible sugar-for-oil deal, were signed in Moscow by Mr Lionel Soto, Cuban vice-president, and Mr Alexander Shokhin, Russia's deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs. The agreements appeared to be the most important reached between Havana and Moscow since the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Caribbean island's main political ally and economic supplier for three decades. Prensa Latina quoted Mr Soto as having said the two sides were also seeking a third partner to help complete a nuclear power station until recently being built in Cuba with Soviet aid. Cuban President Fidel Castro suspended work on the plant on September 5, saying the country could not afford to accept terms offered by Russia to finish it. Mr Soto said guarantees were needed to ensure the supply of nuclear fuel to the Cuban plant, according to Prensa Latina. The agency described the accords as 'important for the future development of bilateral relations'. It quoted Mr Soto as having said they would help to widen and stabilise ties between the two countries. Prensa Latina said the bilateral agreements, valid for 1993, covered trade, economic co-operation, shipping and the 'permanence in Cuba of the ex-Soviet radio-electronic centre'. This was a reference to a military signals intelligence facility at Lourdes and believed to be one of the biggest operated by the Soviet military in the western hemisphere during the cold war. Cuba and Russia agreed in September to withdraw the last remaining former Soviet combat troops on the island. Russian officials said at the time that the Lourdes installation, now the responsibility of the Russian government, would be the subject of separate talks.  The Financial Times   London Page 7  "

In several weekend statements, Mr Castro also said that Cuban workers were not efficient enough and praised foreign investors in Cuba for increasing productivity in several sectors, including tourism. He told a group of foreign businessmen investment opportunities in Cuba were worth many billions of dollars and that tourism alone had the potential for Dollars 20bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in new foreign business. Opportunities for foreign investment in Cuba were growing so quickly that there would be 'not one square metre of beach' left for US companies. 'Those who impose a blockade impose a blockade on themselves,' he said. Speaking to a conference of Communist party delegates, Mr Castro said his government was committed to expanding the tourism sector, as it was the only economy activity which could ease Cuba's economic problems.

0,FT944-11926 ,"FT944-11926 _AN-EKCEGAGJFT 941103   FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuba struggles to revive sugar sector - A look at problems dogging the mainstay of the country's economy      By PASCAL FLETCHER   Cuba's sugar harvest, mainstay of the island's economy, could soon begin to level out after its recent nosedive, but a return to cruising altitude looks a long way off. Just five years ago output was running at a comfortable 8m tonnes a year. But then it went into a tailspin. The crop fell to a historic low of 4m tonnes in 1993-94 from 4.2m tonnes in 1992-93 and 7m tonnes the previous year. This represented lost export earnings over two harvests of Dollars 1bn, a heavy blow for a sugar-dominated, recession-hit economy whose total export revenue in 1993 was an estimated Dollars 1.7 bn. Faced with continuing severe input shortages and a reduced level of harvestable cane, the best Cuba can hope for from the 1994-95 season is to slow the decline in its leading export industry. If it can do this, the island may be able to lay some foundations for a future recovery. But it will be a hard slog. Sugar market analysts, such as London trade house ED  F. Man, have already predicted that Cuban output will continue to fall in 1994-95. Even the Cuban authorities, normally loath to make any public pre-harvest forecasts, are signalling that they expect a crop as low as or lower than last year. 'This is not a time for spectacular results measured in large volumes of sugar,' the official workers' daily Trabajadores said in an October 10 editorial. 'Sugar production suffers from a syndrome of cycles, either good or bad. . . if you had a bad previous harvest, recovery is difficult,' said Mr Juan Triana Cordovi, deputy director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on the Cuban Economy. It was the sudden collapse after 1990 of crucial Soviet supplies of fuel, fertiliser, herbicides and spares that knocked Cuban sugar production off course. Recent harvests have also been buffeted by unseasonal bad weather and slowed by declining efficiency. The antidote proposed by Mr Nelson Torres, Cuba's minister for sugar, is a short, sharp and above all efficient 1994-95 harvest. This year's campaign, if it starts this month as usual, will not be allowed to extend beyond April. In another change of strategy, all of Cuba's more than 150 mills will be required to join the harvest to maximise production. Last season, more than a dozen below-par mills did not operate, with the result that their machinery was 'cannibalised' for other uses and their work forces dispersed. The over-extended 1993-94 harvest, which lasted well beyond May, cut into growing cane reserves and delayed field cultivation and mill repairs. Mill managers, struggling to meet pre-set production targets and to compensate for industrial breakdowns and inefficiency, harvested cane that could have been left for the coming season. Granma, the official Communist Party newspaper, said in a September 2 article: 'There is going to be once again - it's no secret - a serious shortage of cane'. That echoed an August, ED  F. Man report warning that the protracted 1993-94 campaign, continuing input shortages and reports of delays in the planting programme meant that 'further degradation of (Cuba's) sugar production cannot be eliminated'. As the start of the harvest approaches, sugar workers have been the target of a blitz of official criticism. State media have accused them of ducking out of eight-hour work schedules, using poor quality seed and failing to weed growing cane. 'Why is the cane in such poor state. . . so full of weeds?' state-run Radio Rebelde asked back in September. Especially targetted for criticism were the cane growing co-operatives, the so-called basic units of co-operative production (UBPCs), created in September, 1993 as part of a decentralising reform of Cuba's state-run farming system. 'Why have these UBPCs still not been able to contain and reverse the sharp collapse of the nation's greatest resource?' Mr Trabajadores said six weeks ago. Reasons cited for poor productivity in the cane co-operatives were the lack of incentives, delays in obtaining promised benefits like new housing and even shortages of work clothes like boots. Government officials were studying the possibility of introducing greater material incentives for sugar workers - whether in local or hard currency or in access to consumer goods - like those already available for workers in Cuba's tourist industry. To offset harvest manpower shortages, Cuba's official trade union organisation, the CTC, is preparing to mobilise 61,000 cane cutters across the island, 25,000 more than last year. This manual cutting force will also help to compensate for cutbacks in machine harvesting resulting from shortages of fuel, lubricants and spare parts. On the commercial front, Cuba has maintained a hermetic silence over the state of its strategic sugar trade contracts with Russia and China. Traders in London and New York reported as early as June that the country might have problems meeting all of its export commitments because of the second consecutive low harvest. The Cubans were expected to have sought to roll over many of their commitments into the next crop period, a tactic widely used even when the island was producing harvests of about 8m tonnes. The roll-over mechanism is considerably less drastic than the force majeure declared by Cuba in June, 1993, when torrential rains devastated an already flagging harvest.

Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will arrive in  Cuba on an official visit on 13 June.

Vice-President Carlos Lage told a news conference in Havana at the weekend that the government was also preparing a new foreign investment law that would give more protection to overseas investors, who are already active in Cuba in activities ranging from oil exploration to citrus production. Cuba began opening up its state-run economy to external investment after 1989 to offset the devastating impact of the collapse of its preferential trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc. 'From now onwards, no productive sector will be excluded from investment by foreign capital,' Mr Lage said. Up to now, raw sugar production, traditionally the island's biggest export earner, had been explicitly closed to foreign investment. But the sugar industry is in deep crisis and has suffered two consecutive disastrously low harvests. Mr Lage also announced that, in defiance of a continuing US economic embargo against Cuba, representatives of more than 69 US companies had visited the island in the first half of this year to discuss business prospects. In some cases, letters of intent for future contracts had been negotiated to take effect when the US embargo was finally lifted by Washington. Representatives of two British sugar companies, Tate  Lyle, and EDF Man, have held talks this year with Cuban investment officials. Shortages of essential inputs previously supplied by the former Soviet Union, such as fuel, spare parts, fertilisers and herbicides, have crippled Cuba's sugar production since 1990. On Cuba's economy, Mr Lage said it was still too early to talk of recovery. But he cited some positive signs, such as the growth of foreign investment, particularly in tourism and oil exploration, improvements in construction, cement and nickel production and progress in the government's efforts to stabilise the country's internal finances.

0,FT944-10333 ,"FT944-10333 _AN-EKKDMABHFT 941111   FT  11 NOV 94 / Cuba and the IMF compare notes: Pascal Fletcher explores the significance of visits from a much pilloried institution      By PASCAL FLETCHER   Cuba has long pilloried the International Monetary Fund as the torch-bearer of neo-liberal capitalism. It regularly blamed IMF 'shock remedies' for causing hunger, unemployment and poverty across the Third World, especially Latin America. The fact that a senior IMF official should have visited Cuba twice over the last year is, then, intriguing. The 'non-official' visits by IMF executive director Mr Jacques de Groote late last year and early this year do not mean that Cuba, which left the Fund in the early 1960s, is trying to re-join, at least not yet. For one thing, the US maintains a blocking objection to Cuban membership as part of its economic sanctions against Cuba's one-party socialist government. But the IMF contacts do reflect an important shift in Cuba's economic policy since the country was left like an orphan in the world economy after the disappearance of its protector, the former Soviet Union. Not only is Cuba trying to beat its recession by implementing reforms the IMF would not disown, but it is also signalling clearly, perhaps as much through necessity as conviction, that it wants to come out of the cold and back into the mainstream of the world economic community. 'Whether we like it or not, (the IMF) is a leading institution in the world economy and so it is a must for us to know about it,' Mr Raul Amado Blanco, vice-president of the National Bank of Cuba, the cental bank, said in an interview. He said the IMF officials who visited were briefed about Cuba's reform moves. Cuba learned how the IMF and World Bank had helped other command economies in eastern Europe and Asia move towards market-oriented policies. But senior Cuban officials are careful to put limits on the rapprochement with the IMF and on just how far Cuba intends to go in its reforms. Mr Amado Blanco said re-joining the Bretton Woods institutions was not being actively considered. 'We would have to be convinced of the usefulness (of rejoining). . . whether it would really signify a contribution to our political and economic policies,' he said. Cuba's vice-president, Mr Carlos Lage, said Cuba was ready to discuss economic options with the IMF, the World Bank and anybody else. 'That doesn't mean we are ready to do what these institutions dictate.' Nevertheless, the economic reforms being introduced by Cuba would not be out of place in an IMF or World Bank policy manual. They include cuts in subsidies to loss-making state companies, selective price increases, farm reforms, currency reform, decentralisation of decision-making, the imposition of taxes, moves to control liquidity and an assault on the yawning budget deficit. Many of the changes, such as the recent authorisation of public markets for farm produce and consumer goods, also reflect recommendations made by a team of Spanish experts led by Spain's former finance minister Mr Carlos Solchaga. 'Cuba is making a serious structural adjustment effort,' Juan Triana, deputy director of Havana University's Centre for Studies on the World Economy, said. The budget deficit, which in 1993 stood at 4.2bn pesos, has already been reduced by some 25 per cent this year. The glut of Cuban pesos sluicing around the economy, estimated at nearly 12bn pesos in circulation at the end of April, has already been cut by 1.3bn pesos, according to the central bank. The moves, also aimed at throttling the black market, have caused a tightening of the level of pesos in circulation and a fall in the black market value of one dollar to less than 50 pesos from past lows of more than 100. Putting buying power back into the peso is one of the objectives. Cuban officials insist the on-going reforms differ from IMF remedies. They say the state is keeping a dominant, controlling economic role and social concerns are paramount. 'We have a strategy. . . it's not a strategy of capitalist development. . . it's a strategy of a planned, socialist economy,' said Mr Lage, who is viewed as the main architect of Cuba's economic reforms. He said Cuba would preserve 'the essentials' of its socialist system - official shorthand for free, universal health, education and other social services. At the same time, however, Mr Lage announced Cuba was opening up more of its economy to foreign investment, namely real estate and sugar production to foreign investment. Many foreign economists, however, say Cuba needs to go further, faster. The IMF's Mr de Groote noted after his November 1993 visit the Cuban authorities were 'still hesitating over the basic issue of allowing more private property and individual decision-making in the economy'. The Spanish team led by Mr Solchaga, in a report in June this year, said Cuba 'must start to help itself' by moving faster to dismantle rigid economic structures and opening up more private business opportunities to Cubans. Mr Lage hinted the government was working on currency reform, expected to be the introduction of a convertible peso, and was also considering widening the legalisation on private, self-employment for Cubans. Concerns over social unrest, like the unprecedented street disturbances in Havana on August 5, are undoubtedly giving impetus to the reforms. So too is the prospect of another record low sugar harvest, the third in a row for Cuba's sugar-based economy. Cuba also desperately needs fresh external credits, which have all but dried up since Paris Club official creditors' rescheduling talks on the convertible currency debt of more than Dollars 7bn stalled in the second half of the 1980s.

This is not at all the namesake republic we knew in the old  times in the former USSR. In this country, land belongs to those  who work on it, and doors are open to foreign investors,  including emigres. Foreign currency is freely accepted here;  entrepreneurship encouraged. And it goes without saying that in  business relations they are guided by regular commercial utility  rather than ideological opinion.    True, in the opinion of some stern observers, there is no  other Cuba. They only pretend on this island of revolution that  they have commenced fantastic transformations. Life made them do  it. The disintegration of the socialist camp, the lack of  friendly subsidies, and the final collapse of the inefficient  economic system have presented them with the need to establish  relations with the world community, which wants a partner to  have a proper image. Cuban leaders have not drawn proper  conclusions from the events in East Europe, such observers  believe. In the design of its initiators, portable capitalism  here should serve only as salvation straw during hard times, and  then help to resurrect socialism. With all relevant consequences  for the same gullible investors.    Cuban reformers, however, have their own interpretation of  change. And they want to be understood correctly. They believe  that what stood in the way until now is an almost complete  information blockade regarding today's Cuba. ""The Soviet Union  lost Cuba, and Russia has not yet discovered it,"" said the  republic's Consul General Felix Leon Carballo at a meeting with  St. Petersburg journalists. For the third year now, the little  country is learning how to live under the conditions of the  harshest economic crisis in its history, having lost overnight  almost all of its trading partners, 85 percent of whom had been  allies from the former socialist camp. They have to economize on  everything. Nevertheless, problems are gradually being resolved.  Exports--the main source of income--are growing; increasingly  more companies invest capital in Cuban industry. By the  beginning of this year, more than 5,000 representative foreign  companies and 112 joint ventures were operating in the country.  Twenty-eight of them are busy developing the tourism industry.  Trips to the exotic island are relatively cheap and are in  demand. Among investors in a variety of economic sectors are  countries of West Europe, North and South America, and the  Caribbean. China is showing an interest in cooperation. All of  this is not accidental. The Cuban Government provided the  necessary guarantees for free movement of capital; associations  have been given the right to distribute property; they are  exempt from taxes on gross income and only pay 30 percent of the  net profit.    Russia so far is absent in this popular new market, however.  It also has neglected the old one: Equipment rusts without spare  parts; unfinished Soviet enterprises under construction turn to  dust; billions worth of investment in the former Cuban economy  are going to waste, while additional potential market for idling  Russian enterprises is being lost. Only late last year were  several intergovernment agreements signed on trade and  scientific-technical cooperation. But the axiom ""better late  than never"" does not apply here. In economics, late most often  means never. Competition does not wait. And even these few  agreements remain on paper. Trips of Russian commercial  Columbuses do not materialize. The same goes for a tentative  partnership with the governments of St. Petersburg and oblast.  No one disagrees that there are good prospects in cooperation  and mutually profitable exchange in the area of developing  tourism, the sugar industry, and production of high- quality  medications for which Cuban specialists have always been famous,  and other projects--but this is where it ends.    One of the possible reasons is the shadows of ideological  prejudice, which manifest themselves one way or the other in the  debates on the substance of changes in Cuba. Whatever they are,  however, commercial and merely vital interests of the people  have their own logic, which will put everything in its proper  place.     "

According to AEC President Carlos  Martinez Salsamendi, this will be Cuba's door to its  incorporation into the international economy.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the official  underlined the Caribbean market's importance for his country,  which enjoys comparative advantages in the subregion in the  fields of industrial development, health, and even tourism. He  said that Cuba exports cement, salt, construction materials, and  technical services of various types to the Caribbean. With the  incorporation of Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela into the AEC,  Cuba will be able to export oil, minerals, raw materials, and  commercial services to these countries also. From Guyana, Cuba  buys minerals and lumber.    Salsamendi said that five years ago the 13 Caribbean Common  Market [Caricom] countries regarded Cuba as a potential  competitor in tourism and for supplies of some traditional  Caribbean exports. Cuba is now considered a complementary  economy, even regarding tourism. There are travel packages that  include Jamaica and Cuba, as well as Mexico and Cuba in the same  packages. In addition, air and sea travel agreements have been  established to improve tourism development in the area. This  improved relationship includes a growing interest in Caribbean  business meetings and the Caribbean Exposition, which have been  held since 1993 and 1992, respectively. These events are  sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce.    This year, the events will precede the signing of the AEC  Charter by the heads of government. The second meeting of  Caribbean businessmen will be held in Santiago de Cuba on 27 and  28 June. Expocaribe '94 will be held in this same city in Cuba's  eastern region from 28 June to 3 July.    In the 1993 exposition, Expocaribe gathered 11 companies  from  nine countries. Presently, 15 countries and 32 firms have been  registered for this year's exposition, the Chamber of Commerce  president has reported.    The exposition grounds are small and, consequently, we have  had to keep the number of participants low, Salsamendi said.  Cuba will be represented by 195 enterprises, all of them  established in the five easternmost provinces of the island.  These provinces are destined to lead in trade and relations  with Cuba's southern neighbors.    Representatives from outside of the region, including  executives from Canada, France, and Spain, have also confirmed  their participation in the businessmen's meeting. The meeting  will include a discussion of Cuba's commercial policy toward the  Caribbean. There will also be a discussion of business  opportunities in each of the five eastern provinces of Cuba.  For this discussion, a catalog has been prepared showing the  idle industrial potential of this region of the island.    Local industrial potential includes the poligraphic  industry,  and nickel, copper, chromium, iron, and manganese mining. There  is an abundance of reserves of these minerals in Cuba's eastern  region.    The meeting will also discuss the Cuban economy and its  prospects, as well as the possibilities for foreign investments  in the country. Salsamendi explained that the new opening to  foreign capital has brought to the Chamber of Commerce host  province increasing activities. Because of these increasing  activities, the Chamber of Commerce will have to open two  subsidiary sites this year. One of these sites will be in  Santiago de Cuba and the other will be in Matanzas.    All commercial delegations and investors go through the  Chamber of Commerce. So far this year, the number of foreign  businessmen who have dealt with the Chamber of Commerce exceeds  the number of foreign businessmen who did business with the  Chamber of Commerce in 1993. This year, the Chamber has handled  the creation of one combined enterprise or economic association  every week, which is twice the amount of last year.    According to the Chamber of Commerce president, foreign  capital investments have been increasing, not only in oil  prospecting and exploitation -- a sector in which Total of  France, Sherrit of Canada, and Taurus of Sweden, among others,  with their Cuban counterpart Cupet, participate -- but also in  the nickel industry, by Inco of Canada; in cement, by Cemex of  Mexico; and in the telephone industry, by Domos International.  In the area of cosmetics and perfumes, the most recent  association agreement was signed with Unilever of Great Britain,  one of the world's leading companies in this industry.    According to Salsamendi, Cuba conducts its trade according  to  market economy rules after three decades of operating with a  long-term system of commercial agreements and equitable prices,  which was used in the old Socialist field.    He said that Cuba is not yet prepared, but it is learning to  negotiate without maladjustments, and it is maintaining the  social equity principle.     "

No, it is not a question of easing, even slightly,  pressure exerted on Cuba or of improving relations between  Washington and Havana. It is only a measure that seeks to  minimize the violation of U.S. citizens rights by prohibiting  visits to other countries, in this case Cuba. As is well known,  measures adopted by the U.S. Government to exert pressure and  cause economic damage to the Cuban economy include the  enforcement of severe sanctions on U.S. citizens who travel to  Cuba in defiance of these restrictions. Obviously, the reported  attenuation of those restrictions does not include those who  want to travel to the Pearl of the Antilles as a tourist because  that would represent income in dollars to the Cuban tourism  industry.    Cuban specialists on international relations believe the  elimination of certain travel restrictions to Cuba and the  expedition of possible information exchanges are part of a  system designed to influence the Cuban civilian society and  increase its political influence on the island, as was done in  Eastern Europe. Others believe that, far from contributing to  the improvement of relations between the United States and Cuba,  its real purpose is to weaken Cuba's conclusive arguments before  international organizations, where it has stated the travel  restrictions imposed on U.S. citizens who wish to travel to  other countries for personal reasons are a violation of their  human rights.    Cuba cannot be accused of extreme mistrust because it has  only experienced all kinds of aggression from the United States  for more than 30 years. Besides, Washington officials have made  it clear they are not interested in making any policy changes  towards Cuba as long as Cuba does not adopt changes to resemble  the so-called representative democracies that follow the U.S.  model throughout the world. Cuba has repeatedly stated it will  not tolerate this blatant interference in its internal affairs,  and it cannot accept conditions to establish and maintain  diplomatic relations, or other types of relations, with another  sovereign state.    If the United States eliminates or reduces restrictions on  its citizens so they may travel to Cuba, even with the provision  that they do not to contribute in any way to the Cuban economy,  this would be another step towards reason and wisdom. Cuba has  many friends in the United States and has always been happy to  receive visitors from all nations, whether they sympathize with  Cuba or not, if they want first-hand knowledge of the real Cuban  situation. The Cuban Revolution has always been able to  differentiate between government and people, as far as the  United States is concerned, and Cubans have always felt respect  and sympathy for the U.S. people.

The agreement was initialled on Wednesday by Britain's trade and technology minister, Mr Ian Taylor. Mr Taylor yesterday referred to Cuba as 'a very exciting market' at the end of a three-day visit, the first by a British minister to the island in almost 20 years. 'Clearly, the potential here is very considerable,' Mr Taylor said. 'The agreement will give confidence that Cuba is a market with which British businesses can deal.' He had led a British business delegation in talks on investment opportunities in air transport, construction, Cuba's sugar sector and insurance. Mr Taylor, clearly distancing British government policy from the US trade and financial embargo against the island, underlined the fact that Britain had never cut its trade links with Cuba. British exports for the first half of this year were up 180 per cent over last year. The 1993 export total was Pounds 14m, which was 50 per cent down from 1992. But he said many British companies had found it difficult to do business in the past because of Cuba's centrally-managed and highly regulated state economy. Cuba was moving to reform its economy to adapt to world trading conditions after the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main trading partner. 'I made it clear that British companies would find dealing with Cuba easier the further the reform process goes,' said Mr Taylor, who had talks with President Fidel Castro. He said that while Cuban reforms were at an early stage, he was assured by Mr Castro they would continue. He noted that British companies were already operating in Cuba in oil exploration and oil services, agrochemicals, lubricants, soap and detergent manufacture, citrus, financial services and the sugar industry.

0,FT942-3162 ,"FT942-3162 _AN-EFPDDABOFT 940616   FT  16 JUN 94 / Mexico venture set to get Cuba on the line: Part-purchase of island's telephone monopoly may be first in wave of investment - A look at a foreign project that at first sight seems improbable      By TED BARDACKE   Foreign participation in the privatisation of the Cuban telephone system appears to be the most improbable of ventures. The country cannot receive remittances from its biggest long-distance market, the US. The local currency is not convertible. The telephone network, largely untouched since the 1959 communist revolution, is rapidly deteriorating. And the privatised company may be subject to compensation claims dating back to nationalisation. But Mexico's Grupo Domos, which will spend nearly Dollars 1.5bn over the next several years to purchase 49 per cent of Cuba's telephone monopoly, EmtelCuba, and to modernise the island's telecommunications infrastructure, believes it has structured the contract in a way that is 'viable financially, politically, and legally'. If it is right, the move, by simultaneously improving business services and setting a precedent for long-term private investment in Cuba, could set off a wave of foreign investment. The big price tag for the company, which had some US telephone company executives gasping in disbelief, is not quite as large as it seems. Domos will pay out about Dollars 500m for its share in the company, as much as half of which is expected to come from a foreign partner with telecommunications technology that the British investment bank Rothschild believes it has lined up. Another Dollars 200m in long-term preferential-rate financing will be obtained in a swap deal liquidating the Cuban government's outstanding debt with Mexico. The remaining Dollars 800m, half of which the Cuban government will have to put up, will be invested over a seven-year period in an ambitious modernisation programme. The plan calls for a three-fold expansion in the network's penetration to 1m working phone lines. As part of the arrangement, EmtelCuba has received a 55-year monopoly concession on local and long-distance service as well as data and image transmission. Still, Domos's ability to recuperate its investment depends on two uncertain things: a change in US policy towards telephone communications with Cuba and the convertibility of the Cuban peso. Currently all transmission charges due to Cuba for telephone traffic with the US go into an escrow account held for potential legal claims against Cuba. For this reason Cuba limits direct calls from the US to 300 a day and all other calls between the two countries get routed through third-party nations. However, while tightening the US blockage of Cuba in most other ways, a 1992 law authorises the US Federal Communications Commission to increase communications links between the two countries and the US Treasury to allow dollar payments to Cuba for telephone calls. As a result of that change, WilTel International, a large long-distance carrier in the US, signed an agreement in March with EmtelCuba to build a fibre optic line from the tip of Florida to a point near Havana. The deal and the mechanism to remit payment to Cuba are awaiting White House approval, but the concept has been agreed to in principle, according to WilTel executives. WilTel estimates that in 1991 60m call attempts were made from the US to Cuba and that, in the first year of liberalisation of telephone services, between 25m and 50m minutes of calls would be handled. EmtelCuba would be entitled to about 60 cents per minute plus a surcharge of about Dollars 3 per collect call made from Cuba to the US. Domos says that its contracts allow it to pull out of the deal if the FCC and the US Treasury decide not to allow dollars to be transferred to Cuba and say a convertibility scheme for the Cuban peso has been worked out with the Cuban government, but will not offer details. The prospect of change in policies by a post-Castro government does not worry Domos. 'A new Cuban government will not be more to the left than the current one. It will have to be more capitalist,' says Pedro Sepulveda of Domos. Domos also discounts the question of compensation claims, arguing that the infrastructure is practically worthless while no new investment could be subject to such a claim. Yet others are not so confident. 'If you buy anything Castro nationalised then you are buying into a potentially dangerous logic,' says on telephone executive who has regular dealings with Cuba, 'because by purchasing something from his government you are validating the right of confiscation. If it was OK for Castro to confiscate and then privatise, wouldn't it be OK for a new government to do the same thing?' Claims by US citizens on property in Cuba, including EmtelCuba, are almost certain as part of any move by the US to life the blockade, according to Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard professor at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. Yet Prof Dominguez is optimistic the deal can work because Cuba needs to modernise its telephone system to bring its economy up to a functioning level. 'This is very different from other private investments in Cuba . . . because it is a long-term project, it will have an innumerable multiplier effect on the economy and shows the openness of the Cuban government to privatisation,' he says.

Havana Asset Management, a new subsidiary of Beta Funds International, will manage the planned Cuba investment fund, which is expected to be established early next year. Mr Peter Scott, Beta's chief executive, said its expected areas of investment included hotels and tourism, mining, food and beverages, the high-tech pharmaceutical sector and specialised manufacturing. It would invest in new joint venture companies, existing Cuban companies and foreign companies with a significant exposure to Cuba. Beta specialises in spotting new markets and pioneered the creation of investment management companies in Vietnam and Poland. It has more than Dollars 230m invested in emerging markets. The Cuban government has opened up sectors of the economy to foreign investors. It has signed more than 100 new trade and investment deals, from oil exploration and mining to cosmetics and textiles. Mr Scott said the Cuba fund had aroused interested in the UK, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Spain, Italy and Mexico. Besides Beta, the other shareholders in Havana Asset Management are Nueva Compania de Indias, a Spanish trading company operating in Cuba, and James Miura, of Ninecastle Overseas, a UK investment management company. Mr Scott said Cuba had provided legal safeguards for foreign investors by signing investment promotion and protection agreements with a number of countries, including the UK. Mr Scott said the fund's articles would not permit the participation of investors from the US, whose government maintains a trade and financial embargo against Cuba.

Speaking in Jamaica at the weekend, he said the switch away from dependence on the leadership of one person - a situation that has existed for the past 34 years - was part of the political and economic changes being implemented by President Fidel Castro's administration. The changes would mean that the country's future would not depend on a new person appearing to succeed President Castro, but on a strong collective leadership. Mr Robaina, who is making official visits to several of Cuba's neighbours, is himself reported to be favoured by Mr Castro to play a prominent role in the island's political leadership, and could be the next president. Earlier this year President Castro said he hoped it would not be 'necessary' for him to be president when his current term expired in five years. 'Fidel has been urging this change for a long time,' Mr Robaina said. 'There are now many of the younger generation involved in this leadership project.' The minister gave no details of how the collective form of government would work, nor who would be involved. Diplomats in Havana said yesterday that the plan to move away from strong individual leadership was an attempt by President Castro to forestall any internecine fights among aspiring successors. The government, which has been seeking private foreign investment in Cuba's embattled economy has introduced several economic changes in the past six months, allowing private and co-operative farms and permitting Cubans to hold and use foreign currency. Mr Robaina denied the changes were the result of US pressure. 'My country is suffering not only from the economic blockade by the US but also from the collapse of its economic relationship with the former Soviet Union,' he said. 'In a changing world it is necessary for everyone to find his own way. Cuba is inserting itself into the world economy and not just trying to settle its relations with the US.' Cuba was willing to discuss the economic embargo with the US, but would do so on the basis of 'mutual respect' and without preconditions, he said. 'We have always been in a position to talk and the only condition which we have strongly stated is mutual respect,' he said.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

Entwistle, the  Canadian ambassador to Cuba, said today that his country's  businessmen will increase their investments in Cuba. He also  reexpressed his government's opposition to the U.S. blockade of  the island.    During an interview given to GRANMA newspaper, Entwistle  said  commerce is the most active sector in the relations between the  two nations because the Canadian private sector is showing  growing interest in the economic opportunities offered by Cuba.    Canadian businessmen are beginning to observe growth  potential in the Cuban economy in areas such as tourism, mining,  and oil. In some of these areas, Canadian businessmen are  already participating, and in others, the investment prospects  are very interesting, he said.    The ambassador observed that Cuba occupies fifth place in  his  country's commercial relations with Latin America as trade with  Cuba amounted to $370 million in 1992, and shows a tendency to  grow.    Canadian businessmen foresee Cuba possibly being a bridge  between South America and the Caribbean and estimate that  possible associations with the Cubans will project them into the  future, Entwistle added.    The ambassador also ratified his country's disapproval of  the  U.S. blockade against Cuba and asserted that U.S. attempts to  have third countries implement this policy are not being  accepted.    It is very simple, he said; the United States has a policy  on  Cuba, and Canada has its own policy on Cuba.    For Canada, he added, from our political perspective, Cuba's  isolation is harmful. Our interest is to contribute to creating  a climate that will allow for improved relations between the  countries in the hemisphere.     "

In Cuba's case, it  becomes a matter of top priority to get the most from what is  available, which generally speaking when dealing with the  economy is not much.    State Committee for Finance (CEF) authorities, when  explaining the complexity of this field, pointed out that Cuba  has had a formal budget for many years. It distributed what was  available and obtained through stable economic and international  trade relations, which Cuba maintained with the socialist field,  especially the Soviet Union.    This mechanism began to run into difficulties while at the  same time others did not keep their agreements, and trade rules  and values were changed; consequently the Cuban economy began to  collapse forcing changes, adjustments, and unprecedented  measures, mostly economic in nature.    With the new conditions, it is very clear that Cuba cannot  spend income it does not have, especially since most of its  international credit sources are blocked by the economic, trade,  and financial blockade imposed and advocated by the United  States.    More than 50 percent of Cuba's general income budget comes  from the state sector, the rest comes from nonstate entities and  what is collected by the population; a ratio that could be  proportionally modified according to increased joint ventures  and self-employed workers' activities, which in turn are subject  to taxes.    Basic state expenses have been aimed at enterprises,  described here as budgeted (completely state controlled),  business activities (that is partly self-financed), and other  investments.    In the first group, which many times the state assumes  without properly figuring the cost, are enterprises that  guarantee social security, an expenditure that in 1993 amounted  to 1.5 billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official  exchange rate). Education, public health, and other basic  sectors for citizens are fundamental and respond to the nature  of the Cuban social system, but at the same time are high  resource consumers.    The population has discussed these topics in depth the past  few weeks. The assemblies convened by the Cuban union movement,  called ""Workers' Parliaments,"" have no doubts about free  schooling and medical assistance among the other things that  Cuban society is already used to.    Nevertheless, the reality has begun to sink into the  mentality of the average Cuban who is used to watching sports  competitions for free, which caused more than headaches during  the organization of the Central American and Pan-American Games;  or the reality of free, complex, and costly surgical operations,  such as aesthetic surgery, for no clinical or humanitarian  reason.    Expenditures which the state has mostly paid, like science  and technology, sports, art and culture, have begun to be  considered as important ways of generating resources and are  rapidly becoming not only self-financed, but considered to be  revenue earners.    Expensive Enterprises    Cuba puts the most emphasis on the business sector to  achieve  increased efficiency and productivity to stem the economic  deterioration caused by the new realities, which the condemned  Torricelli Law plays no small role through increased harassment.    A high-ranking CEF official told this journalist that to  reverse the current situation, state subsidies for losses by the  state enterprises need to be reduced to a minimum. This past  year, the sugar and agricultural sectors were the worst, needing  more than 4 billion pesos.    Generally speaking, it has been said that 69 percent of  Cuban  productive businesses receive subsidies, therefore, only 31 of  100 enterprises contribute to the state budget.    Therefore, it is not enough to reduce investments -- a  development mortgage -- to effectively stop the budget deficit.    Steps    The measures that have already begun to be applied with  little publicity but with significant effect are aimed at  decentralizing even further the administration of what has been  budgeted by the state with a spending limit for certain  financial allotments to prevent excesses (in salaries, for  example, to avoid arbitrary job creations).    Likewise, the idea is for greater financial resource  disbursement freedom and to make them more productive while not  deviating from the general plan of overall economy development.    The course that is being followed contributes greater  flexibility to budget activities so as to increase  self-financing without forgetting to see that assigned funds are  being used as they were intended. Therefore, each part of the  economic puzzle should fit properly in the Cuban social pattern.    A complex struggle is taking place, and it must be won in  order for Cuba's social income-expenditures to balance in an  unbalanced world. Achieving this will guarantee future, stable,  and harmonious development, which will allow one to remember the  current special period Cuba is facing as the feverish state a  body feels from the effects of a vaccine intended to save it  from serious illness.

At a conference for Higher Education Ministry officials,  Rodriguez said Cuba has an ample level of certitude on imports,  exports, and other resources, in addition to its economic  planning system. He estimated that the changes introduced in  the Cuban economy can be slow according to the people's needs  but not according to the possibilities of the island.    Among the economic measures implemented since last August,  Rodriguez mentioned the depenalization of the dollar, the  opening to foreign investments, and the increase of tasks  authorized for self-employment.    The Cuban finance minister said 1994 will be better than  1993  for Cuba from the economic standpoint, ""as it will break the  violent economic fall suffered from 1989 to 1993.""    He based his assertion on the possibilities of having a  cheaper sugarcane harvest, the recovery of sugar and nickel  prices--two of the country's main economic sectors--and getting  tourism to grow 25 percent.    Other factors that will mark this year in the Cuba economy,  according to the specialist, will be the substitution of  imports, the discovery of new oil deposits, the recovery of  fuel, and an increase -- although not an extraordinary one -- in  agricultural production.

The president stressed that the measures proposed by the  National Assembly of the People's Government to cleanse the  country's economy defend the spirit of socialism without  disregarding the reality of a world that is in the hands of  multinationals.    Appealing to the people's understanding on the need to adopt  these measures promptly, the president insisted on the  advantages of this action over the neoliberal recipes which, he  asserted, have caused crises in various countries, particularly  in the social area.    Fidel Castro called for a broad dissemination of all topics  discussed at the parliament, in search of the broadest popular  support. In this regard, he highlighted the earlier speech by  Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon, who recalled what is the  fate proposed for the island from Miami. He added that  well-to-do and large landowners, whose properties were  expropriated by the 1959 revolution, want to return from Miami  to claim their former properties and privileges.    The Cuban president noted the need to act perfectly and  quickly, while guaranteeing not only the recovery of excess  circulating currency but also a progressive improvement of the  economic situation to insure that disequilibrium is not  reproduced.    Fidel Castro affirmed the measures will be gradual but ""will  not be left unimplemented."" He termed the parliament's final  resolution ""broad and flexible,"" which will permit the  government to act to correct disequilibrium and its causes.    According to official figures from this Assembly, Cuba is  facing a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos (equal to dollars  at the official Cuban exchange rate) and an excess of  circulating currency estimated at 11.636 billion pesos. These  indicators are considered one of the main obstacles on the path  to economic recovery.     "

In an interview published this Sunday by the government  weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE, Martinez said the island's authorities  must find solutions in a capitalist market ruled by  monetary-commercial laws.    The publication of this interview coincides with a special  Assembly session during which Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and  prices minister, outlined a strict adjustment program which, he  insisted, is not a neoliberal shock plan.    The Assembly member said the search for efficiency in the  island's economy is ""a matter of life or death"", with only 31  percent of the enterprises producing an income, according to  official figures.    The official added that 1994 continues to be difficult for  the Cuban economy, but the first signs of long-term recovery are  being seen.    Martinez said tourism represents the first positive aspect  of  the Caribbean country's economic activities, with a growth rate  of 30 percent per year; and, according to government sources, it  will surpass the sugar industry as the country's main source of  income.    The National Assembly leader said that increased production  of domestic oil, with its high sulfur content, is expected to  exceed last year's 1.1 billion tons in 1994.    The exploitation of new forms of state-owned lands, where  former employees now organized in cooperatives have the right to  use the land, has resulted in an increase in the production of  food, he said.    The state has a monopoly on the marketing of new  cooperatives  that have replaced inefficient state-owned farms that were  operated by agricultural workers for a salary.    According to Martinez, the measures adopted by the  government  to put its internal finances on a sound basis will have positive  effects in the near future, although its essential effects will  need no less than a year and a half to mature.    Martinez said Cuba will leave the crisis behind by the end  of  the century ""by resuming the economic growth process but also by  achieving a different economy -- qualitatively speaking.""    It must be an economy in which we have a strong state sector  that sets guidelines and operates more through decentralized  mechanisms in which economic considerations play a more  important role than administrative considerations, he explained.    The legislator said that plans for this model will involve a  much more important role for the market and a strong presence of  foreign capital, which Cuba has encouraged since the  disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European  socialist bloc.    In Martinez' opinion, these changes do not alter the  essential basis of Cuban society, which is compelled to forge  ahead in a world ruled by capitalism.    The economy will still be socialist, which means that  political decisions will be made by the central government and  that politics will rule the economy, meaning it will be  subordinate and aimed at achieving the goals of socialism,  Martinez said.

The thermoelectric plants in  Santa Cruz del Norte and Mariel in the western part of the  country, and Rente in Santiago de Cuba were manufactured by the  Soviet Union, while the Nuevitas thermoelectric plant, which has  a generation capacity of 550 mw, was built in Czechoslovakia.    Electric Union officials said Cuba has not received any  spare  parts for these plants since 1990, and only since May 1993 has  the country has been able to maintain a certain level of spare  parts for programmed maintenance operations and repair of  unexpected breakdowns.    Right now, from that total generation capacity, 570 mw are  affected by the plants' maintenance problems, 821 mw by  breakdowns, and 372 mw by generation limitations -- the  equipment operating at lower capacity.    Some spare parts and other meterials necessary for a  maintenance program are already in the country, while others are  about to be acquired. These spare parts will allow recovery of  the generation capacity of these plants.    Despite our economic limitations, the country has provided  the necessary resources to make this inevitable investment, in  an effort to solve the current problems as soon as possible. The  lengthy power cuts will begin a gradual reduction process  throughout the country, to the extent that the maintenance  programs required by these plants are fulfilled.     "

This was stated by  Politburo member Carlos Lage during a visit to Ciego de Avila.  [Words indistinct] has demonstrated its capability to resist and  its conviction to maintain the principles of socialism.    [Being Lage recording] I believe that the perspectives have  to be seen not only in the context of one year but in the next  few years. I believe the country has all the possibilities so  that [words indistinct] begin and develop in the next few years.  It will be -- I would add -- a slow recovery. It will be a step  by step recovery.    The difficulties are great and the resource limitations are  severe and will continue in 1994. The resources for 1994 are  closely tied to the result of the last harvest, which was 4.27  million tons of sugar, and these resources seriously affect the  preparation of the resources with which the economy has to  operate in 1994. Therefore, we have to be aware that this is  also going to be a very difficult year, a year filled with many  difficulties. However, we think that this year certain  activities of the economy might begin to experience a better  situation.    Of course, in the conditions our country lives, we have to  to  make all these projections keeping in mind that there are  factors we cannot control, which are not dependent on our  possibilities. After losing our highly stable foreign economic  relations, we are dependent on sugar and oil world market  prices. The conditions of the blockade give our economy very few  opportunities to protect itself from price factors.    Keeping in mind the conditions in which we are beginning  this  year, we believe that certain activities might begin to recover,  such as the sugar industry. I believe that we will overcome the  special period being more efficient, more aware of the  conservation of resources, and with more rationality. [end  recording]     "

The topic of the discussion is: What country do we live in  today? Rodriguez and Sexto point out that Cuba is overcoming the  economic crisis. Although there are pessimists who believe that  all is lost, Sexto points out that Cuba is poised on the runway,  ready for takeoff.    Rodriguez focuses on two words used by Sexto in his  arguments: ignorance and pessimism. Rodriguez says that those  who cannot see the progress are more ignorant than pessimistic.  He believes that many people will have to see progress in their  own homes before they can believe.    Sexto points out that Cuba has developed its infrastructure  during the past 30 years. He says: ""Nowadays there is a trend  toward denying all that has been accomplished in Cuba during the  past 30 years. In other words, we are in these circumstances and  what we did in the past is no longer good. Of course, they do  not realize that external factors are greatly influencing the  internal reality of Cuba.""    Sexto goes on to say that there are many signs of recovery:  ""Every time a factory goes into operation, Cuba advances a  millimeter down the runway for its takeoff. A few months back,  we put the cardboard factory in Santa Cruz del Norte into  operation. That is good news. We believe the current sugar  harvest will be a bit better than the past harvest. If we  produce 1,000 tons more, than we will have grown another  millimeter in our situation. We will have produced more than  last year.""    Rodriguez points out that there have been other  achievements:  ""Now that you are talking about accomplishments, I should remind  you that in the first quarter 305,000 tons of oil were extracted  from Cuban soil. This represents a 12-percent growth in relation  to the goal for that quarter. It also represents an increase in  comparison to last year.""    Regarding this, Sexto replies: ""That is a record high  figure.  In other words, during the month of January, oil workers worked  very hard. There are some who say that no one works in this  country. Nevertheless, the oil workers have rejected that  superficial and incomplete vision that is circulating.""    With regard to the tobacco, pharmaceuticals, and oil  industries, Sexto points out: ""In the past, the tobacco crops  suffered some deterioration. I believe there has been a recovery  in this area. This year we have had a good harvest.    ""I also understand that the income from biotechnological and  biopharmaceutical products is increasing. We also know that our  nickel is selling well. It is even being marketed, if I am not  mistaken, in more than 20 countries and its price has increased.    ""As you mentioned just seconds ago, oil extraction has  increased. The possibility of finding better oil and in greater  quantities may not be an off-the-wall possibility. It may be a  very serious possibility. Some people have said that those are  real possibilities. In other words, we have foreign companies  which have invested a large sum of money in this country and I  believe that no one invests money blindly and foolishly. I  believe there must be a certainty, a certain guarantee that what  is being invested will not be lost.""    Regarding the economy and public opinion, Sexto says: ""There  is a poll that indicates that 65 percent of the those questioned  believe that with the gradual application of measures that will  be adopted in the next few months, our economy will benefit.""    Rodriguez remarks: ""That same survey points out that only  1.4  percent of those questioned believe that there is no need for  measures.""    Sexto concludes by saying: ""That 65 percent believes that  the  economic measures that will be adopted in the next few months  will gradually help improve the country indicates that there is  a tendency toward optimism. Workers truly trust in the strategy  that our country has followed to overcome this difficult  situation."" ""Straight Talk"" ends at 1615 GMT.     "

In a two-hour meeting with representatives,  delegates, tour operators, and reporters attending the Cuba-94  tourism convention, President Castro answered more than a dozen  questions.    He said anything that has an impact on the economy is very  important to the country, that tourism is one of the areas with  the greatest impact, and that it is growing at a rate of almost  30 percent yearly. He added that because Cuba has tourist  potential, and especially because there is willingness to keep  it growing, tourism is considered a priority.    The blockade was also among the issues discussed at the  meeting with delegates, tour operators, and reporters from the  tourism convention. On this matter, the commander in chief said  President Clinton is maintaining his severity, but in a softer  manner and with less threatening, less bellicose words. He said,  however, that the severity of U.S. policy toward Cuba has not  changed. It remains the same.    Concerning foreign investments in the country, Fidel Castro  said the opening will be increasingly broader and that it is  perfectly conceivable because the objective is to attain the  means to develop the country.    When asked about how a socialist system can coexist with the  flow of foreign capital, Castro said that Cuba neither will give  up socialism nor defraud those who want to contribute to the  development of this and other fields, such as petroleum  exploration and exploitation.    Concerning the desired image for Cuba, Castro said he wants  to convey the image of a beautiful country with natural  conditions; a hospitable and sound nation; a well-organized,  drug-free country with a warm climate and a high culture that  protects the environment.    The 15th tourism convention gathered 971 delegates from 26  European and American countries and representatives from Algiers  and the Arab world. In this convention, Cuba has signed several  contracts for the next winter and summer seasons.     "

Even though 1994 will be very difficult, very trying, we  trust that certain activities will improve during the year,  added Lage--who is also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba  Political Bureau--in statements to the national television news.    He said the availability of resources is directly related to  the 1992-1993 sugar harvest, when production was approximately  two million metric tons less than estimated, resulting in lost  revenues of more than $450 million.    He admitted, however, that the Cuban economy has a very slim  chance of protecting itself against the negative repercussions  resulting from external factors, such as the reinforced U.S.  economic, financial, and commercial blockade against the island.    Lage's statements were made in the central eastern Province  of Ciego de Avila, where he said the recovery of the sugar  industry constitutes an indispensable condition to surpass the  current Cuban economic crisis.

0,FT943-9880 ,"FT943-9880 _AN-EHIE8ABGFT 940809   FT  09 AUG 94 / Income tax for Cubans next year      By CANUTE JAMES and REUTER      KINGSTON, MIAMI   Cuba will impose taxes on property and income at the start of next year as part of a government effort to cut the budget deficit, ease pressure on the peso and shore up the troubled economy. The taxes, the first of their kind since the revolution 35 years ago, will be levied first on the self-employed and on Cubans who earn from foreign sources. The legislation, passed at the weekend by the National Assembly, includes provisions for taxes on salaried workers when the economy improves. The legislation also imposes taxes on a range of property and on some services. The rates will be announced in the next three months. Their imposition of the taxes is the Cuban government's response to a widening budget deficit, which reached 4bn Cuban pesos (Pounds 2.5bn at the official exchange rate) last year. It also wants to mop up much of the 11.75bn pesos in circulation, which officials say has contributed to a depreciation of the currency on the unofficial market. The government announced a 50 per cent cut in the armed forces' budget this year, saying the military should cost the country 'as little as possible'. For the past two months Cubans have been paying higher prices for a range of consumer goods and public transportation. Cigarette prices rose by an average of 600 per cent while alcohol prices were doubled. The cost of air and sea travel was also increased. Last week police clashed with demonstrators protesting over the price rises in Havana's port area after what diplomats describe as a perceptible rise in political tension in the capital. Cuban newspapers said 35 people, including 10 policemen, were injured. Cuba's economy has been thrown off course by the collapse of the Soviet Union, which was the Caribbean island's main trading partner, the failure of last year's sugar harvest and a significant cut in foreign earnings. Fuel, food and medicines have been in short supply, power cuts are frequent and lines of ration card holders have been growing. US Coast Guard ships picked up 230 Cuban refugees in the seas between Cuba and Florida over the weekend, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Miami. The people, on makeshift boats and rafts, left Cuba amid reports of unrest after three ferryboats were hijacked in nine days by Cubans hoping to reach the US.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

Lage said this opening is one of the paths that the Cuban  Government must try in an effort to pay off its debts. The  official said Cuba could pay what it owes Venezuela,  approximately $47 million, through investments by Venezuelan  businessmen.    Cuba's debt problem can be traced back to the agreement  signed between Venezuela and Russia in 1986. Under that  agreement, Russia committed itself to supplying oil to Germany  (a client of Venezuela), and, in exchange, Venezuela supplied  oil to Cuba. In 1991, the Caribbean island found itself in the  position of having to pay for Venezuelan oil deliveries in cash  in line with demands made by the Venezuelan Government. Cuba,  however, was unable to meet the requirements.    With a view to establishing trade relations that would allow  the island to pay off its debt, the Cuban vice president showed  special interest in activities related to tourism, because he  believes this sector could ultimately attract Venezuelan  investments. Lage also believes that Venezuela has more tourist  experience than Cuba. Cuba wants to learn from other Latin  American countries, avoid environmental problems, and create a  modern infrastructure.    The meeting held at FIV headquarters was attended by Cuban  Ambassador Norberto Hernandez; Gonzalo Garcia Bustillo,  Venezuela's diplomatic representative to Cuba; and Carlos  Sequera Yepez, former president of the Venezuelan Federation of  Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry.    Although it is gratifying to know that the representative of  a nearby country considers Venezuela's experience to be a  reference point for establishing its own framework for  development, the FIV's record in attracting foreign investments  has been scant in recent years. We have to give time to the new  FIV administration headed by Abdon Vivas Teran to determine  whether we will see the fruits of the privatization of hotels  and the channeling of multilateral financial support aimed at  turning tourism and the services industry into a source of  economic development.

Apart from signing a cooperation agreement  on economy and trade with Indonesia, Foreign Minister Robaina  also briefed Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas on his  country's problems.    It can be said that the Republic of Cuba is one of the five  communist regimes left in the world. Situated in close proximity  to the United States, the regime under Fidel Castro's  leadership, has been under the U.S. economic blockade for almost  three decades. The Republic of Cuba has withstood the stringent  economic blockade all this while. Undeniably, Cuba was able to  weather the blockade due to the Soviet Union's huge subsidies.    Apparently, subsidies to Cuba terminated with the collapse  of  the Soviet Union. Cuba's economic situation was unquestionably  threatened due to the termination of the subsidies. Moreover,  observers believe that Fidel Castro's days are numbered due to  this reality.    That is the reason for Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's  visit to several Asian nations -- Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia,  Myanmar [Burma], India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's diplomatic tour is aimed  entirely at mustering sympathy and clarifying Cuba's economic  situation. Cuba considers the U.S. economic blockade as totally  unjust.    Indonesia, which has close relations with Cuba, is currently  interested in further upgrading its economic and trade relations  with Cuba, apart from further improving bilateral political ties.    As another developing country in the Nonaligned Movement,  Indonesia is showing its concern for Cuba. Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas stated strongly that Indonesia will never accept the  imposition of the philosophy or ideology of one country on  another.    He said: ""We have never accepted the blockade against Cuba.  Every country has the right to determine its own political  system."" The foreign minister also stated that Indonesia's basic  foreign policy provides for the right of one country to  determine its own destiny. That is why Indonesia will never  accept the United States' economic blockade against Cuba.    The blockade against Cuba should give rise to several  questions, considering the fact that the United States itself  experienced great resentment over Vietnam. In fact, the United  States lifted its economic embargo on Vietnam last month.    Why does the United states still want to carry on with such  a  practise -- the residual heritage of the Cold War, which lasted  for 34 years?    Looking at the historical perspective, the U.S.-Cuban  conflict reached its climax when the issue of Soviet SS-4 and  SS-5 missiles was brought to the fore. The United States then  announced its economic blockade against Cuba in 1962.  Presently, there are no more missiles in Cuba and the Soviet  Union has ceased to exist. Therefore, animosity should not exist  between the two countries anymore.    But according to a statement reported by Carlos Batista of  the INTERNATIONAL PRESS SERVICE, even though Cuba is not  considered as an offensive ""enemy,"" there are no indications  that Washington will not change its attitude toward this island  nation in the Carribean. Besides, John Shalikashvili, commander  of the U.S. Armed Forces, reiterated that the ""rival regime""  still exists in Havana -- the reason why the U.S. military will  always remain constantly on alert.    We are in no position to study the United States rationale  in  detail. Besides, it is our fervent hope that with the present  changes taking place, the United States will reconsider its  decision on the economic blockade against Cuba.    As a result of the conflict, the United States has to bear  the responsibility of accepting the flow of emigrants from  Havana. But Cuba considers the embargo as an ""incurable and  invisible disease which brings along destruction anywhere it  settles.""    According to analysts, the embargo has caused Cuba to suffer  an economic loss of about U.S. $40 billion -- more than five  times the amount of loans which Cuba has taken from the West.  The amount is also 20 times more than the total amount of  Cuba's imports.    Certainly, Cuba has blamed the United States for the  embargo,  which has caused its people to suffer. There are others who  share such an opinion, particularly after former U.S. President  George Bush intensified the blockade through what he termed the  Torricelli Laws.    It is possible that the U.S. decision to prolong the  blockade  against Cuba is probably due to the opposition by the  Miami-based Hispanic and conservative communities. In other  words, domestic politics have a role in the question of imposing  the economic blockade.    The United States will definitely stress -- as it has  clarified to the other developing nations -- that the decision  to lift the embargo will solely depend on Cuban leader Fidel  Castro's willingness to embark on reforms in his country.    But whatever the case may be, Indonesia will definitely  extend its support to Cuba. It is hoped that similar support  will be extended by the other Asian countries visited by Foreign  Minister Robaina.     "

In a firmly worded appeal against the ban on all trade,  diplomatic relations and other contacts, the pope said it hurt  only the Cuban nation's poorest.    Receiving the Cuban bishops for their five-yearly ad limina  visit to the Vatican, the pope also cited a document written by  them in September urging a national dialogue with the Cuban  Government to steer the country out of its present crisis. In  their document, the prelates urged a liberalisation of Cuba's  politics and economy and also demanded respect for religious and  civil liberties.    The document was published after insistent rumours that the  Cuban Government was seeking Vatican assistance to end the  embargo, offering concessions to local Catholics or even  permission for a papal visit in return.    In June, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina visited Rome  for talks with his Vatican counterpart, Jean-Louis Tauran, but  the Vatican later denied all speculation that he was pressing  for Vatican aid in stopping the embargo in exchange for a visit  that the Pope had said he was keen to make, but the Cuban  Government had previously termed ""premature.""    The Pope also cited a document approved by the Second  Vatican  Council asserting the church's right to go about its work among  the peoples and to pass moral judgement on political systems as  part of its mission to save souls and defend fundamental human  rights.    The Vatican never broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba  despite difficulties with government policy. When the bishops'  report was published last year, the Cuban Government accused the  Vatican of ""betrayal"" and ""counter-revolutionary action,"" later  complaining that the church had ignored warnings against  consequences should the report be made public.    Speaking to the bishops today, the pope reiterated his  desire  to visit Cuba and reported on the increasing strength of the  church there without directly mentioning the political situation.     "

The announcement late last month that Canada was easing a 16-year aid embargo, imposed in protest at Cuba's involvement in the Angolan civil war, is expected to speed the growing involvement of Canadian non-governmental organisations and universities in Cuba. Two Canadian universities for instance, have set up English-language training courses for Cubans. Ottawa has never joined Washington in imposing trade sanctions against Cuba. Air Canada, for example, has maintained a regular service to Havana, and Canadians have been among the largest groups of foreign tourists visiting Cuba. Two-way trade totalled CDollars 311m (Dollars 224m) last year. The Canadian business presence in Cuba is centred on mining, oil and gas exploration and tourism. Joutel Resources of Toronto last year became the first western mining company to sign an exploration agreement with Geominera, the Cuban mining agency. Last month, Sherritt, a Canadian nickel and cobalt producer, unveiled plans for a joint venture with Compania General de Niquel which will include mining and ore processing facilities in Cuba, and a refinery in Alberta. In addition, Canadian hotel operators have signed management contracts with more than half a dozen Cuban hotels. Companies will also benefit by being able to draw on funds from the Canadian International Development Agency (Cida) for feasibility studies. Canadian investors and joint-venture partners have generally found a warm welcome in Cuba. Dr Jim Henderson, a member of the Ontario provincial legislature who has taken a close interest in Cuba, says that 'the wheels can turn very quickly, provided it's a kind of business that Cuba has decided it wants.' The recent shift in Ottawa's policy towards Cuba are unlikely to have a profound impact either on Cuba's tottering economy or its relations with the outside world. However, they highlight a clear division between the US and some of its allies on the best way of halting the deterioration in social and economic conditions in the country. The Clinton administration has continued to apply, though without great enthusiasm, the comprehensive embargo imposed 30 years ago. Calls from the US business community, especially hotel operators, to ease the curbs have been offset by pressure from the large Cuban community in the US to maintain them. Ottawa however, has come to the conclusion that continued isolation carries risks of its own. Its new policy is based on a view that industrial countries need to become more involved to alleviate the island's economic and social problems before they lead to an explosion.

At the closing of a session of the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP], which approved guidelines for the  strengthening of the country's finances, Castro said it is  necessary to make concessions to adapt the country to a world  dominated by capitalism, but without moving away from the  country's principles.    Speaking to more than 550 deputies and several dozen foreign  and Cuban guests, he ruled out the possible application of  neoliberal formulas because, according to him, these measures  have not solved problems such as unemployment, which continues  to increase even if the economy grows. In his opinion, the  world is in the hands of the multinational companies and  capitalism, and this situation will continue for a relatively  long time, a reality that the Revolution will have to bear in  mind. He pointed out that Cuba is willing to make concessions  but only the indispensable ones to survive and develop.    Fidel Castro noted that the survival of socialism in Cuba,  almost four years after the disappearance of the USSR, is also  taking place at a time in which the country is blockaded by the  United States and its anti-Cuban policy.    He pointed out, however, that despite this situation, the  number of foreign companies interested in investing in Cuba has  increased because the nation occupies an important position  among the countries considered safe for investment.    The Cuban president said the current problem is not limited  to domestic finances, a topic that was debated by the ANPP,  because the scarcity of foreign exchange considerably limits the  purchasing of food, medicines, fuel, raw materials, and spare  parts to keep the economy running.    He noted that the reactivation of the economy is a difficult  process because the agriculture sector has to work with a  shortage of pesticides, fertilizers, and the country lacks the  resources to purchase steel with which to manufacture plows.    Cuban President Fidel Castro said, however, that the country  is not discouraged and is facing the difficulties under complex  conditions. For example, he said sugarcane cutters do not even  have the appropriate shoes, workers are poorly dressed, and  workers are not eating the proper foods for the jobs they  perform.    In this regard, he described as an example of courage the  agreements reached today by the ANPP to create an integral tax  system, to increase the prices of certain products, to eliminate  certain free services and subsidies because of company losses,  as well as to recover the value of the peso, without ruling out  the exchange of money to achieve it.    He pointed out that the government will not rest in applying  this measure designed by the ANPP; it will do so gradually but  without delay because it will begin this week with the passage  of a decree on the confiscation of illegally acquired property.

Great  expectations surrounded Portal's public appearance, considering  the population is suffering daily power outages that last  several hours. In addition, transportation service has been  reduced to a minimum. Strict fuel shortages, frequent  breakdowns in power plants, and the limitations resulting from  the serious economic situation known as the special period have  seriously limited the supply of gas.    This situation, which has caused severe and constant  hardships among a population that works and strives courageously  to preserve its social victories, would have triggered the  collapse of any government or social system that did not have  the firm support of the majority of its people, as is the case  with Cuba and its revolution. In turn, the authorities feel  obligated to inform Cubans fully and to give them all of the  necessary information to inform them of the situation and the  efforts being undertaken to overcome the crisis.    Minister Portal referred to the poor condition of Cuban  power  plants, which lack required regular maintenance because of a  shortage of spare parts and accessories. The supply of these  parts was interrupted by the sudden collapse of the Soviet Union  and other socialist countries in Europe, which had provided Cuba  with power plant equipment and the fuel required to operate the  plants.    Minister Portal spoke of Cuban efforts to develop its oil  industry with the assistance of foreign companies that have  entered into joint investments with the Cuban Government.  Portal pointed out that 1994 production in regions that have  already been explored will greatly exceed 1 million tons of  petroleum, and Cuba will be able to increase the ceiling on  petroleum used to generate electricity.    Along this line, Minister Portal had to refute false rumors  rival radio stations air to Cuba. These rumors claimed that the  heavy crude being extracted from some of the country's fields  had damaged the power plants. The information provided by  Minister Portal has been properly conveyed to Radio Havana  listeners worldwide -- especially on this continent -- and has  been welcomed by a population confident its revolutionary  government is doing all it can to resolve the problems. The  Cuban Government has the committed support of its people to  confront the current critical situation.    One aspect of Minister Portal's speech deserves special  attention because it reflects the sensible path authorities are  following -- namely, the policy to avoid depending on a single  country, a single economic and commercial source to ensure the  functioning and development of Cuban society. Cuba currently  has trade and economic development relations with a wide range  of countries, including Spain, Canada, France, the Netherlands,  Great Britain, and Latin American countries, with which it can  conduct exchanges for mutual benefit. Therefore, the Cuban  economy will experience flourishing and stable growth, and no  power will ever be able to enforce a blockade or cut supply  lines to Cuba in an attempt to impose its political interests  and views.    We, the Cuban people, are facing a critical situation, but  we  are reaping very useful lessons from the struggle, and we will  become increasingly harder to defeat.     "

Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 22 March reports that the  Matanzas  sugar industry has fulfilled the sugarcane planting plan for  March 10 days early. The number of caballerias scheduled to be  planted in March was 390, but 458 caballerias have been planted.  Thus, the plan has been surpassed by 17 percent.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 22 March reports that thanks to  the help of workers from Santiago de Cuba in harvesting  approximately 17 caballerias planted in plantains, Ciego de  Avila Province will send 200,000 quintals of plantains to the  markets of Santiago de Cuba Province this year.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 March reports the following:    Tourism sector workers in Varadero have donated to the  public  health sector more than $17,000 made in tips during February.    A solidarity group from northern Italy has made a donation  to  Cuba valued at more than $15,000. The donation, which includes  medicine, powdered milk, soap, and disinfectants, is earmarked  for polyclinics in Camaguey Province.    The German airline LTU announced that it will increase  tourist flights to Cuba in 1994. LTU is one of the biggest  airline companies in the world dedicated to tourism. Cuba is one  of the LTU's most important long distance stops. The company  markets over 850 rooms at the Tuxpan and Bella Costa Hotels in  Varadero and at the Carisol and Los Corales complexes in  Santiago de Cuba.    Armando Puello, president of the Dominican Republic's  tourism  association, highlighted the increased links between Dominican  companies and the tourist hub of Santiago de Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 23 March reports that after six  years of work, the Cubanacan Travel Agency on 22 March was  introduced in Havana City as Fantastico, the new name with which  it will operate as of this date. According to Fausto Garcia  Diez, manager of this agency which is subordinate to the  Cubanacan Corporation, the agency aspires to receive no less  than 300,000 tourists and to collect $11 million in 1994.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 24 March reports that 51  foreign  and 184 national companies are participating in the commercial  fair running from 22 to 27 March at the Convention Palace in  Havana. The fair seeks to increase the flow of currency in our  economy and to show the results of joint ventures with foreign  companies in the spheres of foods, containers, packing,  refrigeration, and printing equipment. The presence of  businessmen from 12 countries, among them Brazil, Mexico, and  Spain, reflects solidarity with Cuba.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Cuba has one of  the lowest fertility rates in the world, despite the fact that  it has one of the highest wedding rates in Latin America.  Moreover, the report adds, the prominent Cuban jurist Holga Mesa  has said that for every 10 births, there are nine abortions in  Cuba.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 24 March reports that  because 20 caballerias of tomatoes in the Caujery Valley are  infected with white blight, the Guantanamo Province tomato  harvest will be 60,000 quintals less than projected.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 March reports that rice,  cane, and other crops in Sancti Spiritus Province this year will  receive some 70,000 tons of organic fertilizers known as  bioearth [bio-tierra] to replace the imported chemical products.  It adds that the country must produce at least 1 million tons of  bioearth to be used on agricultural land to reduce the demand  for industrial fertilizers. Bioearth is a mixture of ash,  vegetable waste, and microorganisms which increase the amount of  potassium, phosphorous, and silica in the soil.     "

The country's conditions of accumulation have changed  radically. This demands the elaboration of a new concept, an  instrument that may make it possible to understand why the  economy can or cannot grow, said the specialist in statements to  PRENSA LATINA.    The economic model, he said, must be basically understood as  an analytical abstraction in which there are several levels: the  economy's macro additions [macroagregados] (investment and  consumption), the sector's structure, the international  situation and insertion (under what conditions it takes place),  and the institutional framework.    He said many economists limit the concept of the model to  this last aspect, in which two basic things prevail:  organization and norms.    According to Monreal, even if the most urgent task of the  Cuban Government were to be the adoption of a package of  measures aimed at correcting the island's financial problems,  the most important job will be in-depth economic restructuring.    According to estimates from the Finance Ministry, the Cuban  budget deficit in 1993 amounted to 4.2 billion pesos (the same  amount in dollars per the official exchange rate) and excess  money in circulation surpassed 10 billion.    Cuba -- he said -- has a very open economy, whose structure  was not designed to compete in the world market but to operate  within another constitutional framework: that of the Council of  Mutual Economic Aid, which it joined in 1972.    He added that within the economy there are competitive  sectors, such as sugar, nickel, citrus, tourism, tobacco, rum,  electronics, construction and engineering services, and some  steel products, among other sectors.    There is a second front, not operating right now, but which  could be if modernized and reduced. It is reflected in the 130  investment opportunities offered by the State Committee of  Economic Collaboration for Foreign Enterprises, as well as a  third area (food production), which he considers nonoperational.    Monreal is one of those who believes that no proposal for a  solution to the economic crisis can accept a squandering of the  labor force, which is doubtlessly the country's most valuable  resource, he stressed.    In this sense he recalled that a possible economic  adjustment  presupposes the elimination of state subsidies for production  and therefore a reduction in jobs.    There are at least three options to the former: aspire to  the  growth of a new state sector that may reabsorb the unemployed,  create new jobs in joint ventures, or expand cooperatives beyond  the agricultural sector.    The two first options -- he said -- have the drawback of  having very big external component, whereas the extension of  cooperatives to other fields, such as services (particularly in  trade) would create a new sector in the economy with a capacity  for absorbing an important amount of labor.    It is convenient -- he stressed -- to exhaust these three  possibilities without undermining the emerging private sector  (some 87,000 citizens with licenses for self-employment) which  technically is not capitalist, as it is a simple mercantile  producer.    The structural changes in the economy will ultimately define  future growth in that sector, as the constitutional framework  has been undergoing modifications and today is much more  flexible than two years ago, he said.    In socialist production -- he concluded -- there is now a  growing presence of market mechanisms, understood to be stimuli  for social cooperation, although often surrounded by the myth of  the intrinsic impossibility for regulating them, which is  totally untrue.

In touching on the process of debates now under way in Cuba,  TRABAJADORES said the basic objective is assessing the economic  and financial conditions at each working center to evaluate the  country's economic situation and the effects of financial  imbalance in the economy.    The editorial stressed that with the authority they have  earned by staying in their jobs, workers, today more than ever,  are demanding high standards of labor discipline, because what  is at stake is the defense of the genuine interests of workers,  peasants, and students.    The editorial said that Cuban workers are concerned and  reject the intolerable presence of crime, its ties to the black  market, and its incidence in social and labor discipline, and  the editorial demanded from the authorities the implementation  of drastic and exemplary measures at all levels. It added that  reality has forced us to make economic adjustments, which we  will model after a socialist and Cuban pattern, using democratic  formulas that are really unthinkable within other societies.

He said there is  no longer consensus among U.S. citizens of Cuban descent about  whether Washington's economic embargo -- which has been in force  since 1960 -- should be maintained. ""Most are against it,"" he  said.    Bolanos, 55, was interviewed by FOLHA during a farewell  dinner offered by the Brazilian-Cuban Chamber of Commerce in Sao  Paulo. He said it was ""entirely contradictory"" for the United  States to maintain the embargo on Cuba since revoked in February  the similar sanctions it imposed on Vietnam. ""Both countries  are Communist, both have a single party system, and both have a  centralized economy.""    Bolanos does not believe the UN Human Rights Commission 11  March decision to condemn Cuba reflects the country's isolation.  ""It just proves the organization is subordinated to the United  States.""    He said he believes the opening of the Cuban economy will  not  destabilize its political system. He cited the former USSR as  an example of the ""illusion of capitalism"" and mentioned the PRC  and Vietnam as examples of Communist countries that have  modernized their economies without losing political stability.    Bolanos, the first ambassador to Brazil since the two  countries resumed diplomatic relations seven years ago, will  become the Cuban deputy foreign minister.     "

During a news conference on the occasion of presenting his  credentials to Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, the Cuban  diplomat said that his mission is to make known and to earn  respect for the situation in his fatherland through a ready  dialogue with the local authorities.    Commenting on his meeting with the Italian president,  Rodriguez said that he was pleasantly impressed by the attention  Scalfaro pays to and the knowledge he has of Cuba and Latin  America.    In explaining the absence of conflicts in bilateral  relations  between the two countries, the ambassador said that annually  Cuba receives 70,000 tourists from Italy, the island's fourth  most important source of tourists, after Canada, Mexico, and  Spain.    Regarding investments, Rodriguez explained that one of every  10 Cubans is either a technician or a professional, something  that represents a guarantee to any nation, and that investors  have legal guarantees that they can export their profits.    Cuba is heading for an economy capable of allowing the  island  to see through a political project that has been obstructed for  35 years by a relentless U.S. economic blockade.    It is absurd to see, he said, how at the end of the century  and after the occurrence of many international changes that  produced political, geopolitical, and economic mutations, the  embargo not only is being maintained, it is also being  encouraged.    Until his designation as ambassador to Italy, Mario  Rodriguez  was vice minister of foreign relations and before that, from  1986 to 1990, he headed the Cuban diplomatic mission in Prague.     "

Jose Ramon Balaguer, member of the Communist Party  Politburo,  confirmed this decision during his speech to close The Nation  and the Emigrants conference, which lasted three days and was  attended by the over 200 guests living in 29 countries.    I want to emphasize our determination not to turn back on  the  path we have taken and to continue working in the future with a  common and constant effort to build this two-way road in  relations between Cuba and its emigrants, despite the Cuban-U.S.  disagreement, Balaguer stressed.    During a nine-minute speech, Balaguer stressed that despite  political, ideological, or any other sort of differences among  participants in the conference, Cuba's independence and  sovereignty constituted the most important points of agreement.    Balaguer added that this attitude conveys the patriotism  felt  by a large number of Cuban emigrants, many of whom also demanded  that the 30-year U.S. embargo against Cuba be lifted.    Balaguer pointed out that discussion topics such as the  elimination of the U.S. blockade, the preservation of our  undeniable social conquests, and not returning to the horrors of  a past of exploitation and submission for Cuba have been widely  agreed by participants, which demonstrates the sincere  patriotism that prevails among emigrants.    In addition, Balaguer indicated that the maturity and  culture  of Cubans on the island is the fundamental starting point that  today enables us to advance our goal of normalizing relations  between Cuba and the emigrants.    Balaguer asserted that ""we must not forget the wound that  has  not yet completely healed or the abnormal circumstances that  still threaten the security of the fatherland.""    Balaguer only excluded from the rapprochement process  supporters of the island's annexation to the United States,  terrorists, political demagogues, and those referred to as false  patriots.    He maintained that they -- those who insist on the goal of  destroying the revolution and thus endangering the existence  itself of the nation, its sovereignty, and that Cuban nature we  have mentioned so often -- do not have any room in these noble  intentions, which do not target anyone in particular.    At the end of Balaguer's speech, several participants  chanted  in the plenary hall of the Conventions Palace. Down the halls  they shouted the slogan, Cuba yes, blockade no.    Today's session was marked by the special participation of  Vice President Carlos Lage, who talked about the state of the  economy and its outlook.    Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso said Lage told Cubans  living abroad about the possibility of participating in the  opening to foreign capital initiated in Cuba last year but said  the application of this policy would be discussed in future  meetings.    In yesterday's session, Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  announced six government measures, many of them old aspirations  of the participants in the meeting with the purpose of  facilitating the emigrants' links to their nation and cultural  exchanges.

In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Santamaria recalled  important events that have taken place in the past few hours as  part of the joint efforts by the two Latin American countries.    Yesterday, Camilo Penalosa, Colombia's deputy minister of  economic development, ended a visit to Cuba in which he led a  group of businessmen interested in investing in the island.  There was also the arrival of the Colombian training ship, Arc  Gloria, which brought a message of friendship to the Cuban  people.    The Colombian and Cuban Civil Aeronautics Directorates have  also signed an agreement allowing for prompt establishment of  regular flights, linking their capitals and other cities in the  two countries.    Commenting on the businessmen's visit, Santamaria explained  that this was a positive step in joint business ventures and  that it had exceeded expectations, as face-to-face meetings were  held with people who want to invest in Cuba.    He said the businessmen identified specific points of  cooperation. As part of the next phase of the talks, they  arranged for a new meeting to be held soon in Bogota with  ranking Cuban and Colombian officials in order to reach specific  agreements. He said the visitors exchanged views on prospects  for Cuba's economy and its future, as well as on new methods of  foreign investment approved by the Cuban state.    The diplomat said this type of visit creates a continuity  that gives Colombians direct knowledge of the opportunities that  exist in Cuba to establish ventures beneficial to both countries.    The topic of the aeronautics agreement recently signed was  broached with enthusiasm by Santamaria, who described this as  the principal object of the diplomatic mission's work in view of  its economic importance.    This is done on the basis of a real market because there are  clear prospects for scheduling several weekly flights between  the capitals and other cities in Cuba and Colombia, as evidenced  by the increase in tourist flights this year, he noted. The  ambassador noted how increased travel between the two countries,  not only of tourists but also of businessmen and respective  government officials, will help strengthen bilateral relations  between the two countries. This important agreement was reached  thanks to Cuba's constructive attitude, which can expect of us  all the loyalty expected of a brother country, he said.    Santamaria referred to the negotiations on expanding the  partial agreement, which would represent a significant increase  in commercial bilateral ties. To this end, the Colombian  Government is now consulting with the private sector on tariff  issues, which would affect over 800 products included in the  expansion and which were the object of prior agreements during  the last meeting in Havana.

Lage, who met with Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister  Miguel  Angel Burelli and other authorities, stopped in Caracas for a  short visit. He arrived from Brazil and will visit Colombia  tomorrow.    At a news conference, the Cuban leader said his country  welcomes foreign capital investments, preferably from the  region, with which Cuba hopes to strengthen political ties and  take steps toward integration.    In his meeting with Burelli, who is also Venezuela's  candidate for OAS secretary general, Lage explained his  country's situation, as well as the consequences of the U.S.  economic blockade against the island. Lage emphasized that the  so-called Torricelli Amendment, which tightens the blockade  through extraterritorial measures, is not only illegal but also  criminal because of its impact on the population.    Lage added that the accusations against Havana of human  rights violations are unjustified and just a part of  Washington's harassment policy.    Lage said Cuba has every right to participate in all aspects  of the Latin American integration process and that regional  organizations must accept all countries and respect the right of  each people to choose its own path.    As for the changes taking place in Cuba, Lage said that the  Caribbean nation does not intend to become a capitalist nation  but to adjust to current world conditions and to improve the  socialist model.    He added that it is very difficult to predict whether  conditions will improve next year due to the U.S. blockade, but  he did say that if the blockade tightens and creates even more  difficult conditions, Cuba will face them.    Lage also met with Abdon Vivas Teran, president of the  Venezuelan Investment Fund, and with Cesar Quintini Rosales,  transport and communications minister.     "
0,FT933-14965 ,"FT933-14965 _AN-DGLB7AAWFT 930712   FT  12 JUL 93 / US-Cuba phone links could mean softer line: Congress is starting to listen to more moderate Cuban voices      By GEORGE GRAHAM   AT first glance, relations between Cuba and the US have rarely been icier: Cuba's devastated economy is driving more people to flee the country, leading to more shootings by Cuban border guards and a flurry of diplomatic protests from the US. 'Because things are so desperate in Cuba and more people think the end is at hand, there have been more incidents that could provoke tension,' comments Mr Ernest Preeg, former chief economist at the US Agency for International Development and author of a recent study on Cuba's economic prospects once the US trade embargo is lifted. A State Department spokesman last week criticised Cuba's 'barbaric' attacks both on US-registered boats trying to pick up refugees and on swimmers trying to reach asylum in the US Guantanamo naval base, on the island's southeastern coast. This drew a sharp rebuttal from Mr Roberto Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, who called the US complaint 'an infamy, a provocation and, at the very least, a shameful lack of seriousness'. Telecommunications between Cuba and the US are also at one of their worst levels in years: last year's Hurricane Andrew destroyed ATT's microwave links from south Florida and Cuba has now sharply cut the volume of US calls it will allow to be routed through Italy. However, the US State Department is preparing new guidelines that could greatly ease telephone links with Cuba and mark a step along what some Cuba experts believe might turn out to be a path towards warmer relations. Significantly, some ATT officials expect the new guidelines to allow Cuba to take some of the revenue from the telephone calls, instead of freezing it all in an escrow, as happens today. Also indicative of a thaw has been President Fidel Castro's recent decision to allow some prominent dissidents to travel abroad, while last month, in a move that could have far-reaching economic consequences, he asked the national assembly to consider legalising use of the dollar in Cuba. US Cuban policy has always been dominated by an argument over whether to use threats to finish the work of the trade embargo and topple the Castro government, or incentives to bring about change more quickly. In political terms, the former school of thought, expounded by the Cuban-American National Foundation, a well-financed Miami exile group led by Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, has always dominated. It still commands a clear majority in Congress, but has lost some of its strongest supporters, such as Mr Dante Fascell, the Florida congressman who chaired the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee until his retirement this year. Members of Congress have started to listen to some of the more moderate voices in the Cuban exile community. The House recently voted to kill funding for TV Marti, the US-financed propaganda station beamed to Cuba and closely aligned with Mr Canosa. The new administration does not appear to have developed a clear Cuba policy yet. During the election campaign, Mr Bill Clinton took an even tougher line on Cuba than President George Bush, but his appointees include some who have in the past favoured more dialogue with Cuba. Telephone links are one area where the two camps agree. The Cuban-American National Foundation, which in general opposes any easing of the embargo, backs easier and cheaper telecommunications, and this measure was included in a bill passed last year which otherwise sought to tighten the economic noose on Cuba. Demand for phone links among the Cuban exile community is high. Even before the limited ATT microwave link was destroyed by the hurricane, the company was able to connect only around 500,000 calls out of 60m attempted each year. The cost of getting through to Cuba has risen sharply. ATT says that if it could serve the island directly, its charges would average Dollars 1.55 (Pounds 1) a minute; with the service via Italy cut to a trickle, many exiles now dial pirate services in Canada, at prices ranging from Dollars 3.50 to Dollars 7.50 a minute. Cuba prefers the Canadian links, because it receives a share of the revenue in the form of desperately needed hard currency. The restriction on ATT's Italian traffic is seen as a bargaining ploy to weaken US insistance that all revenue go into the escrow account, which has an estimated Dollars 60m already.

During  the visit he met with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and other  high-ranking members of the Spanish Government.    Likewise, in exclusive statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage  expressed his satisfaction with the current state of relations  between Cuba and Spain.    The high-ranking Cuban official explained the meeting with  Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, which lasted an hour and  a half, allowed him to provide an in-depth depiction of Cuba's  current situation and the measures implemented on the island as  well as to analyze bilateral relations.    It was also an opportunity to evaluate Spanish investment  opportunities and perspectives in Cuba and the possibility of  expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields.    During his four-day stay, Lage carried out a very tight  agenda, which included meetings with Foreign Minister Javier  Solana, Economy and Finance Minister Pedro Solbes, and Commerce  and Tourism Minister Javier Gomez Navarro, as well as with Jose  Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for cooperation.    Lage also met with Carlos Solchaga, president of the Spanish  Socialist Workers Party parliamentary bloc and former economy  minister. The Cuban official also met with Rafael Portaencasa,  rector of the Madrid Polytechnic University.    We appreciate these meetings and working sessions giving us  the opportunity to explain the our efforts and how difficult it  is for us to progress amid U.S. pressures against other  governments and investors, Lage stated.    Likewise, these contacts, he added, allow us to enlighten  Spanish authorities on the expected Cuban successes in the near  future in certain fields.    According to Lage, this exchange of ideas and opinions is  also useful, because it offers the opportunity to provide more  information abroad about the country's progression.    Lage explained his visit to Madrid follows a visit by Jose  Luis Rodriguez, Cuban minister president of the State Committee  for Finance, who met with representatives of Spain's financial  institutions last week to discuss technical issues.    He said talks with financial institutions from Spain and  other nations have been taking place for several months now,  because Cuba is confronting a totally new situation in which it  must adopt economic measures. In this respect, Cuba is ready to  assimilate experiences and knowledge from other nations.    We are aware conditions are different, because, first of  all,  in our case they are occurring within a socialist context;  second, because Cuba's economic adaptation is taking place amid  the U.S. economic blockade, the Council of State vice president  explained.    In expressing an opinion on the results of his agenda during  the past days, Lage said it allowed an interesting exchange of  ideas with the leaders of the Spanish Government, which, in his  opinion, is important in many ways.    In this respect, he cited, among other aspects, the  magnitude  of economic exchange, bilateral cooperation, the possibility of  expanding the historic closeness between Cuba and Spain, and the  affinity as well as affection between both countries.    Finally, Lage said this contact with the Madrid Government  is  not an isolated occurrence, rather, something that will continue  to ensure greater dialogue and economic exchange between Cuba  and Spain.

In his book, ""Beyond  Peace,"" the ultraconservative statesman, who was an enemy of the  Cuban Revolution, expounds on his theory about the policy that  should be followed by the United States regarding Cuba and  discusses the blockade issue.    We give details of journalist Marco Castellon's commentary  on  this issue in ""Doing Radio"":    [Begin Castellon recording] In his book, Nixon recommends  the  separation of political and economic relations with Vietnam,  allowing each to develop at its own pace. Although he recognizes  differences between the Vietnamese reality and the Cuban  reality, he encourages something similar concerning Cuba.    In Cuba's case, former President Nixon says a considerable  part of the pressure to maintain the embargo is derived from the  old belief, particularly among many members of the exiled Cuban  community, that it is the best way to put an end to what he  terms the cruel and destructive Castro regime. Therefore, he  leaves no doubt about his position concerning the Cuban process.    He nevertheless recognizes that, following the Soviet  Union's  collapse, economic conditions on the island worsened; and after  35 years of Fidel Castro's government, hardliners who oppose him  have not been able to destroy him. Therefore, he says it is time  to change the goal sought by the North American policy, from  trying to harm the Cuban Government to helping the people  because, Nixon thinks, it is highly unlikely the island will  become a subversive threat in the hemisphere even if the Cuban  economy improves.    This means the economic embargo should be lifted to permit  trade, investments, and economic interaction between the United  States and Cuba. He insists, of course, that ideas and  information be allowed to flow as freely as products. [end  recording]     "

The Cuban economy has faced a growing crisis following the gradual withdrawal of aid and supplies from the former Soviet Union. It has also suffered from the fall in price of some raw-material exports, notably sugar. Italgrani will supply cereals, vegetable oils and pasta products, worth about L100bn, in return for Cuban sugar of a similar value.

Rodriguez begins the discussion by saying that politically  and socially, Cuba is one of a kind: ""We have a steep economic  crisis, yet we maintain political stability; and why not say it  -- social stability as well. Cuba is the only such case.""    Sexto points out that Cuba's political present cannot be  judged without considering its past. He says: ""Never have I seen  in any other country such a solid bond between past and present;  between history and history-in-the-making."" He goes on to say  that: ""Despite shortages that are in some aspects acute, but not  tragic; despite deficits; despite sacrifices; and despite the  postponement of legitimate individual and social dreams, the  Cuban people are aware that there is no other political system  or political idea that would guarantee what they themselves have  lived during the past 35 years.    ""This is part of the reasoning, even unconsciously, of any  Cuban today. What alternative does Cuba have today if not to  remain bonded to the political idea of the Revolution? What  other options do we have? The option proposed by the people in  Miami who support annexation? The most progressive of the Miami  annexation supporters are proposing private property and a  market economy."" Rodriguez replies: ""I recently read in the  Miami NUEVO HERALD an article going beyond that, proposing for  1994, U.S. annexation as a solution to our problems."" Sexto  notes that some say that socialism has failed in Cuba, adding:  ""That is something that remains to be seen. What completely  failed 35 years ago in Cuba was capitalism.""    Rodriguez stresses that history is a factor in analyzing  attitudes Cubans assume today in contending with the situation.  He points out that despite the shortages, the situation in Cuba  is far removed from that of many Latin American countries  because Cuba is trying to maintain an equilibrium in terms of  social services.    Rodriguez and Sexto discuss the importance of the ration  booklet in Cuba's present situation. Rodriguez points out: ""I  believe the ration booklet is an element of that equilibrium you  mentioned."" Sexto responds: ""The ration book is precisely an  element that favors distribution equilibrium. I am not an enemy  of the ration book, but I believe that getting rid of it someday  will benefit us all. I have had that opinion for years. But  right now, the ration booklet guarantees minimal distribution  and equilibrium in distribution."" Rodriguez disagrees with  Sexto's point of view: ""I do not agree with you. I believe the  ration booklet must be maintained because it is what guarantees  goods for people with lower incomes.""    Sexto says that in Cuba they are working hard to cover basic  needs. He adds: ""We are trying to avoid anyone's being abandoned  or anyone's literal starving to death. I do not believe that  anyone in this country is literally starving to death because in  one way or another, they get what they need. It has a lot to do  with our policies. We have a policy that favors the services and  views of social justice and protection.""    In discussing these policies of social justice, Rodriguez  says: ""We have only one option: To stay with the Revolution and  sacrifice ourselves to maintain our independence and dignity.  Many of our leaders, including Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina during his trips abroad, have said that anything can be  discussed here but our independence or the dignity of the Cuban  people.""    Sexto adds: ""If we look at the trend and the fact that the  country continues to survive after a three-year crisis, that it  remains standing with determination to overcome the crisis, this  means that this country, the Revolution, the government, and the  social regime that supports this country have the support of the  majority of the people. That is irrefutable proof. The fact that  we remain standing is irrefutable proof that the majority of  Cubans support the Cuban Revolution. The fact that the majority  of people support the Cuban Revolution does not mean that there  is no irritation. I believe there is a certain level of  irritation in the streets.    I believe that everyone can take the shortages, the deficit,  but not everyone can take these challenges with a rational,  serene, and stable attitude. I believe there are times when the  irritation is produced because -- and I believe you said this  during a recent program -- I get home, for example, and there is  no power. I might get upset because maybe I wanted to read a  good book or write an article for the magazine. I am not just  talking about myself; I am referring to any citizen. This does  not mean that deep down I do not understand the causes for the  outages. I say to myself that this is what I must go through so  we can overcome this situation, because the other option is not  in my best interest. The other option is capitalism, which is  offered to us by some in Miami, and by some who leave us, to  back them up.""    Rodriguez remarks: ""With capitalism, everyone knows that  some  will benefit while the majority will drown.""    Sexto says he was once asked what capitalism is. He  answered:  ""The underground economy is the capitalist economy."" Rodriguez  adds that capitalism's equilibrium is established by the law of  the market: ""A market economy is the underground economy, where  the price is determined by the supply and demand, regardless of  who can or cannot buy those goods.""    Rodriguez says: ""We are living in a country facing a  difficult economic crisis, a country that despite its economic  crisis, lives in social equilibrium and political stability."" He  concludes: ""I will define the country we live in. We live in a  country that struggles to be better, to overcome, and to defend  itself."" Straight Talk ends at 1615 GMT.     "

Contrary to what happened over the previous three  years, several effects of the siege have landed simultaneous  blows on the Cuban people, particularly hurting their food  supply and some areas of the public health system. It is  important to recall that since 6 July 1960, almost 34 years ago,  the U.S. Government has stopped buying sugar from the island.  One of the main objectives of the blockade was to try to curb  as much as possible the inflow of foreign financial resources  essential to Havana in its efforts to keep its economy afloat  and meet the basic needs of Cubans.    Last year, because of limited exchange opportunities;  because  of the lack of imports required by the sugar harvest -- oil, for  instance; and because of bad whether, Cuban sugar production,  still a key component in the national economy, fell to just more  than 4 million tons, which is much lower than the 7 million tons  produced during the previous harvest. This drastic drop in  production not only caused the country to stop receiving more  than $400 million a year amid an already difficult situation,  but it also created difficulties in distributing sugar among the  people, who were already facing many other difficulties in the  January-March period in terms of delivery dates, although,  ultimately, distribution was achieved as planned.    The lack of raw materials affected not only the sugar  industry, but also the agriculture sector in which tuber and  vegetable production declined. The shortage of agricultural  produce was highly visible in terms of the supply of these  products in this period. If these examples, among others, are  combined with the trade transactions with other countries which  Washington's embassies and special services have tried to wreck  -- for example, the purchase of Asian cooking oil to meet  first-quarter needs -- then we get a sad idea of what is going  on in this Caribbean country. Should we want to expand on this a  bit more, we would have to remember the painful path travelled  by Cuba in Latin America to buy powdered milk for newborn  babies, because suppliers feared White House retaliation or  because some ships dropped their loads in ports of other  Caribbean nations. If those ships had docked in Cuban ports  with the powdered milk on board, they could be severely  penalized upon their arrival in U.S. ports because of provisions  in the Torricelli Law.    Some day, when details of how Cuban life was affected by the  U.S. blockade, and when the information blockade and distortions  no longer cloud the island's achievements, reality will easily  win out over fantasy. Meanwhile, Cuba shows no signs of  surrendering; although life goes on very much affected by  difficulties primarily caused by the blockade, we are  maintaining the ironhanded notion of not sacrificing our  national freedom.

They were enticed with lengthy presentations on the state of Cuba and top-level meetings with officials of their choice, and entertained at an official drinks party. Representatives from PepsiCo, Eastman Kodak, RJR Nabisco, BFI International, the US Rice Council, and a host of tourist developers, lawyers, investment bankers, and curious Cuban-Americans all made the trip. Most of the visitors were from the US, although US law prevents them from doing business with Cuba or even spending money there. But sensing a slight easing in US policy to Cuba, Cuban officials and backers hope the meetings will generate opposition to the three-decade US trade embargo against the island. In the meantime Cuba is hoping non-US businessmen will prop up its faltering economy with foreign capital. Cuba has found foreign partners in tourism, mining, light industry, agro-business and electronics, and claims to have attracted some Dollars 500m (Pounds 333m) in foreign investment in the past couple of years. So far such investment has not stopped the economy's decline, provoked by the collapse in trade with former Comecom countries. It is expected to have halved since 1989, with imports down to Dollars 2.2bn from Dollars 8.1bn. Eight-hour electricity blackouts are common, malnutrition is a problem for the first time since the revolution, and trade in all but the most crucial products has ground to a halt. 'You could sign fantastic letters of credit for Dollars 1m of business tomorrow,' says Mr Sem Davies of Fisons, the UK pharmaceutical company which has experience in Cuba, 'but you would never get paid'. The potential investors were briefed by earnest bureaucrats. Mr Raul Amado Blanco, of the central bank, said Cuba would allow foreign banks to set up branches in partnership with the government in Cuba. Cuba's need for credit, trade guarantees, import and export financing, credit card operations and more meant the country's financial sector was ripe for take off. Mr Antonio de los Reyes, deputy minister of basic industry, said laws that gave Cubans majority ownership of joint ventures could be 'negotiated'. His department is to auction 11 oil fields to foreign investors - some 45 have shown interest - in August. Three foreign oil companies, most notably Total of France, are already exploring in Cuba. Mr Carlos Lage, Cuba's top economic official, said yesterday plans to allow Cubans to hold and spend dollars were in the final stage. Mr Lage hoped the measures would increase the amount of hard currency in Cuba, and suggested the government was taking steps to reduce the amount of local currency in circulation. The moves could bring transactions now conducted in the black market to the formal market. Unsurprisingly, the US businessmen who came along thought the US trade embargo should be lifted. 'We have sent 55,000 people back in rubber bags from Vietnam and we are doing business with them. Why not with Cuba?' said the representative from BFI waste disposal company. Despite the precarious state of the Cuban economy, many are enthusiastic about the market's potential. 'The embargo could be lifted in three years,' said the PepsiCo man.

Nicholas Woodsworth walks the streets of Old Havana and today finds mostly inertia and neglect, decline and breakdown      By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH   There is a quiet anger about Mercedes, a smouldering resentment which on evenings with me she keeps damped down only with rum and cigarettes. It is the hospital wards she works in, she tells me - the shortage of medicines and pain-killers, her inability to relieve suffering, the cries and moans of patients which continue to pursue her long after her shift is over. Now, in the little room I have rented in the house of her friends Luis and Isabel, Mercedes administers her own pain-killer, large gulps of dark, caramel-tasting Paticruzados rum. Two whimsical, carefree sailors dance about the label of the bottle. It sits conveniently close, parked on a bedside table between a cheaply whirring Russian fan and a battered radio which sprays the hot Havana night with brassy rhythms - salsa, rumba, cha cha cha. After a few glasses her gloom lifts, her smooth brown face lightens. She flirts and laughs a little, shakes her shoulders in time to the music, takes on the brightness that in a more ordinary time and place would naturally be hers. We plan a day at the beach, a walk along the sea front promenade of the Malecon, ice-cream at La Coppelia in the smart part of town, and Mercedes seems happy. Her anger, though, I know, is still there, profound and indelible. It is not just anger over her work, for Fidel Castro's unwavering, catastrophic vision for her country, for Cuba's years of hardship and suffering. It is also directed at the outside world, at me. 'You know nothing,' she has already said to me in a brief moment of unguarded bitterness. 'You tell me things have changed all over the world, that Cuba is a dinosaur, that things can only change here, too. You tell me democracy is around the corner. But you do not know Cuba.' Tonight, though, Mercedes has no fight in her, no room left for debate. Like most Cubans, she is sick to death of ideology and the politics of state. She saves her energy for the true politics of Cuba - the strategies of day-to-day survival, the salvaging of small satisfactions from moral bankruptcy and material collapse. She drains her glass, stubs out one of the American cigarettes she likes me to buy her. 'Toda politica es mentiras,' is all she will say, shaking her head. All politics is lies. She switches off the radio and stands, swaying a little with music, drink and fatigue. 'Take me dancing.' We walk out into the streets of Havana Vieja. Decayed and crumbling, Old Havana is an eerie, empty quarter at night. We stumble over rubble and around potholes, under hanging laundry and through tall, broad arcades built by the Spanish against Cuba's fierce tropical sun. Here and there are the remnants of an imperial finery financed by slaves and sugar: an ornate stone church, a baroque opera house, a pillared convent, a wall of Seville Moorish tiles, and matching pairs of bronze lions along the tree-lined Prado. But mostly there is inertia and neglect, decline and breakdown. We walk gingerly. There is little lighting - electricity is a precious commodity in Cuba today. Neither, in these still streets, is there much traffic - there is little petrol to fuel the hulking pre-revolutionary Buicks and Pontiacs, the tinny post-revolutionary Skodas and Ladas, that lie salt-corroded and rotting on every corner. Nor is there any of the business, the exchange, the human transaction that is normally the heartbeat of a big city's life. Only occasionally in the gloom do we pass a small boy raising water to an upper-floor apartment with a bucket and pulley, an old man smoking a fragrant cigar on the cool of a doorstep. Old Havana is jammed with tens of thousands of tenement dwellers; but with nowhere to go, no money to spend, and nothing to spend it on, they remain indoors, comforted in the blue glow of Cuba's last accessible past-time, the television soap opera. 'Nada . . . nada . . . nada . . . . ' mutters Mercedes as, one after another, we pass the meagre window displays of government shops that have nothing left to sell. I find them pathetic. Mercedes has little sense of pathos - but a good deal of contempt - for state economic planning that now fails to provide even the bare minimum needed for survival. The defiant gesturing continues, Castro's revolutionary avowals persist. But, as the people of Cuba know to great personal cost, there are no provisions on any known communist chart or model for the plunge of the last four years. Even the name given to the post-Soviet age by the Cuban leadership - the 'Special Period' - indicates its lack of certainty in the progress of the revolution. Well might the leaders lack confidence. Before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990, Cuba was consuming Dollars 8bn worth of goods annually, most of it garnered through special trade-and-aid agreements with the east bloc. Not only did the Soviet Union, happy with a permanent foothold on the very doorstep of the enemy camp, purchase Cuban sugar at above-world-market prices, it also supplied the Caribbean client-state with subsidised oil, food, machinery, medicines, vehicles, military hardware, technical advice, and cheap loans. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it all vanished overnight. The goodwill dried up, the teachers went home, the agreements were cancelled, the ships stopped calling in at Havana harbour. Without foreign exchange, Cuban imports have slowed to a trickle. Without raw materials, Cuban factories have stopped operating. Without fertilisers and pesticides, the Cuban sugar industry is floundering. Not only demanding payment of a Dollars 30bn Cuban debt, Russia has now rejected as a risky deal even the simplest form of trade - the bartering of oil for sugar. US refusal to do business with its revolutionary neighbour remains as firm as ever. Like an air-filled balloon, Cuba's prosperity - such as it was - has suddenly blown up in the face of its people, leaving little trace behind. Cuba has stopped spending money that did not belong to it - the value of annual consumption has shrunk from the equivalent of Dollars 8bn to Dollars 1bn, with shortage and need everywhere. Not long ago a comprehensive social safety net, universal health care and high educational standards made Cubans the envy of the third world. Today they grub about in the wreckage of their economy, no better off than the African disaster cases they used to assist, and wonder how long the 'Special Period' can possibly continue. Two rolls of bread a day, one box of matches a month, one bar of soap a month, two portions of mince-and-soya paste a month, two pairs of underwear a year . . . armed with her government-issue ration book, such is the level of provision Mercedes now manages to obtain through the state. Often not even these meagre undertakings can be met. Mercedes has not seen soap in the government shops for three months. 'Mierda de nada,' she whispers, for good measure. At the end of the dark street, on the edge of Old Havana, we emerge into a rare constellation of lights, the Hotel Plaza. No one, of course, manages to live on the official ration, or on the official economy at all. It is around the foreigner-frequented hotels that a parallel mechanism - a dollar-based economy that pervades all sections of Cuban society - can be found in its rawest, most distorted form. For Cubans, life is an unending struggle, a daily series of problems which must be resolved. There is a catch-all verb they apply to any action helping them overcome their straitened circumstances - it is, simply, resolver, or find a solution. One can, for example, like my hosts Luis and Isabel, resolve the question of the spare bedroom by illegally renting it to tourists. Consuelo down the road from Luis, on the other hand, has found her own resolution in a supply of black market chickens that do not officially exist; much to Mercedes' and my satisfaction, she runs a paladar, an illicit back-room restaurant. I am glad to have Mercedes by my side as we walk past the hotel entrance. She is a sort of protection. For a good deal of 'resolving' in this part of town takes place on the street, and involves separating foreigners from their dollars. Cubans will go to desperate lengths to get hold of dollars, for without them there is no meat, fuel, clothing, pharmaceuticals, electrical goods, household items or much of anything else. Some of the denizens lurking in the shadows here simply beg. They want soap for their babies, milk powder for their mothers. I spot one who has already asked me for the shirt off my back. These are not professional street hustlers, but students, housewives, fathers, and there is no artfulness to their approach. It makes their entreaties all the more painful. Others have something to offer - themselves. Prostitution is now widespread in Havana, although there is a wide gap between hard core professionals and those casual young women willing to stay the night after an evening's entertainment. Part of the problem is that there are many more single women in Havana than men; over the years conscription for the Angolan war, the Mariel boat lift, the haemmorrhage of young men to Miami, has made available young men scarce. A young man with ready money in his pocket is even rarer. On my first visit to the Plaza I was ambushed by two teenage girls in risque attire who steered me straight to the bar. Were they after daquiris, pina coladas, whisky, I wondered? Far from it. They craved the now-unavailable treats of their childhood. One demanded a glass of milk, the other a gooey, chocolate-covered marshmallow. Lounging outside the doors of the Plaza we meet Ramon and Anna, already acquaintances of mine. Like many of Havana's black marketeers, they are part of a well organised system of theft and resale that operates in almost every factory, warehouse, business and shop in Cuba. Ramon sells PPG-5, the cholesterol-reducing miracle drug, fruit of Fidel's prestige medical research project. Coincidentally, it commands a high street value for its effects on male sexual potency. Anna acts as a street lookout for Ramon. Most societies would judge Ramon and Anna's profession criminal, their behaviour corrupt. But in an official economy as maladjusted to social needs as Cuba's, definitions of corruption hardly mean much; what counts for Cubans is a market-driven alternative that works. From the sidewalk, Ramon tells me, he makes Dollars 5 to Dollars 10 dollars a day; in a state office or factory he would not make five dollars a month. Such a morality is widely accepted. Neither of Mercedes' parents work the street, but both steal from the state. Her mother, a cigar roller, smuggles cigars from the factory where she works. Her father, a petrol-tanker driver, has an agreement with the depot foreman for the falsifying of way-bills. It is the only way to keep food in the house. Nor is the administration exempt from such behaviour. Ramon could never ply his trade without the connivance of the police and his local Committee for the Defense of the Revolution, the organisation that regulates Cuban life on a city block-by-block basis. Ramon regularly turns over a percentage of profits to his CDR chief. In its own interests the regime tolerates a certain level of black marketeering and petty corruption - it relieves pressure on the state to provide. It also relieves Mercedes and me of the task of finding an officially licensed taxi. Just outside the glow of the Plaza's lights a wheezing, fly-by-night Moscovitch skulks. We climb in and clatter along the Malecon sea front, six lanes of deserted city-centre highway, to the 1830 Club. Through the doors of the dance club lies another world, a brave and shiny new Cuba in which failure might never have existed. In a seaside garden of rustling palm trees and well-kept lawns, a crowd sits scattered around an outdoor dance floor. They are well off, wealthy enough to spend in an evening what most Cubans earn in six months. They are young. The men are casual and tanned. They smile a lot. The women are sleek, well made up, alluring. This is not exactly the old elite, the senior military, the party ideologues, the command economy captains who grew up fighting in the mountains with Fidel Castro. These are their children, the technocratic class, Cuba's new elite. They work for new joint ventures, in import-export agencies, the tourist industry. They have access to dollars, to the outside world, to new ideas. Mercedes and I sip rum daquiris, wander in the garden, dance to American disco music. There is a Tropicana-style floor show - all sequins and legs. Then a fashion show - casual opulence and legs again. More drinks, more dancing. Mercedes is entranced. Her eyes sparkle, rove over the clothing, the coloured cocktails, the happy couples. Returning from the dance floor I meet a small-time Swiss businessman, a maverick at the far edge of emerging markets. His face is flushed with achievement - today through his Cuban partner he has purchased yet another downtown Havana apartment at a rock-bottom price. Cuba will change fast, he assures me. Already the signs are there, in the recently-opened private markets for farmer's produce, in a new European investment fund for Cuba, in rumours of foreign financing for the sugar industry. 'In two or three years all this unpleasantness between Cuba and the US will be patched up,' he beams with anticipation. 'Investments will come rolling in. Then watch real estate prices rocket]' In the taxi back to Ramon and Isabel's I am perturbed. I am unable to make the link between this gasping, exhausted city and the self-assured ease of the 1830 Club. It all seems make-believe, I tell Mercedes. I am still perturbed back in the room where the little table-fan whirs and the radio continues pumping hot Latin music into the night. Where will it end, I ask Mercedes. Surely something good must lie at the end of such hard times? The sparkle has left her eyes. 'You still don't understand,' she says quietly, reluctantly, shaking her head. 'That was not make-believe. That is the future. 'Do you think because our economy is in ruins the state is in ruins? There is something that counts more in Cuba than economics. It is political power. It is as strong as ever, as absolute and privileged as ever. 'The men who run this country see the writing on the wall. They know the old times are gone forever. But do you think they will surrender their places to some new, local breed, or to Cubans screaming for their jobs from Miami?' She pours herself a last glass of Paticruzados. 'Yesterday the men at the 1830 Club were good communists. Tomorrow they will be good capitalists. The lies will change, but the liars will be the same.' And what, I ask, will happen to her patients, her neighbours, her compatriots, the people of Old Havana? Mercedes downs her glass, shivers, and closes her eyes. She is tired, and bitter, and has the chronic victim's calm certainty of the future. 'Nothing,' she replies 'the elite shall remain the elite, with all their power and privilege. The poor of Cuba shall remain the poor.' She is whispering now, nearly asleep. 'It seems that is the way of the world. They say we are the last state of our kind on earth. But are we not, after all, much the same as everyone else?'   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.

""But first  the 32-year-old economic embargo against our country must be  lifted. It has cost us $40 billion in damage, goes against  international law, and has been condemned throughout the world.  With such an embargo, how could it be possible for us to talk  about compensation for U.S. possessions (which were nationalized  after the 1959 revolution, ed.)?""    Washington recently lifted the economic embargo against  Vietnam without imposing political preconditions. Deputy  Minister Allende does not have much hope that this will also  happen to Cuba in the near future.    ""It is a good, rational thing that the embargo against  Vietnam was lifted,"" she says. ""But Cuba is a special case for  U.S. Governments. Their policy toward us goes beyond pure  rationality. Cuba is something like an obsession. Of course,  one can also interpret the maintenance of the embargo against  Cuba as a warning to the rest of Latin America,"" a warning that  a high price is paid for any reduction in U.S. influence on the  continent.    ""The Americans,"" Allende sighs, ""make demands on us about  human rights and democracy. But they are just excuses. They do  not want Cuba to follow an independent course."" These demands  are largely linked to domestic U.S. politics, she says. There  are more than 1 million Cubans living in the United States, and  they are U.S. citizens and voters who are hostile to the Castro  government. Wealthy exiles finance the election campaigns of  U.S. politicians like Torricelli, who ensured that the Cuban  embargo was further tightened at the end of 1992.    ""Not all of them are hysterics who want to further  strengthen  the embargo,"" according to Allende. ""Others do not want that at  all. In April, we will talk with those exiles who accept that  Cuba makes its decisions itself."" The distinction between  ""fanatics"" and other Cubans in the United States is a new  element in Havana's attitude. Until recently all exiles were  regarded as ""gusanos"" (worms) and defectors who had betrayed  their country.    The deputy prime minister speaks passionately in support of  the democratization carried out by Cuba within the one-party  system. ""What is democracy?"" she asks. ""Does it only exist in  one form, such as the one applied in the United States? For me,  it still means government by the people. In Cuba the  people participate in the government. Where else are planned  economic measures subjected to popular consultation in the  workplace?"" Allende refers to the planned government cutbacks,  the introduction of a progressive income tax, and other  far-reaching changes, which after an initial debate in  parliament, are being discussed in the factories under the  leadership of the trade unions.    The minister defends last year's general elections. ""It was  the people who chose the candidates for the election lists,"" she  says. ""Directly and by secret voting."" She agrees with  parliamentary Chairman Ricardo Alarcon. He said proudly that  ""the political map of the world would look very different if  everywhere, like in Cuba, the people selected the candidates,  rather than the political machines greased by the financial  powers.""    Havana feels that Washington, with regard to Cuba, limits  the  concept of ""human rights"" to individual and political rights,  while discounting economic and social rights. ""There are human  rights in Cuba, which are not even discussed in other parts of  the world,"" Allende says, referring to free education and health  care and the absence of hunger and poverty. ""In addition,  Washington violates human rights itself,"" she says. ""U.S.  companies are not allowed to trade with us and U.S. tourists are  not allowed to go to Cuba.""    Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a columnist for the Trabajadores trade  union newspaper and member of the Communist Party's Central  Committee, also calls the U.S arguments for the embargo excuses.  ""The original justifications given for the embargo were that  Cuba was a danger to U.S. security, that it encouraged  subversion in Latin America, that it was the ally of the Soviet  Union, that it intervened in Angola. With the passing of time  they could no longer use these arguments. Now human rights and  democracy have once again come to the forefront in their  arguments.""    Nicanor Leon says: ""But when Washington had to explain to  the  United Nations why it supported the embargo, it dropped all  these arguments and maintained only the demand for compensation  for nationalized U.S. interests in Cuba."" Only the United  States is still making problems about the nationalization; in  other countries the problem has been cleared up, according to  him. And the real reason for the embargo? ""The United States  has not forgiven Cuba for shaking off its neocolonial status in  1959 in a traditional sphere of U.S. influence.""    Leon points out that to a large degree Cuba ""is a theme of  domestic politics in the United States. Nearly 1 million Cubans  live in Florida, the state with the fourth biggest electorate in  the United States. The U.S.'s Cuba policy is decided in Miami.  Up to now it was Jorge Mas Canosa who decided this policy.""    Mas Canosa, a businessman originally from Cuba, is  president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a  right-wing, extreme anti-Castro organization. He was the  architect of the tightening of the U.S.'s embargo on Cuba during  the 1992 presidential election campaign. ""That is the core of  the problem,"" says Leon. ""The U.S. policy toward Cuba is  hostage to Cubans in Miami."" Leon does not say ""the"" Cubans in  Miami: he, too, makes a distinction between Cuban exiles who  want to talk to Castro and the ""fanatics"" around Mas Canosa.    How are things in Cuba now? ""The lifting of the embargo  would make it easier to solve our internal problems,"" says Leon,  ""simply because it would be cheaper to import a range of  products.""    Investments    Deputy Minister Allende identifies two priorities: ""We must  seek new markets, and we must encourage foreign investments, for  without these investments we cannot get production up to an  adequate level."" Cuba has rolled out the red carpet for foreign  investors. They can have full ownership of companies and  repatriate profits.    Recently Cuba has been inundated with businessmen eagerly  looking for opportunities. Many made investments, but others  wonder how they can repatriate profits if they cannot convert  their money into foreign currency. Cuba is considering making  the peso convertible, but is still hesitating because that would  entail a large devaluation.    ""For us,two principles cannot be negotiated,"" says  Allende,""and those are our independence and sovereignty; and the  benefits of the revolution, a social security system like that  on which Europe prides itself. And the fundamental sectors of  the economy will not be considered for privatization.""     "

The commission, which has been attacked by the US State Department and by several US legislators, will oversee co-operation in several areas, including trade and the development of the region's sugar cane industry. The agreement, which was signed on Monday, is aimed at increasing the volume of trade between Cuba and Caricom, improvement in sugar cane yields, co-operation in developing livestock and fisheries, and will combine research in biotechnology, particularly for agricultural and technical applications. The commission represents several years of work by the Cuban government to raise the level of contact with its neighbours, many of which have been slow to entertain the Cubans because of concern over a negative reaction from Washington. Mr Ricardo Cabrisas, Cuba's external trade minister, said on Monday that the establishment of the joint commission will allow Caribbean companies to make use of new economic opportunities in Cuba. 'Our economic and commercial space resulting from the opening of our economy is being occupied by capital and markets of diverse origin, and we would not like the Caribbean to arrive too late,' he said. 'We invite the Caribbean not to waste this opportunity to link ourselves more closely and create better conditions with a view towards a future economic integration of the Caribbean.' The region's private sector was told by Mr Edwin Carrington, secretary-general of Caricom, to pursue investment opportunities in Cuba, and in other countries with which Caricom has similar agreements.

0,FT943-1006 ,"FT943-1006 _AN-EI0DNAA4FT 940927   FT  27 SEP 94 / Cubans urged not to forget their sugar: Havana recognises food market reforms are not enough to rescue economy      By PASCAL FLETCHER   In a recent broadcast, Cuban state radio chastised some of the country's sugar workers for spending more time growing food than weeding cane fields. More food is what the government would like - and has announced reforms to encourage - but not at the expense of sugar production. Even if its farm reforms, modelled on those that proved so successful in China and Vietnam, do produce results, boosting sugar production will prove more difficult. But Cuban officials say it is imperative to help haul the country out of its four-year-old recession that has seen the economy's buying power (its capacity to import using available export revenues) contract from USDollars 8bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1993. 'Cuba is a sugar economy . . . . Economic recovery must come through recovery in the sugar harvests,' Mr Octavio Castilla, deputy minister for foreign investment and economic co-operation, said. From this Saturday, Cuba's farmers will gradually start legally selling produce directly to the public. Under reforms detailed last week, state farms and individual growers, excluding sugar co-operatives, will be allowed freely to set their own prices to sell surplus fruit and vegetables after they have fulfilled government supply quotas. The reforms, part of an on-going cautious process of economic liberalisation, are aimed at easing chronic food shortages and combating the flourishing black market. To some extent they amount to the legalisation of an already widespread sale of black market produce by Cuban farmers which has resulted in inflationary black market prices. 'I am sure that with this legislation we can stimulate food production through the law of supply and demand,' Cuban defence minister Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro, said. The strategic sugar sector appears headed for another difficult season. It was one of the areas hardest hit by the unravelling of the comfortable cocoon of preferential trade and aid ties Cuba had enjoyed with the now defunct Soviet bloc. The impact of this economic shock has been compounded by a US trade and financial embargo that remains firmly in place. The 1992-93 sugar harvest, hit by bad weather and shortages of fuel, fertilisers and spares, was only 4.2m tonnes, a 40 per cent drop from the previous season. The 1993-94 crop fell lower still. Cuba put it at just above 4m tonnes. Some international traders said it was even lower. Sugar is not just the island's biggest export earner, accounting for about 40 per cent of total external revenue in 1993. It is also a key commodity to trade for vital oil imports and is closely inter-linked with other sectors such as farming, export rum production and energy generation. As Cuba prepares for the start of the next harvest in November, alarm bells are sounding about sloppy preparations. In unusually frank reports, the state media have criticised poor repairs and maintenance at sugar mills, delays in new cane plantings and the failure of sugar workers to weed growing cane fields. 'One of the most critical points at this time is the sugar harvest,' Mr Castilla said. He said urgent reforms were needed to de-centralise, re-organise and revitalise the sugar sector. Incentives for sugar workers either in the form of bonuses or improved access to necessary consumer goods in exchange for higher productivity, similar to those already introduced in the tourism sector, are being discussed. If this season's harvest is as bad, or worse, than the last, gross earnings from tourism could overtake sugar as the island's leading hard currency earner. The tourism industry, one of the first to be opened to foreign investment, had became more profitable and cost effective as the number of foreign visitors increased. Figures published by Cuba's Centre for Studies on the Cuban Economy show that tourism grossed Dollars 650m in 1993 - net earnings are substantially less because of the imports needed to service the tourist industry - compared with Dollars 720m earned by sugar exports. Besides tourism, foreign investors, especially Mexicans, are putting money into textiles, cement, steel and glass manufacturing, cosmetics production and citrus farming. Canadians are leading the field in the oil exploration and mining sectors. One additional external squeeze will come from the US government's decision on August 20 to restrict dollar remittances sent to relatives in Cuba by Cuban-Americans living in the US. Mr Jose Luis Rodrguez, the finance minister, said this would hurt, but described as 'exaggerated' US reports that the remittances represented Dollars 500m of income for Cuba each year. Over the last 18 months, the government has lifted a ban on Cubans using hard currency, legalised limited private initiative in some trades and crafts and moved to balance the country's lopsided internal finances through cutting subsidies, starting a tax system and raising prices of utilities and consumer goods such as alcohol and cigarettes. 'We're moving, we're not standing about with our arms crossed. There is a process of reform in progress,' Osvaldo Martnez, president of the Cuban parliament's Economy Commission, said. But it is clear the reform process will be cautious and controlled and limited by the government's expressed intention to preserve its one-party socialist system. 'We can't let the process run away from us,' Mr Martnez said. The government's dilemma is that it must move quickly enough to respond to popular pressure in demands for improved economic conditions while not letting the momentum of economic reform wrest centralised control of the economy completely from it hands.

Rodriguez begins by stating that efficiency is not a hollow  slogan and that the struggle to attain efficiency has barely  begun. Sexto states that slogans are good for mobilizing the  masses, but that ""in the economy, slogans are harmful. The  economy is not advanced by slogans because we run the risk of  their becoming hollow. Slogans can be a mask behind which many  people hide their lack of effort or efficiency.""    Sexto stresses that efficiency is vital to all societies and  to overcoming the dire situation Cuba is experiencing. He adds  that development is the result of efficiency, and praises the  Cuban Workers Federation's economic efficiency assemblies' goal  to motivate every worker.    Rodriguez adds: ""In order to make efficiency a viable, truly  attainable goal, the concepts and mechanisms that direct our  economy must change, the concepts and mechanism that today  direct our economy."" He states that it is important to embark on  this path with firmness, ""ensuring that in the future we will  not regret having taken this path.""    Sexto agrees, noting that the current assembly process seeks  to tap the workers' ""subjective reserves"" to solve collective  problems. Sexto also agrees that: ""In order to attain efficiency  in Cuba, certain changes in the economic organization must be  made. I believe certain principles that have been followed for  many years must be changed because one way or another, they have  conditioned our widespread inefficiency. We must admit that Cuba  has done tremendous work over the past 35 years, but I believe  that work could have been even greater. I also believe that a  certain widespread inefficiency has limited that work because  the model and concepts used to direct our economy promoted  inefficiency.""    He goes on to say that only through autonomous management  will the enterprises become efficient: ""...although the word  autonomy scares many people. These people are those who, today,  we identify with the bureaucracy, and for whom autonomy  represents a loss of power."" Sexto and Rodriguez agree that it  is difficult to pinpoint these people because they are people  who are trying to defend the Revolution, but who go about it the  wrong way.    Sexto again emphasizes the importance of autonomous  management for achieving efficiency, citing Ranchuelo's Cigar  Factory as an example. This factory produced the cigars, but did  not market them. That was done by another enterprise, which owed  4 million pesos to the factory. The factory, therefore, had to  seek bank loans to meet its payroll. The marketing enterprise  had no incentive to quickly pay the factory.    Rodriguez focuses on the individual workers' role in  attaining efficiency. Sexto notes that the worker's existence is  fully independent from the result of his labor. ""You well know  that in Cuba, the egalitarian concepts that have tried to make  all workers equal have also created a schism between the worker  and his labor. Whether the lathe worker does good or bad work,  his job is not affected. If the factory is unprofitable, his job  is not affected. He continues to get the same salary. His life  is not changed.""    Sexto reiterates that a link must be established between  performance, and salary or living conditions. Rodriguez agrees,  noting the example of an enterprise in which a manager did not  receive a salary for two months because of his inefficient  performance. Sexto again stresses the importance of the link  between performance and salary. Rodriguez closes by reiterating  that efficiency is not a hollow issue.     "
0,FT944-1129 ,"FT944-1129 _AN-ELVDSABFFT 941222   FT  22 DEC 94 / Cuba cuts budget deficit      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   Cuba says it has managed to cut its bloated budget deficit in a drive to balance the state accounts, seven months after launching financial reforms. But a senior government official said big increases in production and efficiency were still needed to haul the sugar-exporting economy out of the doldrums. Mr Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance minister, told the National Assembly on Tuesday the state budget deficit had been slashed in 1994 to nearly a quarter of its 1993 level. He put the 1994 deficit at 1.4bn pesos (Pounds 897m), 72 per cent lower than the 1993 deficit of just over 5bn pesos. The government had boosted revenues by 25 per cent, largely by raising cigarette and alcohol prices, but also by introducing some taxes and increasing charges in selected public utilities and services. Another big saving was achieved in cutting by nearly 40 per cent state subsidies previously doled out to cover losses in agriculture, basic industry, construction and local government. Improved financial discipline by state companies had also helped to lighten the 1994 budget load. Vice President Carlos Lage said on Saturday he believed the government had managed to check the sharp decline of the economy that followed the collapse after 1990 of trade and aid flows from the former Soviet bloc. The National Assembly on Tuesday approved a budget proposal for 1995 that further cut the deficit to 1bn pesos, on estimated revenues of 11.68bn pesos and projected spending of 12.68bn pesos. While spending on health and education would increase slightly in 1995, the government would further reduce by nearly 35 per cent subsidies to cover losses by state companies and institutions A continuing budget black spot was the heavily subsidised sugar sector, where, following disastrously low harvests in 1993 and 1994, funds still had to be set aside to bankroll struggling sugar cane co-operatives.

Robaina, 38, has assumed the responsibility of directing and  developing Cuba's foreign policy, which he has done from an  offensive position.    [Bernales] What is the restructuring of the Cuban foreign  policy?    [Robaina] I would not speak about restructuring, but about  the need to make a policy in line with the current times. It is  necessary to take into account factors of the new situation in  the world, in the area in which we live, and in our country. We  simply want a foreign policy that reflects the real situation in  the country, which is very difficult and complex, a policy that  should not only envisage our problems but also explain our plan  to the world.    [Bernales] What has been your reaction, as head of your  portfolio, to the designation of a special observer for Cuba by  the UN Human Rights Council?    [Robaina] We have absolutely nothing against the observer,  but we do reject the mechanism because the designation was made  on the basis that human rights are flagrantly and massively  violated in Cuba. For us to accept the observer would mean  agreeing with this position.    [Bernales] Changing the subject, Cuba's foreign trade is  adjusting itself to the international free market system. Cuba  has to adjust itself to the foreign capitalist system in order  to maintain the socialist system on the island. How is this  apparent contradiction being experienced?    [Robaina] It is very complex. For us it is clear that the  point is to adjust ourselves to an economic model whose name I  will not try to specify. If I am asked about it, I reply that  the economic model is Cuban and also feasible. No one asks any  questions about work in the education, scientific, or health  areas. There are, however, major questions on a group of  economic factors that have yielded no results. That is why we  are trying to join a world in which the rules of the game are  different from the ones by which we have traditionally directed  our work. Joining that world, while keeping our own line and  saving the essential factors, is the process on which we have  embarked. It is very hard and very difficult, but by being alive  it has begun to show at least that it exists, and the 100-odd  entrepreneurs -- or non-entrepreneurs -- or the 100-odd  businesses that foreign firms have opened in Cuba prove that we  can trade with the capitalist world without giving up the  socialist plan that we chose. There are difficulties, but it is  possible to trade.    [Bernales] Please make a brief commentary on the progress in  Cuban-Chinese relations.    [Robaina] There are fine relations with China; there is a  high level of exchange and communication, which I believe had  its crowning point with the Chinese president's recent visit to  Cuba. In addition, China has many important experiences that we  have to evaluate, without the idea of mechanically copying them  but with the idea of studying them in order to make progress.    [Bernales] In the past four years, relations with Russia and  with the former Soviet republics had to forcefully change for  Cuba. How are they now?    [Robaina] There is high-level communication with Russia, but  everyone knows that Russia is experiencing a tremendously  complex internal process that has nothing to do with the level  of communications with Cuba. There are more or less normal  relations with the other former Soviet republics. But both the  former Soviet republics and the former socialist countries are  experiencing an internal process that calls for strong  adjustments in order to define some of their foreign policy  guidelines.    [Bernales] How are diplomatic relations with Chile, taking  into account that there is no Cuban embassy in that Andean  country?    [Robaina] Relations and communications are in good shape.  Much noise has been made as to whether we were invited to the  Chilean inauguration. It is an exclusively Chilean matter; they  decided to invite a group of people based on concepts and a  policy that we, like any other country, can respect. We are not  desperate about our diplomatic relations, and we are not trying  to accelerate contacts either. Our communications have reached a  certain level. There is an increasing number of economic links  that can be established. We should not despair. Everything will  come in due time. The time will come when both Chileans and  ourselves will find that conditions are appropriate; there is no  need to hurry. What I can assure you is that having no  ambassadorial-level relations is not an obstacle to fluent  communication.     "

He said: ""Cuba is in very bad economic shape  because its policies are very bad.""    Di Tella confirmed the possibility of a personal meeting  between President Carlos Menem and Castro. He added, however,  that ""conditions are not right"" following the harsh speech by  Castro yesterday.    Di Tella said: ""Yesterday, in the boat (that transported the  presidents to a luncheon) they were together and they chatted.  The same thing may happen again."" Di Tella quickly added,  however, that a formal meeting is unlikely because conditions  are not right. ""Castro's position does not encourage anyone to  speak seriously,"" the minister said    Di Tella talked with Argentine journalists covering the  summit at this city's convention center at noon today. He  recognized that the Argentine Government felt ""very bad"" about  Castro's speech at the end of the ceremony yesterday.    Foreign Minister Di Tella, who does not hide his deep  differences with Castro, said: ""To say Cuba is being persecuted  and that their entire situation is the consequence of U.S.  persecution is like living on the moon.""    Di Tella said: ""Cuba is in very bad economic shape because  its policies are very bad."" The minister added: ""The U.S.  embargo, which the Cubans call a blockade, prevents them from  purchasing from the United States, but not from Canada, Mexico,  or Europe.""    Regarding the situation on the island Di Tella said: ""Their  economy is a mess because of their policy that the state  directs, contracts, and rations everything.""    Di Tella stressed: ""Cuba needs a qualitative change toward  democracy and a change toward a market economy -- which started  to appear but too timidly -- because the situation is on fire.""    He said: ""There is no point in talking about Cuba's entry  into the Inter-American system until these changes take place.  We expect Cuba to join the system later. I hope Castro will  introduce those changes; if not, I think the situation will end  dramatically.""    The foreign minister said: ""We do not want Cuba to be  reincorporated into the OAS before it accepts democracy,""  because the organization ""is a democratic club.""    Di Tella thus answered criticism by Castro against his  counterparts on 7 June for not pronouncing ""a single word  against the United States' criminal blockade"" and for not  reiterating the demand to democratize the island. [sentence as  received]    ""We respect your opinion and you should respect our  opinion,""  said Castro during an impromptu speech last night when answering  the insistent call of various presidents, among them the  Argentine president, to introduce democracy in Cuba.

0,FT943-4894 ,"FT943-4894 _AN-EIGDVAAZFT 940907   FT  07 SEP 94 / Spain seeks liberal moves by Cubans      By TOM BURNS and REUTER      MADRID, LONDON   The Spanish government hopes that Mr Roberto Robana, Cuba's foreign minister, will announce a set of deregulation measures for the domestic economy during a six-day visit to Spain from today. Officials are hoping that, in what would be a significant shift towards a market economy in Cuba, the minister will give a timetable for the removal of curbs on self-employment in Cuba, with an undertaking to close state-owned industries which are no longer viable. Failure by Mr Robana to do so could prompt Madrid to rethink its open-door policy towards Cuba. Employment deregulation is one of several policies that has been pressed on the Cuban government by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spanish former finance minister, who has visited Havana twice in the past year after an agreement by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister, to provide President Fidel Castro with a senior economic counsellor. Mr Solchaga, whose representatives have held working sessions in Havana between his trips, has consistently told the Cubans that their critical financial troubles owe far more to their state-controlled economy than to the US economic embargo, which Spain has always opposed. When it set up Mr Solchaga's mission, Madrid believed a comprehensive package of economic reforms in Cuba would lead to a transition to political pluralism. Cuba is the main recipient of Spanish aid in Latin America, in direct subsidies and export credits. Recent Spanish investment, chiefly in tourism, is estimated at some Dollars 200m (Pounds 129m). Even so, the former minister's recommendations have been largely ignored and the Spanish government, wary of accusations that it is legitimising Mr Castro's government, now wants to relinquish its advisory role in favour of a panel of experts from the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, who met Mr Castro in early August and will hold talks with Mr Robana today, has hardened Spain's diplomatic language, saying that economic liberalisation alone is insufficient and the Cuban government must take 'urgent' and 'rapid' steps towards democracy. Reuter adds in London: The UK government, welcoming recent changes in the Cuban economy, said yesterday it was sending a minister to Havana for the first time in 19 years. Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, will make a three-day visit to the island from Monday, with a group of British businessmen, in an attempt to increase UK-Cuban trade.

According to EL MUNDO and as can be deduced from the report  presented in the summer of 1993 to Castro by Carlos Solchaga,  former Spanish economy minister, the Spanish Government advised  Castro to implement a rapid transition to capitalism. According  to the newspaper, Castro was also especially upset because  Solchaga does not make the slightest mention of the U.S.  blockade, blaming the Cuban system alone for the serious crisis  affecting the island.    Carlos Solchaga's secret report recommends that Castro  implement immediate reform in three areas: privatization of all  commercial sectors and industries; reduction of state  intervention to a minimum by introducing a market economy with a  Western-style fiscal system; and allowing the free economic  initiative of Cuban and foreign individuals and companies.    EL MUNDO goes on to say that Solchaga contradicts one of the  Castro's main theories, according to which Cuba can overcome the  crisis through the development of two profitable and  well-organized economic activities -- tourism and sugar sales.  EL MUNDO notes, citing Solchaga's report, that ""the stagnation  of the remaining productive sectors would prevent the chosen  sectors from developing.""    In its study of the Cuban ecomony, the Solchaga report says  that the Castro government has been unable to generate wealth  because of political factors. In his research, Solchaga refers  to the situation of the Cuban economy as disastrous, emphasizing  that ""galloping inflation"" and ""huge budget deficits"" have  paralyzed the country.    According to EL MUNDO, Fidel Castro is aware that the  economic changes proposed by the Spanish Government and the IMF  would lead to a transition to democracy and pluralism. EL MUNDO  notes that time and again Castro has explained that he will  never give up the Communist Party's monopoly on power. Instead,  he insists that ""Cuba must learn from China and Vietnam.""  According to Castro, Cuba's future lies in ""a democratic  dictatorship like the ones in China and Vietnam, which have not  abandoned the Marxist-Leninist doctrine.""    The document submitted by Spain has broken the usual  unanimity within the Cuban system. According to EL MUNDO,  Carlos Lage -- in charge of the Communist Party's financial  affairs and third in command -- considers that the Spanish  recommendation for transition is a valid option     "
0,FT933-12676 ,"FT933-12676 _AN-DGWCHAA4FT 930723   FT  23 JUL 93 / Castro looks to the dollar for help: Legalising foreign exchange aimed at saving economy      By DAMIAN FRASER   FOR 30 years no Cuban has legally possessed a US dollar or any other foreign currency because of a law as much an instrument of economic control as defiant symbol of Cuban nationalism. But with the economy in ruins and recent measures at resuscitating it having failed, President Fidel Castro is looking for salvation from the former enemy. His government is set to legalise the possession of all foreign currency, perhaps his most significant market economic reform yet. Mr Castro first aired the proposal at the end of last month before the Cuban parliament. Last week Mr Carlos Lage, the reform-minded minister in charge of the economy, made it official. He told visiting foreign businessmen that new laws legalising possession and use of dollars would soon be presented to parliament. Currency convertibility is being proposed partly in the hope that it might encourage the 1m Cuban-Americans to send hundreds of millions of dollars a year to impoverished relatives in Cuba. Under US law, an American citizen can send a relative in Cuba up to Dollars 300 (Pounds 200) a quarter. But the political consequences would be far-reaching. While Cubans are increasingly using dollars as the only currency of value, and buying goods with it on the black market, the proposed reform would cause the government to cede control over the distribution of wealth. A Communist party apparatchik may find himself worse off than a dissident with generous donors in Miami. The details of the law have still to be made public. Still, Mr Lage told foreign journalists that they would have an 'undeniable social impact, giving certain persons independence and access to goods, and create divisions that have not been customary since the revolution'. Cuban officials accompanying the visiting businessmen earlier sketched out a scheme where a Cuban would swap the donated dollars for dollar vouchers, with which he could buy goods in 'dollar shops', while giving the government much needed foreign currency. As long as such dollar shops offered fair prices, the black market would lose much of its point. Eventually the so-called parallel market in non-rationed goods, which closed in 1991 because of the economic crisis, might open again with all transactions carried out in dollars. The reforms, as one European diplomat commented in Havana, would constitute a necessary step in creating market prices for all non-rationed goods. With prices pegged to dollars in the parallel (non-rationed) market, it is likely the peso would be devalued from the official rate of one to one. Even now, because of an informal 'dollarisation' of the economy, one dollar buys 60 pesos in the black market. At this exchange rate, the typical monthly salary now buys between Dollars 2 and Dollars 4 - or two to four bottles of cooking oil on the black market. With peso salaries worth so little, the government might come under pressure to liberalise wages and allow workers, such as farmers, to sell some of their goods freely. While Mr Lage said wages would not be set in dollars, he pointedly did not exclude a return to the free market in some farm products that existed for a while in the mid-1980s. He said the latest economic opening 'was not part of a definite or final end but part of an on-going process'. The willingness to legalise the dollar and risk the political costs is a measure of the dire state of the Cuban economy and of the failure so far of a limited economic opening to improve conditions. The overtures to foreign capital are believed to have brought in just Dollars 500m over the past couple of years, according to Mr Andrew Zimbalist, a Cuba expert at Smith College, Massachusetts. This is a fraction of the annual aid and subsidies Cuba used to receive from the former Soviet bloc. Since the collapse of the Soviet bloc in 1989, the Cuban economy is reckoned to have shrunk by about half, while imports have fallen from Dollars 8.1bn to Dollars 2.2bn last year. This year the economy is likely to be reduced by another 10 per cent, says Mr Zimbalist, in part because of this year's wretched sugar crop, which is forecast at 4.2m tonnes, 40 per cent down from last year. While the disintegrating economy has yet to provoke signs of overt and organised opposition to Mr Castro, daily life is becoming increasingly difficult. Electricity blackouts from anything up to eight hours are common, Havana residents often wait three hours for a bus, and basic necessities such as soap and cooking oil are unavailable in shops for weeks at a time. The lack of spare parts and energy means most factories are closed, as attested by thousands of people roaming Havana streets in working hours apparently with nothing to do. A recent outbreak of more than 45,000 cases of a neural disease that can cause blindness has been attributed in part to malnutrition.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

Mendiandua]    [Text] Havana, 31 Mar (PL) -- Relations between Cuba and  Mexico are diverse, exhibit mutual respect, and have a very  encouraging future in terms of joint ventures and  technical-scientific cooperation, Mexican Ambassador Carlos  Tello asserted here today.    The diplomat said he was optimistic about the future of  bilateral ties with Cuba after having assumed responsibility for  the Mexican mission in Havana in February.    Tello, who is an economist and a professor with a  comprehensive professional vitae, revealed he had already  attended several economic and technical-scientific cooperation  meetings in the few weeks he has been in Cuba.    Regarding reciprocal assistance, he said a mission from the  Mexican Science and Technology Council had recently visited Cuba  and signed an agreement with the State Economic and  Scientific-Technical Cooperation Committee to increase  scientific ties.    According to this agreement, oceanographers, engineers, and  other specialists have agreed to carry out joint studies and to  help each other in specific projects.    Furthermore, the ambassador added, active exchanges between  the universities of the two countries are continuing and a  history seminar for specialists was held just a few days ago.    To give one example of developing relations in the field of  education, Tello noted that a group from the clinic school,  which travels to different parts of the world, recently visited  Cuba to exchange student experiences.    Asked about Mexico's response to Cuba's policy on opening to  foreign investments, Tello said this area is very promising, and  he revealed there are agreements to set up joint ventures to  produce cement and glass.    We are currently negotiating two very important agreements,  the ambassador stressed. One is a comprehensive agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other communications systems which could amount to more than $1  billion. [PRENSA LATINA in Spanish at 2023 GMT on 1 April  transmits a similar report prefaced with a parenthetical note  asking PRENSA LATINA offices to ""substitute"" the new article for  the one printed here. The new report is identical to the first,  with two changes. The first is a rewording of this paragraph so  that it reads: ""We are currently negotiating an agreement on  telephone systems, satellite communications, telex, fax, and  other matters related to this field, the value of which could  exceed $1 billion, the ambassador said."" In addition, the  following paragraph has been deleted and the item continues with  paragraph 11.]    The other is the signing of a letter of intent between the  Cuban Government and Mexpetrol to refine approximately 60,000  barrels of crude oil at the Cienfuegos refinery, located in the  country's central region, as well as to manufacture byproducts  that will be sold in the domestic and international markets.    In terms of tourism -- an industry in which the Mexicans are  giving advice to the Cubans -- Mexico and Cuba have signed  agreements to operate hotels such as the Tuxpan, Granma, and the  Old Man and the Sea.    Likewise, Carlos Tello explained that Cuba provides medical,  biotechnology, and social security assistance to Mexico.    Also, both nations continue to exchange experiences,  expertise, and specialists in agriculture, fisheries, and sugar  production, which has resulted in mutual benefits.    The diplomat expressed regret over the current level of  trade, which totalled approximately $124 million in 1992, and he  indicated that there are obstacles, like Cuba's debt with Mexico  and the shortage of freely convertible currency.    The fall of Eastern Europe's socialist bloc was a hard blow  to the Cuban economy because 85 percent of the island's trade  was conducted with this region, a region from which it also  imported 90 percent of its crude oil.    Tello stressed that when these difficulties are overcome,  trade between the two countries will increase several times over.     "

The three brands are Monte Cristo, H. Upmann and Por Larranaga. According to Seita, France's largest tobacco goods distributor, these marques comprise about 50 per cent of French Cuban cigar imports of 7.7m. However, Cuba pledged yesterday that the court ban would not deprive connoisseur French smokers of their cigars. Cubatabaco, the state tobacco agency, said it would send other prestigious Havana brands to replace the three banned names. Mr Patrick Clayeux, a senior manager for Seita, said yesterday the company would stop distributing the three brands on August 14. All retail sales must stop by September 7. Surplus stocks would be withdrawn from retail outlets. In addition, Seita is obliged to stop production of Mini-Montecristo 'whiff' cigars, manufactured in France with imported raw Cuban tobacco. The landmark lawsuit, settled recently in a French appeals court ruling, stems from a dispute over the ownership of the three famous brands, whose proprietors fled Cuba following the 1959 revolution. Cuba, under Cubatabaco, has continued their manufacture since. In 1976, the former owners sold the marques to Cuban Cigar Brands (Curacao) of the US, which launched the orginal challenge in various international courts. CCB in the late 1980s sold the non-US use of the brand names to Tabacalera, the Spanish distributor, which now controls them for all non-US business. Mr Clayeux said that officials from Seita, Tabacalera and Cubatabaco had held a series of meetings to enable the French group to resume sales, but the dispute remained unresolved. Cuba's struggling economy earns Dollars 100m a year from tobacco exports.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Copa]    [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (DPA) -- Cuba is determined to  continue with its nuclear plans even though the construction of  its most important project, the Juragua Electronuclear Plant,  temporarily suspended in 1992, has yet to resume. In response to  a question asked by a DPA reporter, an Executive Secretariat for  Nuclear Affairs (SEAN) source said the country's plan was  drafted with multifaceted goals.    In 1983, Cuba began building two 440-megawatt nuclear energy  reactors in the area of Cienfuegos, on the south-central coast  of the island approximately 300 km east of Havana. On 5  September 1992, when President Fidel Castro announced the halt  of ""the construction of the century,"" one of the reactors was 90  percent completed and scheduled to begin operating in late 1995  or early 1996, while the other one was only 20 or 30 percent  completed.    The project, which is estimated to have involved an  investment of $1.1 billion, would have been a big relief for  Cuban authorities, who lack hard money to buy the necessary oil  for the operational use of their thermoelectric plants.    For his part, Dr. Daniel Cordoniu, executive deputy  secretary  of the SEAN, said that, together with nuclear energy (production  of electricity stemming from the fusion of the atom) [passage as  received], another method being developed is the use of  radioisotopes and radiation in diverse fields. In addition to  being used in biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, and  health, which are priority areas in the country, these nuclear  techniques are being applied both in the food program and in  open support of diverse industries, the researcher said recently  on Cubavision's ""Open Agenda"" program. In that sense, he also  mentioned other areas, such as nickel-bearing, sugar, and oil  industries, without ruling out the use of nuclear techniques in  environmental activities related to tourism.    Engineer Gilberto Salazar, who is also executive vice  secretary of the SEAN, praised the production of  radiopharmaceuticals (components that are introduced into the  body for diagnostic and therapeutical purposes), which have  permitted substituting imports in 1993. He explained that this  progress was achieved by the Center of Applied Studies to  Nuclear Development (CEADEN), which is also taking part in  preparing certain components.    That technique is virtually irreplaceable in the studies of  absorption, distribution, metabolism, and the excretion of  medicine (pharmacodynamics), which is essential for registering  new medicines, Salazar stated. After noting that the  preservation of the Juragua plant has been achieved  satisfactorily with the Basic Industries Ministry as investor,  Codorniu confirmed that alternatives are being sought to  complete the project. Cuba and Russia are willing to contribute  foreign capital to put the Juragua plant in operation, which  will net the island a savings of over 800,000 tons of oil  annually.    Diplomatic sources in Havana and Moscow agreed that there is  great interest in this regard and that French authorities  apparently are considering possibly financing the project  jointly with Russia. The weekly GRANMA INTERNACIONAL, which is  edited in Spanish, English, and French, recently revealed that  the Russian Government granted the island a $30 million loan to  maintain the project. The necessary funding to obtain an  automation system for the plant's only reactor, however, is  pending.     "

Havana had repeatedly said the plant was able to provide adequate power for new industrial and commercial ventures on the island, ending the energy shortage which has crippled economic life. Cuba's oil supplies have fallen sharply since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main source of petroleum products. President Fidel Castro has said the decision to suspend work was temporary. Russia had been making unacceptable demands on Cuba for support in completing the plant. The differences, say diplomats, centred on Russia's decision that its contribution should be on a commercial basis. The Cubans were uncertain about access to fuel for the plant. It is unlikely any other country will offer to complete the project. With Cuba's domestic oil output at only 5 per cent of the 10m tonnes it needs each year, Havana will be pressed to convince prospective investors the island represents a viable business location without the power station. The plant, at Jurugua in Cienfuegos Province, has been frequently delayed by technical problems. It was based on four 417MW reactors, but was planned to start with two reactors two years ago. The decision to suspend construction is likely to be greeted with relief by Cuba's Caribbean neighbours. Claims by defecting Cuban scientists that it was unsafe had forced several Caribbean governments to raise questions about the effect on the region of a nuclear accident in the wake of the disaster at a similar plant in Chernobyl. The Cubans denied their plant was faulty and invited foreign experts to examine it.  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

In an  exclusive interview by our reporter (Carea Bermudes), Lage  stresses the importance of the trip.    [Lage] ""We are very satisfied with the trip. I believe the  meetings we held with the presidents of the three countries were  excellent. We established an excellent channel of communication  and I think the opportunities represented by these meetings are  very important for us. We had the occasion to explain our  situation, what we are doing, the measures we are adopting, and  the importance of the struggle against the U.S. blockade under  current conditions.    ""We met not only with the presidents of those countries, but  also with other officials, with ministers and businessmen. I  think the environment is very positive for strengthening current  political, economic, and commercial relations with the countries  we visited. The fruit of this positive environment was the  visits to those countries, and I believe these visits can  contribute to improving relations.    [(Bermudes)] ""In your opinion, what were the highlights of  those visits?    [Lage] ""I think the most outstanding points were the respect  for the Cuban Revolution, the interest in our country's  situation, the increasing awareness of the need to fight against  the U.S. blockade, an understanding of the measures the country  is adopting to adjust itself to current circumstances, and the  possibility that the measures we are adopting can lead to  greater economic integration with Latin America. I think one of  the main results of the visits is the thrust we are giving to  inviting investment in the Cuban economy and strengthening  economic and commercial ties, as well as opening new  possibilities for the export of Cuban products to those  countries of the region.""    Colombian Ambassador to Cuba (Ricardo Santamaria) also  returned to Havana. He participated in Lage's visit to Colombia.  Santamaria also conveyed his opinion to this station.    [(Santamaria)] ""I would say that the visit was very positive  because bilateral relations were strengthened, especially in the  area of business. Vice President Lage met with Colombian  businessmen, six ministers, and President Gaviria. We must also  mention the visit of Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and  the reestablishment of relations. We hope that after this visit,  we will be able to arrange a visit to Cuba between Colombian  businessmen and various ministers for closer identification of  points of cooperation.

[Lage] The adverse situation we have been facing ever since  the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union's  disintegration is not a result of the suspension of Soviet  assistance in itself, but the result of the loss of markets, the  lack of fair prices, and the lack of mutually favorable economic  and trade exchange conditions. Today we must face major  disadvantages in our relations with the world. The hardening of  the U.S. blockade and the pressures of all types applied by the  United States against companies and governments make our access  to credits difficult and undermine our efforts in the areas of  trade and capital investment.    [Rodrigues] What is the country doing to survive?    [Lage] We are seeking new markets, new sources of capital,  new technologies, and new paths for development conceived in the  context of a community of nations that will disappear as a  community, and in some cases nations that will disappear as  nations. Meanwhile, we took some measures anticipating a virtual  dismantling of the USSR even before it collapsed, such as  increasing our exports and the replacement, as much as possible,  of imported products by national products. We also gave  incentives to savings in all fields and we urged a more rational  use of available resources, particularly in the area of energy.    [Rodrigues] What are the embargo's most visible results?    [Lage] This will give you an idea of the sanctions' impact.  In 1989 our imports totalled $8.2 billion. Three years later  they were only worth $2.2 million [figures as published] and  today they continue shrinking. We had to reduce our imports 70  percent in only four years. And ours is an economy that depends  on foreign trade to develop. We had to reduce the importation of  vital products such as oil.    [Rodrigues] Cuba has not implemented such a deep program of  changes in its economic structures as is being planned today  since the transformation that accompanied the 1959 revolution.  Is there a model that is being used as a basis?    [Lage] It is being mistakenly said abroad that Cuba must  present a program of economic reorganization. We already have a  model, the socialist model.    [Rodrigues] What is changing in Cuba in light of the new  world economic context?    [Lage] For instance, it was necessary to adopt a group of  urgent measures to transform our foreign trade system and  reorient it to facilitate the search for new markets for our  products. That is something easy to say but very difficult and  complicated to implement, particularly considering that 85  percent of our trade involved the Soviet Union and the other  East European countries before 1989. We had to hurry to find  markets for our sugar, nickel, and citrus, always having present  the U.S. blockade's increasing pressure in each operation.  Already operating in the country are 476 foreign commercial  firms from nearly 40 countries, some of them with their own  independent representation and others that are represented  through national state and private companies. We also have  sponsored a process of opening for foreign capital and allowed  various kinds of associations, such as mixed enterprises in the  tourist area.    [Rodrigues] But those changes are purely capitalistic,  making  the failure of the economic model conceived by the socialist  system obvious, are they not?    [Lage] We cannot speak of a failure of the socialist system  in Cuba. We found ourselves suddenly submerged in a crisis that  originated abroad, that came from outside. With that I do not  want to say that our model does not have insufficiencies,  deficiencies, and mistakes. But the crisis was provoked by  external factors, not internal reasons. And the situation was  aggravated by the U.S. blockade of the country. Despite it all,  we are determined to show that the Cuban socialist model not  only did not fail, but it continues to be active and is seeking  to get consolidated. We know our model is not perfect, but it  has achieved many good things.    [Rodrigues] Does the economic opening have a limit?    [Lage] Practically all productive areas of the economy are  open to possible associations with foreign investors.  Regrettably, we cannot give details. Our experience forces us to  use discretion to avoid pressures against entrepreneurs who  might be interested in investing in Cuba. Today we can speak of  an increased opening in the sense that some negotiations that  were unthinkable only three years ago are being carried out  today.    [Rodrigues] What countries are Cuba's main economic partners  today?    [Lage] Our main partners are Russia, China, Spain, Canada,  Italy, and France.     "

Mr Vasili Severin, head of the sugar production department at the Russian agriculture ministry, told Itar-Tass that only four of 95 refineries were functioning because of a shortfall of raw sugar. He said refineries had last year received only 4m tonnes of the 7.5m tonnes of raw sugar they were supposed to receive under the state plan. His deputy, Mr Anatoly Kholudov, said that the 'situation with sugar was serious' and that supplies would be worse this year than last. But he added that some more plants would be opened in March to process imported supplies. Mr Severin said the first shipments would arrive from Cuba and France in late February. Prodintorg, a state trading body, said it was talking with more potential suppliers but declined to give details. Mr Boris Orlov, head of the government's department for agricultural products, said that sugar refining was a seasonal process and that only a few more refineries would be open at this time of year any way. 'The plants usually function for three to four months starting in September.' He said Russia required 7m tonnes of raw sugar this year, some of which would materialise only this autumn. He said the shortfall was caused by producers' refusal to sell raw sugar to the state because they were waiting for prices to rise. They had sold their raw sugar to private markets instead. Mr Alexei Ulyuakev, an adviser to the Russian government, said earlier this week the government was considering liberalising from next month the prices of sugar and vegetable oil, two commodities which are in particularly short supply in the shops.

Alarcon began today in Bonn the most important part of his  five-day official visit to Germany at the invitation of German  National Assembly (Bundestag) President Rita Sussmuth. Alarcon  spent the first two days of his tour in the northern city-state  of Bremen. Alarcon, a former foreign minister, will meet with  top officials during his stay. Minister Bernd Schmidbauer, who  is from the office of Prime Minister Helmut Kohl and is the man  in charge of coordinating Germany's secret services, will be one  of Alarcon's interlocutors. These gestures, however, do not  represent an opening on the German side, Alarcon's interlocutors  indicated. ""To do that, we would need to see a decision to  change from Cuba, something we are not seeing,"" highly placed  sources stated in Bonn.    The German Government would like to help Cubans with broader  bilateral cooperation programs, ""but so far we have not seen the  conditions necessary to do that,"" German authorities stated.  ""Cuban-German relations are therefore marked by a certain  sentiment of ambiguity.""    The ANPP president met first with Bundestag Vice President  Hans Klein (of the co-ruling Christian Social Union), and later  with members of the Christian Democratic Union bloc.    Klein told DPA about a Cuban-German ""joint venture"" in  tourism. He noted, however, that ""the realization of decisive  German-Cuban bilateral cooperation projects depends  fundamentally on the legal system and economic conditions in  Cuba.""    A group of Bundestag deputies in charge of relations with  Central America and the Caribbean will host a lunch in Alarcon's  honor at the headquarters of Bonn's Parliamentary Society.  Earlier the Cuban official met with Deputy Gregor Gysi, chief  of the Party of Democratic Socialism bloc, the political  successor of the East German Communist Party.    Alarcon told DPA that Cuba ""must make a series of changes in  its economy but does not seek to change the basic elements of  its political project, which is socialism.""    On relations with the EU, Alarcon said he was convinced that  ""they are headed in the right direction at the bilateral level,  as well as with Europe as a whole, and we hope to conclude soon  an overall cooperation agreement with the EU.""    For the German Government and legislature, however, the  ideas  of the EU Executive Committee about Cuba ""do not constitute an  opening, either.""    Europeans are convinced that Cuba must first reach an  agreement with the United States before the EU doors are opened.  Meanwhile, ""these will be the only gestures of support that  Cubans will receive from us. Those gestures, however, will not  manage to resolve the catastrophic situation that the nation is  experiencing.""    Tourism will not solve Cuba's problems, either. The German  authorities are not opposed to any kind of increase in the  number of tourists to Cuba or investments by German companies in  hotel or vacation centers, ""but capital does not flow to places  where there is no guarantee of stability,"" Klein added.    Over 60,000 Germans went to Cuba on vacation last year. For  Cuba, German tourists constitute the second largest group of  visitors in the world and the first in Europe. ""But all of this  is not going to save the country,"" Bonn government sources  stated.    Cubans are ""nice, welcome, highly qualified, and seeking  cooperation, but deep down that cannot happen so long as they  maintain their same policy,"" the sources concluded.     "

[Alfonso] ""He expressed our solidarity and said we share in  their sorrow at this sad and difficult moment that Central  America [as heard] is experiencing following the (?tragedy) in  Huila and Cauca. As you know, a series of tremors have rocked  that area and have resulted in heavy damage. In his letter, the  commander in chief expresses to President Gaviria our feelings  of fraternal understanding and adds that we share in their  sorrow.

The commander in chief has placed this unit at the  disposal of the Colombian authorities should they need it.""    I must add that the Cuban Public Health Ministry has formed  the unit. Through its spokesman, the Cuban Foreign Ministry  also expressed its pleasure with the recent statements by  various international organizations regarding the lifting of the  U.S. blockade against Cuba. Miguel Alfonso spoke, in  particular, of Resolution 356 approved by the SELA [Latin  American Economic System] Council.    [Alfonso] ""This resolution is significant because it is the  first time that SELA has approved a resolution directly  rejecting something. As you know, SELA is an economic  organization and all Latin American countries are members of  this organization which Cuba helped found in 1970. This  resolution, a copy of which you will receive shortly, not only  supports the recent resolution issued by the UN General Assembly  [UNGA] -- as you know, the UNGA approved its resolution in  November -- but it also strongly urges the United States to lift  the economic, commercial, and financial blockade on Cuba.""    Likewise, Miguel Alfonso talked about the two paragraphs of  the final declaration issued by the Nonaligned Movement's [NAM]  ministerial meeting held in Cairo, Egypt.    [Alfonso] ""Paragraph 161 strongly urges the expeditious and  efficient implementation of the resolution that was approved not  only in [words indistinct] but also in 1992 by the UNGA  regarding the U.S. blockade of Cuba.    ``There is another paragraph [words indistinct] in which the  NAM foreign ministers call on the developed countries to put an  end to the generic implementation of all the unilateral coercive  measures against developing countries.    ``I believe it is important we view this within a single  context. These are not isolated things. The Cuban Foreign  Ministry has observed that the international community is more  frequently repudiating this measure which for more than 30 years  has been affecting not only the economy but also the human  rights of the Cuban people.''    Alfonso also talked about the various lobbying actions  conducted on Thursday by several U.S. congressmen, academicians,  politicians, and members of nongovernmental organizations in  favor of the lifting of the blockade.    [Alfonso] ""I believe that the most important of these  actions  was the discussion of Cuba held in the U.S. Congress, specially  in the U.S. Senate amphitheater. They talked about the  situation the blockade creates for Cuba. The people who  organized the day for lobbying in the United States had planned  to hold approximately 35 meetings with U.S. congressmen,  senators and members of the House of Representatives, to explain  to them the impact the blockade has on Cuba and the need to  adopt legislative and other measures to ensure that the blockade  becomes something of the past.""    In responding to several questions asked by reporters,  Miguel Alfonso, spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, talked  about recent statements made by the Honduran foreign minister,  which were favorable for Cuba.    [Alfonso] ""We have been seeing a series of reactions lately  and it has become evident that it is no longer true that Cuba is  isolated or that it is a country that cannot muster support and  understanding from other countries. These reactions are coming  not only from countries in the area, but from outside the  continent as well.""    Alfonso was also asked to appraise the meaning of the  possibility that the Canadian Government will lift its embargo  on Cuba.    [Alfonso] ""We have learned that the Canadian Government will  formally announce it will renew the aid it stopped a few years  ago. This is significant because Cuba is confronting an  economic situation and it does not take a genius to see that it  is a difficult economic situation. This decision will  contribute to improving the standard of living of the Cuban  people. All aid to Cuba is very welcome.""    These were some of the statements made by Miguel Alfonso,  spokesman for the Cuban Foreign Ministry, during a meeting with  the local and foreign media.     "

Ciefuegos dedicated the specialized fair and noted the  presence of more than 600 firms, -- 155 of them local, from 22  countries, including Spain, Canada, Mexico, Italy, and Germany,  which are also the countries whose citizens travel to the island  the most.    The minister said: We hope all tourist and marketing  enterprises will secure service and supply contracts in this  sector of the economy during Tecnotour '94.    The tourism industry is considered strategic in pulling the  island out of the economic crisis it has been facing for more  than four years.    Regarding the presence of foreign firms, Cienfuegos noted  that most of them have relations with Cuba and that the new ones  are trying to establish them.    Shortly after cutting the inaugural ribbon at the exposition  pavilion in this capital's Convention Palace , Cienfuegos and  other representatives of the Cuban Government walked through  part of the 4,680-square meter fair area and spoke with some of  the exhibitors.    He spoke with Eduardo Adam, representative in Cuba of Farma  Venda, an Italian enterprise that occupies approximately 100  square meters of the fair exhibiting cosmetics, clothes,  appliances, and food.    At the fair, foreign visitors have the opportunity to talk,  make contacts, and sign new agreements with Cuban entities.  Czechoslovakia and Costa Rica are the newcomers to this tourist  technology round, which will last until 29 May.    The Latin America countries with the largest number of  exhibitors in Tecnotour '94 are Mexico with nine firms; Chile  with four; Panama with three; Venezuela with two; and Costa  Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Peru with one each.

0,FT924-8185 ,"FT924-8185 _AN-CKLB2ADYFT 921112   FT  12 NOV 92 / Book Review: Castro's ticking clock      By STEPHEN FIDLER   CASTRO'S FINAL HOUR By Andres Oppenheimer Simon  Schuster, Dollars 25, 462 pages CUBA AFTER COMMUNISM By Eliana Cardoso and Ann Helwege The MIT Press, Dollars 24.95 in Europe (Dollars 17.95 in US), 148 pages Fidel Castro, leader of the Cuban revolution and head of one of the few remaining hard-line communist states, is now courting foreign capitalists in an attempt to sustain the island's economy and his grip on power. Since the fall of his Soviet benefactors, which removed a vital source of aid and trade, Castro's regime has struggled to find the hard currency it needs to import food and the luxury goods required by its tourist industry. Though it has had some success in attracting investment through joint ventures in tourism, other initiatives have been less successful. A lack of clear rules about property rights is one important reason. Castro seems to think he can create islands of capitalism in a socialist state. But seeking to encourage profit-seeking companies from abroad while repressing local entrepreneurs is contradictory and unlikely to work, as these two books make clear. 'Attracting capital to modernise and expand Cuba's productive capacity requires privatisation. Joint ventures alone will not do the job. Cuba needs more than big hotels; it needs everything from hot-dog stands to fax machine outlets,' say Cardoso and Helwege, two US academics. Castro's willingness to get close to foreign capitalists shows his pragmatic nature. Expelling foreign investors was, after all, one of the tenets of his revolution. However, he has opposed the measure that would do most to increase Cuba's own food output: allowing smallholders to sell surplus food at market prices. Castro tried this in the early 1980s, but banned it again in 1986. Perhaps the main reason for his change of heart was a fear that further development of the market would have proved impossible for him to control. In this respect - the preservation of control - Castro's political acumen should not be underestimated. According to Oppenheimer, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist on the Miami Herald, Castro understood long before most of his subordinates the threat posed by Gorbachev's reforms for the Soviet Union and, by extension, for Cuba. Castro has also been skilful in his dealings with the opposition. By allowing opponents to leave the country, he has deprived the growing numbers of disaffected Cubans of a focus. The vociferous right-wing exiles may think of themselves as the country's next leaders, but they have little support inside Cuba. For one thing, as Oppenheimer points out, Cuba is overwhelmingly black and the exiles overwhelmingly white. Greater equality between races was one of the achievements of Castro's revolution. The others - good healthcare and education and reasonably fair distribution of income - have set it apart from the rest of Latin America. But much of this was made possible by big subsidies from the Soviet Union and now the subsidies have gone. Castro's Final Hour does a fine job of reporting recent developments in Cuba, some little known until now. Oppenheimer has pieced together, for example, the politicking behind the Fourth Communist Party Congress in 1991. Reform-minded party members in Cuba had hoped that this would start the process of change; instead Castro blocked reform. Since then, the Cuban regime has become more repressive. Cuba After Communism looks forward to what Castro could do to avoid a violent end to his revolution and what action the world should take to ensure a peaceful transformation in Cuba. Both books forcefully outline Castro's dilemma. He could embrace reform wholeheartedly, and risk losing control of the country but perhaps preserve some social benefits of the revolution. Or he could take the course he seems to have decided upon: make minor adjustments but allow no big change to the economic structure. Both books agree this will not be enough; in all probability, it will bring the economy closer to collapse and the revolution to a violent denouement. Oppenheimer's book convincingly argues that Castro's Cuba cannot survive in its current form. However, despite its somewhat hyperbolic title, it fails to make the case that the end is necessarily imminent. Castro's character suggests that, anachronistic as his regime may now seem, he is unlikely to give up. He has been in even more desperate straits. His tiny band of 82 men was routed soon after landing in Cuba in 1956. But the men regrouped and gradually expanded their influence. Nor are there obvious leaders to organise a rebellion - since Castro has neutralised them - or mechanisms through which popular discontent could be expressed. Those who want to see Castro ousted must therefore await a spontaneous revolt, the unlikely prospect of foreign military intervention or his death. Castro is only 67 years old; the final hour could yet be a long one.  The Financial Times   London Page 20  "

Source is listed in parentheses following each item:    Radio Reloj at 2040 GMT on 24 January reports that  accelerated repairs are being made at the Republica Dominican  Mill in Carlos Manuel de Cespedes municipality, Camaguey  Province. Originally, the Rebublica Dominicana Mill was not  scheduled to participate in the grinding in Camaguey this  harvest. It was later decided that the mill would participate  ""because of the importance to the nation to produce as much  sugar as possible.""    Radio Reloj at 2042 GMT on 24 January notes that production  in Matanzas Province has decreased. According to a statistical  study, the province produced 777 million pesos' worth of goods  in 1993, which was 71 percent of the amount that had been  projected. ""In comparison with a similar earlier period,  Matanza's economy showed a decline of almost 21 points, felt  most strongly in the sugar industry.""    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 25 January reports that 400  caballerias of tobacco have been planted in Pinar del Rio. Some  4,000 students are participating in the planting.    Radio Reloj Network at 2030 GMT on 25 January reports in its  30-minute newscast that:    The plant at the Ignacio Agramonte Sugar Mill that produces  the product called ""sorbitol,"" a sugarcane by-product, produced  over 300 tons of the product in 1993. ""Sorbitol"" is used in  making toothpaste, diet foods, pharmaceuticals, and other  things. The plant has the capacity to produce 10,000 tons a year  in the Villa Clara and Camaguey plants. Also obtained were 217  tons of glucose.    The local industries of Contramaestre municipality, Santiago  de Cuba Province, brought in 5 million pesos for the state in  1993. ""Esteban Lazo, secretary general of the Communist Party of  Cuba for the province, urged local industries to improve quality  and design, and to increase prodcution of certain very important  products, such as shoes for school children, workers, and the  population in general.""    ""Over 13 million passengers were transported within Matanzas  in 1993 thanks to the efforts of the state inspectors, who also  created a favorable atmosphere for moving some 1,000 metric tons  of various types of merchandise. During that period, the more  than 230 men and women commonly known as `yellows' [because of  the color of their uniforms] collected slightly more than 1  million pesos and made use of over 1 million vehicles belonging  to enterprises and organizations."" They were assisted by around  70 volunteers.    There have been 42 Basic Cooperative Production Units  [UBPC's] formed in Havana Province to-date: 29 in miscellaneous  crops; 10 in tobacco, and 3 in citrus. Four remain to be formed:  one in Artemisa, two in Alquizar, and one in Batabano. At  present, the Havana Province UBPC's consist of almost 6,600  workers, not a final figure.    There are at present five bicycle factories in Cuba. The  overall goal is to manufacture 300,000 bicycles in 1994. In  1993, 174,700 bicyles were produced by all these plants  together, a figure significantly higher than the 1993 figure of  86,000. Each plant works on its own design, which leads to  competition in making the bicycles and motivates the workers to  do better work. All facilities are trying to improve post-sale  services.    The Tropical Travel Agency in Havana sold over 10.5 percent  more optional activities in 1993 than in 1992. In 1993, this  brought half a million dollars more than in 1992 to the national  economy -- said Juan Emilio Santana, director of the Tropical  Travel Agency. Santana said that the optional activities and  proposals targeting international tourism at the diverse tourist  hubs also increased in 1993, with a view to increasing the  amount of hard currency brought in. The task of the Tropical  Travel Agency is to provide international tourists with all  types of services and information, thus occupying the free time  of travelers while in Cuba.    Cuba Vision Network at 2310 GMT on 25 January reports that  in  Granma Province, workers of the Manzanillo shoe enterprise  produced more than 250,000 pairs of shoes in 1993. They are  increasing efforts to meet the demand of sugar industry workers.    Radio Reloj Network at 1506 GMT on 26 January reports that  the Havana Convention Center obtained more than $3 million in  1993 as compared to the previous year. Adding national and  convertible currency, its income amounts to some 6 million of an  unspecified currency from the various activities in this center  over the past year. More than 12,000 foreign delegates  participated in congresses, fairs, meetings, and other forums in  that center last year.    Radio Reloj Network at 1509 GMT on 26 January adds that the  Cuban Ministry of the Steelworking Industry, the Sime, is  working hard to become self-suffient. Sime's main objectives for  this year are to become an exporting organization capable of  guaranteeing its self- sufficiency, providing financial  resources, and meeting the special demands of the national  economy.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 26 January reports that an  Asturian solidarity group donated office equipment worth $11,500  to the accounting department of the University of Havana.     "
0,FT943-7727 ,"FT943-7727 _AN-EHVD2AAXFT 940822   FT  22 AUG 94 / US toughens policy on links with Cuba      By JAMES HARDING and Agencies      MIAMI, WASHINGTON   The US further toughened its Cuba policy at the weekend. The stronger measures against President Fidel Castro's country followed Washington's announcement on Friday that Cubans fleeing the Caribbean island as refugees would be barred from the US and detained at Guantanamo, the US base in south-eastern Cuba. President Bill Clinton said on Saturday he was barring cash remittances by Americans to Cuba and putting new limits on charter flights between the US and the island. Scheduled flights have long been discontinued under the 30-year US embargo on its trading with Cuba. Mr Clinton also pledged increased and amplified US radio broadcasts into Cuba, warning residents not to go to sea and head for the US. With the spotlight of attention shifting from the refugee problem and onto the US agenda to oust Mr Castro, Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said yesterday that imposing a blockade on Cuba was not out of the question. 'That is obviously one of the options that we would look at in the future, as we see whether or not Castro begins to make some legitimate movements toward democracy,' he said on television in the US. He added that the US was committed to foster democracy in Cuba, as well as to end the wave of illegal emigration to Florida by flimsy boats and rafts. 'At the same time, we have to continue to put pressure on Castro because the problem is not with refugees - it is within the Castro regime.' However, administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that Mr Panetta had been referring to blocking trade from other countries with Cuba. Such an idea is on a long list of US options, but the officials said there was no active effort to implement a blockade. Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican minority whip in the House of Representatives, yesterday accused President Clinton of failing to flesh out his Cuba policy. 'This administration has a passion for taking one or two steps without working out what the rest of the trip is,' Mr Gingrich said, calling on Mr Clinton to look for a smooth transition to democracy and a liberal economy in Cuba. It remains to be seen whether the change in US policy towards Cuban refugees, whose predecessors were welcomed in the US and offered the possibility of permanent residence status after one year, will deter further attempts to cross the Florida Strait. The US Coast Guard in Florida picked up 1,189 people on Saturday, the highest total of such Cuban boatpeople in one day this year and nearly three times the number of such Cubans who reached the US in the whole of 1990. However, the Cuban-American community in Florida appears to acknowledge the need to stem the flow of would-be immigrants to the US as refugees from the island. A survey of 240 Florida residents, by the Miami Herald, showed 66 per cent support for Mr Clinton's decision and 43 per cent not wanting detained refugees given a chance to apply for asylum. Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, and all those likely to challenge his bid for re-election in November, approved a tough stance on Cuban refugees, an indication of how they judge the attitude of non-hispanic voters in Florida.

Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February reported that an  agreement of cooperation was signed between the Cuban Ecumenical  Council and the Sugar Industry Ministry to build a biogas plant  in Matanzas to reprocess residues of other industries into  cooking gas. The agreement establishes that German churches will  finance the project while the Cuban Government will be  responsible for the construction and technological assembly of  the plant, which will also eliminate an important source of  environmental pollution.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 February adds that the  Agriculture Ministry phytosanitary board saved $800,000 last  year by conducting a biological control program in Matanzas. The  program succeeded in controlling the spread of plagues and  diseases, thereby saving money spent in the past to purchase  pesticides.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 2320 GMT on 1  February report that 11,000 people are self-employed in Santiago  de Cuba Province with positive results for the economy of that  province. According to estimates by the state labor committee,  approximately 2 million pesos were collected during the last  quarter of last year through registration fees. Drivers,  craftsmen, tailors, and handicraft vendors are the services most  in demand. Special studies are being carried out in Santiago de  Cuba better to control and organize the self-employment jobs.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 2 February reports that  Matanzas  Province's farmers planted 330 caballerias of tubers,  vegetables, and grains in January, the highest figure for a  similar period in the cold-season planting campaign in the past  10 years. At the end of January, Matanzas farmers had planted a  little over 810 caballerias of miscellaneous food crops in the  cold-season planting, which includes 162 caballerias of potatoes  that are looking good.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 2 February reports that the  Ministry of the Sugar Industry [Minaz] has announced that,  nationwide, sugar sector workers planted a total 863 caballerias  of cane in January, exceeding the month's plan by 48 percent.  Minaz reports that all provinces except Villa Clara, Las Tunas,  and Granma met their schedule for the month. This is a good  beginning for the spring planting, which takes place ""from  January to 30 June,"" by which time 18,090 caballerias of cane  are to have been planted.    Radio Reloj in Spanish at 2030 GMT on 2 February reports  that  electricity supply to the eastern region has been increased by  approximately 100 megawatts with the establishment of modern  Russian-made equipment at the Vicente Substation in Ciego de  Avila. Several towns between Ciego de Avila and Guantanamo will  receive the benefits of this equipment.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 3 February reports that the  Claudio Arguelles Bicycle Factory in Havana has held a  Parliament in the Workplace. During the discussions, one  participant noted that no one wants Cuban bicycles ""because they  are very bad. They have no quality whatsoever, none whatsover.""  Another noted that the cost of producing a bicyle in 1993 was  140.95 pesos, and that the bicycle sold for 95 pesos; therefore,  these bicycles were subsidized to the tune of ""some 2 million  pesos."" A third participant pointed out that the poor quality  was not the fault of the assembly plant but lay, instead, in the  poor work done by the workshops that produce the parts assembled  at the Claudio Arguelles plant.    Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 4  February  report the following:    Three new 15-megawatt turbogenerators were installed at the  Panama agricultural complex in Vertientes Municipality in  Camaguey.    In 1993, the Department of Transit in Havana City reported  1,825 traffic accidents, in which 348 people died and 1,605 were  injured. Comparison to 1992 figures shows a 40-percent drop in  the number of accidents and 16 percent in injuries. In 1992, one  person died in every nine accidents; in 1993, one person died in  every five.    The Comandante Pinares General Hospital in Pinar del Rio  Province benefited from a donation by the German Government to  the Cuban Red Cross of 12 tons of food valued at $100,000. The  German company, Mercedes-Benz, also donated an intensive care  ambulance valued at $50,000 to the Cuban Red Cross.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 February reports the  following, citing the 4 February edition of GRANMA: Cuba had  6.644 billion cubic meters of water in its reservoirs at the end  of January 1994, 74 percent of their potential.    Cuba has almost 4,000 minidairy farms. Import costs of $5  million dollars were avoided in 1993 by practicing recycling.    Of the over 800 Basic Cooperative Production Units in the  agriculture-livestock sector in Cuba, 238 are in miscellaneous  crops and 431 in commercial cattle-raising. The rest are in  activities related to coffee, rice, and forestry.     "

PA2101023794 Havana PRENSA LATINA in Spanish 0456 GMT 19 Jan  94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY    PA2101023794    Havana PRENSA LATINA     Language:  Spanish  Article Type:BFN    [""Exclusive"" article by Jesus Bermudez Cutino, PRENSA LATINA  associate, division general of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Cuba, and chief of Cuban Military Intelligence: ""Is the Cold War  Truly Over?""]    [Text] The scene of the Berlin Wall's destruction repeated  over and over in the U.S. press and television and practically  worldwide carried an implicit message that the ""Cold War"" had  concluded, that the threat of nuclear war had passed. This was  subsequently supported by the Soviet Union's demise.    Perhaps Winston Churchill, who definitely marked the  initiation of the Cold War following his 5 March 1946 speech at  Fulton University, Missouri, United States of America, would not  have been so optimistic if he could see several current  conflicts now.    The Korean case: For almost 40 years, the United States has  virtually maintained an occupation force in South Korea.  Currently it maintains 30,500 soldiers and 140 diverse types of  combat planes in addition to the forces it maintains in Japan  and other areas of the Pacific. These forces could also be used  in case of a conflict in the region.    On 12 March 1993, the DPRK decided to withdraw from the NPT  [Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty], under pressure to have its  territory unconditionally inspected by IAEA officials. This  occurred after it was accused of making preparations to  construct a nuclear weapon. Although there are ongoing  negotiations, the situation in the peninsula continues to be  tense.    The anti-Korean campaign started at the beginning of 1993.  The London SUNDAY TIMES affirmed the DPRK was on the verge of  constructing the atomic bomb in an extensive April report.    In its 28 November 1993 edition, the U.S. magazine NEWSWEEK,  adding fuel to the fire (or maybe a little more ""ice"" to what  was left of the Cold War), labelled the DPRK as ""public enemy  No. 1."" The publication affirmed that the United States, the  IAEA, and South Korea are ""convinced"" the North Koreans are  dangerously close to constructing the atomic bomb.    The Russian case: When the one-time powerful Soviet Union  ceased to exist in December 1991, the consolidation of  friendship and relations between Russia and the United States  reached unprecedented levels in the military field. In addition  to disarmament agreements, on 8 September 1993 a memorandum of  understanding was signed between the U.S. Defense Department and  the Defense Ministry of the Russian Federation. This was,  according to the document, within the framework of ""leaving  behind forever the years of nuclear confrontation and superpower  rivalry.""    Some U.S. officials have reiterated that Russia is no longer  an enemy of the United States, and therefore the possibility of  a nuclear attack being initiated against the United State from  Russian territory has been reduced    Nevertheless, the U.S. combat forces' training program  maintains a high level of periodic offensive actions. According  to the so-called strategists, their main adversaries are the  former USSR republics that have nuclear weapons, particularly  the Russian Federation. Their activities include several nuclear  rocket targeting tests and the implementation of massive  strategic bombings.    The report labeled ""Total Revision: Forces for a New Era,""  presented by Les Aspin, U.S. secretary of defense, dated 1  September 1993, after reasserting that the Cold War is over,  acknowledges:    ""The dangers that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass  destruction represent, including the dangers associated with the  proliferation of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons,  associated with the high levels of those weapons that are still  present in the former Soviet Union."" [sentence as received]    General George L. Butler, chief of the U.S. Armed Forces  Strategic Command, in statements to THE NEW YORK TIMES at the  beginning of March, in referrence to the ""target"" of U.S.  intercontinental rockets, said: ""We do not only concentrate on  the former Soviet Union but also on any potentially hostile  country that possesses or that is attempting to possess weapons  of mass destruction.    It appears the Cold War is not over... definitely not for  the  Russians either.    The Cuban case: The Cuban-U.S. conflict gained a new  dimension following the revolution's victory on 1 January 1959.  Nevertheless, its roots date back many years before Churchill's  speech, and even before the springing up of socialism as a  system. It is rooted in the imperialists' appetite for the  ""sugar island,"" their theory of a ""ripe fruit,"" and based on the  Monroe Doctrine (America for the Americans) and other similar  theories.    The U.S. Administrations has attempted to isolate, weaken,  and defeat the revolution through invasion, the well-known  assassination attempts, the economic blockade (taken to its  highest levels ever), hostile propaganda, and all types of  harassment.    During the ""Cold War,"" the United States considered Cuba a  USSR satellite and, therefore, a threat to its national  security. This is the reason for those Sunday nuclear targeting  tests against the small island, while the majority of its  resident slept or were getting ready for their daily voluntary  work in the countryside and the cities.    Although for some theoreticians, the Cold War was officially  over in December of 1991, the empire's policy toward Cuba has  turned more dramatic since then.    The stepping up of the economic blockade with the so-called  ""Law for Democracy in Cuba,"" know as the ""Torricelli Law,""  represents one more escalation in this ""specific cold war"" the  U.S. Government is waging against Cuba. This comes at a time  when the world is rapidly expanding measures that encourage free  trade.    But revolutionary Cuba, the Cuba that has always been ready  to help everyone, does not have rights. Cuba must be  persecuted; it must be cornered, strangled, and starved if it  does not surrender; this is how things are in the economic,  political, and military fields. The U.S. Armed Forces will use  any pretext to maintain a permanent presence in areas near Cuba  -- whether the struggle against drugs or the situation in Haiti.  Several U.S. Navy warships and Coast Guards ships are always  kept a short distance from our coasts.    The U.S. Armed Forces have continued to carry out extensive  exercises and maneuvers around our nation, despite the alleged  end of the ""Cold War.""    In 1992, for example, the U.S. Armed Forces were engaged in  the Ocean Venture Exercise that included the landing of  amphibious craft on Puerto Rico and the passing of large naval  convoys, including aircraft carriers and amphibious ships, near  Cuba. This coincided with the Trade Winds Exercise carried out  in the eastern Caribbean, which included a mock naval blockade  on a Caribbean island.    Also, after the ""end of the Cold War,"" the Unites States  maintains on Cuba territory -- against the will and wish of our  government and our people -- Guantanamo Naval Base in the  southeastern part of the country. The United States was able to  impose this base under leonine conditions on the budding pseudo-  republic more than 90 years ago.    From this base -- a base that costs U.S. taxpayers  approximately $821,917 a day -- they annually engage in  violations of our airspace and national waters by combat  aircraft and ships that visit the base. In addition, since its  installation, scores of provocations have been staged against  our border brigade guards. Their soldiers in this military  enclave periodically carry out military exercises in which even  the alleged massive arrival of Cuban refugees from nonoccupied  territory has been simulated.    The immigration issue is another factor that ""could make one  think"" that the ""Cold War"" has not concluded. While the United  States puts up a three-meter metal wall (similar to the one they  brought down in Berlin), to prevent the crossing of ""illegal  aliens"" from Mexico into U.S. territory, they encourage illegal  departures from Cuba. They do not care who these individuals  are, be they mere traitors or common criminals; all are received  with open arms in Miami.    At Guantanamo Naval Base they also encourage illegal  departures, without taking into account the danger this  represents. Those who attempt these departures run the risk of  perishing because of the mines placed on either side of the  fence. Nevertheless, a high percentage of those Cuban citizens  who officially request an entry visa at the U.S. Interests  Office are refused.    After reviewing these specific facts, any reader, even  though  he may not be an expert in international politics, could at  least question whether the Cold War is truly over.     "

According to analysts and observers, the signs pointing in  this direction are becoming increasingly clear while the Cuban  economy is showing a modest reactivation, and foreign  investments in the country are growing.    The intense business activities being conducted on the  island  and the increase of foreign investors who want to negotiate with  Cuba to participate in various industrial and service sectors  are unprecedented in the entire history of the revolutionary  process that began in 1959.    According to official sources, 413 commercial enterprises  from about 40 countries already have subsidiaries in the  country, and 129 economic agreements with foreign firms have  been signed.    Right now, buzzwords that touch on production, productivity,  and the concepts of quality and cost control are being heard not  only from knowledgeable economists and foreign businessmen, but  also from workers in the parliaments in the workplace, as well  as on the job.    This setting will gradually, but definitely, lead to a  cleansing of the domestic finances and to investments that are  necessary in sectors severely hampered as a result of years of  U.S. hostility and the disappearance of the European socialist  bloc.    This means that the Cuban people, who have grown used to  coming up winners in a countless number of difficult situations  over the past four decades, are now focusing their efforts on  overcoming an adverse situation characterized by economic and  supply restrictions imposed by international circumstances.    At the same time, important political decisions, such as the  convoking to ""the Nation and the Emigrants"" conference in April,  are being adopted. This is the latest step taken along the path  of normalizing relations between the government and Cubans  living abroad.    In addition to contributing to the reuniting of families and  to a certain degree of participation by emigrants in national  affairs, the meeting is another factor that contributes to  inspiring trust in the soundness of the current global policy of  the Antillean nation.    Things being as they are, the ongoing blockade imposed 32  years ago and maintained by successive U.S. governments that  have wanted to liquidate the Cuban revolutionary process is  increasingly showing various signs of breaking down.    Evidence of this is the increased interest that nations from  various parts of the world are showing in trading directly with  Cuba, despite White House pressure and the disgust that such  trade sparks in the anti-Cuban lobby that functions close to  U.S. Government circles.    The finding of such interest in Latin America -- the region  of the world of which the island is a part -- has special  significance, but we also find such interest among the West  European powers and in countries in Africa and Asia.    The increase in visits to Cuba by foreign delegations to  explore trade relations or to sign agreements, as well as the  bilateral agreements that have either been signed or are being  negotiated, are also evidence of what we have affirmed.    The role Cuba has played in international forums such as the  Ibero-American summits and the United Nations, in addition to  Cuba's stand in defense of Latin America's integrationist  philosophy, have also harmed the isolationist objectives  Washington has obsessively pursued with regard to the Antillean  nation.    The crisis of the U.S. blockade is also mirrored by the  desperation that, according to what AREITO magazine Director  Andres Gomez has revealed, has overcome the people's calling for  a hardening of the blockade -- namely, those people who have  turned their life in exile into a lucrative business.    Recently, while grand caravans of solidarity with Cuba  cruised the United States and Canada to transport aid to the  island, a costly mobilization by bellicose groups that function  in the United States was able to gather only a few hundred  people in Washington.    Meanwhile, several legislators have presented at the U.S.  Congress a bill to weaken the so-called Torricelli Law which  hardened the conditions of the blockade, and this is another  factor to be taken into consideration at this moment.    Taking into consideration all these factors, it looks like  modifications are inevitable and that the hopes of those who  dream of a return to the past in Cuba will collapse.     "

Good  evening Cavada. We are ready whenever you are.    [Cavada] Yes, thank you very much. Good evening, people of  Cuba. Once again, Cuba's Foreign Ministry has presented to (?the  world) the true architect of its diplomacy: the Cuban people.    This evening, over 40 chiefs of mission -- ambassadors,  consuls, military attaches -- left the Cuban capital to learn in  detail about all the things that the men and women of the  Escambray Mountain areas accomplish daily.    The first stop on this work tour was the Integrated Military  Enterprise of the Che Guevara Center in Manicaragua  Municipality, Villa Clara Province, very near the community of  La Campana, where the visitors were informed about the  possibilities the medical industry brings to the nation's life.  There, Brigadier General Luis Perez, an engineer and director of  the Military Enterprises Union, confirmed that over 40  factories, in addition to making and repairing all the military  material for the Revolutionary Armed Forces, are collaborating  with tourism, the nickel industry, and petroleum. In this way,  the alleged (?veils) that have always existed regarding military  information were lifted because, as Foreign Minister Robaina  said, at home, there are no hidden truths, and truth is  precisely the distinctive sign of Cuba's foreign policy, which  arises, without a doubt, from the interior of the country.    The following is the opinion of the Colombian ambassador to  Cuba:    [Begin recording] Well, as for me, I must say that [words  indistinct], because our idea is to bring businessmen, bring  people linked (?to) businesses in Colombia; and this way we can  identify the kinds of opportunities, the kind of exchange  agreements that can be realized. Thus, it is particularly useful  for the ambassadors and for me to begin learning from within how  industry is doing, how the Cuban economy is doing.

He noted that many of the  country's latest hardships were the result of the emulation of  the American monetarist model. ""Reforming the Russian economy is  a prolonged process, which will take years,"" Mr. Soskovets said.    He said he doubted that the United States would provide any  substantial assistance for the development of the Russian  economy and that France was a more proximate and reliable  partner for Russia.    Mr. Soskovets said that Russia and France could co-operate  in  metallurgy and aerospace industry and hold consultations on the  price, investment and banking policies.    The French defence minister, for his part, assured the  Russian vice-premier that his country was prepared ""to follow  the logic of partnership"" and wished to see Russia ""a leading  manufacturing power rather than a supplier of raw materials"".

Over 3 million Cubans are currently participating in  discussions promoted by the unions in an attempt to find  solutions to various problems that hinder the efficiency of each  workplace and affect the country's financial reorganization.    According to the Center for Social-Political Studies and  Research [Centro de Estudios Socio-Politicos y de Opinion],  which conducted a poll among 1,300 workers, the leading topic  discussed in the meetings held thus far is labor efficiency. In  response to a call by the union leadership, the main concern of  Cuban workers has been to find a formula to produce more  efficiently given the availability of enough raw materials,  fuels, and production equipment.    During the meetings on economic issues called by the unions,  the participants have contributed many ideas, recommendations,  and useful reflections on how to face the management problem.  According to official figures, only 31 percent of Cuban  enterprises are profitable due to primarily external factors  linked to the loss of Cuba's traditional partners in the  vanished socialist sphere and the intensification of the U.S.  blockade.    However, other factors are involved in this situation,  namely  an inefficiency accumulated over many years, a lack of concern  regarding costs, expenditures, and the balance between earnings  and expenditures as well as a poor resource-management. The  Cuban economy needs to place greater emphasis on all these  aspects and to that effect, the current meetings come in very  handy. In these meetings, both workers and administrative  leaders examine thoroughly the best ways to eradicate  inefficiency. What constitutes one of the most pressing tasks  is to implement the agreements fully in order to eradicate  inefficiency, without waiting for the measures that will soon be  approved by the Cuban Parliament to reorganize the country's  finances.

Recent revelations from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, one of the  historical leaders of the revolutionary process, regarding  failed negotiations for the solution of the dispute, have  brought to the table this affair, which was broadly discussed by  local specialists over recent times.    The accusations that on 25 May 1978 then U.S. President  James  Carter leveled against Cuba for alleged participation in the  attack by Katanguese troops on the Province of Shaba in southern  Zaire, shattered the possible start in New York of the Cuba-U.S.  dialogue.    According to Rodriguez, he was to hold a secret meeting that  day with Secretary of State Cyrus Vance to begin the search for  a solution to the crisis between the two governments, which at  that time was already two decades old.    ""That battle -- he said -- ended with the clarification of  the truth: Cuba had not participated whatsoever in the  adventure (in that African country), but the opportunity to  start negotiations had passed.""    Three lusters after the failed negotiation attempt, Rafael  Hernandez, head of the Inter-American Relations Department at  the nongovernmental American Studies Center (CEA), is one who  believes that the regional situation is very favorable for  normalization of the ties between Cuba and the United States.    The Latin American countries have gradually improved --  since  the beginning of the 70's -- their relations with the island,  the majority recognize Cuba's determination for national  independence and sovereignty and even advise that Washington's  policy hinders international free trade and is counterproductive  and harmful for the Cuban people, he says.    In his article ""Learning From the Cold War: The U.S. Policy  Towards Cuba and Vietnam,"" which recently appeared in the  CUADERNOS DE NUESTRA AMERICA magazine, the analyst remembers  that even today Cuban exiles interfere in the adoption of a  rational policy by Washington toward Havana.    The most dramatic impact of a new U.S. policy toward Cuba  would be precisely on the conduct of the U.S.-Cuban community,  he warns.    In a panel discussion held in mid-December 1993, on the 15th  anniversary of the CEA, the investigator returned to the subject  and spoke about the possible solution of the conflict between  the two countries.    The analysis -- he said back then -- must start from two  basic premises: The impossibility of sidelining the  antagonistic interests and values that separate Cuba and the  United States (beyond the greater or lesser will for a  diplomatic arrangement) and the fact that the accounting of  costs and benefits in a general scenario of negotiation is not  to be reduced to something as simple as balancing a checkbook.    According to his criteria, the main cost Washington will  have  for mending its diplomatic agenda with Havana is dealing with  attitudes and predispositions established over three decades in  the security and foreign relations organizations and in Congress.    Also, [Washington] will have to recognize the Cuban  Government in fact and by law and return to Cuban sovereignty  the Guantanamo Naval Base, a naval and aerial resource in the  Caribbean it has held for almost a century.    However, he adds, that last action will allow an improvement  in the relations and an exploration of forms of constructive  coexistence between the armed forces of the two countries and  will ease -- in fact -- cooperation in topics such as the  struggle against drug trafficking, naval and aerial security,  among others.    Other benefits the White House could obtain at the  negotiating table are the awakening of a political basis of  interest groups -- especially economic -- which up to now do not  work as lobbies [previous word in English] due to the rigidity  of the U.S. policy toward the island.    Also, the total or partial lifting of the blockade will  benefit the U.S. private sector and eliminate a point of discord  with Latin America and several industrialized countries and a  tense topic in the deliberations of international organizations.    The solution of the conflict with the northern neighbor  means  for Cuba immediate benefits: The mere reduction of the  hostility favors its national interests, makes possible access  to new markets and the flow of capital, and broadens the surface  of bilateral contact.    However, rapprochement with the United States also has costs  for Cuba, says Hernandez.    In the first place, the rapprochement between the two  countries, although seen as necessary in purely economic terms,  may divide national consensus on the political and ideological  planes at a time when cohesion is of strategic importance.    Also, the presumed irruption of U.S. capital in the Cuban  economy -- amid a process of reforms -- could be  counterproductive.    That, without ruling out the possibility that Washington may  seek to influence the business community with regard to Cuba by  counseling or tutoring the monetary flow so as to favor  determined political processes.    In any event, the topic of U.S.-Cuban dialogue is currently  moving only in the field of speculation.    Cuba, recently said Foreign Minister Robaina, cannot decide  whether it will make changes in those ties, because its  definitions have already been established and it is Washington  who has to alter its policy.

0,FT943-7650 ,"FT943-7650 _AN-EHVD2AC2FT 940822   FT  22 AUG 94 / Leading Article: A new deal for Cuba   The tightening of the US economic embargo on Cuba, announced this weekend, is a step in precisely the wrong direction. By further isolating its neighbour, the US is intensifying economic misery in Cuba. This will increase the flood of refugees attempting to leave the island, which will make further difficulties for the Clinton administration. It will also allow Fidel Castro to deflect blame for the country's dire economic circumstances from himself, where it belongs, to Washington. The present exodus from Cuba should show him that fundamental change must come soon. His dictatorship of 35 years is an anachronism in a continent of elected governments. He has succeeded in extending literacy and reducing infant mortality. Yet in the absence of eastern bloc subsidies and trade, the failures of Cuba's centrally planned economy have become painfully clear. National income has almost halved during the last three years. An aid agency recently estimated that the average Cuban eats about 1,000 fewer calories per day than in 1989, pushing many towards starvation. Hardship and repression have caused rising discontent. During recent protests, the worst in the regime's history, demonstrators chanted 'freedom' and 'down with Fidel'. Civil unrest The question is no longer whether change will come to Cuba, but how. There is little cause for complacency on the part of the Clinton administration. Deteriorating conditions will produce increasing civil unrest and a worsening exodus to the US. Presumably, the US sees itself as tightening the economic noose around Castro's neck, creating the conditions for his overthrow. But given the country's lack of democratic tradition, there are no guarantees that a change of regime will mean the advent of democracy. Already this year, more than 6,000 Cuban refugees have entered the US, twice the number in 1993. Ideological protestation aside, the US is no more interested in absorbing refugees from post-communist turmoil in the western hemisphere than is the EU in accepting refugees from eastern Europe. The White House has responded to Castro's apparent decision to let Cubans leave with a virtual blockade around Florida. Rather than encouraging a violent outcome to the Cuban crisis, the US should end its blanket isolation of the Castro regime and offer a series of incentives for economic and political liberalisation. Cuba has taken halting and inadequate steps towards economic reform. The dollar has been reluctantly legalised, and some private enterprise is now allowed. Greater communication with the island would strengthen this liberalisation process. For example, Cuba has granted several US telecommunication companies the right to link the two countries, but they still await the Clinton administration's approval. Cold war regulations restricting Cuban journalists in the US should also be repealed. Encouraging reformers Reformers within the government must be encouraged. The US should end embargoes on food and medicine, and if reform continues, it should permit Cuba's entrance into the World Bank and IMF. Liberalisation needs to yield results, otherwise Castro may be able to blame the reformers for Cuba's economic misery. US policy is unlikely to change without corresponding movement within the Cuban-American community, long the primary force behind America's uncompromising stance. Although the most powerful Cuban-American organisation, the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), still supports the embargo, alternative voices are emerging. The newly-formed Cuban Committee for Democracy supports the recently introduced Free Trade with Cuba Act. The Clinton administration's first nominee for under-secretary for Inter-American Affairs, Afro-Cuban exile Mario Baeza, was blocked by CANF because he appeared too open to dialogue with the Castro regime. The stand-off between Cuba and the US remains one of the cold war's most painful legacies. The past's scars, however, must not prevent a pragmatic assessment the present predicament. For Cuba, that means reforms to arrest its political and economic slide. For the US, it means encouraging that to happen.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.     USZ  United States of America.

He also spoke with other prominent Parliament members as well  as with German businessmen.    In Dresden, the capital of the eastern German State of  Saxony, Saxon Economy Minister Hajo Schommer explained to  Alarcon the transformations that have taken place to move that  region toward a market economy, the German news agency DPA has  reported.    In a statement to DPA, Alarcon said Cuba will pay great  attention to the transition process in Saxony, where, he said,  the authorities want to show him the transition mechanisms from  a planned socialist economy to a market socialist economy.    Alarcon, who is accompanied by two other officials, was  entertained by Erich Iltgen, president of the Saxon Regional  Parliament, who offered a dinner in his honor yesterday.  Alarcon also met with Iltgen this morning.    During his visit to Germany, Alarcon visited the city-state  of Bremen, on the country's northern coast, where he met with  local authorities and businessmen from various sectors.     "

[O ESTADO] The names of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and  Raul Castro are mentioned as the strongest candidates to replace  Fidel. You allegedly also are on the list.

[O ESTADO] The Cuban regime seems to be implementing a  transition rhythm different from that preferred by the United  States and Cuban dissidents.

[O ESTADO] How are subjects like a multiparty system being  dealt with?    [Lage] Our concept is of a single party. In Cuba, a party is  not an electoral party that organizes itself to win or to  participate in an election and then lacks power to organize or  conduct society. From our point of view, a single party is more  democratic. There are multiparty elections in many countries but  barely 30 or 40 percent of the people participate in the  elections so the winners have barely 30 or 40 percent of the  votes.    [O ESTADO] Is it true that Fidel admires former President  Collor?    [Lage] The truth is that Collor, while he was president, had  a positive attitude toward Cuba and resisted U.S. pressures.

Rodriguez opens the debate by stating that he has received  many letters on today's issue, some in favor, some against, and  others urging further explanation.    Recio states that it is not strange to see disagreements on  differentiated incentives or material incentives given for  production work. He adds that the people have an ""egalitarian  point of view"" and that this is inadequate. Everyone agrees,  however, that the appropriate distribution formula for the Cuban  economy is the socialist formula: ""Pay each person according to  the quantity and quality of his work."" He goes on to say that  everyone agrees with this but that it is hard to put into  practice. Recio adds: ""The problem is when it affects someone  who is not included among those that contribute the most in  quantity and quality of work.""    Recio adds that Cuba had not been able to fully apply a  labor-incentive formula. He adds: ""The situation now calls for  a policy of incentives by sectors and individuals. There are  other sectors that do not produce, materialistically speaking,  but are important, such as the education and health sectors.""    Rodriguez states that Cuban society fairly distributes all  that there is to distribute but that, unfortunately, this cannot  be transferred to the production sector. He adds that some of  the letters received mention extraordinary efforts, but do not  mention results.    Recio states that Raul Castro has stressed that efforts must  be encouraged but only results must be rewarded. He adds:  ""There is a certain mind-set in Cuba that praises the man that  exhausts himself in the effort, is seen uncombed, tired, and is  turned into a hero. In a certain sense, heroism requires that  exhausting effort, but that is not always synonymous with  efficiency.""    Recio goes on to say that production must precede  distribution and that what little there is is being distributed  with egalitarian criteria. The prioritized sectors -- tourism,  sugar, petroleum, transport, mining, and others -- are to be the  engines of the Cuban economy and the ones that ought to receive  incentives.    Rodriguez points out that sectors involved in garnering  currency could be considered prioritized sectors and that he  believes that these incentives are not being utilized correctly.  He adds: ""I am thinking, for example, of those chain stores  called shoppings. Some of the stores distribute equally among  their workers what has come to be called a bag, which is no more  than a monthly stock of products which are hard to come by in  Cuba. This is distributed equally among the workers.""    Rodriguez points out the example of the incentive programs  implemented in the electric sector, where workers are rewarded  for meeting certain standards. He stresses that egalitarian  distribution of incentives ""is once again dragging us back to  the same situation we are trying to fight.""    Recio states that to give all workers the same incentive is  no incentive. He adds: ""I believe incentives must be given  within a sector, within a sector to a specific branch, within a  branch to a specific enterprise, within certain enterprise to a  specific factory, and within a factory to specific workers. I  insist on the idea that the same incentive cannot be given to an  indirect worker than to a worker involved directly with  production."" Rodriguez closes by stressing the importance of  differentiated incentives to specific workers.     "

Ross made this statement in the television program ""Open  Agenda"" during which he announced over 3 million union members  will participate in a consultation process called ""the  parliament of the labor centers.""    He recalled that union debate on the measures the country  should adopt to reorganize its finances and revitalize the  economy began yesterday on an experimental basis in the western  Province of Pinar del Rio. Numerous meetings of companies  related to the food and fishing industries took place in Pinar  del Rio.    Ross considered the debates held with workers from Pinar del  Rio as broad, open, and fruitful. Ross said that the workers  proposed such measures as increasing the price of electricity;  charging a fee for sports and cultural events; and creating and  selling national bonds recoverable within a period of five to 10  years.    Ross added that there is a broad consensus regarding the  need  to seek ways to recover the money illegally obtained by Cubans  who are locally called ""macetas"" [profiteers]. He emphasized  that these ""macetas"" have built their fortunes by exploiting the  needs of others.    Ross confirmed that the consultation process will include in  its first stage (until 29 January) over 400,000 union leaders,  and after 29 January, meetings will be conducted in all the  country's labor centers.    The popular debate on the serious economic-financial  situation was recommended last December by the National Assembly  of the People's Government (Parliament). During the  Parliament's regular session, it was learned that Cuba faces an  excess of currency in circulation amounting to more than 12  billion pesos (equivalent to dollars at the official currency  exchange).    It was also learned in Parliament that 30 percent of state  companies are unprofitable and it was estimated that the  subsidies to just the sugar industry in the past three years  reached 7.2 billion pesos.    Ross Leal's statement was preceded by the publication  yesterday in the weekly TRABAJADORES of an editorial which urged  the union sectors to ""take part in the kneading of the bread of  decisionmaking rather than sitting back and smelling it as it is  baking.""

[Castro] Every summit has had a positive effect, has  fostered  a closeness and friendship among the peoples of Latin America.  Diverse initiatives have sprung from the summits. This summit is  already an institution and constitutes a Latin American force.  This is something new which did not exist before. Previously,  the Latin American peoples meet only when summoned by the United  States. This is the fourth time we have met by our own  initiative.    [Reporter] Do you expect this summit to be akin to a  platform  to allow Cuba to rejoin the OAS?    [Castro] I do not hope for that much. This is a complex  problem. Diverse opinions have been expressed. We have to wait  to see the final result in favor of Cuba's reincorporation in  the OAS. That does not necessarily guarantee, however, that the  good wishes of many Latin American peoples can be effected.    [Reporter] What is your answer to the call by all the Latin  American leaders advocating a political and democratic opening  in Cuba?    [Castro] No, not all. Some very respectfully expressed their  views. I appreciate their concern for Cuba but I in turn  replied, you heard it, that I could not believe that not a  single word had been said against such an unfair and inhuman  blockade which is trying to make our people surrender out of  hunger and turn our country into a blood bath, and which  attempts to dismiss the heroic resistance which Cuba and the  Cuban people have put up in defense of dignity and sovereignty  of the peoples of Latin America for more than 35 years. Our  views are ignored.    Our country has been institutionalized and we have our views  on how the country ought to be organized, how to keep the  country united. We have our Constitution and follow it. I  believe our practices and the participation of our people are  truly much more democratic than that of others systems. There is  more than one model of democracy. I also explained how  distraught we were by the fact that it has not been acknowledged  that Cuba has attained the greatest social progress in the  history of this hemisphere; and that this hemisphere has the  worst distribution of wealth and land, that millions of people  die every year, people who could be saved. We have done so in  Cuba. Only in Cuba, the Revolution's social efforts have not  only educated the entire population but also saved the lives of  hundreds of thousands of people. [Words indistinct] the others  have not done this.    [Reporter] As you explained, Cuba has experienced great  social development. Currently, great economic development is  taking place.    [Castro] No, great economic development is not taking place  right now. We are under a double blockade. We have endured the  U.S. blockade for over 30 years and we have had to abide the  outcome of the collapse of the socialist bloc, with which we had  the bulk of our trade, and the disappearance of the Soviet Union.    [Reporter] Is Cuba attracting foreign investment?    [Castro] It is, not in the proportion we would like, but  increasingly so.    [Reporter] Could we expect to see an opening in Cuba like in  the PRC where a market economy coexists with a socialist  government?    [Castro] We have studied the Chinese and Vietnamese  experiences and everything useful and applicable to Cuba that we  can take from that experience will be undoubtedly implemented.  We cannot mechanically copy everything they have done because  their situation is different. For example, in the PRC, 80  percent of the population lives in rural areas where in Cuba, 80  percent of the population lives in urban areas. We cannot do in  rural areas some of the things they do. We have to do things  differently. We are in close contact with the PRC and Vietnam  and have studied them seriously in addition to our own  contributions. We have also conducted a significant economic  opening and are aware that we have to solve problems under very  difficult conditions. It was easier to resist the blockade when  the USSR existed and we had guaranteed trade and markets, fair  prices for our products, and had credit and technology which  today we do not have. Nowadays, we have to accomplish this on  our own and under enormous U.S. pressures.    [Reporter] You have made a unique statement by wearing a  guayabera for the first time in over 35 years. Does this imply a  change?    [Castro] Well, rather than a change it is matter of  (?deference) and respect, first of all, to the local climate and  second, to the request of the organizers. They sent word to  please come in guayaberas or shirts. I did not have any  guayaberas or shirts, our suits. I had to rush. Someone lent me  a guayabera for measurements, then one was made for me at full  speed. I had no idea how it was going to fit. On Monday, the  very day I left, guayaberas were being made for me. Thus, I  complied with all the requirements of the climate and the host  and I am very comfortable.    [Reporter] Will there be Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long  time?    [Castro] Who can tell if there will be Fidel Castro in Cuba  for a long time? It all depends on my health and, above all, my  capacity to contribute to solve the national problems.    There is no need for Fidel Castro in Cuba for a long time.  We  have many outstanding comrades able to do the job. We have been  developing younger and well prepared cadres. I am not  indispensable. I do not believe myself indispensable, nor does  it worry me how much longer I may have, how long I am going to  last, or for how long will they demand that I fulfill certain  duties which, by the way, are not easy.    [Reporter] Do you not think it is time for the Cuban people  to have other political options?    [Castro] The Cuban people participated in elections not long  ago.    [Reporter] But it is a one party system.    [Castro] Yes, but the party does not nominate the  candidates.  The candidates are nominated directly by the people. In other  words, we do not have one but a thousand, every citizen has the  option to make a nomination. The neighbors in the district meet  and nominate candidates.    [Reporter] But these are candidates from the Communist Party  of Cuba [PCC]?    [Castro] Well, it is an honor. There are many who are not  members of the PCC, however. Yet, in Cuba, the candidates are  nominated by the people, not the PCC. The PCC does not  participate in the nomination of candidates, the mass  organizations do. The percentage of the population that votes is  much higher than in the United States, a higher percentage than  in any Latin American country. That is a fact.    [Reporter] Regarding the embargo: Canada has said that it  supports the lifting of the embargo against Cuba. Do you believe  this is a good beginning to which the U.S. will be receptive?    [Castro] Canada has always followed independent and  outstanding policies regarding ties with Cuba, a policy of  respect for our national sovereignty. This policy, like  Mexico's, has been upheld for over 30 years through various  administrations, conservative, liberal, and progressive.     "
0,FT934-4579 ,"FT934-4579 _AN-DLCDFABGFT 931203   FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Cruise ship lifeline for Cuban economy - Castro's latest attempt to attract dollars from tourism      By ROSIE HAYES and STEPHEN FIDLER   When the cruise ship Santiago de Cuba sails later this month from Havana, it will underline the extent to which revolutionary fervour is giving way to pragmatism as Cuba tries to adjust to economic hardship. On board ship, there will be gambling - although it will not be allowed in Cuban ports. The government of President Fidel Castro is now accepting an activity it banned when it closed Havana's notorious gambling parlours after the 1959 revolution. Compared with the previous policy shifts forced on the Cuban government by the collapse of the Soviet Union and its financial support for Cuba, this is small. Among other things, the government has been aggressively pursuing previously unwelcome foreign investors and has legalised use of the once-banned US dollar. The cruise operation - a joint venture between the state-owned Havanatur and European interests, including the Italian ship agents Fratelli Cosulich - is the latest attempt to attract tourist dollars to the country. Mr Castro is now laying much emphasis on the promotion of tourism. He turned up last month on the holiday island of Cayo Coco at a ceremonial signing of a Spanish-Cuban joint venture and mingled with tourists, even at one stage watching a dance performance in a discotheque. The joint venture involves the Spanish group Guitart Hotels investing Dollars 20m (Pounds 13.4m) over 10 years and the local Cubanacana SA contributing the equivalent in local currency. He spoke of fighting the country's financial problems through tourism and told Cubans to prepare for an influx of foreign visitors. The president has also heaped praise on Spain, probably the most important source of foreign investment in the Cuban tourist industry, and has described Spanish skill and enterprise as a great advantage to the island. He even told an audience of Havana Communist party delegates this month that sugar was 'no longer the country's main economic source' and that the tourist industry had developed to such an extent it was now 'Cuba's main financial lifeline'. The number of visitors to Cuba has increased from 289,000 in 1987 to 460,000 last year, and is forecast to grow again this year. Visitors are also spending more. According to the government, daily spending rose to Dollars 67 a day in 1990 to Dollars 89 in 1992, and is predicted to increase to Dollars 100 in 1995. But there are doubts among external observers whether tourism is as important as the government suggests. Mr Jorge Dominguez, a Harvard professor and visiting fellow at the Washington-based study group InterAmerican Dialogue, says that total foreign direct investment in Cuba is an elusive figure, but probably amounts to less than Dollars 1bn. 'That means the claim that tourism is significant rests on its generation of foreign exchange.' Yet the foreign exchange earnings usually quoted by Cuban sources represent gross, rather than net earnings. A report produced in March by the Cuban Grupo de Turismo said that tourism generated Dollars 530m in gross hard-currency receipts in 1992 - four times the 1987 level - and directly accounted for 62,000 jobs, 1.6 per cent of total employment. A report published in April by La Sociedad Economica, a moderate London-based exile group which favours the country's transformation to a market economy, also points out that the policy of keeping tourists in enclaves 'limits the market for locally-produced goods and services, so reducing the beneficial effect that tourism could generate in the wider economy'. The net hard-currency benefit is thus significantly less than the gross receipts. Tourists have to be serviced by imports, such as Scotch whisky and video cassettes. Sales commissions, tour operating profits, and aviation expenses must also be paid. This suggests, says Mr Dominguez, the net annual hard currency gain to Cuba is between Dollars 100m and Dollars 300m. While this compares with the Dollars 220m earned in 1992 from nickel exports, it is still significantly less than its earnings from sugar exports, even though they fell to their lowest level this year since 1963. This year's harvest of 4.2m tonnes would generate Dollars 800m-Dollars 900m in export revenues. 'Tourism, as at present structured, offers only very limited relief to Cuba's economic crisis,' argues La Sociedad Economica. This could change if Americans were allowed to go to Cuba - but the end of the US embargo still appears a long way off.   Companies:-  Havanatur.     Fratelli Cosulich.     Guitart Hotels.

Speaking to the plenum of ""The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference,"" Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of  State, explained that, in general, the regulations established  by the current legislation regarding foreign investment will  apply to these cases.    Thus, investment in export-generating areas will have  priority, and will not be authorized -- for the time being -- in  the small-business, sugar industry, and oil-extraction areas,  among others.    Miguel Alfonso, a conference spokesman, told the media that  Lage gave a briefing on Cuba's financial situation, which has  worsened as a result of the collapse of the European socialist  bloc and the tightening of the U.S. blockade.    Lage stressed that, in light of the current situation, the  Cuban Government adopted several strategic decisions, including  the promotion of the tourist, pharmaceutical, and  biotechnological industries as well as the completion of  investment projects under way, those of which only generate  revenues via exports.    Other decisions consisted of revamping the state apparatus  to  make it smaller and more efficient, and guaranteeing that no one  is abandoned in case the structural changes generate some sort  of unemployment.    Lage mentioned that the opening to foreign investment, the  creation of the basic cooperative production units -- which  already comprise 2.5 million hectares -- and the removal of the  ban on Cuban's possession of foreign currency constitute  additional strategic measures.    Further decisions include increasing the authorization of  self-employment and reorganizing finances to return the Cuban  peso its purchasing power.    A total of 24 speakers participated in the debate that  followed Lage's remarks. Emigrants discussed the possible  purchase of state-issued bonds to participate in local the  economy as well as the necessary increase in family remittances.    Emigrants expressed their interest in the possibility of  assigning small capital to their relatives to open private  businesses and the creation of mechanisms to channel those funds.    Alfonso pointed out that all participants agreed that it is  necessary to lift the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba in  order to promote any type of investment on the island.     "

What Russian Parliamentarians Became  Convinced of in Latin America""]    [Text] Russia is ready for partnership relations with  South America. Convincing the Latin Americans of this was the  main task of a Federation Council delegation's official visit to  Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador.    The purpose of creating a political climate in Latin America  favorable to Russia is meant to facilitate the development of  mutually advantageous economic and trade relations between our  countries. The great potential of the region, which occupies 13  percent of the globe's land mass with a population of around 450  million people, the complementarity of our economies, and the  similarity of our economic and sociopolitical processes are  preconditions for this. All the leaders of the countries that  the delegation visited spoke of the need to organize strategic  collaboration with Russia. The Brazilian president, for  example, noted that ""this is needed to prevent the creation of a  unipolar world."" The Brazilians let it be clearly known that it  is time for Russia to ""stake its claims"" in Latin America.  Unless it lays a long-term basis for Russian-Latin American  relations, the region's leading countries will quite soon ""reach  the peak of the world hierarchy without taking Russian  priorities along with them.""    Meetings with representatives of Latin American countries'  business circles demonstrated their readiness to cooperate with  Russia primarily in the sphere of private enterprise. Here they  stressed the importance of the ""sponsorship"" of future projects  by presidents, foreign ministries, and other official state  authorities. The Russian side also believes that relations in  the private sector can to some extent compensate for the  transitional difficulties in foreign economic ties with Latin  America associated with the crisis in the previous model of the  Russian economy.    In order to facilitate these contacts there must be a  renewal  of the legal and treaty base of relations with Latin American  countries. Treaties have already been concluded with a number  of them, and memorandums have been adopted on the principles of  bilateral cooperation. Draft agreements on protecting  investment and avoiding double taxation are being elaborated  with many of them. These questions have been repeatedly raised  at meetings between the Russian delegation and their Latin  American colleagues and entrepreneurs. They are very important  as regards developing trade and increasing the volume of  investment in the Russian economy.    The Latin American market is also fruitful for Russia from  the viewpoint of high technology. Venezuela has great  experience in the sphere of oil extraction and refining, and it  is recommissioning once-abandoned wells by using the latest  technologies. Brazil is ready to cooperate with us in the  aerospace and nuclear power generating spheres.    Finally, we must not forget Peru, Nicaragua, and Cuba --  Russia's debtors. We must seek a settlement in relations with  these countries in order to recover the people's billions:  These countries' total debt is estimated at over $20 billion.    The changes that have taken place in the world are forcing  Russia to look at the former Third World in a different way.  The countries of this vast region in the Western Hemisphere  will no longer be an arena for rivalry between the  ""superpowers."" At any rate, for as long as a democratic Russia  exists.     "

We have especially been experiencing the effects of new  blackouts, an increasing number of blackouts. This could perhaps  create the false notion that the economy is regressing again,  that we are doomed to a recessive situation.    I think our listeners deserve an explanation of our economic  situation, that our economy is still going through the stages of  a downward trend, but which can now be considered over. There  are signs that the recovery process can begin at any moment.    Today I invited Eloy Concepcion of the weekly nespaper  TRABAJADOES to discuss this subject with me. Eloy, take the  floor, please.    [Concepcion] Well, you painted one situation. I think the  visible face of an economic situation in a given country is  often reflected in those things that affect us more directly.  Unquestionably, the energy crisis is the essential point here  and can reflect the country's situation, whether we are well or  not economically, because of the implications it might have on  our technological development, on our social and economic  infrastructure, et cetera.    Now, independent of some details concerning the blackouts  you  mentioned, we must insist on some ideas that can somehow explain  the current situation. I am one of those who have always  expressed -- and last year when the situation was very serious  and spiraling, especially in 1993 when the economic situation  was very difficult -- I expressed a super optimism. And today I  want to ratify this optimism based on some elements and facts  showing that our economy is beginning a slight and slow recovery  process.    As everyone knows, for instance, sugar is our main source of  currency. The sugar harvest for a long time will be our main  source of currency. And the current harvest, Osvaldo, is being  carried out under very difficult circumstances. We are all aware  that there are no spare parts, no rubber belts for tractors and  harvesters, but that the workers have been very creative and  have made tremendous efforts to fulfill our harvest goals.    A sugarcane recovery plan was also established, but was not  fully concluded due to logical problems, such as the lack of  fertilizers that are necessary for increasing the production  levels. Fertilizers are necessary and they must be paid for in  hard currency. We must also have fuel to run the pumps to  irrigate the areas equipped with irrigation systems, et cetera.  But I do have an idea that this year's harvest will be a bit  better than last year's. This gives us another example of the  resistance of our people and of the country under adverse  situations, in the wake of the collapse of the socialist bloc,  namely the USSR, and especially because of the Torricelli Law  which seeks to torment and humiliate us. This is the first  element we must consider.    [Rodriguez] I think it is also important to consider the  viewpoint of the common citizen who has no access to the  macroeconomic data and who is not informed about economic  issues. The economy is improving or worsening to the extent that  the situation also improves or worsens in his house, in his  homelife. Society will experience the same with those phenomena  we encounter on the streets called service, transport, and  commerce. The common citizen will consider that those things are  improving or worsening in accordance with the quality of those  services. For this reason, many believe that the increased  number of blackouts is a sign of a deteriorating economy.    Eloy, you also wanted to talk about sugarcane and the sugar  harvest situation. Well, everyone is aware of the material  difficulties we are experiencing because last year we had the  same problem. Next year I do not think the situation will be the  same. But I think there are other aspects to consider positive  within the Cuban economy. We must mention, for instance, the  prospects in the sugar industry, and without talking about  triumphalism, without saying that we have solved the problem, or  that we have found the formula to solve this problem, we must  first reach a consensus that we are on a path that will lead us  to an improving situation.    [Concepcion] Yes, upon conclusion of the harvest, or even  before concluding the harvest throughout the country, more  sugarcane is being planted in clean areas, and I would say that  in this special period, the efforts being made are yielding very  encouraging results.    Osvaldo, there is another element that is likewise  important:  Tobacco harvest this year was the best in years. This is a point  to be considered because it will also give us the possibility of  obtaining currency at levels higher than last year when the  harvest was affected by the Storm of the Century and by other  adverse weather conditions.    [Rodriguez] We have to clarify that the profits from this  tobacco, which still needs to be processed, will be seen by the  end of 1995 or perhaps the beginning of 1996, due to tobacco's  manufacturing requirements -- either made into cigars, or sold  in bulk. This crop's profit will be seen in 1995 or 1996.    [Concepcion] Yes. However, these are realities, rather than  prospects.    Within these prospects we have tourism, which, as everyone  knows, has experienced an increase of more than 30 percent in  hard currency earnings. We can also mention the creation of the  Basic Cooperative Production Units, which are quickly solving,  more than only the food needs of 4 or 5 million Cubans linked to  them -- 1 million direct workers and 3 or 4 million relatives.  We can also mention the issue of the decriminalization of  dollars [as heard], which, however, creates the well-known  problems of privilege and inequitable situations. However, we  cannot deny that the decriminalization of the dollar has also  been an element that has helped reactivate certain elements of  the economy. There are also the joint enterprises. There are  over 130 of these contracts, which are reactivating our economy.    [Rodriguez] Allow me to interrupt. I believe you have  forgotten certain things that represent significant  developments: One is oil extraction in Cuba. Last year, we  attained a record level of 1.1 million tons. This year, oil  workers began January with a very high level which might  forecast the breaking of last year's production record. Also,  the price of nickel on the international market has improved. We  have to add that biotechnology has been consolidating certain  products and above all, has been gaining a space in the market.  Recently, there have been reports about Cuban vaccines in  certain Latin American countries and the welcome they have  received in certain countries.    Eloy, we already discussed power outages as a symptom some  people -- I believe many people -- see as a new deterioration of  the national economic situation. I believe we have to discuss  this further.    [Concepcion] My personal opinion is that in the case of  power  outages, there is a lack of information, or there is not enough  information.    [Rodriguez] I agree.    [Concepcion] Those dry, brief notes from the Electric  Enterprise regarding a situation that affects and hurts the  entire population, are unacceptable. I believe our people are  capable -- they have proven so -- of undertaking the greatest  risks and difficulties so long as they are for independence, the  preservation of the fatherland, and the accomplishments of  socialism. I believe the people deserve everyday more, better,  and more detailed information. As far as I know, there are  breakdowns at electric plants due to the use of Cuban oil. Our  oil is rather heavy and loaded with sulfur and this damages the  entire national electric system. This is one factor.    The other is that many times the people complain that the  power is turned off in some regions and not in others. Yet, no  explanations are given. There are places where the power is  maintained because there is a hospital or neurology center which  needs the power to continue to operate and so their equipment is  not damaged. There are also certain neighborhoods where we find  this happening and this irritates the people. This can very well  be solved by an explanation of the problem to the people. I do  not believe the Electric Enterprise should be happy with a stark  three- line note once a week saying the outages will occur here  and there and there. Our people are not sheep. Our people are a  revolutionary people who have proven themselves for years, who  are capable of resisting and enduring the worst limitations so  long as they save the Revolution and the fatherland. However,  the people have to be kept well informed. They need to receive  all the details and information so they are able to understand  and better resist.    [Rodriguez] I believe that you have expressed the  irritation of the people.    If he has been excessive, it is because of that. He is  expressing the feelings of the Cuban people. I agree with you. I  have discussed this with comrades from the Electric Enterprise.  One of the excuses given is the highly technical details of the  explanation. I believe that we ought to find a clear way of  explaining to the people the difficulties at the electric  plants, which are not always a lack of fuel. There is also lack  of maintenance due to material difficulties. Last year, the  electric plants should have received investments or undergone  maintenance that requires investments of approximately $60  million. However, I believe that what was invested was minimal.  Therefore, the problems accumulate.    [Concepcion] We also need to know that the outages are going  to continue to a greater or lesser degree. The outages recently  increased because of a known situation, not sufficiently  explained, but known -- difficulties with fuel supplies from  Russia. Russia is now saying that the fuel accords might be  fulfilled. We hope so.    I believe that this situation will undoubtedly improve in  the  coming months. However, we need to clearly understand, and I  believe the people do, that outages will continue -- perhaps for  four hours, perhaps five -- until the Cuban economy becomes  stabilized, so that we can restructure the entire national  economy including all technological resources, which are high  consumers of fuel. This will take years.    [Rodriguez] To this, we must add that what has been stated  about Colombia's offer to sell oil to Cuba is on the basis of  world market trading, on the basis of liquid payment, or simply  a barter by which we sell to Colombia and buy oil from Colombia.  However, this does not mean that great amounts of Colombian oil  are going to be received, nor will it arrive on credit.    We need to understand that in Colombia we are going to have  the advantage of not having middlemen between the Cuban  Government and Colombia's oil company. Nowadays, when purchasing  oil on the international market, one needs otherwise to resort  to middlemen.     "

Why has the United States  sponsored an incident involving the Interests Section in Havana?  What has hurt the United States? Could it be that after 35 years  of frustration it can no longer resist a Cuba that keeps  resisting, and which in its [word indistinct] has adopted  initiatives to facilitate the reunion of Cuban families? Or is  it perhaps trying to create incidents with rumors like these, to  prevent the meetings called for by Cuba? Or was it perhaps  trying with this incident hastily to create charges to justify  its groundless accusations against our country at the UN Human  Rights Commission, which is meeting in Geneva? Or was it perhaps  trying to tarnish the rally it knew was scheduled to be held in  New York on 12 February in support of Cuba and the proposal that  Charles Rangel will submit to the U.S. Congress demanding the  lifting of the blockade? Or perhaps, because of its arrogance,  the United States can no longer resist the many blows such as  those scored by the success of Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina's tour of Africa; the great Israeli rabbi's recent  remarks about Fidel Castro; Ricardo Alarcon's tour of several  European nations; the agreements signed with businessmen from  developed nations who have publicly stressed the feasibility of  Cuban projects; and of Carlos Lage's successful visit to three  Latin American countries?    Imperialism, the Miami counterrevolution, and the warmongers  disguised as dissidents are fully and exclusively responsible  for the incident.    Cuba does not implement any coercive policy; neither does it  have any military base in any country whatsoever, nor does it  finance radio or television stations against any government, nor  does it lend its territory to shelter terrorist organizations  with all material and radio means to promote incidents like this  one.    The strength of the Cuban policy is based on its universally  recognized justice, its clear openness, and its loyalty to the  principles it proclaims.    The embassies in Cuba will always have the necessary  protection and facilities to carry out their activities and  provide security to their staffs, who also have the moral  obligation not to promote incidents which have nothing to do  with their diplomatic roles.    Trying to hold the Cuban press responsible for this incident  because of the recent publication of a number of works on the  emigration issue is a maneuver by certain U.S. sectors which can  have no other objective than trying to disguise the true origin  of the problem. It is childish to try to hold those who condemn  and denounce such an action responsible for it.    Once again it is confirmed that the streets of this country  belong to and will belong to revolutionaries. Under no pretext  will anyone jeopardize the fatherland's independence.    The economy is experiencing a special period, but the  dignity  and decency of a people who are displaying heroism will never be  at stake.    Today we must be more alert than ever. What imperialism  could  not achieve at Playa Giron or during the past 35 years, it is  now trying to achieve, as in the 1960's, by spreading lies and  rumors that could create incidents propitious for its goals.    It is not the Cuban Government that must give explanations  to  the people who might go to the U.S. Interests Section, but  rather the U.S. officials. Surely they have publicly explained  their rules for the issuance of visas, which will help dispel  the false rumors and unfounded illusions created.    Our action and our duty, clearly outlined during the  incident, are strictly based on the obligations of a nation and  have been fulfilled impartially and efficiently. Cuba will  continue granting all guarantees to those who are authorized by  the United States to travel or to emigrate to that country.    Nothing happened within the U.S. Interests Section. There is  not a single Cuban citizen inside the building. No one was  either injured or wounded. With the dispelling of the rumor,  everything returned to normal.    However, this type of incident or irresponsibility can  provoke more serious consequences, all the responsibility for  which will fall upon the promoters. This incident will serve as  a lesson to the unscrupulous perpetrators of this ordeal. No one  will ever step on the Revolution, because to step on the  Revolution means to step on the courage and resolution of  millions of Cubans who believe neither lies nor rumors when they  must defend their country's integrity.

Export earnings fell by about 60 per cent between 1989 and 1992, while imports fell by about 70 per cent in the same period. When in the spring of 1993 Cuba's sugar harvest output fell by a third compared to the 1992 level, President Fidel Castro knew he had to authorise significant economic changes if he was to reactivate the economy and save his regime. Since the summer of 1993, a series of economic reforms has been promulgated. Their effects are still difficult to gauge, but their design and preliminary results shed light on Cuba's near-term prospects. On July 26, Castro announced his decision to legalise the holding of dollars and other foreign currencies by ordinary Cubans, and their use in retail trade. The aim was to stimulate dollar remittances from Cuban-Americans to friends and relatives in Cuba. Foreign currencies may not be used, though, to pay wages or to stimulate domestic output directly. Under those limitations, the short-term economic and political effects have been problematic for the government. Who had dollars? The answer is those who had obtained them illegally; those who had been perhaps less politically loyal and had retained contacts with their relatives in the US; and those who had enjoyed the privilege of going overseas with Cuban government authorisation. Opening up the use of foreign currencies for purposes other than stimulation of production led to a rush on existing dollar retail stores established to serve tourists and diplomats. To curtail demand in these stores, the government decreed a 50 per cent price increase. The partial currency liberalisation also provided a strong incentive to ordinary Cubans to move out of the formal peso-denominated economy into the illegal economy or into the foreign currency segments of the formal economy. In effect, the government's decision expanded the money supply without increasing output. This created economic and political distress. In August, the government allowed individuals in more than 100 occupations to go into business for themselves (a modification in October excluded medical doctors and teachers). Until then, the only lawful way to contract a plumber or to get a hair-cut was to go to the state enterprise in charge of providing such services. The effects of freeing the market are modest, however, because most services had been freely, though illegally, available. The potential dynamism this measure could impart to the economy is also limited: no one is authorised to hire non-relatives. In September, the partial privatisation of state farms was authorised. Agricultural workers on state farms can now form private co-operatives. There are, though, three limitations. No one but the state can have property title to the land. No one can work by himself or herself; workers must join co-operatives. Moreover, all commercial output must still be sold to the ministry of agriculture. Because of these limitations, the economic results of the measures are modest and are likely to remain so unless additional steps are taken. Some are already in the pipeline. The central bank is considering changing the rigid exchange rate policy, a move which, with the decision to permit circulation of foreign currencies for retail trade, might enable Cuba to qualify to apply for membership in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank some time in 1994. These modest economic reforms have more far-reaching political implications. Above all, the Cuban government has admitted through these decisions that it can no longer govern much of the economy. The weakness of the Cuban state was especially evident in the decree authorising the free contracting of certain services. It says progressive taxation would be the best way to regulate and tax such activities, but then admits the government is incapable of administering such a system. Instead of tax payments relative to the volume of economic activity or to earnings, self-employed persons are to pay a monthly flat fee. Today Cuba has three co-existing economies. One is illegal. Another is legal and operates only in hard-currency. The third is the rapidly shrinking official economy, which operates in pesos through state enterprises. Most of Cuba's commercial transactions now occur in the first two private economies. The Cuban economy's transition from socialism is well under way.

I say important meeting because the  businessmen from the Netherlands are accompanied by a trade  mission from 22 companies, which will study at first hand the  possibilities of investing in the construction of waterworks and  port facilities, in the textile industry, and in food products.  Also present are representatives from important financial banks  and legal assistance. According to the chairman of the Dutch  party, Wuliam Want Waut [identified by caption], the objective  is to activate this group after years of regrettable immobility.    [Begin Wuliam Want Waut recording, in English with  superimposed translation into Spanish] The only problem is that  they need time. This is a characteristic of the Dutch. They need  time to study things in depth. However, we expect very good  results from this visit. [end recording]    The Netherlands is an important trading partner for Cuba,  one  whose exchange value over the past three years exceeded $50  million; they have, in Cuba, such prestigious companies as  Castrol, and they trade in areas as vital as nickel. Indeed,  thanks to the work of this bilateral group, a Dutch bank  extended credit to Cuba's nickel and sugar industries, although  Cuban representative (Ariel Maso) says there are other fields,  too.    This group will be making bilateral contacts until Friday  [25  March], when the individual and collective results of the  negotiations will be learned. Businessmen from both countries  can rely on a market that is needful and almost virgin and, in  addition, has the corresponding financing -- apparently all the  links to allow the economy to benefit.

Surplus liquidity increased as the country found itself  forced to reduce production and imports because of the  termination of the fair and fruitful ties that had existed with  the now dissolved socialist bloc.    The country's purchasing power was further reduced as a  result of the tightening of the U.S. economic blockade.  Eventually, supplies dwindled, and this led to Cuban workers  who found that they held large amounts of money they could not  spend.    Excess currency in circulation undermines the motivation to  work and to produce, and it fuels the black market which  benefits a group of citizens who dedicate themselves to  profiting from the needs of the majority.    One way of collecting this excess money is by increasing  prices on nonessential products and service fees, while making  adjustments designed to protect certain sectors of the  population.    In addition, the government will introduce these reforms  gradually and will continuing subsidizing staples to the tune of  365 million pesos a year. This helps the family economy a great  deal.    Today's cigarette price hike affects 3 million smokers, but  addicts as well as those who do not have this harmful habit will  continue receiving a monthly quota at prices below the new  price, but always higher than the current price.    Another reform that went into effect today has to do with  new  prices on liquor -- a category that rightly is considered  nonessential. The impact of this price hike will not affect the  entire population.    Today, 1 June, the fees for air and sea transportation to  and  from the Isle of Youth will also be increased, but the increases  will be relatively modest.    With the implementation today of the new prices on  cigarettes, liquor, and transportation to the Isle of Youth  begins the first phase of a plan that will cover other  nonessential products and services, although there will be some  exceptions based on specific situations. These new prices and  fees represent an increase in family expenditures, but everybody  knows that the funds collected will be used to benefit society.     "

As is well known, this tour began in Indonesia, the country  leading the nonaligned movement. The Indonesian Government and  the productive sectors in general have reaffirmed their  willingness and desire to increase trade and cooperation with  our country in several areas.    Robaina's trip through that region of ancient culture is  still underway, so it is premature to make an assessment, either  country by country or of the mission as a whole. I believe,  however, that the objective of these visits has been achieved.    Cuba needs to make known to the world the true situation  current in the country, and its new strategies to counteract the  perverse blockade and the collapse of the European socialist  bloc, particularly of the ex-Soviet Union. Our international  relations also have an impact on the priorities of our economy  within the context of principles.    Today I would like to underscore the importance of the Cuban  foreign minister's visit to India. This Asian country is one of  the most heavily populated nations on earth, a multinational,  multiethnic, and pluricultural country, the industry of which is  extremely versatile.    India and Cuba are linked by long-standing ties of  friendship. As you are all well aware, both were founders of the  nonaligned movement in 1961, and both countries demand the right  to a dignified life for Third World nations, which implies  international cooperation, trade without barriers, transfer of  technology in an unrestricted manner, and respect for  self-determination and national sovereignty.    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro had already visited this  vast  nation, the culture of which spans more than four milleniums,  and which was responsible for one of the earliest literary  creations of man. Its great forefathers and leading figures of  the modern state, beginning with Gandhi; then Nehru; later,  Nehru's daughter Indira; and finally, Rajiv Gandhi, have  enhanced the policy of peace, mutual understanding, and demands  for the rights of neglected peoples.    With all of these precedents, it is easy to assess the  importance of this visit the Cuban foreign minister will begin  within the next few hours to India, without minimizing, of  course, the visits he already made to other countries of the  region, and the visits he is still to make to other Asian  countries, all of them heirs to ancestral cultures.

We were discussing the underground economy, or the  submerged economy, as it is also called. I think there are many  people with doubts, and surely this program seeks to clear up  some of those doubts and explain some of these trends. I was  talking with an economics student about this program. She did  have the opportunity to listen. She said she was rather  surprised over your definition of this matter as an underground  economy, or black market, which are not the same. One is  implicit in the other, but they are not the same. I also think  this was the reason for an analysis of other subjects related to  this issue.    [Rodriguez] I can give you an additional definition: It is  also called an informal economy in other countries, namely in  Latin America. This submerged economy can be defined as an  aspect of the economics that are affecting Cuba at this moment.    [Roque] Yes, and in the previous program we said that this  is  not a problem in Cuba alone, but is a problem affecting all  societies. Also that it comes from a capitalist society.    [Rodriguez] Of course.    [Roque] This problem is a derivative of capitalist society,  and today this activity is at its peak in Latin American  economies. To define it, I was saying that transactions of goods  and services that are not officially authorized can be either  legal or illegal. Here is where some confusion can emerge  concerning the black market versus the underground economy. The  black market can be part of the underground economy, but it is  not the only thing within the underground economy.    Recently, in a program when my friend Renato Recio was  present, we were discussing the cigarette issue. We were saying  that a large number of people are assigned certain allocations  of cigarettes. One of the proposals submitted today in the  parliament is that in work places we should to try eliminate  these allocations. Well, according to a recent study conducted  by a group of friends from the Research Institute to which I had  access, they reached the conclusion that only 40 percent of the  people who receive normal and controlled allocations of  cigarettes are in fact smokers. The rest -- well, some of these  allocations go to the family, but others use them to sell in the  underground economy. This is the example I was giving the other  day, because if I, a nonsmoker, receive cigarettes that are  assigned to my house and I submit them to the informal economy,  either by selling or bartering them, it is neither an illegal,  nor a black-market activity. It is informal economics,  nonofficial economics. Of course, this situation does not affect  the economy as much as the black market because the black market  is within the underground economy. Well, to make it clearer, let  me tell you this: If I exchange one of my cigarette packs for a  bag of rice, it is not black market.    [Rodriguez] No, it is not black market, it is underground  economy; and if you sell that box of cigarettes, as usually  happens, at black-market price, it is not black market. It is  underground economy, but it does have an effect. The same thing  happens with those people who do not drink, but who sell their  rum at black-market prices.    [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy.  Osvaldo, why has this term emerged, and why has this phenomenon  occurred in the world economy?    [Rodriguez] First, let us begin with why it emerged in  Cuba. It was the shortage in state supplies to the population  that enlarged and consolidated this type of economy, which we  can call underground or informal economy. Undoubtedly, it is  nourished by excess currency that is not backed by goods. That  is its origin. I wish to point out that this existed or  coexisted before, with financial stability, when there were  undoubtedly deficiencies in the official market of products that  were in great demand. We could talk about shoes, for example.    [Roque] Yes, I believe that having discussed here the  concepts of black-market and underground economies, we can see  that it is not a phenomenon that has only now emerged, but as  you said, it existed in parallel with the stability of certain  years. I can remember that in the eighties -- I call this period  the golden decade because we were very stable, especially with  food products -- there were some products that were also sold on  the street in that way. It was not a black market, but you  needed to go to this underground economy to satisfy the need for  products that you could not find on the official market.    [Rodriguez] Yes, this study I was talking about makes an  interesting point: During the period of financial stability, the  population's expenses in the underground economy did not exceed  20 percent.    I would also like to answer the other part of your question  on how it emerged. I am sure that in your trips to Mexico you  have seen the illicit street vendors. This underground economy  is more prominent in Latin America and underdeveloped countries.  It is the economy of immigrants in developed countries.    [Roque] These people do not pay taxes. That is probably one  of the main things that make it an underground economy: It is  not controlled by the state.    [Rodriguez] Right, they are not officially authorized.    [Roque] There it has its beginnings. Here in Cuba it has a  different beginning.    [Rodriguez] Here it has other causes. Necessity is what  drives this economy. The main difference between the presence of  an underground economy in that market economy and in our economy  is that over there they compete below official prices.    [Roque] And the necessities are different.    [Rodriguez] Yes, of course. Here it is the speculators who  use the black market to try to get rich or to try to live better  than the average citizen.    [Roque] Something that stands out is that over there, it is  the complete opposite. There they lower the prices. In other  words, their prices are lower than those of the state.    [Rodriguez] Inside that economy, there is also a black  market  because many of the products that are sold at lower prices are  stolen, or are products that are smuggled into the country. They  therefore are not charged customs or taxes, and have a shady  origin.    [Roque] Let us talk about our problem. How can we resolve  this situation -- do away with the underground economy? We know  that the main factor is production. We must stabilize production  levels in general. Without goods to back the excess currency  circulating on the streets... [pauses] everything is connected  here. Everything is related to the other. People must accept  this information and these explanations in order to understand  the concepts of the economy.    [Rodriguez] I think you are right. We must first increase  our  production, as you said before, but we must also remember that  the official market will take some time to change. There is a  group of needs, especially services. The underground economy  involves not only the sale of goods, it also includes the sale  of services. That too forms part of the underground economy. It  is going to take some time to be able to solve that.    [Roque] And in this case of services, can the tax system  help, or contribute toward putting an end to this phenomenon?    [Rodriguez] Well, if it is organized, it can. We cannot say  that self-employed workers are part of the underground economy  because they are authorized and licensed by the state. They pay  taxes to the state and are authorized to produce and market  their product in determined places. They are not the problem.  The problem is those who do this illegally. It is those persons  who provide services or who sell their products illegally. We  cannot always call things illegal, because there are times when  there is no law, as in the example we mentioned of selling  something from our house. There is no law that prohibits me from  selling something from my house and there is no law that imposes  a tax on that sale. There are countries where that does exist.  Any transaction between two people requires a tax to the state  because it is a business transaction.    [Roque] We are talking about the underground economy. I must  admit that this is a topic I do not know much about since I am  not an economist; but at the same time, I am very interested, as  are many of the listeners.    [Rodriguez] I am not an economist either, but I have read  some material that I have received and I believe it is an  interesting subject because it is a passionate subject. It is  something we are currently living.    [Roque] Let us look at this study that was conducted. I can  see that we are concerned about this problem. We are at least  studying the phenomenon and looking for ways or alternatives for  its solution.    [Rodriguez] Yes, this study has a series of proposals that  we  could leave for another program, because they are interesting  proposals.    [Roque] We are going to have to call them Underground  Economy  One, Underground Economy Two, and present a series of  programs....    [Rodriguez, interrupting] ... and proposals for solutions to  the underground economy. These researchers point out something  very interesting: They say that everytime there is a structural  imbalance between supply and demand, there will be economic  space for the underground economy, which is created through the  redistribution of income. Of course, we are talking about the  Cuban phenomenon. We are not talking about the underground  economy of other places where the prices are below those of the  official market. We are talking about our situation. We must  remember that people go to the underground economy to improve  the structure of consumption, due to deficiencies in the  assortment and existence of products from the state supply.  People also go to the underground economy in cases when they  have excess income, to try to increase satisfaction of their  needs. These are the reasons why people go to this underground  economy. Just recently, this was discussed on a Straight Talk  program.    For the most objective analysis of our current situation,  the  financial imbalance, we must look at the merchandise, not the  money. Money keeps accruing because there is a lack of goods. As  soon as these goods begin to appear, and these measures that we  are all waiting for are applied to balance our domestic economy,  the problems of this underground economy will also be solved. As  these products we are all hoping to produce begin appearing, we  start to hope that one day we will have the money to buy them.  As the excess currency begins disappearing, the black-market  prices will not be as high as those that the worker must pay  with their salaries.    [Roque] At least there can be an end to this black market.  Is  it the same for the underground economy, or is it a phenomenon  that will be with us for many years to come?    [Rodriguez] I believe that when the economy is stabilized  and  there is a balance between supply and demand, or when supply is  slightly higher than demand -- when that happens, and it happens  in any economy because there is always a supply facing the flow  of currency -- I believe, because I am realistic, that what is  happening in other countries will happen -- an underground  economy will exist and will be below the official market. I do  not think it will disappear.    [Roque] The most important thing now is to keep producing,  to  gradually restore the value of our money, and to achieve market  stability, as you said, so that people will feel relieved.    [Rodriguez] Yes. I believe this relief will be experienced  after a given period -- following the implementation of measures  -- not immediately. We have said several times on this program  that measures cannot be considered a magic wand to yield  immediate results in the economy. All economies have a delayed,  not an immediate effect, unless drastic shock measures are  adopted such as changing the monetary system.    [Roque] Yes. Well, I thank you for your participation in  this  program. Of course, I invite you to comment again on part three  of The Underground Economy.     "

0,FT943-5957 ,"FT943-5957 _AN-EIAD1ADGFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Russia withdraws   Yesterday's ceremonies, marking the final withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany and the Baltic states, celebrated the peaceful liberation of central Europe from the Red Army and drew a line under the second world war. History has, once again, given Russia and Germany the chief responsibility for the peace, prosperity and freedom of central Europe. Fortunately, the Germany that has emerged from two world wars and the Cold War is a stable, democratic country firmly anchored in Nato and the European Union. Meanwhile, Russia seems committed to re-integrating itself into the world economy and repairing the damage caused by 75 years of self-imposed tyranny. The litmus tests of these countries' future behaviour will be Moscow's continued willingness to honour the independence of the Baltic states and united Germany's toleration of post-war frontiers that leave most of former Pomerania and Prussia in Polish hands. Russia and Germany have much to gain from growing economic prosperity and self-confidence in the central European and Baltic states which, all too often in the past, have been crushed by the machinations of their neighbours, acting in concert. But the greatest gainer from the decline in the power and influence of the Red Army could be Russia itself. Under communist rule the Soviet Union became the most militarised society on earth. The health and wealth of Soviet citizens were sacrificed in the vain effort to wear down the west. Now, at last, Russians and citizens of other former Soviet states have an opportunity to use their talents and resources to repair the environmental, economic, social, physical and psychological scars left by the ill-conceived communist experiment. Nostalgia for the imperial past is misplaced. The decks have been cleared for Russia to concentrate on its own affairs. So far as its security is concerned, the main tasks are to keep its nuclear weapons under watchful control and to replace the sprawling conscript army of the past with a smaller, better equipped and trained professional force. The main challenge, however, is to build an economy responsive to consumers, whose needs were neglected for decades. The old economy produced world-class rockets but terrible shoes. Russia's military withdrawal from Europe should free up the men and resources needed to shift the balance at last towards a productive civilian economy.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

For the  previous publications, see the issues of our newspaper for 22  and 29 December 1993.    Investment in the economy of the country, that is, making  outlays for its development, means laying a foundation for the  future prosperity of society. The growth of investment means  drawing closer to a such a future; slowing investment down means  eating away at our own potential, eating away at our own selves.    What is the investment situation in the economy of Estonia  today? We must note, first, that we lack any kind of clear-cut  statistical base with regard to all sectors. Why do we lack it?  It is impossible to gather the necessary data all at once for  the tens of thousands of enterprises, mostly small and  medium-size ones, and analyze all of them to see what kinds of  processes are developing there. However, we can discuss  estimates.    So, the total volume of investment in the economy of Estonia  in nine months of 1993 came to about 2 billion kroons and, in  comparable prices, remained at the level of the corresponding  period of 1992. Under our circumstances, this is a positive  note. Investment on the whole did not decrease, although it did  not grow either, while we know how difficult the period is our  society is now going through. The enterprises themselves have a  bare minimum of funds for investment, and this is well known.    It is no accident that under the circumstances we are  placing  our bets on foreign investment, on luring foreign investors to  Estonia. We clearly lack our own capital.    However, in this instance the numbers are quite  contradictory. There are statistical data, but they take into  account only foreign investment as of the moment of the  establishment of a given joint venture or foreign enterprise.  This is their original contribution, and it is reflected by  statistics. However, current contributions to already operating  joint ventures or foreign enterprises, or the same enterprises  established earlier, do not show up in the statistics.    According to statistical data, the following quite  approximate picture emerges. As of the end of the first quarter  of 1993, the volume of foreign investment came to just 2.2  billion kroons, and by the end of the third quarter, had  increased to 2.5 billion kroons. That is to say, the total  volume of investment during the year, as has already been noted,  remained at the same level--2.2 billion kroons during the year,  but the share of foreign investors increased. How are these  numbers to be evaluated?    There is a council of experts at the Institute for the Study  of Trends. This council believes that the course of the  investment process is unsatisfactory; there is little  investment, more is necessary.    However, this is after all a maximalist approach. We wish  well, but realistic potential must be taken into account, too.  It is good in and of itself that we are registering a continuous  growth of foreign investment, although of course more can be  desired.    It is also necessary to note that at present only one-fourth  of all investment goes to industry, and the rest goes to other  sectors. In other words, a process of structural changes in the  economy is underway. Indeed, industry used to be the sector that  got investment first. Foreign investors now understand that this  is not the best investment there is, and are investing in the  service and trade sectors. Therefore, structural changes in the  economy occur in our country under the influence of foreign  capital, among other things.    Statistical data indicate that during the nine months of  1993  foreign investment came to 625 million kroons, of which 208  million kroons were in the third quarter. In turn, according to  the balance of payments, that is, data from the Bank of Estonia,  it turns out that in the nine months of 1993 foreign investment  came to 1.5 billion kroons. We have already said which data show  up in the statistics and which do not. The discrepancy results  precisely from this. Therefore, the data of the Bank of Estonia  should be considered closer to the truth.    Who precisely are the largest foreign investors? They are  companies from Sweden and Finland. The volume of investment by  Russia keeps decreasing. In the third quarter of 1993 Russia  merely ranked seventh, with a volume of investment of 8 million  kroons.    Data on investment in its own economy are published in  Russia  accurately, quarter after quarter. Naturally, the high rate of  inflation hampers foreign investors, and a drop in the volume is  being registered. Nonetheless, the level of investment remains  quite high. Thus in the first quarter of 1993 the volume of  investment came to 97 percent compared to the corresponding  period of 1992, and in the third quarter--93 percent.    The total volume of foreign investment in Russia came to $7  billion as of the end of the second quarter of 1993. Germany and  the United States are the main investors.    If we compare the per capita volumes of foreign investment  in  Russia and in our country (based on statistical data), we will  obtain $46 for Russia and $115 for Estonia in the first half of  1993.    Here are a few more numbers. In Russia the number of joint  ventures comes to 7,000, and in Estonia--4,000. These are  absolute numbers, and they speak volumes. At present Estonia  amounts to a more attractive bridgehead for foreign investors  than Russia.     "

How many telephone contacts did they have and  what did they discuss?    [Robaina] As far as I know, there was only one telephone  conversation arranged by a common friend. With regard to the  topic of their conversation, I think that President Menem's  account of this talk corresponded better with the truth. In  other words, they discussed subjects that do not necessarily  have anything to do with politics.    [Sopena] With regard to the different approaches adopted by  Menem and Castro, why does it bother Cuba that a democratically  elected Latin American president, whether Menem or any other,  should say that Cuban citizens also ought to have the  opportunity to choose their rulers in freely contested elections?    [Robaina] It does not bother us at all, but I think that  both  countries face different realities. I believe that we should  not be questioned as if we lived in a normal country because my  country continues to be a country whose living conditions are  those of a besieged stronghold. And a besieged stronghold  cannot afford the luxuries it would aspire to if it lived under  normal conditions.    [Sopena] Has the accession of Bill Clinton to the U.S.  presidency somehow changed things?    [Robaina] No. Perhaps the only substantial public change is  that Clinton is not as aggressive as Bush. But leaving this  consideration aside, perhaps there is an even more repressive  stance on the trade embargo. Hence, there is no reason  whatsoever for being overly enthusiastic.    [Sopena] Let us imagine a possible scenario in which, in a  move comparable to Nixon when he recognized the PRC, President  Clinton decided to lift the embargo and Cuba became a country  just like the others. What would change in Cuba? Would there  be an economic and political opening?    [Robaina] Well, seeing is believing. However, I would say  that, under normal living conditions, Cuba will develop a work  system in which everything may be analyzed.    [Sopena] The embargo seems to be the main argument put  forward to explain Cuba's dire financial straits. But is it not  a way to hide the domestic economic system's inherent  inefficiencies, which have nothing to do with the embargo?    [Robaina] There is no denying the fact that there are  inefficiencies but, comparatively, the embargo continues to be  the main cause of our problems.    [Sopena] How far will the current economic opening drive go?    [Robaina] As far as it can adapt to our circumstances. We  will widen those possibilities as we become more acquainted with  the system once the foreign capital we need comes to our country  and is channeled into investments.    [Sopena] Would Cuba privatize some sectors of its economy?    [Robaina] We believe the state has proved that it is  efficient in many areas. There are others, however, in which we  have started to work together with the private sector.  Nevertheless, I think that a long road lies ahead of us so it  is still too early to evaluate what we will do afterward.    [Sopena] Does Castro wholly mistrust private activity?    [Robaina] Both Castro and all of us have seen that in some  places where the economy is administered by the private sector  it has proved to be efficient whereas in other places it has  not. Moreover, I believe that the neoliberal model has yielded  good results in some places and is teaching us things that we  have to study in-depth. This includes the partnership with the  private sector, and even the privatization of what has to be  privatized in some areas. However, one should not run away with  the idea that these changes will come overnight.    [Sopena] The world is changing rapidly nowadays. Does Cuba  not run the risk of staying behind?    [Robaina] We cannot afford to make mistakes because what  others do without being subject to pressure, we must accomplish  under pressure.     "

The immediate goal of that effort, according to an editorial  published today by the weekly TRABAJADORES, is to combine during  May and June the cutting and processing of all the available  sugar cane with a sowing effort that has been termed colossal,  as well as to carry out extensive cleaning of the sugar cane  fields before spring.    In an effort to use existing manpower to its maximum  capacity, men and machinery will be transferred from various  provinces to other territories so that they can complete the  harvest in their places of operation, to cutting down and  processing all of the sugar cane.    The newspaper, published by the Central Organization of  Cuban  Trade Unions [CTC], explained that this will be a concerted  effort among forces and teams that have achieved the highest  yield and discipline. It will include tens of thousands of  workers, while other contingents will devote themselves to  sowing, fertilizing, and manual cutting.    The newspaper tells the country that it is necessary to win  in the current sugar cane harvest and adds that the goal is to  surpass the last harvest's production by several thousand tons,  thus starting the agriculture industry's recovery.    Decisions on these matters are occurring at the same time as  deputies of the National Assembly of the People's Government  (parliament) are discussing the general guidelines of a package  of measures designed to end the country's financial imbalance  and decrease the amount of excess currency in circulation, thus  restoring the value of salaries.    TRABAJADORES says that, aside from being the country's  leading source of revenue, sugar production is also a measure of  the country's heartbeat. The current sugar harvest is vital to  halting what it terms the depression afflicting the national  economy.    It added: This will be an indicator of Cuban capacity for  countering enormous shortages and difficulties that now exist.    Within this strategy, Cuba intends to have within the next  few years the necessary raw materials to achieve former levels  of sugar production. But in 1994 it defines its eventual  success only as a harvest which surpasses that of 1993, which  was 4.2 million tons.    The state of mind which prevails among workers who  participate in the sugar battle is at its highest, the CTC  publication's editorial concludes.     "

Of these studies, 10 were ranked as outstanding, and one  entitled the Environmental Radiological Study of the Republic of  Cuba won an award from the Academy of Science of Cuba (ACC), one  of the most important awards of all the institutions under the  ACC.    According to Sean, in the 1993 contest the introduction and  categorization of studies of previous years were made.    Among these studies is one of three varieties of rice in  which genetic traits were introduced via irradiation, and one of  the technology for activating polystyrene plates [placas de  polistireno], which are of great use for investigations of  various types.    During this period, different institutions sold and  contracted 12 pieces of equipment developed by specialists from  the Center of Applied Studies for the Development of Nuclear  Energy (Ceaden).    In addition, it was learned in 1993 Sean guaranteed the  country's basic services in the field of dosimetry and  radiological protection.    Sources of nuclear energy that were not being used in the 14  provinces and in the special municipality of the Isle of Youth  were gathered and rendered inactive and were taken to the  nuclear waste site near the outskirts of the capital.    During the period, nuclear experts were able to maintain a  stable functioning of the national network of radiological  operations.    Other works continued by Cuban atomic energy experts with  the  arrival of new patients concerns the evaluation of radiation  effects on children from Chernobyl at a tourist installation  east of Havana.    After a detailed study of current conditions, it was agreed  to maintain the nuclear option in the electromagnetic Cuban  system.    During the last six months of last year, work was done in  this regard, and a gradual national planning strategy was  devised to face the future programs of nuclear energy  development.    The construction of the first electronuclear center (CEN) on  this Caribbean island has come to a standstill due to the  difficult situation the Cuban economy is facing.    A program in which nuclear builders and experts will  participate was designed to offer maintenance to installation  programs. This will be done until conditions permit the  completion of the first two reactors in the central-southern  Province of Cienfuegos.    Meanwhile, qualified personnel of the first Cuban CEN have  devoted their work to applying nuclear energy to other fields,  so as to contribute to national economic development.     "

Ross said it is necessary to give a political tenor to the  workers' assemblies initiated one week ago so that workers may  discuss how to improve the nation's economic situation and put  the country's domestic finances in order.    The island's most important labor leader said that the  country wants to overcome the current crisis in such a way that  it will be able to continue defending the achievements of the  people and of socialism, the daily GRANMA reports today.    A similar position has been taken by Ricardo Alarcon,  president of the Cuban Parliament. He said that this phase of  discussions about measures to put the country's domestic  finances in order and other key matters of the economy also  forms part of the political battle for island development.    The country's authorities have promoted collective debates  in  search for a national consensus on the adoption of decisions  capable of balancing a fiscal deficit of approximately 4.2  billion pesos (the peso is equivalent to the dollar at the  official exchange rate) and decreasing the excess 10 billion  pesos now circulating.    In the assemblies that have been held the members of labor  unions have spoken in favor of reducing subsidies on some state  products and services, eliminating undue free services,  increasing the prices of nonstaples, and offering social  security only to people who really need it.

Considering the serious and urgent nature of these  documents,  as well as certain special features of the present situation in  Russia, we are citing them in full.    Yu. Skokov had previously already carried on negotiations  with the prime minister and the closest assistants of the  president with respect to questions of guaranteeing the  interests of domestic commodity producers. These discussions  were held in a constructive spirit.    It is not difficult to observe that certain provisions of  the  appeal of the FTR Council to the government were utilized in  Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly.    Appeal of the Council of the Federation of the Commodity  Producers of Russia to the Government of the Russian Federation    The Second Congress of the commodity producers of Russia,  which took place in December 1993, defined the basic problems of  domestic commodity production and formulated the immediate and  strategic goals of the association of commodity producers.    The position of the commodity producers with respect to  questions of their cooperation with organs of state power is  stated and demands regarding the creation of conditions ensuring  such cooperation expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of  Commodity Producers adopted at the congress. The indicated  declaration was sent to the Government of the Russian Federation.    On the instructions of the Congress the Council of the  Federation of Commodity Producers considers it necessary to  direct the attention of the government to the fact that the  growth of negative processes in the sphere of commodity  production which is going on at the present time threatens to  cause a chain reaction of dramatic social, political and  economic consequences.    Tension in the economy has reached a critical point. Forced  large-scale open and hidden unemployment can become the powerful  detonator of a social explosion, since the state is not in a  position to guarantee the protection of the basic social rights  of the unemployed and there is no law regulating the relations  of the unemployed with the state and fixing the duties and  obligations of the state in relation to a person who has to all  intents and purposes become a hostage of irresponsible  experiments and political games.    It is necessary, finally, to honestly say that the basic  cause of the developing inflation is the catastrophic drop in  commodity production. The methods of struggling with inflation  being practiced can only lead to the complete collapse of the  economy. The means of regulating the economy being proposed are  inadequate for the state of the national economy and have led to  the fracturing of the resources and commodities markets and  those of financial and industrial capital, and to investment and  payments crises. As a result complete collapse threatens the  economy and disintegration and chaos the state.    The Council of the Federation of Commodity Producers:    --proposes that the Government of the Russian Federation  conclude an agreement defining the procedure for the  implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Commodity  Producers and the cooperation of the parties in developing a  coordinated position in the tactics and strategy of the further  reformation of the economy;    --considers immediate consultations of the chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation with the chairman of the  Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the purpose  of discussing and adopting an agreement and a joint plan of  actions to be necessary;    --insists on the promulgation by the government of a precise  plan of actions for stabilizing the economy and preventing the  destruction of technological and intellectual potentials;    --considers it advisable for the agreement to be discussed  in  labor collectives and implemented in cooperation with the heads  of administrations, regional unions of commodity producers and  interregional associations for the economic cooperation of the  subjects of the Federation.    If the government does not see the need for a joint search  for ways to get out of the crisis and for securing a  qualitatively new system of interrelations with commodity  producers, then the Federation Council thinks that the  government has a right to reach such a decision. However, it  should be kept in mind that the economic reforms begun in the  name of democracy and a better life for the citizens of Russia  should not become the next tragedy in the country's history,  which imposes a special responsibility in relation to the people  and to history on all who have taken the levers of power into  their hands.    The draft of an agreement of the Government of the Russian  Federation with the Federation of Commodity Producers is  attached.    On the instructions of the Council of the Federation of the  Commodity Producers of Russia    Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity Producers  of Russia Yu. Skokov    Draft Agreement on the Cooperation of the Government of the  Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations  of the Commodity Producers of Russia    Recognizing the need to combine the efforts of the  Government  of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public  Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the  purpose of:    --formulating a stable system of commodity production and a  stage-by-stage large-scale restructuring of Russia's economy on  new principles and creating a balanced national economy on this  basis;    --retaining strategic and work-available resources,  including  the country's scientific-technical and technologicial potential;    --setting up a national self-developing market oriented to  the domestic commodity producer and creating new forms for the  self-organization of commodity producers on the regional and  interregional levels;    --realistically achieving the social guarantees of all  subjects of commodity production;    --creating an effective system for the cooperation of the  Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the  Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia in  implementing economic transformations in the country secured by  procedures for the coordination of the interests, principles,  and procedures of joint actions;    the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation  of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia  conclude the following agreement:    Article 1    The Government of the Russian Federation recognizes the  ""Declaration of the Rights of the Commodity Producers of the  Russian Federation"" as one of the basic documents when  developing the strategic course of economic reforms and the  methods of its implementation.

Article 2    The Federation of the Public Assocations of the Commodity  Producers of Russia is to ensure the coordination of the  economic policy of the Government of the Russian Federation with  federal and regional associations of commodity producers and  with labor collectives.    For the purpose of implementing understandings achieved with  the Government of the Russia Federation on the basis of a  coordinated position the Federation of the Public Associations  of the Commodity Producers of Russia is to ensure the combining  of the efforts of commodity producers and labor collectives with  respect to their implementation in cooperation with the organs  of regional power.    Article 3    For the purpose of organizing the direct cooperation of the  Government of the Russian Federation with the Federation of the  Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia and of  taking into account the position of domestic commodity producers  when developing and reaching governmental decisons with respect  to problems of the social and economic development of the  country, the Government of the Russian Federation and the  Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers  of Russia are to form a joint council of experts on commodity  production within a month from the date of the signing of the  present agreement.    The activity of the council is to be regulated by a Statute  on the council of experts on commodity production approved by  the Government of the Russian Federation in coordination with  the Council of the Federation of the Public Associations of the  Commodity Producers of Russia.    The staff of the council of experts is to be organized by  the  Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the  Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia.    Article 4    Within two weeks from the date of the signing of the  agreement the Government of the Russian Federation and the  Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers  of Russia are to create joint commissions on the basis of parity  consisting of representatives of the Federation of the Public  Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia and the  interested ministries and departments of the Russian Federation  for examination of the immediate problems of domestic commodity  production.    Article 5    The Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation  of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia  are to form a conciliation board (soglasitelnaya kommissiya)  under the chairmanship of the first deputy chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation and the chairman of the  Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers  of Russia for coordination of the basic directions of joint  activity with respect to the implementation of social and  economic policy.    In the process of preparing and discussing the drafts of the  economic programs of the Government of the Russian Federation  representatives of the appropriate committees of the State Duma  and the Council of the Federation of the Federal Assembly of the  Russian Federation are to be able to participate in the work of  the conciliation board.    Article 6    The Government of the Russian Federation is to refer draft  bills on questions of economic policy to the coordination of the  Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers  of Russia for the conducting of an independent public appraisal.    The Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity  Producers of Russia is to submit its own proposals and  observations to the Government of the Russian Federation within  agreed-upon time periods, in case of the adoption of which it is  to be obliged to ensure the development of a mechanism for their  implementation in the commodity production system.    Article 7    For the purpose of stabilizing the economic activity of the  economic complexes of the regions and of working out new  organizational forms for implementing regional economic policy  the Federation of the Public Associations of the Commodity  Producers of Russia is to render methodological and  organizational assistance for the self-organization of commodity  producers on the regional level and to promote the coordination  of the activities of commodity producers and organs of regional  power under conditions of the decentralized management of the  economy and a change in the principles of shaping regional and  industrial policy.    Article 8    The Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation  of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia  are to be obliged to examine the course of the implementation of  the present Agreement no less than twice a year.    Article 9    The present agreement is to enter into force from the moment  of its signing and is to operate indefinitely unless one of the  parties officially notifies the other party of the need to  review and change it or to cease its operation.

0,FT921-12766 ,"FT921-12766 _AN-CAXBAAE6FT 920124   FT  24 JAN 92 / Castro crackdown leaves him a castaway at home: The increasing international isolation of Cuba      By DAMIAN FRASER and CANUTE JAMES   CUBA'S attempts to seek new economic partners, following the demise of the Soviet Union, are being placed in jeopardy by a new purge of opposition leaders in Cuba and the execution on Monday of a Cuban exile. The crackdown has shaken President Fidel Castro's fragile relations with the Latin American and Spanish leaders who count among his last remaining friends abroad, and on whom he is depending for vital foreign investment. Since the execution of Eduardo Diaz Betancourt, the leader of a group of three Cuban-Americans apparently set on sabotage in Cuba, Mr Castro has come under diplomatic attack across the world. The German government expressed 'profound consternation'. The European Community said the execution was a 'great obstacle' to better relations. France, Spain and the Vatican, among others, expressed dismay. The reaction underlines the president's growing dilemma. As Professor Jorge Dominguez of Harvard University says: 'Mr Castro's chances for co-operation with Latin America grow if he does not crack down internally; but his reading of the changes in eastern Europe suggests that he ought to crack down'. Heightened repression is also bound to scare away some of the foreign investment that Mr Castro is hoping will pull Cuba out of its economic troubles. On Wednesday, Germany cancelled a bilateral air transport accord. The extent to which the government is willing to go to deal with dissent was indicated by Mr Raul Castro, defence minister and the president's brother, who said the administration would respond violently to any opposition. He warned opponents that the government would not hesitate to reconvene emergency revolutionary tribunals, scrapped 20 years ago, to determine sentences for violence against the government and the country. The capture of the three Cuban-Americans three weeks ago has provided the Havana government with some justification for its claims that it is under threat and must defend itself, and rationalises a crackdown on opposition elements which appears to have been intensified this week. As the first execution for 'counter-revolutionary activity' in 20 years, it also seemed meant to warn groups which have been making public criticisms of the Castro administration. It has also allowed a temporary diversion, clearly to the government's relief, from the deepening economic problems which have overtaken the country after the end of communism in the Soviet Union and eastern Europe, and stem also from the unbending 30-year US embargo on trade with Cuba. Reports this week of further detentions of opposition figures follow the arrest of some 60 activists since September last year, almost half of whom remain in jail. This comes after a modest political liberalisation in the mid-to-late 1980s and reflects in part an attempt to link the supporters of democracy with alleged US-sponsored attempts to overthrow the regime. More significant: it shows Mr Castro's fear that the discontent (so far mainly silent) caused by the rapid deterioration in the economy will translate into organised opposition. The tough actions have damaged the hopes of some Latin leaders that prospects of Latin American economic integration and foreign investment would encourage Mr Castro to curb political repression. The so-called Group of Three - Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela - invited Mr Castro to Mexico in late October to preach that message. While not offering aid, the three 'agreed to fight for the rapid and total integration of Cuba into the Latin American family', and to promote foreign investment in Cuba. The barely concealed objective was to prod Mr Castro into more reforms, in return for economic help and membership of the emerging Latin American economic bloc. This conciliatory approach contrasts not only with the unbending US position, but also with that of some Latin nations which prefer that help to Cuba be conditional on clear promises for reform. Cuba has rejected such interference in its affairs and has hit back at its Latin American critics. This makes it increasingly difficult for Latin countries to include Cuba in their regional plans.

Background      On August 20, 1994, President Clinton announced steps to limit the ability of the Cuban government to accumulate foreign exchange. Accordingly, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (``FAC'') is amending the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 CFR Part 515 (the ``Regulations''), to implement these measures by revising existing provisions that heretofore have generally authorized travelrelated transactions, cash remittances, and the shipment of gift parcels to Cuba. Specifically, 515.533 no longer authorizes exportation to Cuba of gift parcels pursuant to General License GIFT, 771.18 of the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Parts 768799 (the ``EAR''), except those containing only food, vitamins, seeds, medicines, medical supplies and devices, hospital supplies and equipment, equipment for the handicapped, clothing, personal hygiene items, veterinary medicines and supplies, fishing equipment and supplies, soapmaking equipment, or certain radio equipment and batteries for such equipment. The complete list of eligible items is set forth in 771.18 of the EAR.   Section 515.560 of the Regulations is revised to limit the categories of travelers to Cuba who are generally authorized to engage in travelrelated transactions to journalists and officials of the United States or foreign governments or international organizations traveling on official business. ``Fullyhosted'' travelers are no longer authorized to travel aboard charter flights between the United States and Cuba. Section 515.416 is revised to set forth the criteria by which specific licenses may be issued for travelrelated transactions for ``professional research.'' Travel transactions by close relatives of Cuban nationals may only be authorized on a casebycase basis by specific license, and only under circumstances of extreme hardship. Specific licenses for travelrelated transactions may still be issued for other strictly humanitarian purposes, for clearly defined educational or religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or for activities related to professional research, telecommunications, or the exportation, importation or transmission of information or informational materials.  Section 515.563, which previously provided general authorization for family remittances for the support of close relatives in Cuba, is revised to permit transfers of funds to Cuba only if authorized on a casebycase basis for humanitarian purposes upon a demonstration of extreme hardship. However, payments not exceeding $500 to facilitate a close relative's lawful immigration to the United States remain generally licensed. All other general authorizations contained in the Regulations for remittances are revoked. In particular, 515.564 is revised to specify that remittances to Cuba for purposes of facilitating a Cuban national's travel to the United States for purposes other than immigration may only be made pursuant to a specific license. Similarly prohibited are remittances to Cuba in connection with intellectual property protection (515.528) and public performances (515.565).  Because the Regulations involve a foreign affairs function, Executive Order 12866 and provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, opportunity for public participation, and delay in effective date are inapplicable. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this rule, the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601612, does not apply.

Subpart D_Interpretations      2. Section 515.416 is revised to read as follows:       515.416     Professional research and similar activities.      (a) Section 515.560(b) sets forth the criteria by which specific licenses for transactions related to travel to, from, and within Cuba may be issued for persons who are engaging in professional research and similar activities of a noncommercial, academic nature.  (1) Persons are considered to be engaged in     professional research     for purposes of this section only if they are fulltime professionals who travel to Cuba to do research in their professional areas, their research is specifically related to Cuba and will constitute a full work schedule in Cuba, and there is a substantial likelihood of public dissemination of the product of their research. No transactions related to tourist or recreational travel within Cuba are authorized in connection with professional research, except those that are consistent with a full schedule of research activities.  (2)     Similar activities     include attendance by professionals with an established interest in Cuba at professional meetings where research on Cuba is shared, and travel for noncommercial research purposes specifically related to Cuba by persons who are working to qualify themselves academically as professionals (e.g., certain graduate degree candidates). Study visits to Cuba in connection with precollege or undergraduate college course work are not within the scope of the term     professional research and similar activities    .  (b) Categories of travel which do not qualify as professional research or similar activities and for which specific license requests will be denied include recreational travel; tourist travel; travel in pursuit of a hobby; general study tours; general orientation visits; student class field trips; youth camps; research for personal satisfaction only; travel by fishing or birdwatching groups and similar affinity groups; and any travel for an authorized research purpose, if the schedule of activities includes free time, travel, or recreation in excess of that consistent with a full work schedule of professional research and similar activities.  (c) A group does not fall within the scope of the term     professional research and similar activities     merely because some members of the group could qualify individually for specific licensing under this category. For example, a specific license authorizing travelrelated transactions by a fish biologist who travels to Cuba to engage in professional research does not authorize other persons who might travel with the fish biologist but whose principal purpose in travel is to engage in recreational or trophy fishing. The fact that such persons may engage in certain activities with, or under the direction of, the professional fish biologist, such as measuring or recording facts about their catch, does not bring these individuals' activities within the scope of professional research and similar activities.  (d) A person will not qualify as engaging in professional research or similar activities merely because that person is a professional who plans to travel to Cuba. For example, a professor of history interested in traveling to Cuba for the principal purpose of learning or practicing Spanish or attending general purpose lectures devoted to Cuban culture and contemporary life would not qualify for a specific license. A doctoral candidate in economics traveling to Cuba to undertake research for a dissertation on the Cuban economy may qualify for a specific license for activities directly related to the research, but would not be authorized to stay an extra week in Cuba in order to attend a seminar on Cuban arts and crafts.           Subpart E_Licenses, Authorizations, and Statements of Licensing Policy      515.522    [Removed and reserved]      3. Section 515.522 is removed and reserved.  4.

Paragraph (g) of 515.560 is amended by adding after the word ``provided'' in the last sentence thereof the words ``that the travel is not aboard a direct flight between the United States and Cuba and'' and by revising paragraphs (a) and (b) to read as follows:      515.560     Certain transactions incident to travel to and within Cuba.      (a)     General license    . The transactions in paragraph (c) of this section are authorized in connection with travel to Cuba by:  (1) Persons who are officials of the United States Government or of any foreign government, or of any intergovernmental organization of which the United States is a member, and who are traveling on official business; or  (2) Journalists regularly employed in that capacity by a news reporting organization.  (b)     Specific Licenses    . Specific licenses authorizing the transactions in paragraph (c) of this section may be issued when extreme hardship is demonstrated in cases involving extreme humanitarian need to persons and their close relatives, or other persons living in the same household, who are traveling to visit close relatives in Cuba. Specific licenses may also be issued to persons demonstrating a compelling need to travel to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, for professional research and similar activities as defined in 515.416, for clearly defined educational or religious activities, for activities of recognized human rights organizations investigating human rights violations, or for purposes related to the exportation, importation, or transmission of information or informational materials.  (1) For purposes of this section, the term     close relative     means spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent, great grandparent, uncle, aunt, brother, sister, nephew, niece, first cousin, or spouse, widow, or widower of any of the foregoing. The term     close relative     also means motherinlaw, fatherinlaw, daughterinlaw, soninlaw, sisterinlaw, or brotherinlaw.

Such remittances may not exceed $500, and, except for purposes of processing a letter of invitation or similar document on behalf of a Cuban national, may be transferred only after the Cuban national has received a valid visa issued by the State Department or other approved U.S. immigration documentation. Any amount remitted to Cuba directly or indirectly in conjunction with the processing of a letter of invitation or similar document must be deducted from the $500 limit. Specific licenses may be issued to permit remittances by persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to Cuba or a Cuban national, directly or indirectly, for transactions to facilitate nonimmigrant travel by a Cuban national to the United States under circumstances where extreme humanitarian need is demonstrated, including terminal illness or severe medical emergency.      515.565     [Amended]      9. Paragraph (b) of 515.565 is removed, paragraph (c) is redesignated as paragraph (b), and the words ``or (b)'' are removed.      515.566     [Amended]      10.

0,FT934-6931 ,"FT934-6931 _AN-DKWCOAA3FT 931123   FT  23 NOV 93 / Cuba set for 'collective government'      By CANUTE JAMES      KINGSTON   Cuba is changing its method of government to a more collective form of administration, according to Mr Roberto Robaina, the foreign minister. Speaking in Jamaica at the weekend, he said the switch from dependence on the leadership of one person - a situation that has existed for the past 34 years - was part of the political and economic changes being implemented by President Fidel Castro's administration. The changes would mean that the country's future would not depend on a new person appearing to succeed President Castro, but on a strong collective leadership. Mr Robaina, who is making official visits to several of Cuba's neighbours, is himself reported to be favoured by Mr Castro to play a prominent role in the island's political leadership, and could be the next president. Earlier this year President Castro said he hoped it would not be 'necessary' for him to be president when his current term expired in five years. 'Fidel has been urging this change for a long time,' Mr Robaina said. 'There are now many of the younger generation involved in this leadership project.' The minister gave no details of how the collective form of government would work, nor who would be involved. Diplomats in Havana said yesterday the plan to move from strong individual leadership was an attempt by President Castro to forestall any internecine fights among aspiring successors. The government, which has been seeking private foreign investment in Cuba's embattled economy has introduced several economic changes in the past six months, allowing private and co-operative farms and permitting Cubans to hold and use foreign currency. Mr Robaina denied the changes were the result of US pressure. 'My country is suffering not only from the economic blockade by the US but also from the collapse of its economic relationship with the former Soviet Union,' he said.

""You are addicted to holding  elections every month,"" Castro joked, provoking laughs among the  guests of a banquet in his honor offered by Governor Antonio  Imbassahy at Ondina Palace. He provoked even louder laughs when  he said he was surprised to find so few presidential candidates  in Brazil this year: ""Brazilians could even reach the  conclusion that a single candidate policy might be best.""    [Talento] What is Cuba doing to break the economic embargo?    [Castro] We are doing everything possible. There is a  movement against the blockade that is gaining momentum in the  United States. Only two or three nations support the blockade in  the United Nations. Cuba resisted, is resisting, and will  continue to resist.    [Talento] PT [Workers Party] presidential candidate Luis  Inacio Lula da Silva called for an end to the blockade against  Cuba during his visit to the United States. What is your  opinion on his position?    [Castro] I appreciate it a lot. He always held that  position. Many politicians and, in general, many members of  progressive and democratic groups in the world are also opposed  to the blockade.    [Talento] What are your expectations regarding the economic  plan now under implementation in Cuba?    [Castro] It is not a new economic plan. We are implementing  a series of measures. We are developing an opening adjusted to  the special conditions we are living under today, without  renouncing our social victories. The National Assembly adopted  a series of measures seeking to straighten out our internal  financial situation.    [Talento] What do these new measures change?    [Castro] They seek to reduce the excessive volume of money  in  circulation. Despite our current difficulties we did not throw  anyone into the streets, or sacrifice our social and educational  programs.    [Talento] Are there any changes in public utility rates?    [Castro] Yes. We changed some utility rates. We adjusted  electricity and fuel prices. We also increased taxes on  superfluous items, such as cigarettes and cigars. We will try  to maintain basic items' current prices.    [Talento] The world is splitting into markets. What prevents  Latin America from having its own market?    [Castro] The U.S. economy is in crisis as a result of the  strong competition from other blocs (Europe, Asia), and wants to  control the Latin American market completely. But many Latin  American countries have stronger trade relations with Europe  than with the United States. These countries have the  obligation to defend regional mechanisms such as Mercosur  [Common Market of the South], the Andean Pact, or the Central  American market in order to prevent the United States from  completely absorbing them.    [Talento] There is a lot of talk about Cuba's need to  implement political reform. Is there any trend pointing in that  direction?    [Castro] There is a tendency to ignore all the reforms  introduced by Cuba in the past few years. These reforms have  just as much quality and democratic spirit than the reforms made  by many other countries. But we do not have access to the  multinationals that control the information, and our reforms are  little known.    [Talento] Do you still have another meeting after you leave  here today (it was after 0100)?    [Castro] I have a meeting with Morpheus [one of the gods of  dreams in Greek mythology]. (laughs)    [Talento] Will you visit the city?    [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from  Cuba for over a week.    [Talento] At what time are you leaving?    [Castro] It is a military secret. (laughs)     "

Recently, this type of advertisement, which has no ties  to the romantic ones that abound in times of crisis,  proliferates in two new Cuban economic newspapers addressed to  foreign readers. According to the monthly CONTACTOS magazine of  the Cuban Chamber of Commerce and the weekly OPCIONES  periodical, which began being published in Havana in January,  the wanted partner must have funds to invest in the island or a  market abroad where Cuban products can be sold.    The request for partners comes from very diverse as well as  unexpected prospects in a country that continues to declare  itself Communist and that practically eliminated foreign  investment since the victory of the revolution in January 1959.  Such is the case because not only do small- and medium-sized  firms advertise their interest in foreign partners but the most  important government associations, oil refineries, sugar  factories, textile firms, distilleries, and cement factories do  so too. They are organizations that have been partially  paralyzed since the fall of the Soviet Union and the divorce  from Russia.    Cuban authorities have established a list of 132 priority  ""investment opportunities,"" which they are proposing throughout  the world in an effort to attract investors with a certain  amount of incentives, mainly in the fiscal sector. Those  proposals have not prompted great enthusiasm for the Cuban  market of 11 million people up to now. However, they have  prompted interest by certain businessmen, mainly Europeans,  Latin Americans, and Canadians.    According to members of the French National Council  Foundation delegation that visited Cuba recently, there is no  doubt that President Fidel Castro's regime is willing to open  the economic system. Castro met with them for eight hours to  confirm the ""irreversible"" character of the ongoing economic  reforms. Communist leaders have asserted that ""the Cuban  economic opening is not a tactical or circumstantial response  but a realistic strategy to permanently adapt the country to a  new international economic scenario.    Concerned that their bulky foreign debt could prompt  difficulties, mainly with European countries, Cuban leaders have  also asserted that ""Cuba is willing to consider flexible  renegotiation of its foreign debt, taking into account the  creditors' interests."" Parallel to this, the Castro government  has created the International Commerce Bank and inaugurated an  area for merchandise in transit that has many of the  characteristics of a free zone.    The number of mixed firms is still relatively small -- 112  in January 1994 -- but the number of foreign firms being  established in Cuba -- 505 currently -- is increasingly rapidly.  Out of the 112 mixed firms, 28 are in the tourism sector, which  Cuban authorities present as the ""salvation"" of the economy and  foreign specialists view as the most promising market in the  entire Caribbean.

[passage omitted]    In the chronology and analysis of the incidents, JUVENTUD  REBELDE points out that on 10 February, rumors began to spread  through the city of Havana to the effect that the Cuban security  guards had been withdrawn from the U.S. Interests Section, and  that people going to the Section's offices were expeditiously  being awarded visas. During that day, several groups of people  appeared in the area, headed for the U.S. Interests Section.  Party officials explained to them that what they heard was  false, and they desisted.    Later, similar incidents occurred, and the custodians asked  the people to leave because it was all nothing but a  manipulation by unscrupulous people. The area was cordoned off  with police barricades. This cordon was later removed, given the  characteristics of the people who, deceived, were showing up at  the site.    In the chronology published today by JUVENTUD REBELDE, it  was  pointed out that on 11 February, however, the human element that  began showing up at the site changed. Noted was the absence of  confused people and the presence of lumpen. One man even had a  knife hidden under his shirt and was arrested.    In the afternoon, a crowd of some 60 or 70 people formed,  among whom a number of agitators were observed. These people  headed along the Malecon intending to enter the U.S. Interests  Section's offices. Revolutionaries gathered at the place  thwarted the attempt. Those believed to be the ringleaders were  arrested. The police cordon was immediately reestablished. There  were another two similar disturbances later, but the  provocateurs failed to achieve their goal. [passage omitted]    JUVENTUD REBELDE'S article adds: It is obvious who  masterminded the incidents. This is how the mechanisms of the  counterrevolution and imperialism operate -- on the basis of  deception and cynicism. It has once again been confirmed that  the streets of this country belong, and will continue to belong,  to the revolutionaries.    The item states: The economy is in a special period here,  but  the dignity and decorum of a people who evidence daily heroism  will never be.    Let what has occured serve as experience for the  unscrupulous  authors of the escapade. Never will anyone be able to ride  roughshod over the Revolution because to do so, he would have to  ride roughshod over the righteous anger [coraje] and  determination of us millions of Cubans who place no stock in  rumors when it is a matter of defending the unity [integridad]  of the fatherland.

0,FT942-12467 ,"FT942-12467 _AN-ED2DAADLFT 940429   FT  29 APR 94 / Hard days, dollar nights: Stephen Fidler on the pressure for economic reform in Cuba      By STEPHEN FIDLER   To eat well in Havana, you need dollars. The currency, once the hated symbol of US imperialism, was made legal tender by President Fidel Castro last July. It gives those Cubans with access to dollars the means to supplement minimal food rations, to buy petrol and other 'luxury' items. It is their passport to illegal private restaurants in houses around Havana and to the unofficial taxis cruising the city. Those without dollars, at least in the city, are forced to depend on government hand-outs of a few pounds of rice and beans a month, rum, cigarettes and occasional other items. For many, daily life in Cuba after the collapse of the Soviet Union is dominated by the chore of finding something extra for the cooking pot. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, which channelled Dollars 65bn in financial support to Cuba over three decades, Cuba's economy has shrunk by an estimated 50 per cent. Fuel shortages have closed factories and most households suffer power cuts of six to 12 hours a day. The bicycle is the main means of transport through Havana; many travel two or even three to a bike. Getting hold of dollars has become an obsession for many Cubans, forcing almost everyone to break the country's restrictive laws. As a result, hundreds of women in Havana have turned to part-time prostitution. A foreigner walking along the Malecon, Havana's waterfront, does not go far without being propositioned. The government recognises the problem. Its reluctant legalising of the dollar benefited those least loyal to Castro's 1959 revolution. They included those who kept in touch with exiled relatives in defiance of the government. Now, the government is, ironically, trying to mend fences with Cubans abroad who send home about Dollars 400m a year in cash and goods. The growth of a dollar economy - already probably bigger than the socialist state sector - inevitably reduces the government's ability to dictate Cubans' living conditions. The government's shortage of hard currency means it has little with which to buy the loyalty of the population. The old levers of control are rusting as defenders of the revolution are themselves forced to move to the margins of the law. 'The police are just the same as everyone else,' says Andres, a catering student who is among the hundreds of youths who gather every evening along the Malecon. 'When they've finished work, they have to find ways to get food.' Castro's government appears at best equivocal about what it should do next, and there seems to be no model for reform. Officials deprecate the idea that they are seeking some kind of 'Chinese model' - economic reform in a strictly controlled political setting - perhaps because they recall the Tiananmen square massacre. They argue that China's huge domestic market and large rural population is not replicated in Cuba. So far, the reforms have done little more than legitimise already rampant black market activity. After authorising limited private enterprise last year, the government last month attempted a crackdown on the black market. The police rounded up many of the capital's Lycra-clad prostitutes, closed private restaurants and searched cars going into Havana, confiscating food - which by law must be sold to the government - intended for illegal sale. This was interpreted by some Cubans as a practical move to stamp out some of the more egregious black market activities, and to underline the government's determination to maintain law and order. According to one Cuban sympathetic to the government, many private restaurants were unsanitary and were becoming havens for delinquents. But others saw the measures as a sign that Castro remained opposed to market reform. Either way, the effectiveness of repression has been limited. New restaurants have replaced those that closed, while some restaurateurs have become caterers, delivering food to the homes of customers. If the government is to build on the limited reforms already made, many observers reckon it should start sooner rather than later. Mr Jacques de Groote, an executive director of the International Monetary Fund, who visited Cuba in an informal capacity last November, said then that 'time is running out for the orderly introduction of a critical mass of market-oriented measures'. His view was that the government's 'time-frame for decisive action seems to be in the next three to six months'. The six months is nearly up, with no sign of action. Things may be clearer after the meeting of the country's National Assembly, scheduled to open on Sunday. Government officials have played down expectations of what might be achieved, though they have held meetings - with often frank exchanges - in workplaces across the country. Mr Roberto Rivas, director of the government's Committee of Economic Co-operation, which tries to encourage inward investment, said this month that 'the process has been slow because of the need to obtain consensus'. Some fiscal and monetary measures may be adopted. For example, the National Assembly may agree to the closure of some state enterprises - 69 per cent of which lost money last year, according to the government, and many of which have ceased production. However, there is no indication of strong action on the supply side of the economy. The most important single measure would be the liberalisation of the agriculture sector to legalise private markets for food. But Castro has in the past opposed this move. Many observers see his dilemma becoming more acute. He can either try to lead the economic reform, ceding some political control but preserving some gains of the revolution, such as its education and health services. Or he can resist it, and watch while the remaining structures of government decay and 'illegal' activity proliferates. Castro, now 67, will probably take the decision he calculates will best preserve his hold on power. That power may be dissolving daily as the economy moves inexorably towards the market. But there is little evidence yet that Cubans' falling standards of living are translating into coherent political opposition. This may be because Havana is still free of the abject poverty that blights most Latin cities, but it is more likely that most Cubans are too tired to indulge in political intrigue. 'At 10pm, the last thought that working men and women have is to get out on a bicycle once again to attend a political meeting,' said one Cuban cited by the Cuban-born US academic Jorge Dominguez in a recent report.

Mendiandua: ""Workers Contribute Ideas  To Improve Economic Situation""]    [Text] Havana, 3 Feb (PL) -- Cuban workers are proposing  various measures and multiplying their initiatives in assemblies  held in their workplaces to identify their productive reserves  and help resolve the country's difficult economic situation.    The Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) has convened nearly  80,000  meetings until 15 March so workers can analyze how to reduce  expenses, increase revenue, achieve profitability, and in this  way contribute to the economic efficiency of their enterprises  and the reorganization of the national finances.    This process is known in Cuba as the workers' parliament,  because the ideas and proposals that emerge will enrich the  debate of the People's Government National Assembly (parliament)  during a special session called to adopt measures to improve the  country's economic situation.    According to experts, the principal problems affecting the  economy are excess money in circulation, swollen payrolls with  more workers than necessary, and a drop in labor productivity.    Cuba entered a period of severe shortages after the collapse  of the European socialist bloc, which provided the island with  almost all the fuel it used and more that 85 percent of its raw  materials, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal feed.    Deputies, provincial and rank and file delegates are  participating in the workplace meetings, offering extensive  information on national and regional problems while at the same  time receiving the proposals and initiatives, enriching the  debate and identifying them with their constituents, according  to repeated evaluations by Cuban authorities.    Repeated proposals in the assemblies held throughout the  country include charges for certain sports and cultural events,  price increases for nonessential articles such as rum and  cigarettes, and the elimination of subsidies as well as more  strict control over state property.    Many workers have advocated a gradual application of these  measures and are against streamlining payrolls without union  participation.    The workers debates began in January with approximately 200  assemblies of union leaders as an initial organizational step  and resumed 31 January with the massive participation of all  workers.    In a labor meeting at the Foreign Ministry, it was learned  the ministry cut its expenses by $4 million during 1992 to 1993,  and several proposals emerged for the ministry to finance itself.    The proposals included: setting the price of consular  services at the same average level of other Foreign Ministries;  charging for services of the documentation center, data base,  chronologies, and others as well as streamlining foreign  communications.    A poll of the sociopolitical studies center based on a  sample  of 1,300 workers representative of the unions and all the  provinces has revealed that 86 percent said the assemblies are  worthwhile, and 75 percent believe very useful initiatives will  be gathered in the debates.

[Rodriguez] Well, first I want to tell you, Carlos, that  ""Straight Talk"" has already made some predictions for this year,  1994, for the beginning of the year, to be exact. On making  those predictions, we said that this year, 1994, was the year  when some symptoms of economic recovery would be emerging. They  would be modest symptoms, as you said, but recovery after all.    At this moment we cannot yet talk about economic  reactivation. I think we can only talk about symptoms of  economic reactivation, because so far some areas which have been  declining, [words indistinct] of the Steelworking Industry  [SIME] which in 1993 announced that it managed to stop its  decline, and even managed to pick up somewhat. But this shows  that compared to 1992 there is a recovery.    Let us consider tourism. Tourism is today the most stable  sector of our economy. It is a sector that has been growing on a  yearly basis with net and gross income. I also think that  tourism is having a domino effect on the rest of the economy.  Why? Well, because the tourism industry demands a number of  resources that the country itself can supply. Today these  resources are sought abroad. This forces the Cuban economy to  divert its merchandise toward tourism.    I was also talking about the steelworking industry. This  industry has strong investments dedicated exclusively to  tourism. But not only the steelworking industry. Agriculture  must also seek strong investments and sufficient production in  order to meet all the needs of tourism, and in addition to this,  there must be other services such as laundering, dry cleaning,  water supply systems, electricity lines, etc. All these things  ensure that the gross tourism income is redistributed among the  rest of the economy.    [Santana] Does this mean that you see tourism as the sector  that is showing signs of reactivation?    [Rodriguez] Well, tourism in itself is a sector where....    [Santana, interrupting] I am asking this question, Osvaldo,  because I would not mention tourism as a sector of reactivation,  but as a fully consolidated branch.    [Rodriguez] Well, both things. It is a branch that is  consolidating itself. But in relation to the national economy,  growing tourism is a sign of economic reactivation because it is  only a sector, which together with petroleum, has been expanding  all these past years, including these recent crisis years. I am  happy to remember the case of petroleum because I have almost  forgotten the efforts made by the petroleum workers. The fact  that our country extracted 100,000 tons of petroleum last year  is another symptom of the economy's reactivation. But this year,  the work being carried out with some foreign companies, namely  through the so-called risk contracts, must also begin yielding  results. Nothing has been announced so far, but they have been  working for a little more than a year looking for petroleum.    [Santana] Suppose we have to make an anlysis of those  sectors  -- which do you think is most responsible for that economic  reactivation, or at least, which do you think is the most  important?    [Rodriguez] Well, unquestionably, the sugar industry is the  most important of all. But the most representative of economic  reactivation, as I said before, is tourism. I have explained the  reasons for this, and I am now going to explain why the sugar  industry is the most important.    The sugar industry is what has always maintained the Cuban  economy, what has yielded the most important fruits, both for  the current foreign trade structure and for the previous  structure, when the socialist bloc was still in effect, when our  most important sales to the world market, including to the CEMA  market, had been by the sugar industry. The sugar industry, seen  in its broadest sense, produces not only sugar, but also  alcohol, molasses, other byproducts such as bagasse; now the  medicines, the cattle feed, and many other products resulting  from the sugar industry.    But today, we are facing an energy crisis. In addition to  the  great crisis, energy or the lack of petroleum, is what has led  us to this profound crisis. Cane has therefore also become our  petroleum. I think, therefore, that we must be careful when  dealing with the sugar industry, because the future of Cuba must  be the sugar industry future. Cuba cannot dream of a future that  is not the sugar industry. Even though we might find a large  petroleum deposit, sugar will always be the source of all the  things I have mentioned.    [Santana] Yes, sugarcane is considered the economic  activity that can help us most under the current circumstances.  However, is this hope justified?    [Rodriguez] Of course. There is the sugarcane recovery  program. We have to keep in mind that our fields have been  highly exploited, which makes the soil lose its fertility. It is  therefore necessary to fertilize the land used for sugarcane.  The lack of fertilizer, first, and the lack of herbicides,  second, have resulted in a significant drop in sugarcane  production. This hope is justified because we are very seriously  working in the recovery program. Today, the main goal of the  Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC's] is to restore  sugarcane production to former levels.    Whenever sugarcane production is restored, the harvest will  of course regain its rate, which had been stabilized at the  8-ton mark. We have to return to that level of harvest.    [Santana] You also spoke of the steelworking industry. I am  still not clear. You spoke about this industry in light of the  importance of production of equipment for other industries?    [Rodriguez] For other industries.... [pauses] The  steelworking industry is capable of building mills, and also  many other types of equipment. It is capable of manufacturing  pumps. Significant investments are being made. This industry  puts out a considerable amount of electricity and telephone  cables. It is also a great provider of spare parts. It is a  tremendous producer of steels, not only carbon steels, but also  stainless steel, which is now produced in Cuba. I believe that  the potential of this industry, which has taken years to shape  -- this is not something done overnight -- is marked by the  specialization of its workers, technicians, and engineers. This  allows us to use this industry to develop the country and also  as a source of exports.    [Santana] Once again on tourism: I understand that Cuban  tourism has performed favorably in terms of international  marketing in recent months. Is this true? What do you know about  it?    [Rodriguez] Yes, I have read about this issue. I believe it  is very interesting that Cuba is already being seen extensively  by tourists in the Caribbean Basin. It is predicted that by the  end of the century, the Caribbean will be the world's top spot  for tourism. Cuba is not competing with many Caribbean islands  today. There are very small Caribbean islands -- perhaps  slightly larger than the Isle of Youth -- that welcome 1 million  tourists. We are beginning to develop. We began tourism late. We  must remember that it is difficult to reduce that distance. Of  course, we must keep the U.S. blockade in mind. The greatest  number of cruise ships in the Caribbean and around Cuba,  transporting approximately 8 million tourists, are based in  Miami. These are American businesses. The blockade bans all  those ships, although they skirt every Cuban coast without  touching Cuban ports. This, undoubtedly, affects us seriously. I  believe that despite this, tourism is arriving. We have many  European, particularly German and Canadian, [as heard] tourists.  Latin American tourism is also beginning to increase. I believe  that this will fulfill those predictions that Cuba will welcome  1 million tourists.    [Santana] In what measure is this reactivation the result of  the opening to certain foreign capital investments on one hand,  and on the other, the result of the increase in our productivity  and quality, in the economic effort based on efficiency and  controls?    [Rodriguez] I believe it is a combination of all these  things. The foreign capital investment has allowed us, first of  all, to access markets, access technologies and capital. This is  the case with tourism. We said that tourism is one of the model  industries of this reactivation. Foreign capital not only forms  part of the tourism industry, it also plays a role in  reactivating other important industries within Cuba. I believe  this has played a role. Undoubtedly, the increased awareness of  Cuban workers -- better yet, the collectives -- of the need to  perform more efficiently, work better, and even come to believe  that the products must be consumed immediately and not be  produced to be stored away, and with poor quality, becoming  aware of all these things has resulted in higher efficiency,  which today cannot yet be seen in any plans because the Cuban  economy has just completed the process of decline.    [Santana] How can we guarantee the soundness of that  reactivation being experienced?    [Rodriguez] First of all, we have to consolidate the Cuban  economy on the basis of our national structures -- to defend  what is ours, to advocate the best possible use of our  resources, and learn to work with high levels of efficiency,  economizing, and using true economic controls. There is no need  to think that a foreigner is needed to teach this to us. I  believe we have foreigners here teaching us very interesting  things, but we can also make our own contributions because when  you speak with workers, they know quite well what needs to be  done.    [Santana] We have discussed macroeconomic issues. When will  the reactivation be felt at home?    [Rodriguez] First of all, in terms of nutrition, I believe  this is the first thing that the people are expecting. We speak  of symptoms, and even some comrades have smiled and said:  Symptoms! With the needs we have today!    I have had to explain that the economic reactivation has to  take place before the domestic part of the economy will feel the  reactivation. The first problem at home is food. I believe we  have to solve this first. In what measure can this be solved?  Well, this is perhaps a subject for another program.    Secondly, we need to satisfy a variety of primary needs  because this crisis has resulted in the lack of many things. We  could make an endless list of household items we need to  provide. These are perhaps not vital for tackling tomorrow, but  are vital to the life of any civilized individual today.     "

According to some Russian economists and government  officials, the sense of a market economy has been planted in the  minds of their citizens and changes have taken place in Russia's  economic system and ways of management since the country began  to reform the economy in 1992.    Since then, private enterprises, stock companies and  cooperatives have been established in Russia.    However, as these economists and officials point out, very  serious problems still exist.    Russia's economy and industrial and agricultural production  have been declining since the beginning of 1992, casting gloom  over economic reform.    Industrial output dropped by 16.3 percent in 1993 compared  with 1992, and output value for the first two months of 1994  decreased 23.6 percent compared with the same period last year.    Russia's agricultural and husbandry production has also  declined between six and eight percent.    Economic recession has become the most difficult issue for  the government.    Therefore, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  proposed that they ""close the door of romanticism."" one of the  important principles for Russian reform is to strengthen the  government's control over the economy.    According to the prime minister, Russia can neither return  to  its old management by administrative decree nor take a  laissez-faire attitude toward enterprises when the economy is in  turmoil.    Another serious problem is high inflation and soaring  commodity prices.    Average monthly inflation was 20 percent, and prices went up  10 fold in 1993. This January prices increased by 22 percent.    In order to solve these problems the Russian government has  decided to adopt a comprehensive administration system.    The government now offers loans to departments of national  defense, energy and agriculture to stimulate production.    The government is also attempting to tackle the problem of  triangle debts, which are estimated by the ministry of finance  to be 31 trillion rubles.    The government has also decided to allow enterprises which  have long incurred losses to go bankrupt in order to ease the  nation's burden.    Other means, such as an increase in export taxes and  rigorously enforced tax regulations, will be implemented to curb  inflation, which Russia has pledged to decrease to seven or nine  percent by the end of 1994.    At the same time, Russia will continue its privatization  policies. Some 70 percent of all stores, hotels and other  service facilities had been privatized by the end of 1993.    The declining standard of living and the extremes of wealth  and poverty are becoming serious problems which must be dealt  with.    One-third of Russia's citizens are living below the poverty  line, and some four million people are unable to provide  themselves with basic necessities.    The income of the rich, perhaps 10 percent of the  population,  is about 30 percent of the total income of society. But the  poor, another 10 percent of the population, secures only 3.4  percent of the nation's income.    Therefore, chernomyrdin proposed enhancing the reform of  social guarantees and gradually increasing retirement pay. The  government will also compensate veterans for savings lost  before 1992.    Russia called for a crack-down on crime in a government  report; organized crime groups were rampant throughout the  country last year.    It is believed that these mafia-type gangs now control over  40,000 economic entities in Russia, including state-run  enterprises and banks. This situation is greatly disturbing  both to society and the government.    The above policies are being carried out by the Russian  government one by one, and time alone will demonstrate their  effectiveness.     "

The program hosts introduce Ross for what they label a Radio  Assembly of the Cuban People. The hosts stress that the workers'  assemblies are not a passing notion but a mass movement that  includes over 3 million workers and now students, according to  recent statements by Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union  of Young Communists.    Ross says: ""I believe it is one of the most important,  relevant political events of all time because no other country,  ever, has conducted a workers' assembly to discuss national  problems, particularly when the country is facing such a  complex, difficult situation. It is precisely the workers'  suggestions, their ideas, that become the basis for decisions.  It is not a matter of conducting a parliamentary exercise. The  goal is to conduct a true parliamentary operation to make  decisions, suggest ideas, and promote action. We are gathering  everything being said. There is even a computer program to store  all the opinions and suggestions offered.""    Ross adds that the 1 million retirees in Cuba can join  former  workplaces to participate in the assemblies. Ross reiterates  that management's reports to the assemblies must be clear,  concise, and to the point, noting the exemplary report presented  by the manager of La Corona Cigar Factory at its ongoing  assembly.    At this point, Ciego de Avila correspondent Fernando Sanchez  states that approximately 120,000 workers will participate in  the provincial workers' assemblies which began 1 February.  Sanchez says that Ciego de Avila's Central Construction  Enterprise workers called for increasing efficiency and cost  reduction and discussed excess currency, unjustified sick  leaves, confiscation of the money of the so-called macetas, and  the need to increase production by increasing efficiency in the  commerce and food industries. Santiago de Cuba correspondent  Carlos Zanabria praises the concept of the workers' assembly as  brilliant. When Ross interjects that it was President Fidel  Castro's idea, Zanabria adds: ""Brilliant, as is every idea of  our commander in chief who has always helped us overcome highly  complex national difficulties and thus enjoys such extraordinary  admiration and the unlimited trust of the Cuban people.""  Zanabria stresses the need to make profits by producing with  quality and efficiency, following the collapse of the socialist  markets.    Ross announces that on 10 February he will be at Palma  Soriano's Abel Santa Maria Printing Enterprise in Santiago de  Cuba Province because it is an outstanding example of how  production and workers' efforts can be realigned. This industry  has sought ways of employing workers usefully instead of  releasing them from their posts; it has also added surplus  workers from other workplaces to its personnel roster.    Ross tells La Corona workers that he will visit the factory  later in the day to discuss their efficiency and the issue of  the 1 million cigars not produced. In response of a question by  the host, Ross notes that ""the workers' main suggestions have to  do with increasing efficiency in the workplace"" and gives  examples of effective implementation of suggestions at the  National Hospital, the Regla Fish Distribution Center, cigar  factories, and the Finlay Research Institute.    Pedro Ross adds that the key is efficiency, citing the  sphere  of sports, which is contributing to the economy in addition to  having become self-financing. He has visited a milk complex that  is producing a good quality soy yogurt through its workers'  efforts. Those workers discussed at length how to make the most  of available resources. Ross notes that the next phase of the  process is management's response and stresses that the measures  implemented will result from the workers' suggestions.    Ross says he has refrained from offering ideas in order not  to influence worker opinions, which he wants to come directly  from them: ""We want the workers to assume their roles as  parliamentarians, as leaders of the country, and to determine  the solutions to the problems we have.""    Ross goes on to say that the workers are being highly  responsible in pointing the finger at those who hamper efforts,  as well as at the bureaucratic tangle in many sectors that is  obstructing efforts to move ahead: ""I have heard this in all 12  assemblies in which I have participated: Our superstructure  inhibits production and service efforts.""    The host stresses that the workers can trust that whatever  economic measures are taken will most benefit the country while  least affecting the people. Ross agrees, thanks the hosts, and  adds that he may appear on the program again after visiting  Camaguey and Santiago de Cuba next week.     "

It would signify the end of the socialist ideal and  its dream of a better life in which wealth is shared by all, in which the  wealth of the rich is transferred to the poor.    That dream has never been a feature of the capitalist promise.    The tendency to magnify capitalism's virtue is making people believe there is  no other possible way. But in the capitalist world, there is much that is not  worth celebrating.    Seen from the point of view of many south of the U.S. border, for example, the  Latin poor fill the coffers of the U.S. banks through crushing and oppressive  external-debt payments.    If it is true that some Latins can live well with capitalism, the majority do  not. It is a dangerous mistake to convert capitalism's vices into virtues  simply because the Marxist regimes have failed to fulfill their socialist  ideals. Most of Latin America's capitalist democracies are characterized by  injustice, poverty, unemployment, hunger, illness, electoral fraud, political  and racial murder and torture. And those ills are suffered by the majority of  the population throughout the continent.    For that reason, it is still valid to ask which is worse: The ""capitalist  freedom"" offered by these countries? Or the ""ideological rigidity"" of Castro's  Cuba, where until now nobody has died from starvation, people live longer and  healthier than anywhere else in Latin America, education is universal, housing  and jobs are available, and people can afford to feed their families? Behind  the arrogance and intransigence of which his detractors accuse him, Castro is  the last leader on the world stage who still believes in the promise of  socialism. The idealism that many in the United States interpret as destructive  blindness has permitted Castro to maintain his regime -- and his country's  pride -- until now.    Pride was the foundation of the Cuban revolution, and remains so to this day,  37 years later. It would be a mistake to pigeonhole Castro as another communist  failure. His revolution, his regime, his communism are too different from the  East European models to expect him to fade because they have. Castro's  revolution, remember, was conducted for and by Cubans, not imposed from  outside. And that is why it is wrong to try to force Cuba into the inevitable  wave of reform sweeping Marxist regimes elsewhere.    Sooner or later, international pressure, age, death, political upheaval at home  -- any or all will bring Castro down. And that will be the end of an ideal.

0,FT923-13351 ,"FT923-13351 _AN-CGNBPADWFT 920714   FT  14 JUL 92 / Cuban revolutionary in an army green business suit: Castro is courting capital - not capitalism      By DAMIAN FRASER   FOR a man who built a revolution on the expropriation of foreign capital, Fidel Castro has been demonstrating a surprising flexibility. Last month the Cuban leader donned an olive green army suit and blue tie to welcome 125 potential foreign investors, many of them Americans, to dine at the government palace. Cuba, he declared, was open to their money. His message has just been underlined by Cuba's National Assembly. On Sunday it effectively formalised a growing practice and passed a new constitutional article to allow foreign investment in state enterprises, to let Cuban companies import and export without permission from central government, and to recognise foreign ownership of property in joint ventures. Mr Castro firmly denies that Cuba, in soliciting foreign investment, is accepting capitalism. 'Capital and capitalism are not the same,' he insisted last month. 'Capitalists will not be the owners of our country. The country will continue to be socialist.' 'Our country', he said, 'knew capitalism before the revolution and does not have kind memories.' Underlining this, the new wording of the constitution's Article Three contains a warning to all those who might dare to challenge Cuba's one-party communist system. The clause reads: 'Against all those who try to overthrow the political, social and economic order established by this constitution, all citizens have the right to fight with any means, including armed struggle, if other methods are not possible.' The contradiction at the heart of Cuba's new economic reform is hard to miss. Castro's plan is for a partially foreign-owned capitalist enclave in Cuba to rescue a socialist economy from its own shortcomings. Cuba is looking to foreign investment to provide capital, technology and management skills at a time when the island is facing a deep economic recession because of the collapse of its economic lifeline to the former Soviet bloc. The obstacles, however, are enormous. The US embargo on trade with, and investment in, Cuba means the biggest source of money, and the largest market for Cuban goods, is out of bounds. The success of the capitalist enclave will depend on an adequate internal market for labour, energy and raw materials, as well as bureaucratic goodwill, all of which could be undermined by a weak domestic economy. The fear that the Communist government will fall, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the public opposition of exiled Cubans to foreign investment in the island means that only the bravest businessmen will invest in Cuba, typically expecting their money back in about three years. Foreign investment is nevertheless one of the few cards Mr Castro has left to play in order to sustain the economy. This continues to reel from the disintegration of the eastern bloc, with which Cuba did 85 per cent of its trade - much at subsidised prices - just three years ago. The deterioration even since last October is palpable. The value of the peso on the black market has fallen, from 15 to 33 pesos to the dollar, as fewer and fewer goods are available at official prices. Black-market prices over the same period have more than doubled. People face shortages of meat, chicken, soap, detergent and cooking oil. At almost every corner in Havana there are long lines of people waiting for food or for extremely infrequent buses. On top of that, the US administration has caved in to Florida's extremist Cuban exiles and agreed to support the Cuban Democracy Act. This act, which now has a chance of becoming law, would seek to ban the subsidiaries of US companies from selling to Cuba. Many of the businessmen on the investors' trip to Cuba were from US subsidiaries of companies such as Procter  Gamble, American Express and Philip Morris, and trade from all subsidiaries has recently been growing, doubling between 1988 and 1990 to Dollars 700m (Pounds 366.4m). Cuba's overtures to foreign investors are undoubtedly bringing in some money. According to Mr Hector Hernandez, president of the central bank, Cuba had signed 60 joint ventures with foreign investors by last year, and another 100 were in the pipeline. By far the most important are in tourism, with Grupo Sol, the Spanish developer, leading the way. One-fifth of the 500,000 tourists expected this year will be staying in hotels that are products of joint ventures. After tourism, foreign investors have shown interest in mines and textiles. Twelve Americans stayed on in Havana after the investor trip in an attempt to clinch deals involving, among others, supplying food in Cuba's airport. One executive from an international pharmaceuticals company left Havana impressed by Cuba's biotechnology plant, suggesting that with the right foreign partner Cuba could successfully penetrate some markets. The Cuban government hopes that foreign investment will reach Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m a year, but even then it will at most form 2 per cent of Cuba's estimated gross domestic product, and would not compensate for the drastic losses caused by the end of subsidised trade with the ex-Soviet Union. Cuba, for example, will be able to import only 6m barrels of oil this year, against 13m in 1989. For political reasons, Mr Castro has rejected moves to stimulate the economy as China has done, by allowing a free market in agriculture. Cuban officials say that such a market would create inequalities in income and thus threaten social peace. The government is concerned that freeing some sectors of the economy, while leaving others controlled, would lead to a shift of resources and workers into free markets, leaving the official sector to fall apart. Last month Mr Castro warned that farmers caught selling their goods in the black market would have their land confiscated. The discontent caused by the worsening economic situation has provoked a political crackdown, with leading dissidents being imprisoned or harassed. Foreign journalists who ask Cubans about the current situation risk being detained or, as happened recently to one, being beaten up. For Cubans the repression is much worse. 'Rapid reaction brigades' of party members have pounced on the few dissidents brave enough to display opposition in public. Mr Raul Castro, defence minister and Fidel's younger brother, threatened earlier this year to reconvene emergency revolutionary tribunals - scrapped 20 years ago - to sentence opposition groups guilty of violence against the state. Such actions make substantial inflows of foreign investment unlikely for the present. Many of the Cuban leader's guests last month said they had come to look for opportunities on the assumption that Mr Castro would soon fall. Mr Sais Gelrud, a Venezuelan oil engineer, caught their mood: 'This is all a make-believe. Nothing is going to happen until that man goes.'  The Financial Times   London Page 4  "

Savall]    [Text] Havana, 25 Feb (PL) -- Leaders of the American  Physicians Association (APHA) have endorsed the role of doctors  in alternative diplomacy against the U.S. blockade against Cuba.    Dr. Helen Rodriguez Trias, president of this association  founded 122 years ago, said the blockade enforced by U.S.  administrations since the beginning of the 1960's is a dirty and  inhumane practice. Rodriguez Trias led an APHA delegation that  attended a bilateral workshop on health exchanges with another  group of doctors and psychologists who came to Cuba at the  invitation of the Center of International Policy.    The meeting covered the subjects of public health in both  countries in terms of their current situations and outlook, the  consequences of the blockade on Cuban medical and sanitary  conditions, and the program to reform public health services  presented by President William Clinton.    After learning in detail the effects of the blockade on the  Cuban economy and its negative repercussions on the lives of the  people, particularly on the lives of children and the elderly,  the APHA delegation voiced a consensus in its determination to  increase the campaign against this measure.    Rodriguez, of Cuban origin, voiced her pleasure with this  visit to the island after so many years of absence. Rodriguez  said: It has been a moving experience, and foremost it has  reinforced my wishes to continue working to eliminate what the  U.S. authorities call an embargo against Cuba.    When mentioning that the rest of the delegation has the same  commitment, she added that APHA -- which she described as an  institution that has always maintained a progressive line in its  professional and social work -- will organize other contacts  with Cuban colleagues in the future.    Meanwhile, the participation of Wayne Smith and Cuban  Foreign  Ministry officials in the workshop gave a touch of alternative  diplomacy to the meeting. Smith was the chief of the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana during the Jimmy Carter  administration.    Dr. Abelardo Ramirez, Cuban vice minister of public health,  said we are mutually learning about the social problems of both  nations, particularly in the field of health. This field  represents a common ground among nations and a means for  personal and collective relations inasmuch as the wellbeing of  humanity favors the development of all people, he pointed out.    Ramirez feels that the presence of these delegations  constitutes a stimulus for the professionals and workers in  Cuban public health services who are determined to maintain the  achievements reached in medical assistance despite the difficult  times of the national economy. This is an example for other  sectors of U.S. society, he added, and on our part we are  committed to improve these meetings which could cover many more  topics.    To this effect, Smith said other visits by professionals to  Cuba will continue to be organized by the Center of  International Policy.     "

Such proposals did not constitute 'magic formulas', he said, and not all Cubans would benefit. But 'we are ready to do everything that is necessary to save the fatherland, the revolution and the triumphs of socialism; that is to say we will not be dogmatic nor mad'. Mr Castro, speaking on Monday, the 40th anniversary of a guerrilla attack that officially marks the beginning of the Cuban revolution, painted a stark picture of the country's economic plight. He said imports this year would be just Dollars 1.7bn, against Dollars 2.2bn last year and Dollars 8.1bn in 1991, as a result of Cuba's collapsing hard currency receipts. Bad weather and fuel shortages caused the sugar crop to fall to 4.2m tonnes this year, leading to a reduction of about Dollars 450m in sugar earnings. While the regulation of ownership of hard currency was still under study, all Cubans would be able to use their foreign currency in specially designated dollar shops. When the new laws were passed, Cuba would introduce a national convertible currency, Mr Castro indicated. Apparently, this will not replace the Cuban peso as the currency of everyday transactions. The Cuban government hopes that the measures will encourage exiles to send dollars to relatives, who will then convert the currency, possibly for dollar vouchers. In an effort to boost such revenues, Mr Castro said he would allow more visits to Cuba from Cubans living abroad. Under US law its citizens can give up to Dollars 300 a quarter to a relative in Cuba. The US State Department said Cuba's decision to legalise ownership of dollars would not affect these limitations.

The FRG, for example, was traditionally the Soviet  Union's largest Western trading partner, but in 1989 trade with  the Soviet Union accounted for only 1.5 percent of total West  German foreign trade, that is, less than trade with Denmark.  The Soviet model of the past was autarky motivated by military  considerations, and that was the case even at a time when war  between the two nuclear alliances was impossible and it was  clear that the future belonged to whoever led in the civilian  technology field.    Now that the Cold War is over, we have a chance to achieve  lasting peace. In Western Europe, economic integration has led  to stability and enduring peace. Economic cooperation and the  growth in prosperity resulting from it are significant elements  in a new security structure for all of Europe. We want to  achieve a state of affairs in which security is primarily  guaranteed by extensive ties, cooperation, and trust, not by  military capability.    Open markets promote an international climate of confidence  and fair dealings with each other. They encourage the exchange  of ideas and bring peoples close to one another. Free trade  relations promote peace.    What now has to be produced is a ""Strategy for Partnership""  for the democratic states of the East and West. The basic idea  underlying such a strategy is that in a rapidly changing  international environment, mutual interests have to be taken  into account and that there should be a long-term strategic  vision rather than short-term responses to individual events.  One of the most important elements of such a strategy would  undoubtedly be support for the reforms in Russia and the Eastern  European states.    A democratic, stable, economically healthy, open, and  predictable Russia accords with the interests of the entire  world. It must be clear to everyone that the world does not  need a weak, strife-torn Russia, but needs a Russia that is a  strong partner, one that will make an indispensable contribution  to the creation of global peace structures and will assume a  lasting place in the family of free, law-governed, and  democratic states. That is the most effective way of putting a  stop to aggressive nationalism.    Everything possible must be done to give Russia and the  reform states of Eastern Europe access to world markets.  However, this is only possible to the extent that conditions  for free enterprise are created in Russia. The decades of  squandering Russia's natural wealth by providing artificially  cheap energy at the expense of the population is an example of  how violations of free market laws harm the people. Thus,  market-oriented reform in Russia is not only a condition for  full participation in the global marketplace, but also a  condition for the economically sensible and thrifty use of  Russia's own domestic strengths. That in turn is a condition  for Russia's economic success. Russia will only become  democratically stable if it is economically successful, and it  can only become a lasting partner for stability in Europe and  the rest of the world if it is democratically stable.    Russia has had a democratic constitution since 12 December  1993. The Russian parliament enjoys democratic legitimacy.  Thus, Russia has moved much closer to membership of the  European Council. At the same time, the foundations of the  framework for a law-governed state, which is necessary for the  functioning of social market economy, have been created. The  free market economy needs an active start that can protect its  function with regard to competition and laws. A law-governed  state and certainty about legal conditions is a basic condition  for political and economic freedom.    After World War II, West Germany had an opportunity to  rebuild the country, which had been ruined, with a social market  economy. A social market economy means combining the freedom of  the market with the dictates of social justice. At first, West  Germany also experienced a wave of inflation and unemployment  while the war economy, with its excessive emphasis on armaments  and heavy industry, was converted to meet the demands of the  population of a country living in peace. Once this conversion  crisis had been overcome, however, the social market economy  came to mean increasing prosperity for all.    The situation in Russia today is in some respects different  from that in West Germany 45 years ago. However, the mechanisms  of free market development, which were effective then, are no  less effective today. Whoever disregards them pays the price in  the form of stagnation and decline.    Russia possesses immeasurable reserves of mineral resources.  However, its greatest wealth lies in its inhabitants, in their  professional qualifications, their spiritual strength, and  tenacity. Russia possesses first-rate educational reserves. In  the research and development field, there are many technologies  in which it is a world leader. This valuable potential must be  retained and developed.    The transition from centralized command and administrative  structures as well as state monopolies to a decentralized free  market economy based on competition is a unique historical  process for which there are no models. The right course will be  a tightrope walk between extremes. A shock without therapy is  no less dangerous than a therapy that only tries to treat  symptoms without addressing the roots of the illness. A  difficult political balance between the exigency of effecting a  transition and the vital necessity of maintaining social  stability will continually have to be struck. Adjustments will  be inevitable. There is no ideal way leading to the future.  However, there is even less of a way back.    Without the reformist beginnings of the past few years, the  current situation in Russia would be all the more difficult. The  latest economic data provide grounds for hope: Russia's  position in foreign trade is beginning to improve, the  privatization program is making impressive progress, production  is gradually responding to signals from consumers. Russia is  demonstrating that it possesses the capacity for self-renewal, a  capacity that has enabled Russia to survive times of crisis so  often in its history.    Russia cannot simply copy Western models and theories.  Russia will modernize, but it will not give up its deep-rooted  culture and wealth of tradition. In the same way as the  requirements in Russia are unique, reform processes must also  take account of the elements unique to Russia's situation. The  free market economy in Germany is, for example, different from  that Japan, although the fundamental principles are the same.    With active German support, Russia has made considerable  progress on the way to global economic partnership: It is an  equal member in international financial institutions and a  partner in dialogue with the G-7. Germany will promote the  development of this dialogue. Germany supports Russia in  developing closer ties with the OECD. The Coordinating Committee  for Multilateral Export Controls will be disbanded. Instead,  Russia will become an equal partner in a new forum that is to  collect comprehensive information on exports of military  technology worldwide. Extensive progress has been made in  negotiations between the EU and Russia on comprehensive  agreement on cooperation and partnership. So far, Germany has  provided Russia with assistance totaling almost 90 billion  German marks. It thus accounts for over 50 percent of worldwide  support for Russia's reforms. This unequivocally reflects  Germany's firm commitment to engage in partnership with a  democratic Russia.    The unilateral transfer of assistance is not, however, a  permanent state of affairs. It can only assist the growth of  solid, mutually advantageous trade relations, but cannot be a  substitute for Russian efforts to achieve a transformation.  Until now, Russia has primarily exported raw materials. It  must now enter world markets with technologically advanced  products. That assumes that military production will undergo  conversion with the aim of boosting civilian prosperity.    In the future, Russia's greatness will not be measured in  terms of the number of soldiers or weapons it has, or the size  of its territory. Russia's global role will become all the more  important if it succeeds in developing a future-oriented,  democratic model of society, bolstering CSCE principles,  contributing to an increase in prosperity -- in Russia and  worldwide -- and participating constructively in mankind's great  future tasks. Not military capacity for destruction, but  economic and technical capacity, and positive development will  determine states' status and influence. Russian intellectual and  cultural life must once again assume its appropriate place in  cultural dialogue.    Change begins in the mind. If one analyzes the economic  successes of the countries of Southeast Asia, one notes that a  large number of highly gifted students studied abroad for a time  and brought back new ideas and impulses. The same path is also  open to the former communist reformist states. For almost three  generations, there were virtually insurmountable barriers  between the intellectual life of Russia and that of the rest of  the world. Now, there has to be a lot of catching up in this  respect. Exchanges for students and academic staff must be  expanded. That is the only way in which understanding between  peoples can grow and knowledge and experience can be used for  the good of all transcending all borders.    It is also important that Russians themselves see the  results  of cooperation with other countries with their own eyes. With  that in mind, models for this kind of cooperation must be  created in the individual regions of Russia. The Murmansk  region, which one of the authors of this article represents in  the Russian Parliament as a democratically elected deputy, can  serve as an example in this respect. This Russian region, which  was previously hermetically sealed off, is now being extensively  opened up for direct contacts and cooperation with neighboring  states and other countries. To provide active support for this  process by promoting specific economic and investment projects  means demonstrating that our partnership is reality.    After World War II, Germany achieved a peaceful  reconciliation with its neighbors by way of democracy and the  free market economy. This not only facilitated the unification  of Germany, but also opened up opportunities for the economic  and cultural blossoming of the whole country. Today, Russia has  the same opportunities. The transition is difficult and will  require time. The Russians themselves know that best of all.  However, through that transition, Russia can finally develop  its potential and find its role in the international community.     "

0,FT942-5721 ,"FT942-5721 _AN-EFCDVABNFT 940603   FT  03 JUN 94 / Cuban economy 'set to recover next year': A senior economic policymaker tells Stephen Fidler of plans to tackle island's money glut      By STEPHEN FIDLER   Cuba's economy will not return to growth until at least next year, and any recovery will be modest, a leading Cuban economic policymaker says. 'It seems to me that this year the economy is still facing a very, very difficult situation,' says Mr Osvaldo Martnez, president of the Economic Commission of Cuba's National Assembly, 'but I expect that next year it will be in a position to resume growth, though not in a spectacular manner.' Mr Martnez, in London last week with a delegation from Cuba's National Assembly, estimates that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cuban economy has shrunk by 30-35 per cent - lower than many external estimates. The collapse - Cuba conducted 85 per cent of its commerce with the USSR and its former east European satellites - was followed by a big drop in Cuban trade. Exports from Cuba dropped from Dollars 8.1bn in 1989 to Dollars 1.7bn in 1993, he says. Mr Martnez says the main problem facing the government is the big overhang of currency in the Cuban economy. A meeting of the National Assembly at the start of this month, following consultations with 3.5m workers, has provided the outline for tackling this issue, he says. The government does not intend to apply shock therapy - 'the type of neo-liberal policies as you see in Latin America. The task is to correct the internal financial imbalance and not to kill the social cohesion'. However, the government recognises that excess liquidity has had negative effects on the economy. 'It hurts the discipline of work and the interest in work. It hurts productivity and efficiency and contributes to the development of the black market,' says Mr Martnez. Excess liquidity was estimated at the start of last month at about 11bn pesos - representing about 15 months of the population's earnings. (The peso is not convertible, but it is officially set at about parity to the dollar. The black market rate is around 100 to the dollar.) Some 60 per cent of this monetary overhang was in the form of deposits in savings banks, and the rest in cash. This is being made worse by a continuing budget deficit. It was 5.2bn pesos last year, and this year the government is aiming to reduce it by 24 per cent, mainly by reducing inefficiency in and cutting subsidies to state enterprises, he says. The monetary overhang will be addressed in three ways. Policies would be aimed at encouraging savings; raising prices and eliminating subsidies and certain government gratuities, such as free water; and through the introduction of wider taxation. At the moment, only a few thousand Cubans pay income tax. Price rises were announced last week, significant ones on products Mr Martnez describes as non-essential goods, such as cigarettes, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, and on petrol. Electricity prices will also go up, but by how much will depend on what is consumed. 'We think that we need not less than 18 months to see the problem under control,' though the first effects of the policy will be seen before that. The aim, he says, is to 'restore the purchasing power of our national currency'. After the problem of excess liquidity is resolved, the possibility of making the peso convertible will be considered. Asked about the crackdown on the rampant black market that also emerged from the National Assembly meeting, Mr Martnez says: 'We are not thinking in terms of an economic solution. The repression of the black market is not a matter of an economic solution, it's a matter of elementary social justice. 'If we are asking Cuban workers to accept some sacrifices in order to balance the excess of liquidity . . . it is necessary to act against the black marketeers who make profits from the exploitation of the people.' The economic solution to the black market 'is to increase the production and efficiency of the economy,' he says. Asked whether a further freeing of the agricultural sector - producers must by law sell their produce to the government - is in prospect to increase farm production, he says: 'We are not in a dogmatic position in this field or any other field.' However, the 1980s experiment of peasant markets is 'not a real solution' but a source of 'speculation, high prices and intermediaries'. His prediction that the economy will improve is based on some improving indicators. 'Foreign investment is going well in the conditions of the US blockade' - a reference to the US embargo, which he estimates has cost the Cuban economy Dollars 40bn since it was introduced in 1960. He says there are no official figures for the size of foreign investment but cites 'academic estimates' of Dollars 500m. 'It's not a big figure but in the conditions of the Cuban economy an important one.' He says tourism is going well. Last year gross revenues were about Dollars 700m - with visitor numbers of around 700,000 - providing a net contribution of Dollars 220m to the economy. Oil exploration is on a rising trend, and national oil output rose last year to 1.1m tonnes, from about 800,000 in 1992. He does not expect electricity shortages, already leading to significant power cuts, to get worse.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

An official announcement of Cuba's new oil policy will come on Sunday and presentations, probably involving senior Cuban industry ministers, will be held in London and Calgary in November and December. A number of blocks have already been allocated to foreign companies in separate bilateral deals. From next August a French consortium involving Total and Compagnie Europeene des Petroles, which signed a contract with the Cubans in December 1990, will begin drilling in its northern oil zone blocks. Brazil's Petrobras, Canada Northwest Energy, and the Swedish company, Torus, have also been allocated blocks. The northern oil zone is more than 1,000 km (620 miles) long and between 80 and lOO km deep, running parallel to Cuba's northern coast and extending into the promising and largely unexplored offshore area. It already accounts for most of the country's domestic production (15,000 barrels of heavy crude and and 1.5m cu ft of gas a day). The southern oil zone consists of about 60,000 sq km, occupies practically the whole of the onshore area and extends to adjacent offshore areas to the south. Cuba's state oil company Cupet was formed out of the amalgamation last December of the upstream enterprise Union de Petroleo with the downstream company Cuba Petroleo. At the same time a specialist subsidiary called Commercial Cupet has been established to concentrate on dealing with foreign partners. The country previously depended for 95 per cent of its oil needs on the Soviet Union, which gave gave its oil industry a distinctly downstream character. A fourth refinery built by Cuban engineers according to Soviet specifications has only recently been completed, giving the country a total refining capacity of 11m tonnes a year. But there is a strong impression that the upstream segment was tending to lag behind. The main producing fields, Boca de Jaruco and Varadero, were discovered in 1969 and 1971 respectively. While their very heavy, high sulphur crude has swelled Cuba's production considerably since then subsequent discoveries proved disappointing until 1989 when a small new field, Pina, was discovered in the central part of the southern oil zone. It has 30m barrels of proved reserves of medium gravity, medium sulphur oil, compared with the more than 80m barrels of proved reserves in Boca de Jaruco and Varadero. Cuba has 20 distinct oil basins with in situ reserves estimated at 1,100m barrels. Ironically Cuba is now competing with its old ally the former Soviet Union for foreign capital investment. Russia and the other states of the CIS certainly have the oil but to date foreign companies have not always found it easy to negotiate contracts in what is often an unpredictable and turbulent political environment. In contrast, evidence from recent visitors suggests that Cuba's commercial relations with foreign companies are handled in a brisk and business-like manner. Moreover the country has firmly established foreign investment laws dating from 1982, which have already proved effective in attracting Spanish capital into its rapidly growing tourist industry. Asked if they would welcome US oil companies into Cuba, the unanimous answer received from Cuban officials is 'yes - if their Government would let them come'.  The Financial Times   London Page 38  "

In the  process of its economic development, China has failed to take  these two essential elements into account for a long period,  making many regional issues related to national economic  development unable to proceed and issues related to  transnational regional cooperation still difficult to be truly  resolved.    Transnational economic cooperation zones are the product  which has emerged in the long development process of the world's  economic special zones following the continuous strengthening of  the tendencies of transnationalizing and diversifying the major  participators of the activities. Building transnational  economic special zones by two countries and even three countries  together can be deemed as a new trend in the current development  of the economic special zones of the world. During the post-war  development of the world economy and international economy,  regional conglomeration of the economy is the major form of  international organizations that suits the internationalization  of economic activities. It is usually reflected in four  development layers, namely tariff union, common market, alliance  in economy and currency, and economic integration, which is also  called ""economic community"" or ""economic ring."" However,  regional conglomeration of the economy faces great limitations.  Contrary to this, transnational economic cooperation zones have  many characteristics and advantages that the regional  conglomeration cannot compare with. Judging from the current  conditions, they may be regarded as the best choice of the  organizations suitable to regional economy. First, the form of  transnational economic cooperation zones is not limited by the  difference in the economic development levels of the various  sides concerned because, due to their different economic  development levels, they can learn from each other's advantages  to make up their deficiencies and supplement each other to  achieve common development. Second, transnational economic  cooperation zones are free zones opened to the whole world,  which, instead of being exclusive, welcome and actively draw in  the countries and regions other than those in the regional  conglomeration to participate and invest in building plants and  to conduct international trade and other forms of economic  cooperation to promote economic development. Third,  transnational economic cooperation zones reflect the relations  between the local interests of a country and the interests of  other countries. Through the transfer of some rights and  interests, they enable some localities of a country to achieve  economic development and also promote the economic development  of the entire country. Transnational economic cooperation zones  are easier to establish because they do not influence the nature  and the overall situation of the countries which build the zones  and are restricted less by political and other noneconomic  factors. This has also been proven by history.    Theoretically speaking, transnational economic cooperation  zones are very feasible. Heilongjiang's transnational economic  cooperation zones, which are being planned, have been provided  with some necessary and also basic conditions.    1. The superior geographical condition. Heilongjiang and  Russia share a border as long as 3,026 km and have groups of  ports that have convenient transport facilities and  corresponding counterpart ports in each other's side. Among  them, the pair of Heihe and Blagoveshchensk cities and the pair  of Suifenhe city and Pogranichnyy possess the best conditions  and strength and can exert the widest influence. They are  regarded as the ideal places to build transnational economic  cooperation zones.    2. China and Russia strongly need each other economically.  This is reflected in the complementation of their industrial  compositions and structures of essential elements. Such a high  degree of complementation and mutual need are bound to lead to  the large-scale circulation of the manpower and material  resources and even funds of both sides. The emergence of  transnational economic cooperation zones, which epitomize such  circulation, then becomes natural and necessary.    3. With border trade as the channel, the economic ties  between some localities of China and Russia have become  increasingly closer, and border trade has tremendously  influenced and even promoted the economic development of both  sides. Such increasingly closer economic ties have laid a  foundation for the localities of China and Russia to establish  certain types of economic associations and transnational  economic cooperation zones.    4. Heilongjiang and the Far East Region of Russia constitute  an important component of the northeast Asian economic region.  Not only are they famous for their abundant resources and  tremendous economic development potential, but also they possess  the geographical advantages as areas in the development region  and areas linking with international transportation lines.  Building transnational economic cooperation zones in  Heilongjiang and Russia will draw the great interest and active  participation of northeast Asian countries and other relevant  countries and regions.    5. A most direct effect of transnational economic  cooperation  zones is that they help bring in international advanced  technology, managerial expertise, funds, and trained personnel.  The very purpose of building Sino-Russian transnational  economic cooperation zones is to bring the largest possible  number of commodities, equipment, raw materials, technology, and  trained personnel of China, Russia, and other countries into the  zones by creating a more relaxed, stable, and advantageous  regional and international market, so that the zones will become  the centers and hot spots of northeast Asian international  economic cooperation, more effectively realize the large-scale  circulation and overall coordination of the essential elements  of production, and then promote the development of Sino-Russian  economic and trade relations to a still higher level and sphere.    Based on the above-mentioned analysis, we maintain that it  is  not only necessary but also possible to set aside certain areas  in Heilongjiang's Heihe and Suifenhe cities and Russia's  Blagoveshchensk and Pogranichnyy for the establishment of  transnational economic cooperation zones. The tentative pattern  of the development of the zones may be as follows. Starting  with the areas set aside, developed, and managed by China and  Russia independently, China and Russia, aimed at their common  prosperity, based on their natural economic ties, and backed by  the active participation and support of the international  community, gradually build relatively independent, complete, and  integrated markets in these areas, establish joint organizations  and managerial institutions in the process of developing  infrastructural facilities, establish a coordinated system for  division of work and cooperation based on commodity trade, and  enable the areas to establish natural economic ties through  division of work and cooperation, so that the economy of the  areas set aside by both sides will be integrated, and the areas  will ultimately become unified and complete transnational  economic cooperation zones in the true sense.

Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above  statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry  officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with  government and Cuban Communist Party officials.    Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being  applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic  economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly  145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last  September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs,  Rodriguez said.    Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the  suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to  foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year  for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the  violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993.    Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures  adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of  agricultural cooperatives.    He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of  land  using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be  continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the  disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading  partners).    We had to make a political decision. We had to link man  directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive  units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel  like co-owners of the land.    We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive  factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the  payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see  that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's  financial situation improves.    The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have  been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a  stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary  now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of  national currency and foreign exchange.    Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic  mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the  solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the  year.    He based his optimism on the possibility of having a  superior  sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price  of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this  mineral, which is in high international demand), the  substitution of imports, and a significant increase in  agriculture.    In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring  electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for  agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to  control a relative or absolute labor force surplus.    He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment  policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness,  alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work  have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline.    Rodriguez said Cuba's degree of economic opening to the  outside will always be high, with tourism as the basic program,  followed by the export of nontraditional products, the export of  established products like sugar, nickel, and tobacco, and with  expeditious changes to reincorporate the country into the world  economy.    Rodriguez said the country will remain open to foreign  capital and stated that 129 associations with this type of  financing are currently operating in Cuba.    He said that the most serious obstacle in the way of this  program is the embargo that the United States has been applying  to the country for more than three decades. To this must be  added the country's foreign debt, which equals approximately $7  billion.    There are solutions, but they are extremely complex,  Rodriguez concluded.     "

Cuban Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez made the above  statement during a conference of Higher Education Ministry  officials, who have been meeting since last Monday with  government and Cuban Communist Party officials.    Different economic mechanisms based on new laws are being  applied, which, in addition to the changes made to the domestic  economy such as the increase in self-employment (with nearly  145,000 people participating since Decree 141 was passed last  September), are a solution to the decreasing number of jobs,  Rodriguez said.    Rodriguez explained that the changes (including the  suspension of penalties for possessing dollars, opening to  foreign capital, and other changes) could lead to a better year  for Cuba from an economic viewpoint, especially a halt to the  violent fall experienced between 1989 and 1993.    Rodriguez pointed out that the strongest of the measures  adopted by the government in this stage is the introduction of  agricultural cooperatives.    He explained that the exploitation of extensive areas of  land  using a large amount of imported fertilizers could not be  continued following the collapse of the socialist bloc and the  disappearance of the USSR (the nation's leading trading  partners).    We had to make a political decision. We had to link man  directly with his work by creating basic cooperative productive  units, which are socialist formulas that allow peasants to feel  like co-owners of the land.    We have reached the conclusion that certain unproductive  factories cannot continue to operate, that we must review the  payrolls, and that we must make a series of decisions to see  that economic mechanisms are successful and that the country's  financial situation improves.    The minister said all the monetary-fiscal reforms that have  been applied and that are being studied are aimed at achieving a  stimulating [estimulante] relationship between work and salary  now that the country is facing the dual problem of an excess of  national currency and foreign exchange.    Nevertheless, he predicted that with a change in economic  mentality, a halt of the current crisis if not progress in the  solution thereof should be observed in the second half of the  year.    He based his optimism on the possibility of having a  superior  sugar harvest (or a less costly one), the increase in the price  of sugar and nickel (and a recovery in the production of this  mineral, which is in high international demand), the  substitution of imports, and a significant increase in  agriculture.    In this regard, he also mentioned oil exploration, restoring  electricity to previous levels, revising storage methods for  agricultural products, and labor reforms, which are essential to  control a relative or absolute labor force surplus.    He said that Cuba has not abandoned its full employment  policy, but to avoid identifying it with labor idleness,  alternatives for state, cooperative, or self-employment work  have been opened, accompanied by strict order and discipline.

0,FT943-6701 ,"FT943-6701 _AN-EH1APAB1FT 940827   FT  27 AUG 94 / Passionate talk, little action: James Harding explains domestic forces shaping US policy on Cuba      By JAMES HARDING   The last time Cuban and US leaders sat down together was to celebrate the triumph of co-operation over conflict. The achievement, however, was not theirs. Under Pretoria's blue sky, Cuban President Fidel Castro and US Vice-President Al Gore, among others, shared the wonder of Nelson Mandela's inauguration as South Africa's first democratically-elected president. In a year of handshakes between old enemies, the failure of the US and Cuban governments to end their cold war bickering has been an exception. The flood of refugees leaving the island over the past two weeks and, the US commitment to shelter them indefinitely, has once again exposed the anachronism of US Cuba policy and the domestic forces which shape it. The Clinton administration last week came to terms with one consequence of a tough stance on Cuban immigration. It announced that in future Cubans were not going to be granted access to the US but would be detained at the country's naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Nevertheless people kept coming in increasing numbers and the US is having to prepare for a small city of Cuban refugees to be maintained until they can be repatriated. When and under what circumstances that repatriation will take place is unclear. The last time US-Cuba relations approached anything like harmony was in 1934. Then the US agreed to drop its right to intervene in the country's affairs and, in return, had the lease on its Guantanamo military base reaffirmed. President Clinton backs the trade embargo imposed on Cuba since 1963, following Castro's nationalisation of US land on the island, and, during the 1992 presidential election, was more enthusiastic than George Bush in backing the Cuban Democracy Act of that year. The act tightened the embargo by prohibiting overseas subsidiaries of US companies from selling goods to Cuba - but to increase the scope for a propaganda drive against the country allowed telecommunication links with the US. Unlike other economic sanctions imposed by the US - against Iraq or former Yugoslavia for example - the strategic aim of the embargo on Cuba is unclear. Asked what Cuba must do to bring an end to the embargo, Mr Clinton said only: 'Mr Castro knows the conditions for changing that policy.' State Department officials were equally vague; they wanted 'demonstrated evidence of Castro's commitment to change'. One camp that does have a clear idea of what US Cuba policy should entail is led by Mr Robert Torricelli, Democratic Congressman from New Jersey and sponsor of the Cuban Democracy Act. He wants to force the collapse of the Cuban economy in the belief that, when conditions become intolerable, its population will rise up and overthrow their oppressor. But the prospect of a mass uprising in a neighbouring country causes concern in Washington. The Central Intelligence Agency last year warned the president that serious instability on the island would have 'an immediate impact' on the US, spilling as many as 80,000 refugees and embroiling him in demands for US military intervention. There are also reports of dissent in the National Security Council, which co-ordinates foreign and military policy for the president. On Capitol Hill, the embargo is also under attack. Senator Chris Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, has criticised the inconsistency of negotiating nuclear issues with North Korea and granting China the commercial advantages of Most Favoured Nation status, but not talking to Cuba. He advocates exploring 'the possibility of reaching some rapprochement'. The White House, however, is aware of dangers of softening its policy on Cuba. Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, was deputy secretary at the same department duringthe Carter administration that developed informal links with Havana - only to discover Cuba was sending 100,000 troops to assist the civil war in Ethiopia and to have Castro allow a flood of 125,000 Cubans to leave the country for the US from the port of Mariel in 1980. The Mariel exodus was a contributory factor in Jimmy Carter's subsequent election defeat. Mr Clinton too has his own scars from Mariel. After a riot at a Cuban refugee camp in Arkansas in 1980, sentiment turned against the state governor who was blamed for playing host to the Cubans. Partly as a result, Governor Clinton lost his campaign for re-election in 1980. More recently, Mr Clinton has realised the benefits of talking tough on Havana. His support for the Cuban Democracy Act won funding and votes from the traditionally Republican Cuban American community in Miami. Florida is an important state for the Democrats: though Mr Clinton lost it narrowly in the 1992 presidential election (with 39.2 per cent of the vote to George Bush's 40.9 per cent) it will be a target in the 1996 contest. More immediately, Florida's Democrat governor Lawton Chiles faces a strong challenge from Mr Jeb Bush (son of the former president) in November's gubernatorial election - and Mr Chiles is keen to play the Cuban card for votes. Ten days ago he demanded federal action to help the state cope with the flood of Cuban immigrants, successfully pre-empting Mr Clinton's decision to slam the doors shut. Similar political considerations would explain why Mr Clinton and Mr Chiles have kept Mr Jorge Mas Canosa, the Cuban American community's most prominent politician and businessman, on board. Support from Mr Mas Canosa's Cuban American National Foundation, the community's most powerful lobby and strongest advocate of the embargo, will be an important consideration in November's congressional, as well as gubernatorial, elections. Mr Charles Rangel, Democratic Representative from New York, says breaking with conservatives in the Cuban American community and opening talks with Havana to stimulate a free market and political democracy in Cuba would be proof of Mr Clinton's statesmanship. Mr Clinton is unlikely to respond to such a challenge. Though the Caribbean is increasingly becoming Mr Clinton's equivalent to Ronald Reagan's central America, there still seems little political benefit from intervention. Among US voters, apathy is still more common than anti-communist derision when it comes to Cuba. In the short term, the administration may just hope that the bad weather holds out long enough to deter people from leaving Cuba. If large numbers continue to come, Mr Clinton will probably look to his allies in the Americas and to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to share the Cuban burden. Democratic Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, who has supported calls for a dialogue, said on Thursday he feared that isolating one of the world's last revolutionary Communist strongholds was 'a response to the national passion rather than the national interest'. Two months away from Congressional mid-terms and a string of gubernatorial elections, satisfying that national passion by talking tough and doing little may well be the administration's priority on Cuba.

Representatives of  collectives of enterprises, directors (managers), and owners  assembled--all those who are engaged in the sphere of goods  production, regardless of form of ownership and type of economic  activity. Established in 1992 by the Association of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of Russia, the Agrarian Union  of the country, the League of Assistance to Defense Enterprises,  the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and the  Russian Union of Workers Collectives, the FTR today,  undoubtedly, not without the energetic efforts of Yuriy Skokov,  its leader, represents the interests of the federal, republic,  regional, kray, and oblast branches of unions of goods  producers, which united, as the congress showed, by no means for  the sake of selfish opposition as such. Their unification was  prompted by the policy of the present government, expressed in a  reprisal against national industry, which, in the opinion of  congress participants and the leadership, does not at all appear  to be a mandatory and necessary victim for a country that has  taken the path of political and economic reformation. Not  denying the need for economic transformations, the congress of  goods producers evaluated the path of economic reforms in Russia  in its own way. As was obvious from the report of FTR Chairman  Yu. Skokov, there were in fact none. The political reforms  absorbed everything, for which there was a consistent need for  the president, people's deputies, and parliament... Meanwhile,  an analysis of the state of the economy of Russia based on the  results of the year presented to the congress by FTR experts  shows that the drop in domestic production, without which the  preservation and strengthening of Russian statehood is  inconceivable, exceeded the planned level by more than a factor  of two. The FTR chairman cited figures: the national food  basket, consisting of 19 (!) descriptions of goods (for  comparison, it is made up of 300 paragraphs in the United  States), is applicable to only 30 percent of the population of  Russia. The growth in unemployment is indicated by the 2,400  plants in this country that died out this year. Against the  background of general instability of economic life and  administration, there is a continuing flow of a significant part  of our national wealth abroad, and the export of capital from  the country in legal and illegal form amounted to $12-15 billion  this year. An economic and legal environment that is hostile to  native goods production, whose direct result was the disruption  of economic relations and a reduction in the volume of products,  created such conditions that it simply became unprofitable to  work. Thus, in branches that determine the competitiveness of  the Russian economy (electronics, electronic equipment, and  instrumentation) in the last three years the output of products  has dropped by more than 40 percent, which indicates that a  process of the deindustrialization of the country is beginning.    In the meantime, the congress of goods producers of Russia  (not anticipating tangible progress for the better, not only in  the first quarter but also in the first half of 1994, when, in  the opinion of FTR experts, there will continue to be a further  listless decline in production, inflation in costs in connection  with continuous price increases for energy sources and  agricultural raw materials, an increase in transport rates and  wages, mutual indebtedness of enterprises, and the depreciation  of money), is coming out in support of signing agreements with  the government of the Russian Federation and organs of authority  of the components of the Federation concerning a qualitatively  new system of mutual relations that regulates the procedure of  implementing the stages for conducting economic transformations.  In the FTR's opinion, the state should guarantee the native  goods producer the unconditional right to direct participation  in determining the strategy of development of the national  economy and in legislative initiatives on questions of goods  production and expert analysis of all normative acts at the  federal and regional level in this sphere. Arkadiy Volskiy,  chairman of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs of  Russia and leader of the Civic Union, remarked in his speech to  the congress that goods producers can credit themselves with the  fact that the government, which until recently demonstratively  had withdrawn from tasks of support of domestic production,  today agrees with the need to regulate the economy of the  country. However, the present state of Russian industry, the FTR  leadership thinks, will not permit restriction to  ""consultations"" with the government. Correctly relying on the  intellectual and production potential of the regions, and also  emphasizing the cementing role of the ""class"" of goods producers  in the regional policy of the state, the FTR chairman sees the  Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), the Agrarian Party,  and the Women of Russia Movement as possible and real allies in  the federal organs of power who could be interested in  supporting domestic goods producers. It is obvious that the  representation of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  of Russia in federal organs of authority by one plant director  can hardly be adequate for an expression of the interests of a  multimillion-strong social group. But the question of the  political formation of a movement of goods producers, as the FTR  leader let it be known, is not yet urgent. Today, Yuriy Skokov  believes, it is far more important to conduct a staged  restructuring of the economy of Russia that is as painless as  possible for the population, and which, in spite of everything,  the FTR leader sees in the future as being among the first in  the world.

We  cannot yet speak of short-term recovery, but we must refer to  things that are going well and allow ourselves to anticipate  good results, the deputy stated in a lengthy interview with  Sunday's weekly JUVENTUD REBELDE.    Martinez also explained that the country is moving toward an  economic model that, without abandoning the basic principles of  socialism, will function without disregarding the market, with  forms of private property and a strong presence of foreign  capital. Martinez cited tourism, which has a 30-percent annual  growth rate, as the first positive aspect of the island's  economic performance, adding that it will shortly exceed the  sugar industry as the main source of revenue for the nation. He  also mentioned the growing production of petroleum, which is  expected to exceed [word indistinct] 1.1 million tons produced  last year.    There is an investment process of foreign capital in the  area  of petroleum, which shows interest in Cuba's petroleum  potential, Martinez noted. He added that the fact that these  companies challenge the blockade and U.S. threats demonstrates  that there are reasonably good prospects for finding petroleum  deposits.    He also explained that new forms of exploiting state-owned  land, granted for the use of former workers, now organized in  cooperatives, will permit a significant increase in food  production. The measures the government will adopt to cleanse  internal finances, he remarked, will have immediate positive  results for the economy, although its basic effect will require  no less than one and a half years to mature.    He said measures will undoubtedly have positive effects on  the recovery, namely to return to the path of growth. Martinez  added that by the end of the century, Cuba will begin overcoming  this adverse situation and will do so by ""not only returning to  the path of economic growth, but achieving a qualitatively  different economy.""    The lawmaker affirmed the country will have greater levels  of  efficiency expressed in high worker productivity, as well as  domestic and export-related productive efficiency. He said it  must be an economy with a strong state sector that outlines the  economic path and operates following decentralized  administration mechanisms in which economic categories play a  more important role than administrative mechanisms. Martinez  said the model being designed will attach greater importance to  the market and to a strong presence of foreign capital.    A sector of self-employed workers, which is expected to grow  in the future, will coexist together with the guiding role of  the state and a very important cooperative sector in  agriculture, Martinez declared. He stressed that these changes  will not alter the basic foundations of Cuban society, forced to  make its way in a world governed by capitalism.    Our economy will continue to be socialist. This means that  political decisionmaking will be central and politics will  govern the economy, in that it is subordinated and directed  towards the achievement of the social objectives of socialism,  Martinez concluded.

I would also like  to know your opinion concerning the possible creation of a Cuban  hard currency certificate, at an exchange rate still to be  determined, and if this is possible, would it the exchange rate  be adequate?    [Carranza] You are asking two complex questions. And first  of  all, these are my personal opinions. I think any of these  measures you mentioned would be valid but only to the extent  that they come within a context of measures and are part of a  sufficiently coherent strategy. As I had said before, the  economy is a system, and the economy does not operate on  singular measures, but on well-prepared strategies within which  the different measures are interconnected, playing a  supplementary role, and this is what makes the decisions within  the economic policy effective in the medium- and long-term, and  also in the short-term. Thus, concerning the question about a  change in currency, or about the freeze of bank accounts, my  answer is that it depends on the manner in which the measure is  implemented; it depends on the context of the strategy adopted.    Taking this into consideration, whether it is part of an  adequate strategy, surely a change in currency could be one of  the measures that would help restore the country's financial  balance. However, this very answer leads me to a second  consideration: that there can be different types of hard  currency exchange systems. There are different ways of  exchanging currency. It has to do with the amount of money, and  the way to handle the future hard currency certificate. There  are also a set of technical matters that must be considered, and  they would also depend on the set of measures to be adopted.    The same thing would happen concerning a freeze of bank  accounts during a given period. I would say that discussions on  a well-prepared proposal, concerning the strategy for the  country's economic feasibility, contemplate these measures, but  in a general manner and not as a specific singular measure.    [Diaz] Would you say the same thing on the possible creation  of a convertible Cuban hard currency certificate?    [Carranza] Monetary problems of the economy are the most  complex of any economic system. As a consequence of the  necessary measures adopted over the past few years to  counterbalance the current crisis, Cuba has in fact authorized  the circulation of two different currencies in the country.  That is, the peso and the rest of the other currencies, which  are convertible currencies, the most common of which is the  dollar, as you know. This brings into the economy an abnormal  situation which has been necessary because of the crisis  situation as we have already explained it on different occasions.    I think that, concerning money circulation, the strategic  idea would be to recover normalcy within the country's monetary  structure, and to achieve this, we must seek the reestablishment  of a single currency in the country. This is my opinion. And  when I say a single currency, I am saying it in strategic terms,  referring to a a single money, a Cuban currency that will have  no other parallel. This does not mean, in strategic terms, that  possession of currency will be penalized. Possession of currency  is one thing, while circulation of currency is quite another  thing. One thing is that a citizen can legally have a given  amount of currency, but it is a different thing to have this  money to use as a means of exchange in the economy. This money,  or the circulation of it, is what I believe must be changed into  a single currency. Between these currencies, there is the  possibility of creating this Cuban currency you mentioned, which  would create a better situation than what we have now, because  it would be a Cuban currency which would be under better  control. But in a more strategic context, I think we must strive  for a single currency that would deal with the exchange rate of  the Cuban peso, and which will comply with Cuba's true economic  demands and its relations with other countries.    [Diaz] But Julio, suppose the money is collected one way or  another. I think nothing will be achieved with the money that  remains and which has no commercial value. That is, we must  necessarily try to increase production, to increase supply. How  can the current economic situation be improved when there is a  scarcity of resources and inefficiency prevails. And how long  would this recovery take place? Could it be achieved this year?    [Carranza] Look, every time this subject is brought up, many  people rightly say that ultimately the crisis will be solved by  increasing production. And I believe this is a correct opinion.  But before that we must ask a question, which I think is a key  question: How are we going to create the conditions to increase  production? That is the problem. If production could be  increased by decree, then the crisis would obviously be solved  because the problem after all is a production problem. But what  the economy must do is to restore the conditions for promoting  production. And here is where all the discussions must focus on  the measures to be adopted, either short- or long-term measures.  I think in a first stage -- which will begin when the National  Assembly of the People's Government adopts the appropriate  measures -- the objective will not be and could not be to  increase production, but to restore the balance. What do we have  within the current situation of financial imbalance? The  economic upturn process is a very complex task. Under a given  condition of greater economic balance, where salaries will  regain their purchasing power and where other conditions will be  created, we would be creating better conditions -- not just  conditions, but the best situation for a recovery process. Then,  this is the first condition I mentioned. We must restore the  financial balance and create the conditions to increase  production.    Everything that can be done, small actions that can allow us  to take small steps to increase production, especially the  efforts being made by workers following their revolutionary  awareness, is very important. But in general terms, we must  recover the balance to push national production forward. This is  the first point, and I am going to the second point.    Concerning financial recovery, in order to make an  evaluation  of a possible recovery of the economy, we need, among other  things, statistical data which I do not have at hand at this  moment. Had I known some details perhaps I could give you a more  authoritative analysis, but I need some statistical data. But  what I can say is that under current conditions production  recovery is a complex and complicated problem. It demands much  effort. I must also say that although the objective is to grow,  we must focus on the recovery of the financial balance.    I also think that we must also take into account the fact  that the Cuban economy has dropped considerably over the past  few years. I can say that it dropped approximately 40 percent,  and so the economy is already experiencing a tremendous  downswing, and going lower than that will be very difficult.  That is, we are experiencing the lowest level, and for this  reason I believe that a new process could begin in a  medium-term, a process of change in the economic policy, of a  slow upturn until, to the extent that the conditions are  created, production is increased in a more effective manner in  the medium term.    I want to add something which I consider important. It has  been said that the Cuban international situation is very  complicated because of the blockade, and because of the  severance of relations we used to have with the socialist block,  therefore Cuba depends on a recovery of its production. I want  to say that these factors are very important, but as I said the  first day, regardless of the different forms of internal  production, despite the different economic policies, and despite  the difficult international relations, the country can give a  different productive answer. And this is the effort I believe we  must make, because the economic policy and the organization of  the productive areas depend on us and not on the world  situation, although the latter might be very important.

Raul congratulated the teachers and students  for a rewarding cultural performance, which included scenes of  contemporary relevance as well as epidoses from the wars of  independence.    Later on, Raul met with Emilia Betancourt, president of the  Oriente Rebelde People's Council, who told Raul that the local  economy depends primarily on milk production, two Basic  Cooperative Production Units, two credit and service  cooperatives, and one farming cooperative. She added that  self-sufficiency in vegetable and meat production is being  promoted. Raul mentioned that Fidel had visited the area in  November. Betancourt also told Raul about efforts to expand  domestic fish farming in minidams and water tanks.    The tour included the Oriente Mill, the most well preserved  in Cuba, which is being restored as a sugar industry museum.  Raul also viewed the plaque marking two important historic  moments: Ignacio Agramonte's uprising, and General Maximo Gomez'  battle camp in 1896.    Omar del Risco, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Sibanicu, gave Raul a detailed briefing on the potential  of fish farming as a food resource and added that there are  plans to attain 500 metric tons of fish in 1994.    Raul also talked with fishing Vice Minister Enrique Oltuski,  who pointed out that compliance with technical specifications  will allow the region to produce large quantities of fish. Raul  stressed the rationality of the minidam program because it  produces higher yields within a smaller area and brings the food  closer to the consumers. Politburo member Julian Rizo agreed  with Raul, adding that 7,000 liters of milk are distributed  within Camaguey without the need for long-distance transport.    Raul concluded that he will follow up on the development of  this program, which will undoubtedly contribute to increasing  food supplies for the people. He noted that this experience  should be made available to other municipalities in the country.     "

President Fidel Castro himself on 26 July announced the need  to make changes on the island, which has been seriously battered  by the tightening of the U.S. embargo and the crumbling of  socialism in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. Cuba  maintained 85 percent of its trade with this region.    The Caribbean country's purchasing power fell from $8  billion  in 1989 to 1.7 billion in 1993, for which the search and  development of new revenue sources has become one of the main  objectives in the struggle for national survival.    Political analysts agree in stating that opening the economy  to foreign capital was the measure with the most significant  impact on the local and international scene. It was also the  most realistic in a country that must now purchase everything  its needs with freely exchangeable currency.    The government also deregulated the holding of foreign  currency to improve the government's income by way of the  growing segment of the population that receives U.S. dollars  from tourism or from relatives living abroad.    Some experts affirm that one decision the community  pleasantly welcomed was the creation of the Basic Production  Cooperative Units (UBPC) in the agriculture sector. This, in  fact, constitutes a new concept in land exploitation methods.    By virtue of a government mandate, state-owned lands were  ceded for an indefinite period of time to groups of Cubans  interested in cultivating them. These groups, in the end, will  share the product of the sales of their harvest to the state.    Fidel Castro said that this new policy improves the  application of the socialist principle of pay according to work  and allows better economic control of resources.    Up to now, the weight of agricultural production was  primarily on the shoulders of state farms. The extreme shortage  of oil the island has experienced this year, the lack of  manpower, and the inefficient production levels threaten the  ability to produce sufficient food through intensive  agricultural activity.    According to local sources, the UBPC's offer greater control  over production levels. It is expected the over 1 million Cubans  will join these units, lured also by the possibility of  cultivating food to supply their own family as well as increase  their income.    Local media reports point out that the next 365 days will be  another period of significant changes in Cuba, to include an  in-depth reorganization of the state apparatus.    This issue will be one of the topics of debate at the Cuban  parliamentary sessions on 27 and 28 December. The assembly is  seeking ways to revive the country's domestic finances, which  have deteriorated due to the excess amount of money in  circulation -- calculated at approximately 10 billion pesos  (equal to the same amount in U.S. dollars at the official  exchange rate).    Government officials say that the assembly will analyze the  application of a tax system and other measures, pursuant to the  labor and salary reorganization measures directed at achieving  greater economic efficiency and encouraging production.    The TRABAJADORES weekly recently reported that personnel  rosters were to be reorganized, in light of the lack of jobs for  the number of people in the work force.    The publication, mouthpiece for the Cuban Workers  Federation,  says that this labor reorganization would be a gradual process,  to prevent any major impact on household economies.    Carlos Lage, a member of the Politburo of the Communist  Party  of Cuba and secretary of Council of Ministers, said that workers  ""will be moved to other centers. If this is not possible, they  will be given part of their salary. No one will be left adrift.""    Another novelty: Cuban television carried, during its  coverage of the recent Central American and Caribbean Games in  Puerto Rico, broadcast advertisements for products and  businesses for the first time in the Cuban revolution's 35 years.    JUVENTUD REBELDE, the newspaper published by the Union of  Young Communists, defended the publicity saying that it does not  harm ""the pure essence of our ideas"" and allows the entry of  currency; so necessary for the survival of the largest of the  Antilles islands.    As the Cubans see it, the logic behind the changes is the  same logic that society applies to maintain this commendable  social balance and its survival. The ways for change will be  never-ending, but all will follow the same political line: to  find a more stimulating style of socialism and economy.     "

The meeting was chaired by Raul Castro Ruz, second secretary of  the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] and Minister of the FAR. The  meeting concluded with a solemn and moving ceremony to promote  Enrique Carreras Rolas, a hero of the Republic of Cuba, to the  rank of division general.    The military council made the final assessment of all the  activities of the FAR during 1993, which had already been  previously analyzed in the last days of the mentioned year. The  review demonstrated the gigantic and fruitful effort in the  three armies with all the types of weapons that defend the  national territory, which shows a strengthening of the combat  capacity and readiness to successfully wage the people's war in  case of enemy aggression.    Significant progress was achieved in the combat readiness of  the personnel, which in Cuba includes millions of men and women  of the FAR and the reserves of the Territorial Troops Militia  [MTT] and the production and defense brigades.    Last year's maintenance and conservation of equipment and  arms and preparation of the theater of military operations  demanded arduous and intense labor that included several million  weapons and war equipment and the mobilization of hundreds of  thousands of men and women in the country to build the people's  defense tunnels and other fortifications.    These heroic deeds performed in 1993 are a continuation of  the heroic deeds achieved in the two previous years. The results  of the three years as a whole have elevated the vitality of the  combat arms and equipment, and the protection of these by the  combatants and the civil population in the face of eventual  enemy aggression. All this was achieved in midst of the  shortages of the special period.    Another important point on the agenda was the FAR's  activities in the agricultural-livestock areas, which are aimed  at achieving self-sufficiency among the troops. As in the past  year, the food production goals for 1994 represent a 30 percent  increase, which would get the FAR closer to its goal of becoming  completely self sufficient. Great emphasis was placed on all  military agricultural-livestock enterprises working towards  reducing costs and increasing productivity and yields, which is  the only way to achieve affordability and profitability. It was  mentioned that the Youth Labor Army [EJT] cares for 15,000  caballerias of land throughout the country and that they produce  632,000 tons of food annually for the national economy.    The reduction of the military budget by 50 percent was  another encouraging observation that the council session made.  This contributes to reducing the deficit of the state budget.  The elevated conduct of discipline and the moral and political  state of the troops were described as satisfactory. The council  was happy to verify that the work of the FAR's restructuring to  adapt itself to the current conditions of the national economy  was done as planned, while achieving the goal of maintaining the  defensive power of the country and perfecting the FAR's  efficiency and combat disposition, deepening even more the  doctrinal and tactical concepts of the people's war.    The homage to General Carreras, on the occasion of his 50th  anniversary as a combat pilot, highlighted his clean record, his  stand against the Nazi-fascist movement, Batista's dictatorship,  and U.S. imperialism, and his elevated patriotism, and  revolutionary spirit. These feelings successively made him a  combat pilot during World War II and the struggle against the  fascist aggressors. He joined the national army when its role  was defined by the Constitution of 1940 as body for the defense  of national sovereignty. He joined the conspiracy that emerged  from the heart of that army, as a rejection to Batista's  military coup and was jailed by the tyranny for refusing to bomb  the insurgent population of Cienfuegos.    In the unequal air combat against the mercenary aggression  at the Bay of Pigs, Carreras had the opportunity he had hoped  for since his youth: defend national independence in the most  audacious and risky situation in the skies of the fatherland. He  shot down two B-26 airplanes and made serious attacks on the  enemy naval group. His heroism in those battles and his  extensive record of service to the Revolution made him worthy of  the title: hero of the Republic of Cuba. Carreras, who is 71  years old, continues to be an active member of the FAR. He is  one of those generals that die with their boots on.    Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first substitute  to  the Minister of the FAR and head of the General Staff, concluded  the ceremony with these words:    [Begin Rosales recording] I am sure that I speak for the  Minister of the FAR and all those present when I say that  together with the fearlessness and courage, honesty and firmness  of principles, General Carreras has the virtue of modesty and  trustworthiness of which he has become a true model and which  has never been tarnished by the deserved promotions and  recognitions, including the honorary title of Hero of the  Republic of Cuba. For that reason, I would like to conclude my  speech by expressing to Division General Enrique Carreras Solas  that our party, the people, and their FAR are proud to have you  among its generals. We, the officers of the FAR, are honored to  be able to be your comrade in arms, and disciples of your  personal example. Thank you very much. [applause] [end recording]    Present at the ceremony were Retired Division General  (Hector  Rios Eregnu). (Rios), who is a retired officer of the sister  Republic of Argentina, is in Cuba with his family on a private  visit and was invited by the Minister of the FAR to attend the  ceremony.     "

Lage traveled by helicopter from Sao Paulo State. He had a  working breakfast here with a group of congressmen this morning.    A Brazilian source has described Lage's stay in Sao Paulo  yesterday, the first day of his official visit to Brazil, as  fruitful.    In Sao Paulo State, the vice president of the Cuban Council  of State met with State Governor Luis Antonio Fleury Filho and  discussed the possibilities of economic cooperation between the  Caribbean island and the Brazilian state in areas such as the  sugar industry, agriculture in general, health, culture, and  others.    Lage and delegation visited Riberao Preto Municipality in  the company of Roberto Rodriguez, the agriculture secretary of  Sao Paulo State, the afternoon of 2 February. Municipal Mayor  Antoni Parocci and prominent businessmen received the Cuban  leader.    The visitors [words indistinct] sugar industry. The Cuban  vice president showed special interest in that regard. The  possibilities of signing a cooperation protocol with that  municipality were discussed.    The Cuban guests completed their busy agenda in Riberao  Preto  with a meeting with the local Chamber of Commerce and Industry  and another meeting with a diverse group of businessmen and  reporters.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim will receive Lage in  Brasilia today. There are plans for a meeting also with Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso.    According to the official schedule, Brazilian President  Itamar Franco will receive him tomorrow morning.    Lage's visit to Brazil will conclude 7 February in Rio de  Janeiro. O GLOBO, a Rio de Janeiro newspaper, has published an  interview with Lage. The Cuban official responded in writing  from Havana to the questions before making the trip to Brazil.    In the interview, Lage explains the external factors that  have produced the tense economic situation in his country, and  he highlights among these factors the passing of the socialist  bloc and the Soviet Union, in addition to the blockade Cuba has  endured for more than three decades.    Lage has said abroad Cuba's economic restructuring program  is  being misinterpreted. He said: ""We already have a model, the  socialist model.""    He denied the socialist model has failed in Cuba, saying the  crisis burdening Cuba came from abroad.    He affirmed: ""I am not saying our model does not suffer from  deficiencies and errors. I am saying external factors have  unleashed the crisis.""    These factors, he added, were fattened by the U.S. blockade.    In spite of all that has happened, he added, we are intent  on  showing that the Cuban socialist model not only has not failed  but is vigorous and trying to consolidate itself. We know it is  not perfect, but it has many accomplishments.    The vice president reported practically all the productive  sectors of the Cuban economy are open to the possibility of  associating with foreign investors.    Lage said Cuba's most important trade partners are Russia,  China, Spain, Canada, Italy, and France.     "

As We Improve  Relations With the North Atlantic Alliance, May We Not Damage  Them With China""]    [Text] To this day, mutual relations between Russia and the  North Atlantic alliance have not been conceptually substantiated  by either side. Two significant questions are being left out of  the scope of all discussions of this topic underway in Russia:  the key historic task Moscow is now facing and Russian interests  in Asia. The issue of whether Russia will join NATO or not may  also be resolved once answers to these questions have been set  forth.    It is obvious that it is necessary to overcome, as soon as  possible, the state of a humiliated great power with a  dilapidated economy and a disfigured national self-awareness.  The main historic task follows from this--to turn within a short  period of time into a great multinational democratic state with  a market economy which has a worthy position in the world.    The strategy of blending into the world economy should be  implemented in the areas where this runs into the least  resistance and begets the greatest cooperation. In other words,  centers of economic power which, for objective reasons, are  interested in the least discriminatory cooperation with Russia  are its natural partners in the outside world. Geographical  neighbors who, proceeding from considerations of their own  security, are interested in the preservation of at least a  stable Russia may be classified as such.    Taking into account the Eurasian affiliation of our country,  it is easy to understand that in the European area, all of the  above refers primarily to the European Union and its core of  integration, France and Germany. In the Asian area, it is  primarily China which is quickly growing into an economic giant.    Therefore, a simultaneous and parallel, primarily economic  rapprochement with both West Europe and China should form the  foundation of a foreign policy strategy.    It will become clear that there is no alternative to  friendly  relations with our Asian neighbor if we take into account that  Russia has the longest land border with China, that China is a  state with a population of 1 billion, and that it has nuclear  potential. It may be said without exaggeration that now that the  threat of a nuclear world war has disappeared, relations between  Russia and China are more important than relations with the  United States from the point of view of ensuring Russia's  security.    The role of China in ensuring Russian interests associated  with economic security is also great. The Chinese leadership is  striving to modernize its armed forces. At present, when many  defense enterprises in Russia are on the brink of economic  demise, even insignificant purchases of armaments by China and  military-technical cooperation with it are helping the survival  of our plants, which concentrate the elite of the  scientific-technical intelligentsia and workers, along with  unique high technology and experience.    Without a doubt, the possible admission to NATO will deal a  blow to the good-neighbor relations between Russia and China. We  would like to recall that a joint Russian-Chinese declaration  signed during the visit by President Yeltsin to China in  December 1992 said directly that the sides undertook to refrain  from participation in military-political alliances aimed against  one another. The Chinese will most likely view Russia's  membership in NATO as a direct violation of these agreements, as  a powerful association of European nations against Asian nations.    It is also beyond a doubt that, reacting to Russia's  membership in NATO, China will take measures in response--it  will begin to wind down economic cooperation and will boost the  military budget and the strength of Chinese troops concentrated  at the Russian-Chinese border.    Therefore the proposal concerning possible NATO membership  for Russia, lucrative at first sight, actually brings about a  perceptible deterioration in its security conditions in Asia,  complications in the course of economic reforms, and  restrictions on independence in foreign policy. Russia's  membership in NATO is not in line with its strategic interests.  However, this is not at all to say that Russia should give up  cooperation with NATO in the course of ensuring European  security.    Certain frictions and contradictions, including territorial  disputes, exist between the former socialist countries of  Central and East Europe. The possibility of armed conflicts  developing between them, i.e., in the vicinity of Russia's  western borders, cannot be ruled out. It is impossible to do  without drawing NATO and Russia into the settlement of these  conflicts. This is why care should be taken in advance to create  a mechanism for interaction between Russia and the alliance,  possibly through the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe. Conflicts should be settled under the mandates of the  United Nations or the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, with both NATO and Russia being brought in.  Participation of other CIS member states is also possible. In  the process, Russia should act as a partner of NATO on an equal  footing rather than a member, with not only the peacemaking  forces but their command being joint. The American Partnership  for Peace program lays a foundation for this.    As far as security guarantees to the former socialist  countries in Europe are concerned, Russia should encourage their  rapprochement with the European Union and the Western European  Union--the defense structure of West Europe. In the process  Russia should firmly argue for its negative attitude toward  their possible admission to NATO. This approach will gain  support from Europists, i.e. proponents of restoring the  erstwhile role of Europe as the center of world civilization,  the leadership of the European Union and the Western European  Union, and Germany. This approach will ensure the much-desired  Western security guarantees for former socialist countries.    The signing of a treaty on partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the European Union which is planned for this  year and its implementation will dispel apprehensions existing  here with regard to the possible isolation of Russia from the  West. On the other hand, with this strategy in the Western area,  freedom of actions in Asia is retained in full, in particular,  an opportunity to maintain good-neighbor relations with China.    In turn, the transformation of the Conference on Security  and  Cooperation in Europe from an amorphous forum into a strong  international organization, with its own Security Council and  peacemaking forces capable of preventing and extinguishing armed  conflicts quickly, should become the main avenue for creating a  common European security system.

""These are the times in which our intelligence, our work  ethic, and courage are necessary to produce as much sugar as  possible,"" Sugar Industry Minister Nelson Torres Perez said on  Tuesday in statements to official newspaper GRANMA. Torres  asked agro-industrial workers to raise their spirits and not to  give up in view of the heavy rains and floods, which paralyzed  harvests in the eastern provinces of the island, where at least  10 persons lost their lives.    Bridges, roads, thermoelectric plants, houses, and  plantations were adversely affected by the heavy rains, which  represented for the residents of the region a disaster similar  to the one they suffered last November.    The sugarcane harvest, which had been scheduled to end in  April, was first extended until May, and now, according to  official estimates, could be extended until June.    The critical situation was foreseen in mid-April by Vice  President Carlos Lage, who in an analysis meeting in Holguin  Province described the sugarcane harvest situation as tense and  difficult. Lage, the principal economic strategist, thereby  changed the criteria he had set at the beginning of the year  when he said that the 1994-95 harvest season would be greater  than the present one and that the present one would be greater  ""by several hundred tons [as received] than the 1992-93 season.""    The water excess, in addition to obstructing the work of the  scarce machinery that remains operating with the shortage of  fuel, decreases the amount of sucrose in the sugarcane. Cuba  registered in the last sugar cane harvest, its principal  industry, the lowest production in three decades of only 4.2  million tons of sugar, which President Fidel Castro described as  ""a disaster.""    The drop in production, as compared to the 1991-92 harvest  season, of 7 million tons, represented for the island a decrease  in revenue of $500 million at a time when the country is facing  a serious shortage of foreign exchange. ""In July and August,  nothing will stop...most of the sugar cane workers will remain  in combat because there are no resources to perform work in  other areas, including repair work"" at the sugar mills, Torres  said. ""This effort we are making is not due to somebody's whim  or to the proud search for an objective,"" the sugar industry  minister said in the western city of Matanzas.    The rains of the last 30 days in the Provinces of  Guantanamo,  Granma, Holguin, and Santiago de Cuba flooded hundreds of  hectares and paralyzed the sugarcane harvest, which is also  facing problems due to the lack of supplies.    Torres suggested taking advantage of the momentary absence  of  rain to work in the flooded fields because ""we cannot spare even  a ton of sugar. The national economy and the commitments we  have made require it.""    The Cuban Government has, for the past few weeks, made a  dramatic effort, which included the deployment of thousands of  workers with machetes -- cane cutters -- to step up production.     "

""The tobacco harvest, the food program, and the  sugar harvest will be given absolute priority in terms of oil  supplies for 1994, Lage said after touring tobacco producing  areas in the western province of Pinar del Rio.    Lage, considered the architect of the limited Cuban economic  reforms, said the current tobacco harvest could be the best  quality seen for the past few years if current weather  conditions continue.    The lack of fertilizer and oil to operate equipment also  affected Cuban tobacco production, a traditional export product.    Nevertheless, Lage said that this year the oil supply  situation -- the Achilles' heel of the feeble Cuban economy,  which has been affected by a serious crisis since the beginning  of the decade -- will improve this year.    The shortage of oil (with its corollary lengthy power  outages), passenger buses, and food were the main hardships the  island's 11 million inhabitants faced last year.    The state-run Cuban Petroleum Enterprise (Cupet) announced  during the first week of this year that it ended 1993 with a  record production of 7.7 million barrels of heavy national crude  oil with a high sulfur content.    Engineer Agustin Jimenez, director of the Maximo Gomez  thermoelectric plant, admitted that the amount is barely enough  to generate 40 percent of the electricity consumed on the  island. Using that type of crude also causes excessive corrosion  to burners and other equipment.    Cuba received an average 91 million barrels of oil per year  in 1989 from the former USSR.    According to president Fidel Castro, the island's economy  cannot function with less than 43 million barrels per year, most  of which must be purchased on the international market or with  sugar traded to Russia.    The authorities are determined to reach production levels of  4.5 to 4.6 million tons of sugar this year. That figure is only  a few hundred tons more than the 1992/1993 harvest, which was  the poorest in the last few decades.     "

In Connection with This Event We Are  Publishing Comments on Russia by Well-Known American Political  and Public Figures""]    [Text] U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen:    Difficulties in the course of the reforms are no reason to  slow them down.    The fact that the Russian population is encountering serious  difficulties in the transition to the market economy is not  unexpected. However, this is happening not because the reforms  are moving too quickly but because they are developing too  slowly. That opinion was expressed by U.S. Treasury Secretary  Lloyd Bentsen at a meeting with a group of journalists organized  by USA TODAY.    The United States maintains relations with Russia at many  levels, L. Bentsen said. We are discussing not only nuclear or  military questions. We are also concerned about bilateral  economic relations. And we are trying to help Russia make the  transition to the market economy easier. One of the most  difficult tasks during such a transformation is to reduce  inflation, the high level of which in Russia is partly due to  the continuation of subsidies to some state enterprises on which  the whole social structure in some regions depends. They are  continuing to produce goods which are not wanted and whose  production is not in the interests of consumers. The progress  in this sphere is quite slow.    Nevertheless, Russia has managed to reduce inflation  somewhat. It has made ""astonishing progress"" in the  privatization of small enterprises, too. ""In this sphere the  situation is heartening,"" L. Bentsen noted. The United States  is interested in creating more favorable conditions for U.S.  business investments in Russia. One such sphere is the oil  industry. The participation of U.S. companies in its  modernization could give Russia a speedy benefit in the form of  hard currency.    The treasury secretary stressed that Russia should work more  quickly to elaborate clear rules for the conclusion of contracts  with foreign companies. Then American firms would have greater  confidence in the legality of their investments and a clear idea  what they can expect when contracts are being concluded. ""Some  progress has already been made in this regard. But even more  remains to be made,"" L. Bentsen stressed.    Answering a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent on what  he expects from the discussion of economic problems during the  U.S.-Russian summit meeting in Moscow, the treasury secretary  said: ""I believe that the U.S. Administration will insist on  further progress in relations between international financial  institutions and the Russian Government."" Efforts must be made  by both sides, L. Bentsen remarked. They must establish closer  contact and discuss Russia's observance of the terms for  granting loans. The United States is also urging the World Bank  to take measures to help Russia to resolve its social problems  connected with the dismissal of workers in major industrial  sectors.    The World Bank can grant loans to help rectify the  situation.  I hope that the bank will study these opportunities together  with the Russian Government, the U.S. treasury secretary said.     "

He also agreed to reply to questions by a correspondent  of this program.    Asked whether there will be any changes in the government  economic policy after the Seimas debate on a government no-  confidence vote, Slezevicius said:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] We have very carefully studied  all statements without exception by Seimas members. We have  analyzed all critical remarks and focussed our attention on many  of them during the preparation of a corrected government  program. As you know, the no-confidence issue is one side of  the matter, but now, in accordance with our constitution, we  have, after a change of more than a half of the members of the  cabinet, submitted a new government program to the Seimas. [end  recording]    Having stated that the stability of the litas is helping the  development of the economy but is not sufficient to make this  development more dynamic, Slezevicius continued:    [Begin Slezevicius recording] In our program we emphasize  our  attention on those issues which require a very fast solution.  This includes taxation policy, the administration of taxes, the  control of borders, and improvement of the work of the customs  offices. And, of course, it is very important to step up the  investment process. [passage omitted]    A limiting factor in the development of the economy is the  very high cost of credits, and, of course, not a single investor  is able to use local credits for investment processes. This is  closely connected with the credit resources of our commercial  banks and with the stability of these banks. Together with the  Central Bank, we have to accomplish a great deal in this sphere,  so that the price of credits in our country goes down in a more  dynamic manner than now. [end recording]    Slezevicius then stressed the government's tasks in creating  favorable trading conditions for Lithuania's industry and  businessmen and mentioned that at a foreign policy coordinating  committee meeting relations with Russia were discussed today.  Then he continued:    [Begin Slevevicius recording] As you know our relations with  Russia are being extensively discussed. They are closely linked  with the strategic situation of the Kaliningrad region and with  the necessity of normalizing transit through our country. As it  happens, our country is situated between two territories of  Russia and our task is to find together with Russia mutually  acceptable means of solving all problems. [passage omitted]    I think that we will find mutually acceptable solutions in  the immediate future and that the agreement signed by Mr  Chernomyrdin on 18 November will be implemented.

In this process, it is clear that the basic intent is to  examine, from the standpoint of each workplace, the true causes  of economic inefficiency and its impact on the financial  imbalances, and to suggest methods of combining economic and  political considerations in the actions the country must  undertake.    Stimulated by the call of their union leaders, the workers  must be cognizant of their active role in the country's economic  reorganization, and must be willing to accept the financial  measures that are ultimately adopted, even if they involve some  sacrifice.    It is obvious in these discussions that the most important  thing in our economy is to be efficient in every possible way,  and the only reasonable means of achieving that goal is to cut  costs, boost labor productivity, and get the most out of the  inputs we have.    With the authority of those who do not abandon their posts,  the speakers are demanding more than ever before that we  maintain a high degree of labor discipline, which at a time like  this depends on attitude, awareness of social duty, and  patriotism. What is at stake, more than anything else, is the  defense of the workers' most genuine interests.    We must not wait for any external measure, but must adopt  those measures we can implement right now to make our economy  more effective. Those measures are in areas where we have raw  materials and where the productive processes have not been  halted and top-quality service is being provided for the  country: the sugar harvest, sugarcane and agricultural  production, fishing, mining and mineral processing, tourism,  pharmaceuticals, science centers, and vital activities such as  health and education, among others.    Few imaginable financial proposals do not involve real or  apparent conflicts of interest or differences of opinion.    Thus, when a worker proposes to raise the prices of certain  products, another worker may remind him that there are  relatively low wages in a wide range of occupations, while a  third may argue that it would be better to accept increases in  certain items that the family budget can afford rather than  having to pay for vital services such as education and health,  which are difficult to pay for on an individual basis.  ks it is better to give subsidies to low-income people than to  subsidize the sale of products at below-cost prices, another  will explain how difficult and complex such subsidy mechanisms  are.    Among the workers' concerns are the intolerable presence of  crime, its relationship to the black market, and its impact on  social and labor discipline. The workers want to find ways of  eliminating the theft and diversions that are driving up costs,  demoralizing the collectives, and enriching money hoarders and  traffickers. They demand that the authorities take drastic  measures that will set an example at all levels.    In connection with the above, they have expressed the need  to  readjust and properly enforce the financial requirements for  collections and payments between enterprises. The present  situation is in fact promoting a lack of discipline and may  actually cover up crime. In any event, the workers and their  unions must monitor efforts in the field to solve this problem.    Another frequent topic of discussion is the tax system: what  it consists of, how it may be expanded, what economic activities  may be sources of additional funding for the state, and how  citizens can increase their support for it.    These and other issues are debated. The fact is that the  workers are fully involved in the consideration and solution of  the problems that affect them the most.    After four years of heroic resistance, the people of Cuba  are  entering a phase that is in significant ways more aggressive in  the struggle to safeguard the sovereignty of the fatherland and  the socialist nature of the revolution.    It is hoped that in 1994, signs of economic recovery will be  seen in some vital activities and areas of production, thanks to  the process of financial adjustment based on a high degree of  political consensus.    Once again, we hail the wisdom of the National People's  Government Assembly in postponing decisionmaking and  categorically denying that the intent is to formulate a  so-called ""packet of measures.""    The truth is that the idea of a ""packet of measures"" smacks  of Third World capitalism, of neoliberal policies under which  the workers wake up one day to the news that prices have  skyrocketed, enterprises are being privatized and half the  employees are to be laid off, wages are falling, and social  benefits have been abruptly eliminated.    Reality forces us to make an economic adjustment, but we  will  do it in the socialist way, the Cuban way, with democratic  formulas that are truly unimaginable for other societies.    We are aware, of course, that the harsh situation of an  economy that has had to withstand devastating blows, as ours  has, causes many people to lose their patience and to yearn for  ""rescue measures.""    Considering the complexity of our problems, however, we  realize that it is naive to expect that measures can act like a  magic wand, graciously granting every wish.    We urgently need to improve our economic efficiency, but we  must not rush into technical solutions without first reconciling  them with their political repercussions.    Hence the importance of continuing to expand and improve  this  democratic and educational process that is so aptly named the  Workplace Parliament, without allowing the slightest hint of  ritual or formalism to taint it.    The workers' voice must be heard loud and clear everywhere.    It is imperative that management be forthcoming with  accurate  information so that the economic and financial situation of each  workplace can be assessed.    Trade union leaders must devote their energies to carrying  out this lofty political task, the true path to the economic  efficiency that Cuba needs to triumph.     "

The first question is on Gaydar's present title and  position,  to which Yegor Gaydar says: ""First, I am a deputy and the head,  the chairman, of the Russia's Choice faction. I resigned from  all kinds of state duties and I am heading on a voluntary basis  the scientific work at the institute of economic policy, [word  indistinct], it is called the Institute of Economic Problems of  the Transitional Period."" He recalls that the institute was set  up in 1991.    Asked why the government in general and Gaydar in particular  were so unwilling to explain to the people where Russia was  going and what was happening, Gaydar acknowledges that it had  been ""a serious fault."" He goes on to say: ""Our work was very  hectic in 1992 . The state had practically collapsed and one  had a permanent feeling that if one were to stop working for  just five minutes, things would simply slip through one's  hands."" He continues: ""The main problem of 1992 and 1993 was  that we failed to convince, failed to explain some simple  things, thus giving opportunities and freedom of action to  demagogues and liars.""    Asked to assess the state of the Russian economy at the time  when Gaydar ""fled,"" as the correspondent put it, Gaydar says ""I  did not flee anywhere, I left to do my own things."" He  continues: ""The funny thing is that those who spent two years  seeking my resignation are now speaking of the harm my  resignation did."" He further says: ""There were many questions  on the reasons for my resignation. I understand that some  people have no shame at all. They are prepared to implement any  policy and they are not ashamed of any decisions. I simply  cannot understand how one can retain one's human dignity and at  the same time justify a policy which allows no money for  resolving the problem of nuclear waste -- which we are dumping  in the world ocean -- but which allows 20 times as much money  for the construction of a major administrative building given  that two parliaments, two governments, the union and the  republican government and party bodies have ceased to exist in  Moscow.""  ""Well, I cannot be held responsible for a policy such as  this,"" says Gaydar, adding that what Russia needs is ""a  cost-conscious, inexpensive state with few officials whose  rights should be restricted."" He says that instead of  arbitrarily handing out grants, licenses, and subsidies, they  should elaborate rules to be adhered to in all cases and control  their observance.  He says that there are those who think Russia needs a large  state which actively interferes in the economy, with a large  army of officials and in times of trouble Russia has often  reacted in this manner. He says that it sometimes yielded  results, but it often led Russian into a historical blind alley  from which it was extremely difficult to extricate itself.    ""It is my deep conviction that the time has now come for us  to extricate ourselves from this blind alley we are in and to  proceed along a path which has actually ensured success for a  majority of civilized states, where society is dominant over the  state, rather than the other way around."" Acknowledging that  this was a problem for Russia, Gaydar said it must be tackled.  ""An army of corrupt officials, in cahoots with a part of the  new bourgeoisie that is interested in receiving handouts from  them represents the factor that is capable of paralyzing through  and through any potential for development, simultaneously  exacerbating constantly the most acute social problems,  inequality, and dissatisfaction"", he said.    Asked about the current situation, Gaydar said he is ""deeply  convinced that despite all the tremendous difficulties we are  now coming up against, despite the whole seriousness of the  current situation, the situation is, of course, much better than  at the end of 1991."" He says that at the end of 1991, Russia  had enough grain to last until February and Russia was  completely dependent on imports. This year Russia has major  grain reserves, although there are various marketing  difficulties.    Continuing his comparison, Gaydar says that ""hard currency  reserves as at the end of 1991 were nil; there were no hard  currency reserves at all, while as at the end of 1993 they  amounted to $4.5 billion"" and these ""modest"" reserves ensured  that we could pay for up to two months of imports. ""We have a  major trade surplus and for the first time Russia ceased to  depend on many imports,"" Gaydar says, adding that this created  preconditions for further stabilization.    He further says: ""We left the country in a situation in  which wages are $100 per month. This is not an indicator of  greater prosperity and it would not be correct to regard it as  such, because wages measured in dollars, of course, fail to  reflect greater prosperity, but it is indicative of the  stabilization of our domestic currency and of the extent to  which the country's economy has become a part of the world  market.""    Hyperinflation causes wages to fall to around $10 per month  as is currently the case in the former Yugoslavia and in Ukraine  and as was the case in Russia at the end of 1991 ""when wages  amounted to seven dollars per month."" ""In December inflation  amounted to 12 percent, a record low,"" Gaydar adds.    Defense orders used to play a tremendous role in the  country's economy which has now adapted itself to a much lower  level of these orders and is geared much more towards consumer  needs which will improve in quality as they have to compete with  high quality foreign consumer goods. This process of economic  restructuring is only in its inception, but it is a promising  trend, Gaydar claims.    Gaydar then states that demilitarization of the economy  altered supply and demand and what is now needed is to finance  investments in the economy. He feels this can be done through  increased taxation and that the state ""is currently taking a lot  of taxpayers' money for itself, because we have a huge defense  expenditure, reduced a bit, but you can not reduce it all in one  go; one must realize this quite clearly. We continue to have  serious expenditure to finance an ineffective agriculture and we  have a whole lot of serious structural problems in the economy  and it is not possible to cope with all this in one go and in  conditions such as these to finance an ambitious and large-scale  program of economic restructuring into the bargain is simply  tantamount to making taxes prohibitive and such taxation does  not exist."" But economic investments can also be financed  through voluntary contributions from the population, as is the  case in Japan, where the state's investments in the economy are  minimal, but where people save a lot and their money, through  the banking system, is invested in the economy, Gaydar explains.    Gaydar continues: ""If I was asked when will the Russian  economy begin to grow, my answer would be, quite simply, that  this process will start when voluntary savings of the population  begin to increase substantially in our country."" This would not  be possible if inflation devalued savings by 20 percent a month.  ""So, when we say that we need to stop price increases, it is  not because we are some kind of blinkered idealists, but because  we simply do know how development of production is financed, as  distinct, perhaps, from our opponents,"" Gaydar says. Inflation  endangers production growth, but Gaydar says he is not overly  inclined to believe that an economic disaster was looming,  because the market mechanisms are in place and, he states, ""I do  not believe that the current Government will start making one  silly and fatal error after another."" Gaydar says he does not  believe that the government would cause hyperinflation in the  country, nor does he believe that the dollar would reach 20,000  rubles.    Asked about his forecasts, Gaydar says: ""I think that the  new government's policy will, to a large extent, be a policy of  vacillation. The government will endeavor to hold inflation in  check and, at the same time, overcome by a passionate desire to  increase production, before pre-conditions have been created for  this to happen, the government will throw all its resources  towards supporting individual industries, especially when it  finds itself under powerful lobby pressure. It will hand out  promises of financial support and will subsequently come up  against tremendous difficulties, unable to fulfill its promises.  It will vacillate between a sharp increase in protectionism and  the necessity of ensuring that consumers' elementary interests  are met. In short, it seems to me that this policy will be very  difficult to form, subject to powerful pressures and that it  will, to a large extent, be a contradictory policy"". This  policy can preserve the present status quo in which inflation is  not high enough to destroy the fiscal system and bring market  mechanisms to a standstill and nor is it sufficiently low to  stimulate growth through savings being invested in the national  economy. He says that against this backdrop some officials can  be in cahoots with a part of the new bourgeoisie, interested in  the emergence of a protectionist, paternalistic state.    He concludes by saying that Russia is facing a choice  between  the all-powerful state endeavoring to solve the problem of  economic development and breaking out of the ""vicious circle of  our history,"" making the state serve society and creating an  open and competitive economy.

0,FT933-13582 ,"FT933-13582 _AN-DGSCZAAYFT 930719   FT  19 JUL 93 / EC and Russia in aluminium trade row      By JOHN LLOYD      MOSCOW   TALKS in Moscow have failed to resolve the growing the rift between the European Community and Russia over trade. The EC appears likely to restrict aluminium imports from Russia and other former Soviet states. Such a move would choke off a market which has produced a flow of desperately needed hard currency. The opening of the western European market to Russian goods has been identified by Russian President Boris Yeltsin as a key objective - but one which the Community has so far denied him. Russia's key contention, underscored last week by Mr Gyorgy Gabunia, deputy minister for foreign trade, is that 'we are no longer a command economy - we are a market economy. We want to be treated by the Community as a market economy - no better than others, but no worse.' However, for Mr Hugo Parmen, the senior EC official in charge of negotiations with the Russians, 'it is obvious they are still a state trading country. They still have the remnants of a planned economy.' Russia has said it wishes to become a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which seeks to reduce or eliminate tariff barriers between members. Mr Yeltsin has said he wants Russia to be a member by the end of the year - an unrealistic demand of a body which takes at least two years to process an application, but evidence of the Russian desire to get in quickly. However, Russia has not yet submitted the memorandum necessary to begin the application process. Mr Gabunia says: 'We have one of the most open markets in the world - we have tariffs on practically nothing.' He instances particular restrictions against Russian goods - such as low ceilings on imports of cars into Spain and Portugal, shoes into Spain, and television sets and vodka into France. Mr Parmen agrees these restrictions exist but says they are strictly disapproved of by the EC and 'will be removed'. The most crucial commodity is aluminium, though. According to EC figures, aluminium exports from the Soviet Union to the EC were running in 1989 at 147,000 tonnes while in 1992, the former Soviet states exported to the Community 529,000 tonnes (85 per cent of which came from Russia), an increase of nearly 250 per cent. At the same time, the EC aluminium market grew from 3.86m tonnes to 4.24m tonnes - an increase of only 14 per cent. 'The aluminium coming into the EC is being sold at very low prices,' said Mr Parmen. 'The European producers cannot possibly compete with it.' He says that the Community does not want to introduce ceilings, but will be forced to do so if the exports are not cut.   Countries:-  QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).

Perez Betancourt will conclude his official visit to Russia  tomorrow after meeting with the high-ranking military chiefs.    The Cuban naval chief on Wednesday laid a wreath in Moscow  at  the tomb of the unknown soldier located on one side of the  Kremlin wall before he met with Colonel General Mikhail  Kolesnikov, chief of the General Staff and first deputy defense  minister.    The visitor and Kolesnikov discussed the levels of friendly  and cooperative relations between the armed institutions of both  nations.     "

The  Cuban Population is Aging""]    [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Local experts have said  a drop in the nation's fertility rate in which the number of  young people goes down raises the population's age and brings it  closer to the demographic patterns of the world's more developed  countries.    Based on Cuban Statistical Research Institute projections  for  the next century, Cuba will have 11.504 million inhabitants,  with more women, by the start of the next millennium.    ""By the year 2020, approximately 28.9 percent of the  population will be 60 years old or older, thereby drawing closer  to Sweden's levels, for example, where the percentage of elderly  people was 22.8 percent in 1992,"" Dr. Raul Hernandez Castellon  told PRENSA LATINA.    The head of the Cuban Center for Demographic Studies said  Cuba is one of the few countries in Latin America experiencing  an early demographic revolution process; a transition that began  its first phase during this century's first three decades.    ""From 1902 to 1928, the United States invested approximately  $1.5 billion in the island, generating a great migratory current  to meet the labor force needs,"" he indicated. According to  statistics from that time, approximately 750,000 Spaniards and  250,000 Haitians, Jamaicans, and Puerto Ricans entered the  country. This situation influenced the age and gender structure  because most of the immigrants were working-age, single men.    At the same time, the high levels of urban development  reached and the relative progress in education, he said, were  factors that influenced the reproductive behavior of the Cuban  population. Studies indicated that the major characteristics  of the second phase of the demographic transition was the change  in the direction of the migratory movements, since the nation  had become a source of emigrants owing to contradictions in the  economy and other factors.    Afterward, when the new government took over in 1959,  another  migratory movement of economic and political nature evolved.    Later, the fertility rate dropped below the replacement  level  and, finally, a stunning increase in the life expectancy rate  occurred. That was when the first signs of aging began to appear.    In making a detailed analysis of this phenomenon, Dr.  Hernandez Castellon indicated that, with few exceptions, the  Cuban population has maintained a rather low annual growth rate  compared to developing countries.    Over a period as long as 62 years, between 1919 and 1981, he  added, the rate was 1.95 percent, although the population  increased approximately 6.8 million, as the census indicated.    In fact, until 1950, the arrival of emigrants contributed to  a relatively high growth rate of 2.31 percent.    Although the rate went from 2.8 children to 1.8 per woman  from 1919 to 1953, the migratory flow basically influenced the  age and gender structure.    For that reason, there were more men than women from 1919 to  1981, but by 1990, statistics showed a balance with women had  been reached.    ""Regarding people younger than 15 years of age, Cuba is on  par with Europe's developed countries, with 22.8 percent in  1990,"" Dr. Hernandez Castellon noted.    The profound socioeconomic changes in the country since 1959  have undoubtedly influenced the recent demographic evolution in  the island, the experts stated.    ""There was a noticeable increase in births in the early  1960's and the ""baby boom"" [preceding two words in English]  peaked in 1963, when the birth rate shot up to 35.1 births for  every 1,000 residents,"" the expert noted.    The reason for that was, in addition to the couple's  economic  security and their confidence in the future, abortions were  restricted, and there were no contraceptives on the local market.    The arrival of electricity to remote areas allowed the news  media to reach those places, which resulted in more education  for the residents.    Family planning orientation was also extended throughout the  country; an aspect that was accompanied by making diverse  contraceptive means available to every woman. We must also  mention the legalization of abortion, which, though it may not  be regarded as a contraceptive, allows the couple to have the  children they want.    ""Another very important aspect regarding the aging of the  population is found in the life expectancy rate from birth. In  1950, it was 58 years and now is over 75 years,"" Dr. Hernandez  Castellon reiterated.    This has been possible, he said, even though the infant  mortality rate has dropped every year, so that by 1993 it had  decreased to 9.4 for every 1,000 live births.     "

The report refers to theft from the Detergent  and Soap Enterprise, formerly Sabatez, in Cerro Municipality,  Havana City Province. The Crimes Against the Economy section of  the Havana City Province Police Operations Unit, upon learning  that detergent had been unloaded at a residence near the  enterprise, searched the home of Lazaro Ruiz Cutino, who has a  criminal record and a history of terrible social conduct, and  seized 40 sacks of detergent. Four enterprise workers -- a  warehouse inspector, warehouse chief, and two loader operators  -- had stolen the detergent through the negligence of the  production area's brigade chief in transporting the sacks to the  warehouse.    The radio notes: ""In certain thefts of merchandise that have  occurred at state enterprises, police investigators have  verified participation in crimes on the part of people in  positions of responsibility, to the sole end of illegally  increasing their personal wealth."" The seven citizens arrested  had shared 50,000 pesos for the stolen detergent. They will be  tried for the crime of serious theft. The detergent was  recovered and the money seized from the defendants was turned  over to the court.    Radio Progreso Network at 1100 GMT on 9 May reports that two  men were arrested for trying to steal five arrobas of potatoes  to sell on the black market. The men, Ignacio Andres Gorrero,  manager of a grocery store that sells agricultural products, and  Faustino Paz Cabrera, driver of the municipal harvesting  company, were caught by the police, who recovered a portion of  the stolen potatoes. The driver had already dropped off over  five quintals of potatoes at the grocery store in question, to  be sold by the corrupt administrator at six pesos per pound.     "

GRANMA has denied the success of a recommendation made to  the  station by a U.S. congressional panel to switch its VHF  frequency to UHF in its fruitless attempts to reach the Cuban  audience thanks to a Cuban Government-sponsored interference  system that blocks out illegal broadcasting.    The newspaper indicates that U.S. technicians and  specialists  are aware of this, but are fraudulently not admitting to the  public that the TV station has failed to achieve its objectives.  This is a hostile action at a time when the possibility of  reaching a bilateral agreement on communications is being  debated.    The text specifies that this also coincides with the  commemoration in this capital of a meeting between Havana's  government and sectors representing Cuban emigres overseas,  [words indistinct] to which switching frequency does not make  that TV station less illegal. Marti also uses the deceitful  argument of offering Cubans ""uncensored information,"" which  really means information that suits U.S. interests. GRANMA adds  that an average of 1,043 radio hours per week originating in the  United States are part of a war that is overloading the Cuban  dial.    GRANMA says that this argument does not stand up to  analysis.  And if this wasn't enough, they would have to admit that a high  percentage of entertainment programming on Cuban TV is produced  in the United States, as are some TV news services.    The idea is to smuggle anti-Cuban ""propaganda,"" not  ""information without censorship,"" with which they seek to  demoralize, discourage, and divide Cubans and to criticize the  Cuban economy which they are sabotaging daily with their  blockade legislation and other harassment measures, the  newspaper argues.    The commentary warns also that if the anti-Cuban television  does not want to trip on the same stone (failure) twice,  something that could happen to the adminsitration of President  William Clinton, it would be worth its while to listen to the  (onomatopoeic, succinct, and direct) advice of millions of  Cubans: ""Click"" (meaning, turning off their television sets).

Despite the record of his 30-month tenure - which has included a 40 per cent drop in gross domestic product over the first four months of this year alone - Mr Kravchuk is gaining in the opinion polls against his main challenger on Sunday, the former prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma. Indeed, repairing the economy, the main challenge facing Ukraine's next president - is barely on the campaign agenda. Instead, campaigning has focused on the shape of a proposed new constitution, the status of the Russian language in a country with an 11m-strong ethnic Russian minority and the extent of alignment with Russia itself. Though Ukraine's leaders succeeded in creating an independent state from the disintegration of the Soviet Union, they have failed to make it economically sustainable, leaving its statehood fragile and beholden to Russia. Ukraine is kept afloat by a large Russian subsidy (Dollars 1bn-Dollars 2bn annually in unpaid oil and gas debts) while Kiev props up its energy-wasteful heavy industries and subsidises its state farms with money it does not have. While the west has woken up belatedly to the fact that Ukraine's stability is important for Europe, Ukraine has yet to face up to the fundamental economic choice of whether to remain dependent on Russia or restructure its energy-intensive industries and diversify its markets. Asked why no one is talking about economics, Mr Mykola Mikhailchenko, the president's chief domestic adviser, says: 'The majority of Ukrainians are satisfied with the current path of reform.' In fact economic dissatisfaction is widespread, but Ukraine's main power brokers - the collective farm bosses, industrial directors and Soviet-era bureaucrats - have so far had more success maintaining their positions than reforming the economy. The slow pace of privatisation - only 150 enterprises in the first wave of the sell-off programme - has also meant the lack of a class of independent owners with an interest in reform. Many private entrepreneurs have gone underground to form a black economy which probably equals the official economy because it is the only way to survive in Kiev's thicket of restrictions and high taxes. The only presidential candidate running on an economic reform platform, Mr Volodymyr Lanoviy, is trailing with less than 10 per cent support in the opinion polls. Even Ukraine's nationalist west has abandoned him, unconvinced this 'Ukrainian Gaidar' could beat their main foe, Mr Kuchma. The two main contenders offer populist promises. Mr Kuchma, a Soviet-era missile plant manager who resigned as prime minister last September after a power struggle with the president, says he will resurrect Ukraine's economy by 're-establishing ties with Russia'. But he does not say whether he means economic union, whereby part of Ukraine's sovereignty would be sacrificed to Russia, or freer trade, which would require Ukraine to lift subsidies and price controls as Russia itself has done. The largely Russian-speaking eastern Ukrainians, particularly communists and factory bosses, seek a return to pre-independence relations where orders from Russian plants flowed in. They are strongly criticised by Mr Mikhailchenko for not understanding 'that Russia is just not the same it was two years ago - you can't just recreate the old connections now'. President Kravchuk offers an even vaguer platform of simply 'developing Ukraine's socially-oriented economy', but observers do not regard his record as encouraging. Only last week he called for the indexation of savings, a move which would cost Ukraine about Dollars 22bn, and parliament approved a new wave of pre-election credits costing the state the equivalent of another Dollars 444m. Last winter the government tightened monetary policy and managed to reduce inflation from 90 per cent monthly last December to only 5.2 per cent last month. But the political fallout from the credit squeeze was too much to bear and Kiev loosened the monetary screws in early spring. In April alone the money supply grew 60 per cent. With the desire to bail out ailing state enterprises winning out over the battle against inflation, most observers believe that the next president is likely to inherit a resurgence of inflation by the end of the summer and a host of other problems which the campaign has not addressed.

0,FT943-2583 ,"FT943-2583 _AN-EISF8AA4FT 940919   FT  19 SEP 94 / Cuba acts to end chronic food shortfall      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   Cuba, moving to resolve chronic food shortages which have caused discontent among its population, will soon introduce markets where state farms and individual farmers will be able to sell excess produce after fulfilling established government production quotas. The weekend announcement of the change in policy was made by Cuban defence minister General Raul Castro, brother of President Fidel Castro and the number two in the ruling Cuban communist party hierarchy. The announcement signalled another step in Cuba's cautious moves to introduce limited market reforms to its centrally run state economy. The changes are expected to follow the lines of similar farm reforms already introduced by China and Vietnam. Gen Castro said solving the food crisis was a priority for the government. While the agricultural markets would have regulations and taxes, 'supply and demand should basically operate', said Gen Castro, saying the government would not involve itself in setting prices. Prices would in any case be much lower than those existing on the black market, he said. The production of food, especially staples like meat, rice, beans, fruit and vegetables, has been a particular black spot in the Cuban economy since the collapse after 1990 of trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc. Starved of inputs like fertilisers, herbicides and tractor spares, farm production, including strategic sugar exports, has fallen sharply, a situation made worse by adverse weather. Other factors were inefficiency, wastage of resources and lack of price incentives for farmers obliged to sell exclusively to the state, foreign diplomats said. Popular pressure had grown for the liberalisation of food production, but the topic was surrounded by agonised ideological debate at the highest levels of the party. In the first half of the 1980s, Cuba introduced a similar experiment with so-called 'peasants' markets' where farmers could sell vegetables, fruit, pork and chicken. But these were shut down after President Castro complained they led to the excessive enrichment of some individuals, especially middlemen who bought and re-sold produce. Raul Castro's announcement was the first public acknowledgement that the farm reforms were imminent, but senior officials said more than 70 markets were already operating experimentally around the island, excluding Havana city. One such 'pilot' market was operating at San Nicolas de Bari in Havana province, where farmers at the weekend directly sold rice, avocado, bananas and yucca (manioc root) to the public. Since the 1960s, small private farmers have made commitments to sell previously agreed upon quantities of produce each year to the government.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

0,FT942-852 ,"FT942-852 _AN-EF0DGAFIFT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (13): Fresh Rbs3,000bn attack on crime - Law and Order      By LEYLA BOULTON   Two bomb attacks on businessmen in Moscow on the same day this month provided a brutal impulse for Russian President Boris Yeltsin to declare all-out war on organised crime. In broad daylight, right outside Paveletsky railway station, the driver of the chief of Logovaz, a big car-dealing company, had his head blown off although his boss, Mr Boris Berezovsky, escaped unscathed. The other intended victim, the manager of a smaller company, was less fortunate: a car-bomb earlier in the day cost him his leg. A few days later, on June 10, President Yeltsin announced he had ordered the security services to 'cleanse Russia of criminal filth'. The interior minister, prosecutor-general, and head of the domestic intelligence service promptly unveiled a new Rbs3,000bn programme to fight crime. Mr Yeltsin said they would be held personally responsible for its success in beating back criminal forces who were trying to 'seize control of the economy and push their way into politics'. He followed this up in mid-June with a presidential decree giving security forces unprecedented powers to fight organised crime, including the right to detain suspects without charge for 30 days and the right to search the premises and bank accounts of any company suspected of illegal dealings. The measures were promptly denounced as unconstitutional by parliament and the liberal media, which warned of a possible return to to Russia's more repressive past. Given an overwhelming public longing for law and order, a successful crackdown could prove the greatest vote-spinner for a government unlikely to deliver quick results on economic reform. But criminals' close links to corrupt police and officials provide the strongest reason to doubt the likelihood of a successful campaign against Russia's so-called 'mafia'. The word 'mafia' is widely used in Russia to mean anything from organised crime to extortion by officials seeking bribes. The crime problem is unique because of its intimate connections to an inherently corrupt economy and bureaucracy inherited from the Communist era. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, a renowned Russian economist and presidential hopeful, argues that the old state-run Soviet economy was designed for lawlessness. He says its vestiges - such as a reliance on personal patronage, excessive discretionary powers for bureaucrats, and a very high degree of monopoly in the economy - need to be dismantled if there is any chance of making inroads against crime and racketeering. How dangerous is Russia today? In term of statistics for ordinary crime, a big city such as St Petersburg is no more dangerous than the more crime-ridden cities of Europe, and is safer than New York or Washington. Major-General Arkady Kramariev, the St Petersburg police chief, says that the higher levels of crime in Russia's second city - 845 murders last year compared to 150 a decade ago - correspond more closely to a free market economy than previous low levels prevailing under the old police state. The difference between Russia and the west is that police who are underpaid, uninsured and demoralised are unlikely to do much to solve crimes. Much of the violence can be blamed on an antiquated legal system's inability to meet the requirements of a market economy. Because the courts take so long to solve commercial disputes, Maj-Gen Kramariev says that 'Judge Kalashnikov' remains the most reliable way to recover debts. This is true of any sphere of activity in Russia. But banking, as one of the most profitable businesses in an ailing economy, provides a useful starting-point for exploring organised crime's involvement in the economy. More than a dozen bankers have been gunned down in contract killings over the past couple of years but not one of these crimes has been solved. The victims were believed to have rejected extortion attempts or to have become too deeply involved with unsavoury customers. Given that Russia has no guidelines on money laundering, it is not surprising that Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, admits that 'any banks may have customers related to illegal, underworld activities'. Mr Tulin, in charge of banking supervision and restructuring, categorically rejects, together with other Russian officials and bankers, some of the more far-fetched western speculation that the entire banking sector is run by the mafia. But while top bankers usually have the means to protect themselves - Mr Vladimir Gussinsky, chairman of Most-Bank, says his construction and banking group has a security force of 650 men - many smaller businesses have no choice but to pay up and shut up. The same differences apply to foreign companies. Big multinationals which are beginning to invest in Russia and do not operate small cash-based businesses are unlikely to do deals with the mafia. But smaller outfits, such as new foreign restaurants in Moscow, or retail outfits, are asked to pay protection money, and often do. Fears are often expressed that organised crime and extortion are stifling economic reforms and growth. While these problems do discourage many newcomers, the hardier entrepreneurs have simply adjusted to a business climate in which most participants find they have to break the law in one way or another in order to prosper. In this context, many businessmen complain that the mafia is less of a problem than the corrupt bureaucracy or over-burdensome taxation. Mr Sergei Klementiev, a private farmer with a small farm and entrepreneur in the province of Nizhny-Novgorod, is doing exactly what bold agricultural reforms in the province are designed to achieve. He is challenging the state trading and food-processing monopolies by taking milk directly to town to sell it more cheaply to consumers. But he says he also has to pay protection money to 'small-time crooks' who otherwise threaten to damage his retail stall. However, he says paying protection money to the same people on a regular basis is the least of his problems, in so far as 'nobody else comes and asks for money'. Without even bothering to go to the police, he is far more concerned that the government should lessen taxation on his businesses. Perhaps the main victim of organised crime is public opinion, which widely perceives market reforms as giving greater freedom to the 'mafia' while impoverishing the quality of their lives. It is for this reason, if only to fend off the coming-to-power of more ruthless extremists who promise summary executions and plan dictatorship, that Russia must hope President Yeltsin can toe a fine line between restoring order and returning to the arbitrary rule of the communist past.

This four-star hotel,  operated by the German firm LTI, is a highly successful venture.  Its average occupancy is 92.2 percent during peak season. It has  233 rooms with ocean views right on the beach. It also has  atmosphere: Tourists are greeted by a stone Aztec calendar as  they walk into the lobby, which is decorated with borders and  figurines made out of precious woods, reproductions of  archeological pieces. Its discotheque, ""La Bamba,"" is famous  because, in the interest of ""providing atmosphere,"" it does not  prevent local Cubans from gaining admittance.    Bufete Industrial designed this hotel in the Mexican style  of  architecture, but all of the construction was done by Cubans. As  with other hotels, the government offered 50 percent of the  shares for sale. In May 1992, the DSC group of Guadalajara, led  at that time by Jose Giral (former director of the Xabre group),  bought the stock. Indecision about how the purchase would be  carried out resulted in delays, however. In 1993, it was agreed  that it would be done by means of swaps. The amount of the  investment was $15 million.    The second project was the El Mariel cement plant, located  in  the port of the same name, 20 kilometers from Havana. It is the  largest of the six cement factories on the island. After the  demise of the Soviet Union and the European Socialist bloc, they  were left without raw materials, and no one had the money to buy  them. According to a study by Donna Rich and Michel Kaplowitz of  Johns Hopkins University, these plants have the potential to  produce 5,500 tons of cement a year.    Lorenzo Zambrano, the majority shareholder in Cemex, came to  the rescue. He formed a joint venture with the Cuban Cement  Union for a total investment of $80 million. Cuba provided half  of that amount in the form of the facilities; $20 million took  the form of swaps, and $20 million was in fresh money from the  Mexican Foreign Trade Bank. Cemex is marketing the cement on the  international market.    The third project, in the petroleum sector, was announced by  Mexico's ambassador to Cuba, Carlos Tello Macias, in a sidewalk  interview at the end of a ceremony in Cuba commemorating the  birthday of Benito Juarez last 21 March.    ""I do not know the technical details,"" said the ambassador,  ""but I understand that Mexpetrol and a Cuban company will work  together to rehabilitate and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos.  They will process Mexican crude oil and other products there.""    The Cienfuegos refinery, located in the southern part of the  island, has the capacity to process 3 million tons of crude a  year, according to data supplied by the Cupet company of Cuba.  At present it is partially shut down because Cuba does not have  any petroleum or any money to buy it. Moreover, the plant was  built with Soviet technology and needs renovation.    According to sources close to the negotiations, Mexpetrol  (of  which Pemex is the majority shareholder) and Cupet of Cuba  signed a ""letter of intent"" and will sign the agreement in two  months. The investment amounts to $200 million, $100 million  from Cupec in the form of the facilities, and $100 million from  the Mexican side, as follows: $50 million in swaps, with stock  in the refinery itself, and $50 million in fresh money.    Although Mexpetrol is heading up the negotiations for the  Mexican side, the Mexican Petroleum Institute (which will  provide the scientific studies) and the private construction  firms ICA and Protexa are also involved. Bancomext will provide  the credit.    This new Cuban-Mexican firm will pay for the credit in cash,  but there is also the possibility that it may make some payments  in refined Mexican crude.    Cienfuegos has one advantage in refining petrochemicals and  by-products: It is directly connected to a supertanker base in  the port of Matanzas, in the western part of the island, by a  187-kilometer pipeline.    IUSA vs. Telmex    These three investments mark the beginning of Mexico's swaps  in Cuba. Other Mexicans are apparently looking for similar  opportunities.    In the case of IUSA, owned by Alejo Peralta, his son Carlos  Peralta offered the Cuban Government an investment project to  modernize the island's telephone system. The current system is  in a state of deterioration, and has 1950's-era technology. His  idea was to bring in satellite communication systems for  international and local calling.    As a prelude, he donated to Castro's government two rural  phone systems valued at $300,000 each. They are now in use in  the Provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana to link up various  agricultural camps.    The younger Peralta's representative in Cuba was Manuel  Cerrillo, who negotiated an investment project amounting to more  than $1 billion, 25 percent in swaps. The deal involved paying  approximately $200 million, equivalent to two-thirds of Cuba's  current debt to Mexico. Thus, it was the biggest investment  project between the two countries. A ""protocol agreement"" was  even signed.    Suddenly, to the Cubans' surprise, Carlos Peralta said  nevermind. He argued that his envoy, Cerrillo, had gone beyond  the authorized limitations in the negotiations and had signed on  to terms that Peralta had not agreed to. Havana officials were  surprised and irritated. It was revealed, however, that the  investment is not a lost cause, and there is hope that an  agreement can be reached.    In response, Carlos Slim, majority shareholder in Telmex,  stepped into the fray. He also submitted a proposal to modernize  the Cuban telephone system, and during the first week in March  he came to Havana to negotiate a deal.    Slim and Peralta are not the only ones vying to win this  contract from the Cuban Government. Several Spanish and English  firms and a Canadian one are also hoping for a nod from Castro's  government. Castro has formed a special group to study the  proposals.    For the time being, only two other Mexican businessmen have  made direct investments on the island: Luis Nino de Rivera, in a  cellular telephone system that he has operated in Havana and  Varadero for two years; and Monterrey businessmen Mauricio  Fernandez and Danny Tafich, who made a joint investment with the  Castro regime to breathe life into 15 Cuban textile plants that  had been practically idled for lack of capital and inputs.    Other companies have announced investment projects, but  nothing has come to pass yet. One example is Infra, which  belongs to Vicente Gutierrez Camposeco, former president of the  National Association of Manufacturers (Canacintra), and which  tried to set up a plant to produce solder. Another is Bancomer,  which talked about introducing credit cards to Cuba and offering  other banking services. Other examples are the Vitro group,  which tried to build a plant to produce glass and plastic  containers; and Bufete Industrial, which intended to participate  in the construction of the Villa Cuba Hotel in Varadero.    Mexico: Most Favored Nation    ""Mexico is the most favored nation,"" stated Ernesto  Melendez,  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation  (CECE), last year during a meeting with businessmen in London.  ""But,"" he added, ""the investment is still at a low level,  considering the two countries' potential.""    So far, most Mexican businessmen have confined themselves to  the commerce sector. Some 200 companies of various sizes and  product lines are exporting everything from canned food to  intermediate manufactured goods to Cuba. The volume is small,  however. They do not account for as much as 5 percent of Cuba's  imports. Trade between the two countries reached $125 million in  1992. This is such a tiny proportion of Mexico's exports that  Cuba does not appear in its annual statistical reports on  foreign trade.    ""We must be more aggressive about participating in trade  (with Cuba) so as not to be edged out by other countries,""  asserted Gutierrez Camposeco in October, when he was still  president of Canacintra, in a lengthy interview with the Mexican  business magazine EXPANSION.    But Mexican businessmen appear timid and slow to act. ""Many  national goods that are sold on the Cuban market are not brought  in by Mexican firms, but by Spanish ones. In other words, the  Spaniards are eating our lunch in Cuba, and with our own  products,"" said Carlos Sanchez Lara, then Mexico's commercial  attache in Cuba, in June of last year to a delegation of 15  businessmen who had come to the island to look into the  possibilities for joint ventures.    ""We cannot allow that to continue,"" he declared  emphatically.    Furthermore, ""Mexico is squandering investment and trade  opportunities in Cuba because it is not up to date on that  market, and it has failed to take into account the very  favorable objective conditions: geographic proximity, stable  economic and political ties, common cultures, favorable  market....""    In the Cuban business world, Mexicans have gained a  reputation for ""always saying yes, but not saying when.""    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina acknowledged in February  that commercial relations with Mexico ""are not as intensive as  we would like. Mexico knows this,"" he stated, ""and we regret  it."" He admitted that the economic ties are not commensurate  with the political relations the two countries have maintained,  and he expressed the hope that the situation would change as the  Cuban economy opens up more and more to foreign capital.    On 21 March of this year, Ambassador Carlos Tello stated  that  commercial ties between the two countries ""are growing, and I  have been instructed to maintain them, strengthen them, and  expand them.""    As if to dispel any doubts, he added: ""There will be fresh  money, financing, and investment.""     "

The end of the ""cold war"" minimized the importance of  military potential as a factor determining a country's position  in the international arena and assigned priority to indicators  of economic, scientific-technical, and financial strength. As a  result, Russia, which had been the United States' equal as a  leader in world development and which had essentially determined  the course of this development in conjunction with the United  States, turned into one of the large but economically weak  states with claims to only a ""secondary role.""    The collapse of the USSR, the severe economic crisis in  Russia, and the uncertainty of emergence from it made our state  even more vulnerable in world politics and international  economic relations. Members of the U.S. military-political,  business, and scientific communities, however, know that Russia  still has significant economic and scientific-technical  potential in addition to nuclear strength and political  influence. If the reforms are successful, this could turn it  into one of the United States' principal competitors in the  international arena and the world market, particularly in  several advanced fields. This is one of the main factors  motivating the United States to become actively involved in the  reform of the Russian economy according to guidelines convenient  for the United States.    Freedom of Choice?    One of the main elements of the present U.S. policy on  Russia  is the encouragement of the Russian Government to choose  patterns of economic reform meeting the long-term economic and  political interests of the West. In this context, the United  States was instrumental in imposing the IMF stabilization  program on Russia. This program has obvious foreign economic  goals in addition to internal economic objectives. The  experience of other states with comparable programs proves that  their main results are ""favorable"" economic conditions for the  servicing of foreign debts and the rapid growth of energy and  raw material exports, which have always been convenient for the  United States and the other leading nations that are the largest  creditors and consumers of fuel and raw materials.    The results of Russian economic development since 1992 prove  conclusively that the United States and other leading Western  nations managed to create the necessary conditions for Russia's  integration in the world economy as a country specializing in  the export of fuel and raw materials and of finished goods  requiring only the slightest processing. Serious negative  tendencies of a structural nature, resulting from the IMF  stabilization program, are already apparent in the Russian  national economy. One of these tendencies is the ""weight gain""  of the Russian economy, in which the processing industries'  share of physical production had already decreased to 64.5  percent in the first half of 1993 in comparison to 65.6 percent  in 1992 and 67.9 percent in 1991. This was accompanied by the  noticeable growth of the fuel and raw material sector, which  accounted for 25 percent of physical production in 1993 in  comparison to 11.3 percent in 1991.    Besides this, the accelerated decline of industrial  production as a result of the ""shock therapy"" also made  additional fuel and raw materials available for export, which  more than compensated for the reduction of output in various  industries. When aluminum production in Russia decreased by 8  percent in 1990-1993, for example, its domestic consumption was  reduced by a factor of almost 2.2, which allowed for a more than  3.7-fold increase in exports of this metal. Exports of crude oil  from Russia increased by more than 20 percent just in 1993, in  spite of the 6-percent reduction in output. As a result, exports  of fuel and raw materials already exceed 80 percent of the  Russian total.    The expansion of Russian exports of fuel and raw materials  to  the world market is in the long-term and short-term interests of  the United States and other developed Western countries. Russian  shipments in recent years were the main factor destabilizing  these markets and lowering prices. The index of world prices of  nonferrous metals, for example, had reached its lowest level in  the last eight years by the end of 1993--40 percent below the  1990 indicator. Comparable tendencies were apparent in the  markets for energy resources. These price dynamics are extremely  convenient for the industrially developed countries, stimulating  their economies and helping them surmount economic difficulties  of a cyclical nature.    Welcome, or Off-Limits to Outsiders    The United States' attempts to accomplish the Russian  economy's integration in the world economy as a fuel and raw  material appendage of the industrially developed nations are  also evident from the development of trade and economic  relations between the two countries. Raw materials are clearly  prevalent, for example, in Russian exports to the United States:  The overwhelming majority of export shipments to the American  market consist of nonferrous metals (aluminum, nickel, zinc,  copper, and others), metals of the platinum group, silver and  precious stones, petroleum and petroleum products, inorganic  chemicals, and fertilizers. Russian fuel and raw materials have  been of the greatest interest to American private businessmen,  who invested around 400 million dollars in Russia in 1993. It is  no coincidence that the biggest project will entail a consortium  of U.S. oil and gas companies investing a total of 3.4 billion  dollars in the exploration and development of new oil and gas  deposits in West Siberia and on the shelf of Sakhalin Island.    All of this has been accompanied by U.S. attempts to crowd  Russian exporters out of traditional markets and to keep Russia  out of the world markets in which it could compete, particularly  the markets for high-tech goods.    In the last seven years Russia's share of world arms exports  decreased from 38 to 17 percent, while the United States managed  to increase its share from 30 to 58 percent. In the last two  years alone, the United States almost doubled its own arms  exports. Meanwhile, the United States, which has a monopoly in  the world market for space services, is constantly spreading  rumors about Russian dumping in this field, although this  industry is no longer subsidized by the state in Russia, and the  low overhead costs of production are due to effective technology  and cheap manpower. A similar situation is taking shape in the  world uranium market, where Russian shipments still account for  only 4 percent of the total, although the Russian output  represents around 25 percent of the world total.    Furthermore, the United States is in no hurry to make any  cardinal improvements in the trade and economic status of  Russian goods. Most-favored-nation status in trade was extended  to Russia for only one year, the Jackson-Vanik amendment is  still in effect, and anti-monopoly legislation is still being  applied vigorously to Russian goods.    Integration processes on the North American continent are  having an increasing effect on the development of foreign  economic relations between the two countries. The more active  recent steps to form a North American free trade zone (NAFTA)  created even more difficulties for Russian goods in American  markets. The sale of Russian motor vehicles in the United States  with minimal customs duties, for example, would require  two-thirds of the components to be produced in the NAFTA states.  There are even more serious restrictions on textiles. The  exporter of Russian linen fabrics to the United States has to  prove that the goods have no analogues in the North American  countries. The perceptible relaxation of CoCom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Control] controls on exports  of several high-technology goods to Russia was dictated  primarily by competition in the world market. The findings of a  study by the U.S. Department of Commerce, in particular,  indicated that existing restrictions were ineffective because  high-power computers could be obtained in the world market in  circumvention of all controls. According to statements by  American officials, the liberalization of computer exports will  enhance the competitiveness of American companies substantially  without hurting U.S. national security.    In spite of Russia's increasingly severe socioeconomic  difficulties, most of the West's financial aid is being extended  in the form of comparatively expensive credits from  international financial institutions, and not in the form of the  nonrefundable aid that was extended to, for example, Japan and  Germany during their periods of economic reform in the 1940s and  1950s. This provides more evidence that the West has no  intention, or even the potential, to offer Russia sweeping  economic assistance comparable to the famous Marshall Plan (the  American aid in the restoration of the postwar economy of  Western Europe), which would amount to 60-75 billion dollars in  today's prices.    The `Triangle' Will Not Become a `Square'    This approach to the Russian reforms is a reflection of the  way in which the United States and other Western powers see the  new balance of power in the world economy and international  relations after the end of the ""cold war."" At present there is  an obvious tendency toward more vigorous efforts by the leading  Western countries to set up an effective system for the  collective regulation of world economic processes and  international relations, which should be based on the three  ""poles"" of economic strength--the United States, the European  Union, and Japan, which account for around two-thirds of the  world GDP. As Director F. Bergsten of the distinguished  Institute of the World Economy remarked in this context, the  ""big three"" should begin acting like an unofficial managing  committee of the world economy. Under these conditions, Russia's  many attempts to become an equal member of the group of leading  Western countries for the collective resolution of global  problems will not win any support. We must not forget that the  harsh laws of competition were always at work in the world  economy and international politics, and there was always the  determination to secure national interests, frequently by  infringing the national interests of others....

0,FT941-4051 ,"FT941-4051 _AN-ECMANAEZFT 940312   FT  12 MAR 94 / Food and Drink: Hey, hey listen to the band - Nicholas Lander feeds on music during a short visit to Cuba      By NICHOLAS LANDER   A 45-minute journey along the road east of Havana brings you to the struggling oil wells that litter this coast. It also brings you to one of the most enjoyable restaurants in Cuba. It is called El C--a-el. It is not a desire to conceal professional secrets which prevents me revealing its full name. It is more simple than that: the missing letters have fallen off and, like so much else in Cuba, cannot be replaced because of lack of cash. Business in these restaurants is not too good for the same reason. When we lunched there one weekday, only one other table was occupied in a room that could seat 70. Nevertheless, a seven-piece Cuban band was warming up and they greeted us with huge smiles and waves. The waitress, also delighted to see us, handed over a large red menu, in Spanish and English, with about 30 items on it. No sooner had we sat down and chosen our fare than the waitress said that, unfortunately, there was no gas for the kitchen stoves and all the cooked items were off. Would we like a sandwich instead? We had no option - even though we already knew that the range of sandwiches on offer in Cuba is limited to ham and cheese or cheese and ham. The band comprised three guitars, a double bass, bongo drums, maracas, andolave and a singer who announced 'traditional Cuban song' before each number. They played with all their heart and soul and within minutes I had forgotten the unpleasant smell of oil from the wells on the shore, the cloudy weather and that I was eating another ham and cheese sandwich. Suddenly, I started enjoying the meal. In Cuba live music is not just an integral part of every meal but also almost the best value on any menu. We gave the band members Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.50) and they went away even happier. Our 12 sandwiches and beers cost twice that. And however tough the sandwiches, they were certainly more enjoyable than any meal in the restaurants of hotels such as the Nacional in Havana or the Melia in Varadero, where so little respect is paid to Cuban culinary tradition that you could close your eyes and imagine you were in any hotel anywhere in the world. Invariably, the two best items on offer are Cuban ice-cream and papaya. The fruit has been crossed with the Spanish 'mamey', a tree that takes 17 years to produce its first crop. It is deep red, slightly putrid, but wonderful. An indication of how disappointing hotel restaurants are came last year when, as the Cuban economy was being opened up to private enterprise, many Cubans turned their houses into restaurants and began to entertain fellow citizens and tourists to delicious home-cooked meals in return for US dollars. These enterprises, known as paladares, became instantly popular, with one man reputedly clearing more than Dollars 1,000 a week. The hotels retaliated, unfortunately not by raising standards, but by complaining to the government which, sadly, closed larger premises. Like so many other tourists, I went initially to La Bodeguita del Medio in old Havana for a mojito, just one of the drinks Ernest Hemingway made famous while living in a nearby hotel. The ingredients are ice, sugar, lime, three-year-old white rum, mint leaves and soda water. The restaurant behind the bar served Cuban food at tourist prices. The traditional moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians - white rice and black beans), roast pork and black bean soup was served along with the most innovative dish, deep fried sweet potato. Dinner was Dollars 40 for two - not including the music. At 9.30pm two guitarists swept in and sang as though we were a room of impresarios. For a final mojito in old Havana I went to sit on the terrace of El Patio looking on to the faded grandeur of Havana's cathedral. The sky was blue, the wind blowing in off the sea and, naturally, a four-piece band was playing. Until they heard the competition, that is. Across the small square another band had set up and, with the aid of amplifiers, filled the square with music. Discretion overcame pride and the four musicians I had noticed earlier had put down their instruments and were standing in the audience. Cuba may not thrill gastronomically, but it does provide the most exciting music I have ever eaten to.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P7999 Amusement and Recreation, NEC.

Gaydar:  because only 50 percent of the 1990 economic potential remained  intact there. It is necessary to change priorities and period  keep key sectors of industry under government jurisdiction  during the transition,""    --thinks the chairman of the economics committee of the  Democratic Party of Russia, Vladimir Leytland. Our correspondent  speaks with him.    [Badov] In everyday terms the evaluation of the crisis  differs depending on the position of the person doing the  evaluating--who has been burned and who has kept warm. In this  sense, as far as I know, your view of the economic barometer is  ""three dimensional""--as an industrialist in the post of  president of the Siberian Highway Corporation, a banker as the  representative of the board of the Narkombank, and as a  politician who heads up the economics committee of the  Democratic Party of Russia.    [Leytland] No matter which side you look from, there is  nothing to make you feel better. The ""Chicago model"" turned out  to be utter quack medicine for our sick economy and it must be  replaced before it is too late.    [Badov] Many see the defeat of the Gaydar bloc as a sign of  public rejection of the monetarist model of reform. Since  Gaydar's resignation, those who took his rhetoric at face value  are grieving over the notion that Russia is about to be knocked  off the bright path of economic liberalism. And right at a time  when the most unfavorable, ""shock"" part of the reform is behind  us. But the economic program of the Democratic Party of Russia,  in which you along with Glazyev and Bogomolov also had a hand,  not only denies the correctness of the path chosen by Gaydar and  his followers in government but also raises doubts about whether  these reforms were actually liberal in nature: ""Today instead of  a market with free competition, a semi-feudal market is being  formed."" Is this not a polemical exaggeration?    [Leytland] I do not see any exaggeration. During the course  of what was called liberal reform the mechanisms the suppress  competition became even stronger. While in terms of degree of  ""liberalization"" of the economy we outdid developed capitalist  countries. What kind of paradox is this? But the dirty trick is  that this present ""free will""--freedom from state  regulation--has been absurdly ""augmented"" with freedom from  responsibility for the means and results of economic activity.  And the first victims of these economic machinations were the  consumers and small enterprises. An oligarchy is appearing which  is suppressing competition and advancing the interests of  society, which include the demand for efficiency. Incentives for  productive activity are simply disappearing.    [Badov] The old bureaucratic command system tied the hands  of  people with entrepreneurial inclinations but it was unable to  close its eyes to their self-will. The imperative for economic  growth held sway over bureaucrats from the Gosplan [State  Planning Commission] and also local party bosses. One gets the  impression that the present authorities have no such imperative.    [Leytland] Perhaps not. Two years of life according to a  monetarist calendar have led to a degradation of the economy  that it would have been difficult to imagine. We industrialists  and entrepreneurs, who in words have been given our ""freedom,""  have ended up in traps stronger than those of the nomenklatura--  financial and doctrinaire ones, but with the opposite sign.  Remember the discussions of Bukharin and Larin from 1918 and  their furious attack on ""bourgeois"" commodity production. It is  as though this historical scene has returned again: There is the  same restraint and ""righteousness,"" but with a switching of the  poles. And the same indifference to the price they pay to get  what they want. They have thrown the works of the Putilovs and  Ryabushkins on the bonfire--the potential of the second largest  economy in the world.    We had ruined everything with our reforms when the national  economy began to go on the auction block and the best capital  and resources were being used to pay for debts and forfeitures.  Does the fact that foreign investors have actually invested a  paltry $180 million in Tyumen oil and gas not tell you anything?  In my times as leader of the trust in Samotlor we assimilated  comparable sums with a large trust in one season.    Foreign investors are bypassing Russia. It is not only  political instability that is to blame for this. It is simply  that they see that our economy is failing and more and more  appreciably oligarchic tendencies are coming forth to control  it. Western entrepreneurs and bankers are surprised at how  ""democratic"" we are. They give us to understand in an open  exchange of opinions that this is good, that the Russians have  finally recognized the advantages of a market economy, but in  our enthusiasm for renouncing communism, why should we let the  economy slide downhill?    Not one of the former socialist countries has had such  pathetic results. Go through the Western supermarkets. They are  crammed with high-quality clothing from the Chinese provinces,  Singapore, and even Bangladesh, where people live in shacks like  during Kipling's times. But you will not see Russian goods of  export quality next to them on the shelf: They simply are not  produced. There is a true sign that Russia does not have healthy  business activity.    Light industry has dropped the production of more than half  of its goods. And the most rapid turnover of capital is here.  Instead of this the stores and shops throughout Russia are  filled with discarded imported goods of mediocre quality. And  the burgeoning network of shops will soon begin to fail because  of the decline of consumer demand. But all that is trivial  compared to the closing of mines, shops, and institutes....    Only 57 percent of our 1990 economic potential has remained  intact. And the decline of production has accelerated sharply in  recent times. Essentially we are experiencing not the costs of  reform but economic disaster. True, there are still enthusiasts  whose heads have not been cleared even by the cold breeze of the  elections to the Duma, and they are calling for making the  policy more radical. They are inciting the government to  ""accelerate"" the reforms even more. As in the tragic plot from  the ""Golden Calf,"" these radicals are prepared to saw even more  weights in two. ""But what if suddenly the weights are not made  of gold?"" The people who were about to accept the radicals'  promises on faith are worried. But in response they hear the  sacramental: ""Saw, Shura, saw."" The pragmatic wing in the  government were hanging onto the coattails of the ""monetarists""  even before. Let us just recall the practical and businesslike  steps of Chernomyrdin and Soskovets and the demarches of Lobov  and Zaveryukha. Realists and pragmatists have long been aware  that the dough being mixed by the ""monetarists"" will never  rise....    Thanks to the pragmatists in all stages the economy is still  functioning somehow and the infrastructures are still whole. The  government has undertaken a number of protectionist measures to  protect the national producer. But it is too early to get our  hopes up. In terms of many indicators, the crisis, I repeat, has  entered a destructive phase.    [Badov] Let us sum up a certain outcome from the Russian  version of ""shock therapy."" Is it true, as inveterate optimists  assert, that the critical phase of the crisis of the economy is  behind us and the forces of market self-regulation will rectify  the situation themselves?    [Leytland] In January 1992 the ""government of intellectuals""  ventured to refrain from state regulation of economic processes,  concentrating on macroeconomic policy. So that the market could  start to function and money would become the ""commodity of  commodities,"" a simple gentlemen's ""collection"" was  proposed--achieving a deficit-free budget, stiffening credit  policy, and restricting the money supply. The result was the  opposite of what was expected: There was sharp decline of  production, high inflation, a growing threat of collapse of the  state sector, and ineffectiveness of the weak private sector.  There was an increased tendency toward deindustrialization of  the national economy with a real prospect of turning Russia into  a cheap market for raw material and work force for highly  developed countries.    [Badov] But there are also signs that the course is being  adjusted.    [Leytland] The failure of the policy of macro-stabilization  forced the government to take the reigns but, in the big  picture, the course that was selected has not changed: from  liberalization of prices--to demonopolization. Still it seems to  me that we must take the opposite path, that is, to  liberalization through the creation of competition.    The real condition of the economy, the extreme level of its  monopolization, and the ""difficult"" structure as well as the  lack of an effective competitive environment make it necessary  to change economic priorities. The potential base for the new  economic policy would be the consumer sector defining and not  backward development of it--only it is capable of restoring  material incentives for labor and accumulation, which will move  the investment process off the mark.    Next I want to say something that will cause general  indignation among the radicals: During the transition period we  must keep the key sectors of industry, the most important ones  for the survival of the entire economy, under state control,  consistently creating along with this a nonmonopolized, nonstate  sector.    [Badov] Do you really consider it possible to put up with  monopolies for a certain amount of time?    [Leytland] The monopolies have not gone anywhere. The  problem  is that all at once, in one fell swoop, we gained a decaying  market where the monopolists, left uncurbed by the state,  grabbed us by the throat, establishing arbitrary prices and  decontrolling production volumes. A change in the form of  ownership is frequently not accompanied by the elimination of  monopolies. In order to escape the vicious circle it is  necessary to use the as yet unforfeited ability of the  monopolized sector to stabilize and maintain the level of  industrial production.    Further, through state regulation it is necessary to change  price ratios in the economy in favor of the nonmonopolized  sector. Such a system of shifting relative prices will make it  possible to stimulate rapid development of small and  medium-sized entrepreneurship and to set the mechanism of  competition in motion. It is necessary to restore the national  market as well. The most important thing for Russia is still a  market within the boundaries of the CIS countries. I consider  the deepening tendency toward isolation of national markets to  be unpromising and dangerous.    [Badov] And what about inflation?    [Leytland] There is no miraculous means of curbing inflation  as long as the factors encouraging it are in play. I would  include among them the government's eagerness to raise prices of  energy sources and raw material to the world level while the  exchange rate of the ruble is declining and monopolized large  sectors of the economy are uncontrolled, and money is being  printed in ""waves.""    The only real ways of fighting inflation are at the micro  level. Such a deep and steady depression throughout the entire  front of the economy as we have today cannot be surmounted with  ordinary market methods. I think that in very short periods of  time the industrialists, trade unions, and government should  conclude a General Agreement on Wages, Prices, Profit, and  Capital Investments. After this, officially regulated prices can  be legally documented as maximum prices.    There is an urgent need for indexation of the assets of the  enterprises. We need an official monthly price indexation based  on the balance of the industrial and product ""baskets,"" with  priority for agricultural products. Finally, we must take steps  to abolish the value added tax in both construction and  agriculture.    [Badov] So you do not share the favorite idea of the  monetarists about a ""deficit-free budget at any price....""    [Leytland] A budget with a zero deficit under conditions  where only half of the pre-perestroyka national income is left  and you cannot knock very much off state expenses is a utopia.  The main measures in the area of finance and credit should be  aimed at surmounting the crisis and stimulating production and  business activity, which will produce added national income and  hence more for the budget.    The resignation of the ""architect of the reform,"" Gaydar,  seems to have marked the end of past illusions and seductions.  We have all emerged from a situation where freedom of  entrepreneurship was suppressed and denied. To use the apt  comparison of our great compatriot and Nobel prize winner  Vasiliy Leontyev, we were trying ""to teach penguins to fly"" just  like that. Neither ""penguins"" nor ""storm petrels"" will replace  the pragmatists if we really do not want to create an efficient  economy where everyone pays his own bills.     "

The governor of the central bank for Belarus, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, dissociated himself from the treaty signed between Russian and Belarus two weeks ago aimed at creating an economic union so close as to deprive the smaller Slav state of any economic independence. He said that the vote expected on the agreement in the Belarus parliament on Wednesday would not approve the deal, though he said the government might then put the issue out to a referendum. Speaking to a conference on central banking in the former communist states, at Chicago Law School's Centre for the Study of Constitutionalism in eastern Europe, Mr Bogdankevich said: 'Belarus will not benefit from tying itself into a common monetary and credit system with other republics and even with Russia. 'The levels of economic development and their individual specialisations differ greatly and they are solving their problems with incompatible methods.' In an interview, Mr Bogdankevich said that he had signed the agreement - a landmark treaty between two former Soviet states and one widely seen in Russia as a harbinger of similar pacts with other CIS states - with the reservation that it broke Belarus' constitution, a major reservation, as he agreed. 'I am sure that the vote on this agreement will not pass in the parliament,' he said. No representative of the Russian central bank attended the conference, but Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy prime minister for finance and present leader of the reformist Liberal Democratic Union in the Russian parliament, said that the three-quarters majority necessary to ratify the agreement in the parliament was also not available. 'Nobody can explain what Russia gains from this deal,' he said. Mr Fyodorov also claimed that the International Monetary Fund had not been informed about the agreement, which - because it changes the Belarus population's cash holdings in the Belarus coupon with the Russian rouble at the rate of one to one while the market exchange rate is 10 to 1 - will boost inflation in Russia at least in the short term. Questions were raised about this at the IMF board meeting last week which discussed the granting of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan to Russia, but the loan was approved in spite of the disquiet. Senior officials from Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the other two republics closest to Russia both politically and in the sense of having large ethnic Russian populations, resolutely rejected a closer economic union with Russia, while acknowledging the need for an efficient and transparent payments union. Mr Victor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian national bank chairman, said in an interview that 'there is a political mood in Ukraine that everything was better five years ago and therefore we need to seek some sort of unity with Russia. It's Utopia - Russian interests are quite different from ours.' In his conference speech, Mr Yushchenko said that 'we should not regret leaving the rouble zone - and it is not the issue of the day. Those politicians who want to join it merely want to continue receiving cheap raw materials and cheap credits.' Mr Grigory Marchenko, the deputy governor designate of the national bank of Kazakhstan, told the conference: 'I believe the rouble zone is unworkable. For far too many people it is an evasion from the major task of creating a viable banking system and a payments system.' All of the central bankers and senior officials saw the provision of external financing by the international financial institutions as the main means of alleviating what is for many of them an increasingly desperate situation. Mr Levon Barkhoudaryan, the finance minister of Armenia, who said the economy was largely dependent on Russia, nevertheless considered the main task of his central bank to be to strengthen the new Armenian currency - the dram. He said: 'Credits from the IMF and the World Bank will play a significant role in promoting the stabilisation of the economy and curtailing the balance of payments deficit.' In many cases the situation seen from the vantage point of the central bank or Finance Ministry is one on the verge of catastrophe. Mr Roman Gotsiridze, who recently resigned as the deputy premier for the economy in Georgia, said that the Georgian coupon was now trading at 500,000 to the dollar - and that 'we will face hunger this year, especially this winter. The economy has already collapsed.' Prof Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor who until January had directed the Macroeconomic Finance Unit attached to the Russian Finance Ministry, told the ministers and the bank governors in an evangelical address that 'to bring yourselves back into the rouble zone, to the Russian military-industrial complex is a disaster for you. Your future is not just with Russia, it is with the whole world.'   Countries:-  BYZ  Belarus, East Europe.     XVZ  Commonwealth of Independent States.     USZ  United States of America.

0,FT932-4130 ,"FT932-4130 _AN-DFJB6AF3FT 930610   FT  10 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's low-grade crystals worry New York traders      By LAURIE MORSE and REUTER      CHICAGO, PARIS   NEW YORK'S Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange, which administers the world's most traded sugar futures contract, is under pressure from the world's biggest refiners to tighten its definition of what is deliverable against its No. 11 raw sugar contract. The controversy, which has been simmering since April, is crucial to traders who have been in the midst of a supply-driven rally following crop disasters in Thailand and Cuba and reduced output from other of the world's major sugar exporters. Unusual market conditions have re-arranged traditional price relationships between raw sugar and other grades. White sugar usually trades at a premium to raw sugar, and so would not be delivered against the New York futures contract. However, as world raw sugar supplies tighten, prices have at times moved above those for low-grade Brazilian white crystals. The Brazilian product is of too low quality to be delivered against the London white sugar market, but technically meets New York's delivery specifications, even though it is not raw sugar. New York sugar traders at one point believed as much as 200,000 tonnes of the Brazilian crystals would be delivered against the expiring July contract. The crystals, according to Mr Peter Hulme, divisional trading director for Tate and Lyle International, are difficult to handle, produce dust that poses safety concerns for warehouses and could meet with import restrictions at some international borders. Now, with July futures well below their high of 13.26 cents a lb, the immediate threat of white crystal deliveries seems to have faded. However, the controversy remains, and Mr Hulme, who says he represents the position of a consortium of sugar refiners, has asked the exchange clearly to exclude the crystals from delivery before the problem arises again. The CSCE's sugar committee met briefly Tuesday to discuss the issue, but did not communicate any findings. The exchange's board was attending a regular meeting yesterday but an official would not say if the sugar delivery issue was on the agenda. French trade house Sucres et Denrees yesterday denied rumors that it sold white sugar to Russia's Prodintorg trade agency in the past few days, reports Reuter from Paris. 'I don't know where these rumours come from. They're false. We haven't signed a deal with Prodintorg recently, but we do sell sugar every day to Russia through private buyers,' said Sucden's co-president, Mr Serge Varsano. Private business with Russia was likely to reach 1m to 1.5m tonnes this year, through small but almost daily sales of 20,000 to 40,000 tonnes, he added.

Mendiandua: ""Cuba: In Search of  Economic Efficiency""]    [Text] Havana, [no date as received] (PL) -- National  economy, efficiency, and profits are the topics most discussed  in Cuban life on the occasion of the opening chapter of the  Workers Assemblies, unprecedented in other democracies, to  search for solutions to the island's economic problems.    These meetings consist of implementing an analysis of the  economy, at all the country's work centers of the respective  enterprises to contribute ideas and initiatives to making them  more productive and efficient.    At these meetings, convened by the Cuban Workers Federation  (CTC) since January, the workers also discussed serious  problems, such as excess money in circulation, equal to more  than $11 billion, and the excessive amount of personnel at a  number of enterprises, a problem which some sources estimate  affects approximately 60 percent of the State-owned enterprises.    Deputies to the National Assembly (parliament) participate  in  the meetings, contribute information to the work centers, and  receive the workers' proposals and initiatives, which they must  take into consideration during debates at the upcoming  extraordinary Assembly session, aimed at adopting measures that  will guide the nation's economic future.    According to CTC sources, this process is called the Workers  Parliament and will be carried out at approximately 80,000 work  centers through 15 March.    The principles that serve as the basis for this measure,  which has no precedent anywhere in the world according to  official Cuban sources, are participative democracy and the  enormous potential of the multiple intelligences involved.    The Cuban economy entered a period of harsh difficulties  following the disappearance of the European socialist bloc and  the disintegration of the Soviet Union, with whom Cuba had  commercial relations that were very beneficial for the island.    The Soviet petroleum supply, amounting to almost all of the  island's consumption, abruptly dropped from 13 million tons per  year to less than 50 percent and the country had to restructure  its foreign trade, which provided 85 percent of the raw  materials to industry and agriculture.    At the end of 1992, another obstacle hampered Havana's  economic plans. The Torricelli Law, ratified in October 1992,  prohibited subsidiaries of U.S. enterprises' in third countries  to trade with the island.    According to studies conducted by specialized U.S. agencies,  trade with Cuba, which reached $500 million with these firms at  one time, was left futureless and the trade embargo tightened.  On 26 July 1993, Cuban authorities announced the adoption of a  series of measures to reactivate the national economy and  reinsert the country into the world economy.    The plan included new incentives for foreign investments to  attract capital, markets, technology, and raw materials.  Additional incentives were granted for visits and the remittance  of funds by Cubans living abroad.    As for the structural aspect of the economy, important  decisions were made, such as the creation of the basic  cooperative production units, which decentralized the national  agriculture sector, and the self-employed workers law, which  encouraged the production of certain goods which the state  cannot provide.    The new offensive is aimed at improving the financial  situation in 1994, eliminate excess personnel, increase work  productivity, and seek new production incentives.    Participants in the majority of the work meetings held this  week have proposed increasing the price of nonessential  articles, such as rum and cigarettes, charging admission to  sports and cultural events, and eliminating subsidies to  unprofitable enterprises.    According to local media, the participants also spoke about  the need to establish greater control mechanisms to prevent the  illegal diversion of state property assets.    Other agreements deal with the labor unions' request to  participate in future processes to account for personnel. They  also requested the measures be adopted in a gradual manner.     "

Laar spoke at the forum about Estonian economic reforms. He  focused on the cost of the reforms for the population of the  country and stressed that the success of the reforms doesn't  mean an immediate growth of the population's income.    Several participants in the discussion following Laar's  address expressed the hope that Estonia, unlike several other  countries, will not abandon the course of quick changes, and  gave their support to Laar's wish for ""less foreign aid and more  open markets."" In the opinion of participants, this allows to  speed up the pace of reforms and reduce a feeling of political  disappointment.    Elimination of barriers in world trade and promotion of a  free economy became the principal topics of the World Economic  Forum, the government's press service informs.    Much attention was given also to the situation in Russia and  to the economic and political integration into the European  Union of Central and East European countries.    Laar's article in Thursday's issue of the INTERNATIONAL  HERALD TRIBUNE, in which he urged to continue shock therapy in  Russia and not support the softening of reforms there, drew a  great deal of attention at the forum.    Several speakers, like economists Jeffrey Sachs and Anders  Aslund, and former Russian Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov,  expressed opinions similar to those in Laar's article. All  three left their jobs in Moscow in protest against the change in  the Russian Government's policies.    Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt stated that hyperinflation  in Russia poses a threat to entire Europe. He arrived at the  conclusion that plans of action have to be worked out in case  the situation in Russia becomes critical.    Richard Erb, deputy chairman of the International Monetary  Fund, voiced his opinion that Estonia is in the forefront among  Central and East European countries in transition from a command  economy to a free market. He cited Ukraine as an example to the  contrary.    The CNN television company recorded a 30-minute program with  Laar that will be shown next week. It gave the Estonian premier  an opportunity to elaborate and comment on his views.     "

Moscow's commitment to reform has been questioned following the departure of key reformers from the government in January, and the IMF has found itself criticised by the US and others for not doing enough to encourage Russian reforms.

This originated during the Vancouver summit in April last  year. It was not fortuitous that the word ""Vancouver"" was  pronounced repeatedly in Moscow these days. And still, the  Moscow dialogue of the two presidents has its own value:  intentions and promises predominated last year, whereas this  time the two sides stated that they begin to work.    This is of importance in itself because not every intention  gets rapidly translated into life, which has been evidenced, in  the opinion of the Russian side, by its experience of contacts  with the Group of Seven (G7) as a whole. Out of all G-7  leaders, Boris Yeltsin believes, only Bill Clinton fulfilled all  his promises to Russia.    Mr Cliton also attained the goals of his current trip,  according to his own estimates: To reaffirm partnership  relations between the U.S. and Russia and express U.S. support  for economic and political reforms in Russia. Singled out among  subjects of discussion can be economic reforms in Russia, a  European security system in the post- cold-war era, disarmament,  and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.    Partnership is the leading idea of the Moscow declaration --  the central document signed by the two presidents. It is stated  in the declaration in particular that ""the two presidents  announced that they would direct the detargeting of strategic  nuclear missiles under their respective commands so that by not  later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be targeted.  Thus, for the time in nearly half a century, virtually since  the dawn of the nuclear age, Russia and the United States will  not operate nuclear forces, day- to-day, in a manner that  presumes they are adversaries.""    In a joint statement, the two presidents undertook jointly  to  seek ways to strengthen guarantees of security for states which  renounced the possession of nuclear weapons and strictly observe  their obligations.    The January 14 signing of a Russo-american-Ukrainian  agreement on the removal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine's  Territory became a real breakthrough in this respect. President  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who had arrived in Moscow by air  expressly for this purpose, described this as a historic moment.    Ukraine in actual fact agreed to become a non-nuclear  country. In exchange for that, Kiev received guarantees of  security and compensation for getting rid of nuclear arms in the  form of fuel- grade uranium which Russia together with the U.s.  will produce by processing weapon-grade uranium, and the removal  of obstacles to the development of Ukraine's economic relations  with foreign countries.    Support for Russian reforms was, perhaps, the principal aim  of Bill Clinton's mission. Only provided there is a stable and  democratic Russia with a free economy, it is possible to build a  new world order in the post-cold-war era on the basis of those  values which are close to America and other civilised nations.    Previously, Washington declared its support for the  liberalisation of the Russian economy in general -- the quicker  the better. This time Bill Clinton placed social problems  related to the transition to a free market economy almost in the  centre of attention.    Although Clinton, during the Ostankino teleshow, jokingly  remarked that he was not going to give up Alaska, in response to  pronouncements by another well-known hero of live broadcasts,  everything seems to indicate that the leader of the country with  the classical liberal economy has come to realise the essence of  the problem: disregard for social welfare development may cost  one dear.    Mutual understanding was also reached to the effect that  Russia does not count on U.S. direct assistance in this respect  but suggests opening the U.S. market to Russian commodities and  technologies and lifting trade restrictions, proceeding from the  assumption that Russia itself, according to Boris Yeltsin, will  seek ways to resolve social problems upon effecting an economic  restructuring.    Among the 12 documents adopted during the summit, there are  those which mark the beginning of the removal of cold-war  obstructions in the trade-and-economic sphere.    With the consent of other countries concerned, the U.S.  announced the Export Control Committee (COCOM) -- the body which  hindered the export of high technologies to Russia -- would be  dissolved not later than March 31. Discriminatory restrictions  on the export of Russian uranium have been lifted.    The understanding of the role of Russia as a great power,  the  position of which has a decisive influence on the development of  events in the world, on peace and security, also manifested  itself in the fact that the U.S. president brought with him to  Moscow the ""Partnership for Peace"" concept which had been  endorsed by NATO leaders during the Brussels summit. The day  before in Prague, those former Warsaw Pact countries which seek  to join NATO as soon as possible had also agreed with the  concept.    Boris Yeltsin supported the concept which makes it possible  to avoid the division of Europe again into two camps but this  time along the border of the former Soviet Union. America's  reaffirmation of the role of Russia as a great power also  manifested itself in the fact that the influential group of  seven economically most developed countries may soon become G-8.  Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton will meet next time precisely at  a G-7 summit in Naples in July.    The problem of Russia's relations with the Baltic states was  discussed as well. Although a joint Russian-U.S. statement on  human rights contains rather general formulas, Bill Clinton  publicly warned ""other countries"" that they should respect the  rights of ethnic Russians and with this end in view promised to  have talks with the leaders of Latvia and Estonia. In response,  Washington expects that those states and Russia Conclude  agreements as soon as possible on the withdrawal of Russian  troops from there.    Of course, a lot of differences were revealed during the  Russian- U.S. summit talks, in views on a settlement of the  conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in particular.

Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan opened the meeting, which was chaired jointly by Mr Kabun Muto, minister for foreign affairs and Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, minister of finance. On April 15 1993, the ministers met with Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime minister and finance minister of Russia, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, for an extended discussion of the economic and political situation in Russia and to review how the international community could best support Russia's reform programme. Our Russian colleagues reaffirmed the determination of President Yeltsin and his government to move forward with reform. They welcomed our determination to support the reform process. 2 Support for Russia's Reform Russia has embarked on a far reaching transformation process with the aim of building a democratic society, establishing a market economy and improving the welfare of its people under the leadership of President Yeltsin. Russia has made courageous and extraordinary progress in the last two years. Russian reform and progress towards democratisation are essential to world peace. We want to see a democratic, stable and economically strong Russia, firmly integrated into the community of democratic states and into the world economy. We are confident that the G7 and Russia will continue to co-operate constructively and responsibly in international affairs. The Russian people themselves must bear primary responsibility for economic and political reform. The development of a market economy in Russia will be a long, arduous undertaking which will require difficult adjustments by the Russian people. We assure them of our support in coping with the inevitable hardships of the transition period. We remain resolved to work with Russia to develop lasting co-operation based on the principles of partnership and help for self-help laid out at the Munich Summit. Our assistance will be pragmatic, visible, tangible and effective, tailored to Russian absorptive capacity and phased with the progress of reform. We welcome the recognition by the Russian government that both monetary stabilisation and further structural reform. including privatisation, are critical. A positive environment for private initiatives and investment, including a proper legal and administrative framework, is crucial for the transformation of the economy. Better access to export markets is indispensable to structural reform in Russia. 3 Bilateral and Multilateral Actions We have agreed on a series of multilateral actions closely linked with our bilateral efforts as described in the Annex. Close co-ordination among our countries and international organisations as well as close contacts with the Russian authorities will be necessary. Russia is currently experiencing a particularly difficult situation. We are also mindful of the challenging tasks facing other economies in transition. The success of the Russian reform programme is in the interest of all countries. . . 4. Next Steps Our meeting in Tokyo has helped lay the foundation for the meeting to be held with President Yeltsin in July in Tokyo. The heads of state and government of the G7 democracies and the president of the EC Commission will continue to pay close attention to developments in Russia. They look forward to a fruitful review in July.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     QRZ  European Economic Community (EC).   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

Mamedov said in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Friday [14  January] that the characteristic feature of the present talks  was that ""Russian-American relations came to the end of a period  when bilateral ties focused, due to circumstances connected with  the initial stage of Russian reforms, on rendering aid to Russia  in the humanitarian and other spheres"".    ""We witness now a switch to macroeconomic partnership,  assistance in structural changes of the Russian economy, in  restructuring of Russia's relations with close neighbours and  major countries in the world as well as in a change of the  attitude of international economic organisations to reforms in  our country with a greater edge on social programmes,"" the  deputy minister noted.    According to Mamedov, Clinton ""put forth a package of  specific measures, to be taken by the United States together  with other countries and international economic organisations,  to help change radically attitudes to Russia in order to ensure  a greater foothold for it on world markets and to ease Russia's  economic relations with former Soviet republics.    Mamedov noted that, thanks to U.S. assistance, international  economic organisations will appropriate funds to countries of  the Commonwealth of Independent States to purchase energy  carriers from Russia at higher prices.    ""There is also a programme for converting the munitions  industry to prevent greater unemployment. Funds released as a  result of conversion will be channeled for social programmes,  including creation of jobs,"" he continued.    ""You see, the package provides not for canned meat  deliveries  but serious measures which will help restructure the Russian  economy and simultaneously create 'a social insurance system'.""    Incidentally, Mamedov added, Clinton, guided by an analysis  of the situation made by American agencies, said during a  discussion of the economic situation in Russia that Russia would  make a powerful breakthrough in two years' time.    In this connection, the sides discussed changing the seven  most industrialised countries into a G-8. ""This issue is  difficult enough,"" Mamedov admitted. ""The American side  expressed support for such a change in the political resepect.  It also noted that structural changes in the economy should  lead to turning the G-7 into a G-8 also economically.""    ITAR-TASS learnt from a member of the Russian delegation at  the talks, who refused to be identified, that the U.S. expressed  support for Russia's admission to GATT during the second round  of the summit.    It was also made known that customs restrictions on nearly  4,400 types of Russian goods will be lifted on the American  market.    Mamedov noted that the Russian president supported the  ""Partnership for Peace"" initiative put forth by Clinton.     "

Reactions to Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's visit  to Angola continue to be heard. The Angolan media continue to  report on the importance of Foreign Minister Robaina's  statements during a news conference on 15 January, moments  before leaving for Harare, Zimbabwe. Asked to describe the  relations between Cuba and the United States, the young foreign  minister said:    [Begin Robaina recording] You can describe relations between  two countries when relations exist. When there are no relations,  you cannot describe them. There are no relations between Cuba  and the United States. Since there are no relations between Cuba  and the United States, relations such as the ones we enjoy with  Angola and many other countries, I can say nothing about them.  The U.S. issue always seems to come up, wherever Cuba goes.  However, I am always willing to discuss this issue. As far as  Cuba is concerned, the U.S. foreign policy has not changed. We  are convinced that Latin America and Cuba are not priorities for  the new U.S. Administration. The U.S. Government has many  domestic problems it must solve, and it is being pressured  domestically to ensure that it will not normalize relations with  Cuba.    Regarding the United States, Cuba will reiterate what it has  always said. Cuba is willing to sit down and talk with the whole  world, as well as with the United States. However, this is based  on one thing: absolute respect. If absolute respect does not  prevail, then we have nothing to say to the United States. If  they want us to sit at a negotiating table as subordinates, we  will not go. We are willing to broach the most difficult issues  -- we are even willing to begin discussing the less complicated  issues -- as long as there is absolute respect. Cuba is begging  no one to talk to us; Cuba is imploring no one to talk to us.  Cuba simply states on what basis it is willing to talk. If this  condition is respected, then we would have no objection to  sitting down to talks.    The only sign of interest we detect in the new U.S.  Administration is the fact that the new U.S. Administration does  not use the aggressive language used by previous U.S.  Administrations. I do not think this is much. It could be  something, and perhaps something may come of it, but there is no  reason for us to be overjoyed. [end recording]    This was what Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told local  and  foreign reporters during a news conference held at the Luanda  International Airport shortly before leaving Angola. Robaina  said that Cuba will not negotiate as a subordinate.    Robaina also answered other questions for the reporters. One  question had to do with the vast political, economic, and social  changes being made in Cuba. Robaina also mentioned that the  Cuban people are allowed to possess dollars. Robaina said:    [Begin Robaina recording] Cuba is undergoing very important  changes. We would have to define what big changes really are.  Big changes can be interpreted in one way or another. I believe  the situation is extremely difficult and complex. We are  undergoing a process of industrial change as well as changes in  our foreign economic relations. We are doing this in the short  term. Doing this in the short term has been extremely complex.  Our task is more difficult because we are doing this amid a  brutal blockade, harassment, and relentless persecution.    Regarding unrest, I am happy to say that we are a people who  enjoy great calm. We have political discussions. We are  currently undergoing strong political discussions. My country is  currently facing difficulties and making changes; therefore, it  is only natural that there should be discussions and very  difficult times. However, I do not believe that the  decriminalization of foreign currency is the most difficult  issue we have broached. There are many other more important  things we have discussed. For example, the economic changes we  are undergoing. Some of these economic changes are: foreign  investment, giving land to peasants and workers in exchange for  their work, self-employment, and decriminalization. All these  things must be discussed. Whenever so many topics are broached,  various opinions will be expressed. However, the most important  thing is that we are capable of doing this and we are doing  this. This is the situation we are currently experiencing in  Cuba.    Cuba chose to follow a path. We believe that even though the  world we live in is a difficult world. We believe this world has  changed. Cuba, however, will join that world. Cuba is willing to  join that world without giving up certain principles. Cuba will  not negotiate its sovereignty and independence, and we will  never give up our right to be heard. We will not take steps  backward in the fields of education, health, science, social  security, and social justice. We will not negotiate those areas  where we have made important progress. [end recording]    These were statements by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina during a news conference held on 15 January in Luanda.  Robaina said that Cuba will not negotiate such fields as health,  education, culture and sports, in which important progress has  been made.    Back to Radio Rebelde now. This was Africano Neto.

This commitment was made to the  provincial Communist Party of Cuba leadership during an  assessment of the results of the last 10 days of the harvest.  The province has already surpassed the production level  attained in the last harvest and is gearing up to complete the  remaining sugar production. This goal implies establishing a  link between the cane waiting to be processed and the mills with  higher production capacities. This vital final period is  getting the support of the manual and combine workers from mills  that have completed operations.    Only the Rafael Reyes, Salvador Rosales, and America Libre  Mills have met their sugar production goals to date.  Recognizing their success, Politburo members Jose Ramon Machado  Ventura and Esteban Lazo instructed the management of those  mills to present labor feat banners to their respective workers.    Machado Ventura stated that together with the efforts that  the current harvest demands, it is necessary to guarantee, by  every means, the sugarcane spring planting campaign. This makes  it necessary for Santiago de Cuba to increase the daily pace to  keep up with the program. Esteban Lazo stated this is why we  need to take advantage of the days remaining in June to get  ahead without neglecting crop tending tasks.     "

In 1993, the controversy over the effectiveness of Cuban  vaccines took new heights as a result of epidemics in Chile,  Argentina, and Brazil and although there are reservations in  purchasing the vaccine, threats of epidemics must be taken into  consideration.    By exporting the vaccine against the meningococcic  meningitis, interferon, the anticholestorelomic PPG, and the  recombining streptokinase, Cuba can secure a new market that  will be backed by the research, raw materials, and laboratories  that have the Made in Cuba label.    This has come as a big surprise for transnational firms that  unlock trade ambitions while in poor countries many people die  for lack of vaccines that Cuba is already producing.    In Cuba, as in the rest of the world, the pharmaceutical  industry is the main beneficiary of advanced technology, over  which the highly industrialized nations almost have a monopoly.    This is the context into which the Cubans broke some years  ago when the island produced a vaccine against the Type B  Meningococcic Meningitis (the serotype that produces the most  deaths among the infant population) and Type B Hepatitis, which  also affects millions of Latin Americans.    These two vaccines are already being marketed in other  countries. In some countries of the area, where different  meningococcic serotypes exist, groups of experts are thinking  about acquiring these vaccines.    Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in  Atlanta, the United States, and WHO have issued a positive  assessment, the obstacles against the marketing of the vaccines  are huge. This marketing has become a strategic field of the  Cuban economy. At the National Forum of Science and Technology  recently held in Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro described  the war that has been launched from the United States against  Cuban pharmaceutical products as terrible.    No one could imagine how far the Cubans would go when they  took, in the 1980's, the short cut that biotechnology and  genetic engineering opened to the developing countries.    The Cubans began producing interferon and now have a series  of products to treat cancer, to fight infections resulting from  the human papiloma virus, and to delay AIDS manifestations in  persons with the HIV virus. These products are marketed by  Heberbiotec S.A. and their effectiveness has been demonstrated.    More than 160 products have been obtained through genetic  engineering, including eight medications that come as  injections, creams, and eye-wash.    Although the main results derive from genetic engineering  and  biotechnology, progress is also being made in chemical and  pharmaceutical products such as the anti-ulcer Qulcer,  antibiotics, and biological remedies.    In 1993, the main objective of Cuba's pharmaceutical sector  was to launch a commercial struggle in the face of a powerful  market where 10 of the largest and most notable pharmacological  enterprises sold more than $170-billion-worth [of products] in  1992.    New formulas are presented at the island's medicine  registration offices, thus strengthening the arsenal of  medicines with high international demand. Some formulas are  streptokinase (used to dissolve cardiac thrombosis) and several  others developed from human placenta and melanin (used to cure  vitiligo).    The more complex field of biotherapy has contributed with  monoclonal antibodies. IOR-T3 was the first product to be  registered at the state pharmaceutical control office.    Dr. Agustin Lage, the director of the National Molecular  Immunology Center, told PRENSA LATINA that the center is  currently performing clinical tests using several lymphoma  treatments.    An anti-cholesterol agent, known as PPG or Ateromyxol, was  developed with the aid of molecular biology. It is currently  riding the crest of an advertising and sales wave among  tourists, who come to the island looking for the ""sexuality  formula"", as some have come to call these pills.    PPG was conceived to treat high cholesterol levels and  presently enjoys wide acceptance for its lack of unwanted side  effects. Patients report a general improvement of their  circulation process and, especially, their sexual functions.    This effective weapon against cardiovascular disease was  introduced to the local therapeutical scene in 1991 and in a  1993 report issued by the University of Geneva it was recognized  to be the best anticholesterol drug available.    Producing pharmaceutical products nowadays means plenty of  scientific research. This was evident at the Fifth Cuban  Pharmaceutical Science Congress, the National Pharmaceutical  Technology Development Workshop, and the International  Antibiotics Workshop, all of which were held in Havana during  1993.    These events assessed the Caribbean nation's research  potential. The island's scientists are preparing to begin the  production of antibiotics using the method of fermentation, with  the support of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP).    Chemical development has produced other achievements such as  the production of a cytostatic agent called ""Actinomicina D,""  which, according to Dr. Carlos Vallin Ploust, a specialist at  the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Center, is used to treat several  types of cancer.    This new industry finds its resources on the ocean floor, by  studying species that provide toxins found useful in  neurological science. The production of hydroxyapatite, which  is a complex phosphate calcium produced by sea coral and used as  an excellent element for bone implants and in stomatology, has  gained strength.    The most innovative discovery of the year about to close,  was  the cancer therapy developed from shark cartilage. A  multidisciplinary Cuban team elaborated and expanded the  research that began in the United States.    A 16-week study was carried out with terminal patients, from  September 1993 to January 1993, under the direction of Dr. Jose  Menendez Lopez and labeled ""The New Option.""    Dr. Lopez Menendez [name as received], in explaining the new  cancer therapy, said that the product is registered and sold in  the United States as a dietary supplement. There are recent  reports, however, that indicate that they are doing clinical  research similar to that completed in Cuba.    I can affirm, he said, that their results, as ours, may not  be described as spectacular. They can, however, be seen as  highly promising and encouraging enough to press on with this  therapeutical effort.    The specialist explained that Cuba began by importing the  product. Now, Cuba is producing shark cartilage of unsurpassed  quality and excellence, as shown in simple spectral analysis.    The formula is rich in an astounding collection of  biologically active substances with anti-inflammatory and  angiogenetic inhibiting properties.    The scientist pointed out, however, that shark cartilage is  by no means the divine nectar of the gods, nor does its use  entail magical results. Cuban experience does recognize it  though as the strongest neoangiogenesis inhibitor tested to date.     "

Market Reforms in the Russian Federation         In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, the Department normally uses a factor valuation methodology to calculate foreign market value when the country involved is an NME country and the Department determines that it cannot determine foreign market value based on the respondent's prices or costs. An NME-country respondent may argue that market-driven prices characterize its particular industry and, therefore, despite NME status, that foreign market value should be calculated by using actual home market prices or costs.     In these investigations, the Russian manufacturers, Avisma and SMW, make such a market-oriented-industry (``MOI'') claim. Alternatively, the two companies claim that economic conditions now prevalent throughout Russia warrant revocation of Russia's NME-country status, effective January 1, 1994.     The Department's analysis with respect to such claims centers around a government's role in economic activity. Consistent with the factors described in section 771(18), the Department considers the extent to which resources are allocated by the market or government, taking into account government involvement in currency and labor markets, pricing, and production and investment decisions. Where resources are not allocated by the market, it would be difficult to conclude that home market prices or costs should be used to calculate fair value.     Evidence provided in these proceedings indicates that Russia is in the process of implementing extensive reforms to achieve its goal of becoming a market economy. The freeing of most prices in December 1991 and the privatization of most enterprises formerly within the state-planning system are important steps in moving Russia towards a market economy.     We cannot conclude, however, based on the information in this record that Russia should be treated as a market economy for purposes of the antidumping duty law. The Russian economy, having emerged from a centrally-planned system, is in a state of transition. Many of the state controls have been abandoned, but that does not mean that functioning markets have replaced controls. Because the evidence does not demonstrate that prices and costs in Russia adequately reflect market considerations, we cannot at this time alter Russia's designation as a nonmarket economy.     Information on the record also suggests that the government continues to be involved in the Russian magnesium sector. For example, the Russian Federal Committee on Metallurgy, a successor to the Ministry of Industry (Metallurgy Department), indicated in an official statement that it controls activity in the magnesium industry in Russia, noting particularly that it coordinates production, exports, and prices. Also, although the two producers under investigation have been privatized, this same statement indicates that the Committee may be using the remaining government interest in these companies to carry out its intentions with respect to pricing and production. For these reasons, we have determined that the prices or costs of producing magnesium in Russia should not be used to calculate fair value.         B. Surrogate Country Selection         In accordance with section 773(c)(4) of the Act, we must, to the extent possible, value the factors of production in one or more market economy countries that (1) are at a level of economic development comparable to that of the non-market economy country, and (2) are significant producers of comparable merchandise. Thus, we have considered as possible surrogates those countries that are economically comparable to Russia and that produce identical or comparable merchandise. Of those countries that we have determined to be economically comparable, Brazil is the only country that is a significant producer of the identical merchandise, magnesium. (See October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the file.) Accordingly, we have based FMV on the values of the appropriate factors of production as valued in Brazil. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible.         C. Factors of Production         We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise for the above-mentioned exporters. The factors used to produce pure and alloy magnesium include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values,     see     our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for general expenses and profit, the cost of containers and coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for shipment to the United States.     To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information for Brazil from the United Nations Trade Commodity Statistics (    UN Trade Statistics    ) for JanuaryDecember 1992. We did not attempt to adjust raw material factor values to account for inflation between 1992 and the POI because the figures were reported in dollars, and we had no indication as to how exchange rates, currency reforms, and hyperinflation could properly be taken into account. For those raw materials for which we were unable to obtain publicly available information from Brazil, we used data provided in the petition.     To value heavy oil, we used 1993 data for Brazil from the Energy Information Administration's International Energy Annual. Although this value for heavy oil is tax-inclusive, it is the only data found for heavy oil in Brazil.     Natural gas was valued using information from the petition on prices in Brazil because we could find no other source for prices of this product.     To value electricity for industrial use, labor, and freight rates for both truck and rail, we used information reported by the U.S. Consulate in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Thus, we have considered as possible surrogates those countries that are economically comparable to Russia and that produce identical or comparable merchandise. Of those countries that we have determined to be economically comparable, Brazil is the only country that is a significant producer of the identical merchandise, magnesium. (See October 21, 1994, Memorandum from the Office of Policy to the file.) Accordingly, we have based FMV on the values of the appropriate factors of production as valued in Brazil. We have obtained and relied upon published, publicly available information, wherever possible.         C. Factors of Production         We calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories which produced the subject merchandise for the above-mentioned exporters. The factors used to produce pure and alloy magnesium include materials, labor, and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values for the different inputs. (For a complete analysis of surrogate values,     see     our calculation memorandum.) We then added amounts for general expenses and profit, the cost of containers and coverings, and other expenses incident to placing the merchandise in condition packed and ready for shipment to the United States.     To value the raw materials, we used publicly available information for Brazil from the United Nations Trade Commodity Statistics (    UN Trade Statistics    ) for JanuaryDecember 1992. We did not attempt to adjust raw material factor values to account for inflation between 1992 and the POI because the figures were reported in dollars, and we had no indication as to how exchange rates, currency reforms, and hyperinflation could properly be taken into account. For those raw materials for which we were unable to obtain publicly available information from Brazil, we used data provided in the petition.     To value heavy oil, we used 1993 data for Brazil from the Energy Information Administration's International Energy Annual. Although this value for heavy oil is tax-inclusive, it is the only data found for heavy oil in Brazil.     Natural gas was valued using information from the petition on prices in Brazil because we could find no other source for prices of this product.     To value electricity for industrial use, labor, and freight rates for both truck and rail, we used information reported by the U.S. Consulate in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.          "
0,FT942-9502 ,"FT942-9502 _AN-EEPCBAATFT 940516   FT  16 MAY 94 / EU seeks even-handed policy towards Russia and Ukraine      By LIONEL BARBER      BRUSSELS   The European Union will today make a start at trying to forge a more even-handed strategy toward Russia and Ukraine, whose neighbourhood rivalry remains a source of instability on the continent. Barring last-minute objections, EU foreign ministers in Brussels are likely to give the go-ahead to a new 'partnership' agreement with Russia whose ambitious goal is a common free-trade zone by the end of the century. However, in a sign of 'new thinking', the EU is balancing its Russia policy with a deeper engagement in Ukraine, whose nuclear arsenal and collapsing economy make it the regional danger spot. Ministers will today examine a European Commission paper which calls for a host of new initiatives to strengthen political co-operation and overhaul the command economy in Ukraine. The plan recommends Ecu100m (Pounds 79m) in emergency food aid and measures to improve nuclear safety, particularly the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant, which experts estimate could cost between Ecu300m and Ecu500m. Chernobyl funding will be a key topic at the Group of Seven industrialised countries' summit in Naples in July. Ministers may baulk at the Commission's food aid plan because of conflicting evidence of food shortages and worries that emergency shipments could distort local agricultural markets. Some countries may also delay approval of the documents in favour of waiting for a deeper analysis of the Ukrainian political economy. A senior EU diplomat said Russia had modified its earlier resistance to having the EU bolster its relations with Ukraine. But Brussels had to tread carefully in the light of Russia's (and its own) insistence that economic aid should be linked to Ukraine's meeting its pledge to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The EU recently completed a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine which is slightly less generous than the EU-Russia pact now virtually complete. Ministers are weighing an invitation to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to attend a signing ceremony. The EU-Russia partnership pact is likely to be approved, provided ministers agree to settle the two controversies which have plagued negotiations over the past 18 months. These are the EU's treatment of Russian uranium exports and Moscow's treatment of European banks operating in Russia. France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, has been worried about being undercut by Russian exports. A new safeguards regime operating until 1997 may ease French concerns. Member states are less enthusiastic about the banking offer because it restricts EU banks to no more than 12 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Russian banking system, with Moscow offering a non-committal review after five years. But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, believes it is the best deal on offer. Agreement would pave the way for Mr Boris Yeltsin to stage a high-profile visit to western Europe, possibly via an invitation to attend the European summit in Corfu next month.

Under what conditions is the  Cuban Revolution celebrating this anniversary?    [Lovaina] Cuba is celebrating the 35th anniversary of the  revolution amid the most adverse circumstances in its entire  history -- a time when the socialist bloc no longer exists and  the United States is stepping up its inhumane blockade. This  entails enormous sacrifices by our people, who are resisting in  an effort to protect our national dignity, sovereignty, and the  progress achieved in the areas of health, education, and labor.    To give just a few examples, this year the death rate for  children fell to 9.6 for every 1,000 children born alive. We  have more than 51,000 doctors, and more than 80 percent of the  population is covered by the family doctor plan. Not a single  school child has been denied registration. Despite our current  difficulties, Cuba has achieved very high health indexes  compared with the ones the revolution encountered in 1959.    [Malespin] The Cuban Government implemented important  changes  in 1993. What goals does the country plan to achieve with them?    [Lovaina] All of the measures uphold our socialist  principles  without giving up a planned economy. Although there will be  increased participation of foreign capital, state ownership will  prevail. Cuba is looking for structures that will allow a  better integration into the world economy, particularly with our  Latin American brothers.    [Malespin] Some people think Cuba is implementing a  Chinese-style communism. Would you place your country in that  category?    [Lovaina] We have taken other experiences into  consideration, but, above all else, it is essentially a matter  of implementing an efficient, mature socialism that solves  national problems and allows us to efficiently achieve  development without abandoning the concept of social justice,  essentially taking into consideration maritime ideas, too [as  published].    [Malespin] Different experts have warned that these measures  involve too many risks. What is the evaluation as we start 1994?    [Lovaina] No human project is free of risk -- nor is it free  of mistakes -- but it is important to face these risks and  protect the homeland, the revolution, and socialism, as Fidel  has stated many times.    [Malespin] [Ernesto] Che [Guevara] warned against making the  mistake of giving imperialism even a foothold. Has not Cuba  done this with these measures?    [Lovaina] He said this within a certain context, and what he  meant was that no concessions should be made to the principles  of imperialism. The measures adopted today by Cuba are  revolutionary measures to defeat the blockade, to save the  revolution's essential achievements, and to protect our  sovereignty and national independence. These policies are  outlined by the Communist Party of Cuba and by Fidel Castro, and  they are fully supported by our people.    [Malespin] The international community has supported Cuba by  condemning the U.S. blockade, but it also has asked President  Fidel Castro's Government to make in-depth changes. Will there  be any in 1994?    [Lovaina] The blockade is aimed at isolating Cuba  politically  and economically, at undermining the Cuban people's  determination to resist, and at creating the image that Cuba is  hell. It does this in an effort to discourage solidarity with  Cuba and to impose an even more abhorrent political system than  the one that existed before 1959.    While a wall has been built to prevent illegal immigrants  from other countries from entering the United States, in Cuba's  case millions of dollars are spent to encourage illegal  immigrants and people without documents to risk their lives to  reach U.S. territory.    There are no limitations whatsoever on any Cuban citizens of  legal age to travel to the United States -- or to any other  country -- just as there are no limitations on any Cubans living  in the United States, or other U.S. residents, from travelling  to Cuba.    The United States, however, denies visas to 60 percent of  the  Cuban citizens who request them at the U.S. interests office in  Cuba. Also, the U.S. authorities have strict penal sanctions  for North American citizens who visit Cuba.    [Malespin] Referring to official relations with Nicaragua,  what is their current status.    [Lovaina] Official relations between Cuba and Nicaragua are  good, respectful, and friendly. Until this year, Cuba has  maintained free medical assistance in Nicaragua, and a Cuban  medical brigade will end its mission in Nicaragua this year.    A new medical assistance agreement has been signed. It will  be paid for with financial aid from international organizations.  Also, some 900 Nicaraguan students will receive free  scholarships in Cuba.     "

0,FT943-15095 ,"FT943-15095 _AN-EGLEZAAOFT 940712   FT  12 JUL 94 / Belarus sweeps in new broom      By LEYLA BOULTON   The victory in Belarus's first presidential election of Mr Alexander Lukashenko, an anti-corruption campaigner, threatens to aggravate the republic's economic woes if the new president sticks to his promise of fighting both corruption and market economics. Official results published yesterday gave Mr Lukashenko 80 per cent of the vote in a run-off against Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the conservative prime minister who had tried every trick in the book - including populist economic handouts and unabashed exploitation of the state-controlled media - to secure his own election. But Mr Lukashenko, a poorly-educated former collective farm boss who more recently headed parliament's anti-corruption commission, owes his surprise victory to his well-delivered message of 'finding simple solutions to complicated problems'. Victory was delivered to him on a plate by popular weariness with old-style Soviet-era leaders who failed to conduct any coherent market reforms in three years of independence. The failure to reform an economy dominated by obsolete industry has meant Belarus has suffered from industrial collapse, hyperinflation, shortages in the shops, and widespread corruption as the state has sought to maintain an increasingly ineffective grip on the economy. Mr Lukashenko, 39, has promised to root out corruption by starting from the top. 'This will end the problem at the lower level because people take their cue from the top,' he has said. He has vowed to restore socialist-style controls over the economy and also frightened the country's fledgling private sector with his promise to confiscate 'ill-gotten gains'. The main plank of Mr Kebich's programme to save the economy from 'catastrophe' was his plan for a monetary union with Russia - in effect turning Belarus into a Russian province. In an attempt to boost Mr Kebich's election chances after his poor showing in the first round of voting, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, even travelled to Minsk to confirm Russia still endorsed the draft union he cooked up with Mr Kebich last winter. During the election campaign, Mr Lukashenko, an unknown quantity in Moscow endorsed only by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the Russian ultra-nationalist, had also supported the proposed union with Russia. He even suggested that the alliance be extended to the political sphere. On Sunday, however, he issued mixed signals on his plans for relations with Russia. 'Let us stop playing up the Russian card,' he said. 'Russia has its own interests, Belarus has its own.' Mr Lukashenko's victory can only reinforce Moscow's growing doubts about the benefits of a union already criticised within Russia as economically unprofitable for it. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, took a non-committal line on the results of elections in both Belarus and Ukraine while acknowledging the problems which have dogged the proposed monetary union with Minsk.

This is not a symbolic fact.  Robaina, Cuba's foreign minister, is a frontrunner. He speaks in  a fresh language and has a very personal style he calls  ""impromptu diplomacy.""    Playing with words and exhibiting his permanent good sense  of  humor, Robaina says he is not a ""career diplomat."" He was  appointed to the post approximately a year ago at a time of very  serious economic difficulties in Cuba.    Since then he has tested his capabilities, ""immediately  aware  of the importance of a duty by which we open the world's doors  to become part of a new international political format, in  particular, to tell our truth in our own voice.""    I followed him through Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and  Vietnam,  and finally, in what was supposed to be a relaxing interview but  what became a maze of ideas by an interlocutor impressively  ready for a dialogue.    Discussing many matters at the end of his tour through eight  Asian countries was the reward he gave me for my tenacious  effort to secure an exclusive interview for PRENSA LATINA.    Cuba's economic crisis looked to me as the best option for  the first question.    [Robaina] It is true the situation is still difficult and  that it will take big efforts to find adequate solutions to our  project, but I am pleased to say the worst is over. The crisis  hit rock bottom and we are now in a launch phase. We see the  light at the end of the tunnel. We are moving with greater  security.    [Triana] In this new light, what economic options does the  Cuban Government have?    [Robaina] A group of measures have been adopted and other  measures are being discussed to revitalize the economy without  renouncing the fundamental achievements of the Revolution.  Openings to foreign investments have developed, our foreign  relations have been diversified, and we continue developing, in  spite of the huge pressure from the U.S. blockade, which also  boycotts every effort Cuba makes to initiate negotiations and  pressures those who want to invest in our island.    [Triana] Is there any change of attitude in the current U.S.  Administration with regard to Cuba?    [Robaina] The United States is now using a less aggressive  language, but we know that internal mechanisms will keep  Washington from changing its attitude toward our country even if  it has this intention. Therefore we do not see, for example, any  surprise lifting of the embargo. We are prepared to negotiate,  as we have often said, on the basis of respect for our  independence and sovereignty, and the right our 35-year-old  Revolution gave us to speak out.    [Triana] Ever since you became foreign minister, you have  worked on a very intense diplomatic offensive throughout the  world. What is the object of this policy?    [Robaina] To explain the truth of our plan, to listen to the  economic experiences of many other countries that have had  successful results in that field, and to explore all the  cooperation possibilities. Latin America and the Caribbean are a  priority. This is the setting from which we were removed and the  setting we are recovering. We are talking now in terms of a  diplomatic offensive because we are tired of sitting on the  defendant's bench.    [Triana] What does your tour through Indonesia, Thailand,  Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam mean?    [Robaina] In this region of the world, there have been  significant economic transformations, and we are interested in  analyzing and learning from them to apply in Cuba whatever may  be applicable. We want to directly report on our openings to  foreign investments and announce our aspirations to have  mutually beneficial cooperation and exchanges in all possible  fields.    [Triana] Any comment on your Asian tour?    [Robaina] It was successful because we found respect and  understanding, unanimous condemnation of the U.S. blockade  against Cuba, and the possibilities of economic cooperation.  Vietnam deserves special mention. This is a dear country that  after going through big sacrifices and challenges was able to  build a road to development without renouncing its socialist  principles.    We applaud what Vietnam is doing and its achievements  encourage us tremendously. We also celebrate the end of the  economic embargo to which it was unjustly subjected by the  United States. We are closely following the Vietnamese process  and once again thank this heroic people for their specific  solidarity with Cuba and their decision to comply with this  year's trade agreement.    [Triana] You return to Havana and almost immediately begin  another tour through Latin America including Peru, Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay, after the 22-24 April meeting with  representatives of the Cuban community abroad, and this is  followed by a tour of Arabian countries. Is it your youth which  allows you to tackle so many tasks in a row?    [Robaina] Fortunately, in Cuba we work with a group spirit.  It is a great responsibility to be foreign minister right now,  and success mostly depends on the officials who accompany me. We  have a large group that is very well prepared, technically  speaking, and personally speaking, since I am young I am  compelled to try to represent the new generations as best I can.    [Triana] The international media said the call for ""The  Nation and the Immigrant Community"" meeting in Cuba is an  audacious step taken by the island's government. What is the  purpose of that meeting?    [Robaina] We invited Cubans who live in the United States,  Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the Caribbean, and other  places and who are willing to participate in a dialogue with  their homeland. We did not invite hysteria or aggressiveness,  but some of those who were not invited to the meeting hastened  to reject an invitation that was not extended. Our goal is to  normalize relations with the Cuban community abroad, as is done  by all countries in the world.    [Triana] People in Cuba and abroad talk about Robaina's  youth. You greatly impressed your Cambodian counterpart, Prince  Norodom Sirivuth, during your Far East tour. In Cambodia like in  the rest of the countries he visited, the head of Havana's  diplomacy made an unusual request for this kind of trip: a  bicycle. The Cambodian prince was so enthusiastic that he went  an early morning ride through Phnom Penh with the Cuban envoy.  ""In barely 24 hours, we got to know each other so well that I  felt duty bound to visit Havana this year,"" Sirivuth commented.    [Robaina] The most important news in my country is not a  young minister, but the essential role young Cubans have in the  country's economic, political, and social development. In other  words, the place they have earned. As far as I am concerned, my  goal is to constantly hold consultations on a wider scale with  the people I represent.    [Triana] What advise would you give your generation?    [Robaina] I do not believe I am in a position to give  advise.  I believe each generation has to face -- in its place and under  its own conditions -- the role it has to play. Nevertheless, if  you insist on asking that question, I would tell the young  people: The most important thing is not to resign yourself to  what has been done. New generations should not settle for what  has been done and they should not talk only about history and  what was done; they should make their own history, a  contemporary history.    [Triana] How can you possibly take on so many tasks and  still  have time for the family?    [Robaina] It requires a personal effort to find time during  the day so I can, for example, take time in the morning to get  my son ready to go to school or to take him bicycle riding on  the weekend, and talk with him. My family has its own  responsibilities. A housewife's tasks are as difficult as a  minister's tasks in Cuba.     "

In a paper entitled ""How To Help Russia? --  Ways and Limitations of Supporting the Reform Process,"" he says  that Russia's preconditions for transferring to a democratic  constitutional state and a market economy have ""clearly  deteriorated as a result of the parliamentary elections and the  continuing economic crisis."" Millions of people in Russia today  associate reform policy with instability, supply shortages,  unemployment, high crime rates, a declining international  reputation, and the loss of Russia's superpower status. Europe,  and Germany in particular, is especially interested in a stable,  economically sound, and predictable neighbor to the east. Help  for Russia, therefore, means ""an active security and peace  policy."" Yet, Western support can only be effective if Russia  itself does everything it can to promote the reform process,  Lamers emphasized. ""The country does not need fewer, but more  reforms."" The West must be prepared to be Russia's partner and  to install a network of friendly cooperation between the  European Union, NATO, and Russia. But it must also be prepared  to show Russia its place. ""Claims to special rights and looking  for special ways do not help Russia."" Although Russia must find  a place in Europe that is appropriate to its size, ""being part  of the new Europe also means giving up its superior role, not  insisting on special rights vis-a-vis its neighbors.""    Unless Russia answers the central question as to whether it  wants to be a ""national state or an empire,"" as long as it  considers its role of world power more important than  establishing an efficient administration, a modern economy, and  a social security system, the country will not come to rest, the  CDU/CSU expert warns. That is why further financial aid to  Russia -- especially by the IMF -- should not be granted as ""an  advance signal of trust, but only as an acknowledgment of  reforms effected so far."" Otherwise, this would mean awarding  premiums for ""wrong decisions instead of reforms.""     "

British officials said it was unlikely that all members of the group would want to expand the club. In Bonn, Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said it was too soon for Russia to become a member of the annual economic summit group. On Thursday night, President Bush said he was prepared to discuss admitting Russia at next week's G7 summit in Munich. The president did not commit himself to supporting the inclusion of Russia, whose president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, will confer with the Group of Seven leaders on the summit's last day. But he said: 'I will be prepared to discuss this, making it a G8 if you will.' This did not seem, however, to be a considered policy statement. He was responding to a question at a press conference by a Russian journalist and answered, off-the-cuff, that the Russian economy was of sufficient size for the issue at least to be debated. UK officials said yesterday that Russian entry would be premature, adding that Japan was likely to oppose such a move. Japan has outstanding territorial disputes with Russia and the two countries still have not signed a peace treaty to mark the end of hostilities in the Second World War. Mr Vogel said: 'Russia has not yet met the economic conditions, and probably not the political conditions either, quickly to become a member of the G8, or a member of what has been the G7 up to now.' The G7 leaders from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada will therefore meet Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the Russian prime minister, for three hours of talks on Wednesday on a 'G7 plus one' basis. The same procedure was adopted last year when the G7 leaders held talks with President Mikhail Gorbachev of the former Soviet Union. Next week's G7 summit is likely to give a strong message of support for Mr Yeltsin and his efforts to push ahead with economic reform in Russia. It is expected to support a rescheduling of Russia's official debts and the release of a first tranche of Dollars 1bn of International Monetary Fund credits for Russia on condition that the government in Moscow puts forward clear plans for reducing its budget deficit and inflation. Japanese Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa arrived in Britain yesterday on a three-day visit ahead of the summit. Mr Miyazawa, on his first official visit to Britain as premier, will meet Britain's Prime Minister John Major, European Commission President Jacques Delors and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney during his stay in London. In the light of a swelling trade surplus with European Community members, Mr Miyazawa is expected to explain his plans to spur a flagging economy to create markets for more foreign goods. He will also seek European support for Japan's demand that Russia returns four islands off northern Japan seized in 1945.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

No one will ever be able to criticize  or applaud Colosio in the future because no one will know if the  words which were virtually his last might have come true: ""I  want to be president because I want to support the most needy in  my country.""    Thus far, while the incredible and forever debatable theory  of a lone assassin makes the rounds, Colosio's death has upset  Mexico's political panorama, cast a gloomy shadow over Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's administration, and created uncertainty  regarding who will be the next presidential candidate for the  party that has been in power for more than 50 years in Mexico.    The assassination has shocked the entire world but it has  devastated Mexico because, emotions aside, it has created an air  of instability with regard to the 21 August elections when  approximately 50 million Mexicans will elect a new president  under turbulent social conditions.    Carefully selected, Colosio graduated in 1972 from the  Monterrey Technological Institute and studied regional  development and urban economy at the post-graduate level at the  University of Pennsylvania. He was an academic researcher in  Austria and in Mexico he taught classes at several institutions.  After Carlos Salinas de Gortari took office, Colosio was  appointed president of the PRI, thus becoming one of the party's  youngest leaders. Colosio was also a senator for Sonora State,  secretary of urban development and ecology, and later secretary  of social development, the post he held until he was appointed  PRI presidential candidate in November, 1993.    Colosio's campaign encountered no problems at the outset but  following the Zapatist National Liberation Army's uprising on  New Year's day, he was widely criticized by the opposition and  factions in his own party for his alleged failure to speak out  against the crisis and because his team of advisers was  perceived as weak. It has always been said that Manuel Camacho  Solis, a former Federal District mayor and former foreign  minister, was Colosio's chief rival. Quite recently, however,  Camacho publicly relinquished his presidential ambitions, which  is why the slain PRI candidate seemed to have a clear path to  the presidency unless another party won.    The dramatic void created by Colosio's death has the PRI in  suspense because it must appoint a new presidential candidate.  Many people have mentioned Ernesto Zedillo as a possible  candidate -- totally dismissing Camacho Solis -- a former  education minister, a brilliant economist, and also a former  budget minister, [the latter] a position that had been held by  Mexico's last two presidents, Miguel de la Madrid and Carlos  Salinas de Gortari prior to their election. Nevertheless, some  analysts believe Zedillo is not the politician the PRI needs at  this time; they need someone who is capable of dealing with a  growing wave of popular discontent as well as with the as yet  unresolved conflict in the southern State of Chiapas.    Colosio's assassination took place on the very day the  Mexican Senate approved legislative reforms aimed at making the  election process more honest. The reforms in question resulted  from a strong political struggle to make the elections as  impartial as possible, especially in view of the political  tension experienced in Mexico during past presidential elections.    The PRI is in need of a new party spirit, new work methods,  and less bureaucracy. Colosio once said it should keep the  people at the core of its decisions, which should not be made  from behind a desk. If the armed uprising in Chiapas prompted a  radical change in Mexico, the assassination of the PRI  presidential candidate creates renewed uncertainty and  expectations which will not be easy to fulfill.

In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Dufour has said the  strengthening of bilateral relations constitutes a reply to  Cuban efforts to broaden, more each day, the ties uniting this  Caribbean nation with the rest of the world, particularly with  the European Union.    Dufour recalled the French delegations that recently visited  Cuba were very impressed with the Cuban people's efforts to  overcome their current difficulties.    Our representatives saw how Cubans are working to find  solutions by using imagination with knowledge. When they  returned to Paris, they reported they found a very active people  ready to work with us, the ambassador has added.    After saying the 35 businessmen who accompanied the first  mission had a similar reaction, Dufour said all of this  contributes to a positive evolution of the negotiations.    He said the French Government has guaranteed a $120-million  credit by which Cuba can acquire basic products for industries  and food. He added both countries must work at materializing a  profound development of commercial relations and overcoming  financial difficulties.    Dufour has said he favors finding solutions for investing in  Cuba so that Cuba can obtain resources and credits to be  invested in tourism and to improve the economy.    It will be necessary to find solutions via the Bank of Paris  to grant Cuba the credit it needs. Naturally, via efforts from  both sides, we will be able to sort this obstacle, Dufour said  during the interview.    Dufour stressed the importance of Cuba's current relations  with Europe and the place the European Continent occupies in the  country's investments and trade, with France in an outstanding  position, along with Spain, Germany, Italy, the U.K., and the  Netherlands.    We must help Cuba overcome its economic difficulties and  facilitate its full development.     "
0,FT924-874 ,"FT924-874 _AN-CL2A6AFBFT 921222   FT  22 DEC 92 / End of US embargo 'would revive Cuba': Position in Caribbean holds great promise for export earnings, says Washington think tank      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   CUBA'S exports could recover quickly and strongly as soon as a market economy was introduced and the US trade embargo lifted, according to a study under way by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a leading Washington think tank. Mr Ernest Preeg, former chief economist of the US Agency for International Development and author of the CSIS study, says Cuba has suffered terribly from the cut-off in Soviet aid, which has reduced the island state's imports from Dollars 8bn in 1989 to Dollars 2.2bn in 1992. This has caused food and fuel shortages, but Mr Preeg says the most damaging effect may be the strangling of machinery imports, which is causing a cumulative crumbling of the Cuban industrial base. Market reforms and a lifting of the US embargo could lead to a sharp revival in export earnings, with little of the disruption that has accompanied such reforms in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Tourism receipts and remittances from Cuban exiles, in particular, could start to flow very quickly, Mr Preeg says, but Cuba's position in the Caribbean basin holds great promise for earnings from other agricultural exports as well as from assembly-type manufacturing. Citrus exports, for example, could take off because Cuba has good trees, and needs just one year's pesticides to upgrade its fruit from the lowest concentrate quality to juice or even fresh fruit quality. Mr Preeg warns that the US should not lift its embargo without human rights and democratic reforms, since the end of the embargo alone would give the Castro government between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1.1bn a year of additional foreign exchange inflows, mostly from tourism and remittances. However, he argues for a more active American diplomatic approach towards Cuba, with the development of both carrots and sticks. Critics of the US's Cuban policy complain that severe damage could be done to Cuba's economic and social structures while Washington waits for the Castro government to collapse. Neither the Clinton administration nor the new Congress, however, is likely to favour loosening the embargo. State television in Havana claimed a high turnout in local government elections held on Sunday, news agencies report. By mid-afternoon, nearly 94 per cent of the island's 7.5m registered voters were said to have voted. In the week leading up to the poll, the authorities launched a crackdown against dissidents who said the elections left no room for opponents of one-party Communist rule. Voters in 13,865 constituencies in the election chose one municipal assembly representative. The elections were the first stage of a new electoral process which culminate in direct, parliamentary elections on February 24 within Cuba's one-party system.

In terms of the number of statesmen attending it, the summit  also proved useful for bilateral contacts that otherwise would  not be made. Aside from that, however, it simply served to  emphasize the contradictions and the discrepancies between the  two Ibero-American worlds and point out the differences inside  each of these worlds. It is, therefore, almost impossible to  reach agreements at these summits, particularly on principles so  broad that their contents prove to be obvious and end up by  becoming almost irrelevant.    There is, however, one noticeable exception. Cuba invariably  takes the opportunity afforded to it by Argentine President  Carlos Menem to recruit supporters for its sad cause. This  time, after Menem's customary attack on the Castroist regime,  President Itamar Franco sympathized with Cuba's plight, seeing  ""positive signs of a reform"" being implemented on the island and  defended Cuba's readmission into the Inter-American system.  Commander Fidel Castro decided to contribute to the agenda of  the Summit of the Americas, which will be held in Miami in  December, even though Cuba has not been invited to attend. As  expected, Castro calls for the end of the economic embargo  imposed on Cuba by the United States, the evacuation of  Guantanamo Base and of the U.S. bases in Panama, the pardoning  of the Latin American foreign debt, and the abolition of Super  Law 301.    Ibero-American countries should really do their best to  clarify the distorted image Cuba reflects. For the past decade,  no Latin American country has subjected the island to any  important or special trade restrictions and for the past decade  European countries have been trading with Cuba as they wish.  Despite all this, Cuba's misery is attributed to an embargo  imposed on it by the United States. This is one of those lies  that run the risk of becoming accepted as true out of sheer  repetition. Cuba faces dreadful economic hardships because  Fidel Castro perseveres with his clumsy policies -- maybe  because he chose socialism instead of capitalism, maybe because  he remains in power thanks to his caudillo-like dictatorship  instead of trusting the virtues of liberal democracy. The U.S.  embargo is the best excuse for Fidel Castro's failure.    There is, however, another side to this coin. There is harsh  criticism in the United States of the embargo on Cuba and its  exclusion from the Inter-American system. The U.S. people  understand that Castro uses the embargo to remain in power  without having to commit himself to any reform that would  undoubtedly lead to the redemocratization of the island. An  ever-increasing number of influential U.S. citizens, including  members of the active Cuban colony in Florida, openly call for  normalization of U.S.-Cuban relations. As to Cuba's readmission  into the OAS, it must be recalled that the reasons for  suspending Cuba from this forum have ceased to exist. Cuba no  longer exports the revolution and the original reasons for  temporarily preventing the Cuban Government from fulfilling its  functions at the OAS no longer exist either. In addition, most  OAS member countries have diplomatic and trade relations with  Havana.    In spite of what President Itamar Franco said, there are no  signs in Cuba that democracy is being restored. Economic dogmas  are more lax as a result of the increasing shortage of basic  products and the opening of the country to tourism is the only  way the government could at least partially replace the inflow  of strong currencies previously received from Russia. The  democracies of the hemisphere and President Itamar Franco  should, however, press the Cuban dictator in a friendly way to  agree to freedom-promoting political reforms. This is the  goodwill sign Fidel Castro should give before the Inter-American  community takes another step forward.     "

[Robaina] Our visit to Peru is part of a tour of other Latin  American countries where we will explain to our American  brothers and the entire international community to what extent  Cuba is determined to carry out its project, without straying  from the historic path it has chosen, in this time of crisis.    The idea is to tell everyone what aspects of our revolution  are not negotiable and what aspects of our socio-economic  program are. Our presence here is also our response to an  international campaign against Cuba. It is our duty to break up  this negative campaign.    [LA REPUBLICA] What are the aspects of socialist Cuba that  can be negotiated? How do you think Cuba should adapt to the new  international context that surrounds it?    [Robaina] This process will, precisely, allow a new type of  relationship with the world. We haven't asked anybody for a  correlation of political ideologies in order to establish an  economic relationship, and this is where we will have to adapt  to a completely new situation. In this regard there are national  interests that match the interests of foreign investors. What is  a need for Cuba might be an investment opportunity for many and,  modestly speaking, we also believe Cuba has a lot to offer the  world.    [LA REPUBLICA] What guarantees and incentives does Cuba  currently offer foreign capital?    [Robaina] Much is said about what Cuba can offer foreign  investors and facts have proven that Cuba, definitely, has a lot  to attract foreign investors. This is why we seek meetings, to  negotiate and get more acquainted, because only thus will we be  able to establish stable new rules. This is why we must point  out that Cuba has opened its doors to foreign capital with legal  and constitutional backing. This backing is clear and flexible  enough to avoid any suspicion.    [LA REPUBLICA] What Cuban sectors are more attractive to  foreign capital? What products does your country offer the  international markets aside from sugar, of course?    [Robaina] We are taking very positive steps in the tourism  field. There is also great potential in the iron and steel  industry, in the construction sector. We also have a wide range  of products in which the international market is interested such  as nickel, oil, and the production and processing of citrus  fruit.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is this new open door policy particularly  directed to a certain market?    [Robaina] The opening to the international market is a  priority issue for Cuba, but within this framework, we want to  give even greater preference to Latin American investors.    [LA REPUBLICA] How can potential foreign investors be  certain  they will enjoy full guarantees in Cuba?    [Robaina] Those investors from various parts of the world  who  already are investing in Cuba can say that better than us  because it is a fact. We have investors from Spain, Canada,  Italy, France, and also from Latin American countries such as  Colombia, Argentina, Brazil. They are not only looking into the  possibilities of investing but already have invested in our  country, and our relationship with them is excellent.    [LA REPUBLICA] This means that the future of foreign  investments in Cuba is quite promising.    [Robaina] It should be pointed out that Cuba's relationship  with foreign investors is not as smooth and easy as in other  countries. It must be taken into account that we are promoting  this opening with great opposition. In order to attract foreign  investors we have not only had to grant them a legal framework  that would give them guarantees, but we also have had to be  quite bold and brave. It is no secret that whoever tries to make  deals with Cuba is subject to great pressure. If the new  investors want legal guarantees, they already have them.  Moreover, there is the guarantee of the facts, there is the  testimony of those already investing in Cuba.    [LA REPUBLICA] What are the expectations regarding Cuba's  relationship with Peru in this new phase?    [Robaina] In all our commercial relationships, Cuba does not  go around the world only saying what it needs. We, modestly,  also offer what could be of help to friendly countries. In sum,  I believe that in Peru's case we have a lot to offer in the  sugar industry; we have a tourism market that may interest many  investors; we have significant technological development in the  medical and paramedical fields, in the production of medical  equipment, important developments in the biotechnology field; we  also have important experience in the sports field. We hope to  increase our relationship with Peru in the commercial and  investments fields, which will, in turn, strengthen our  traditional historic and cultural ties.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is the U.S. commercial blockade imposed more  than 30 years ago the only obstacle to Cuba's new political  opening being fully successful in the near future?    [Robaina] We have never said that the blockade is the only  cause of our problems. The problems Cuba has experienced lately  are the combination of a series of factors but, definitely, the  blockade is the greatest obstacle. Now, more than ever in this  crucial phase, we have to bear a tremendous pressure exerted not  only directly against Cuba but also against whoever deals with  or invests in Cuba.    [LA REPUBLICA] Is tourism the field in which Cuba has  attracted the most foreign investment?    [Robaina] Let us talk about priorities. Tourism is a market  with lots of possibilities for Cuba and important steps in this  area have been taken. Cuba's climate is very attractive to any  tourist in the world. This is why we have given tourism the same  level of development as other very promising fields for foreign  investors. However, we should bear in mind that we have resorted  to tourism out of need, due to the difficulties Cuba is facing.  But it is no secret to anybody that, aside from the capital,  tourism in countries such as ours have a very high political and  social cost.    [LA REPUBLICA] Does this mean that tourism for Cuba  represents more problems than solutions?    [Robaina] No. That is not so. If we have promoted tourism in  Cuba it is because we have no alternatives at this very  difficult moment. But, fortunately, tourism has developed at a  time when the Cuban people have reached a cultural,  technological, scientific, and political level that has allowed  us to face the opening to the tourism industry in a suitable  way. There is no doubt that tourism today is as important as any  of our harvests.    [LA REPUBLICA] On the domestic front, how does the Cuban  Government intend to face the black market's socio-economic  problem?    [Robaina] The so-called black market exists; we do not deny  nor try to conceal our problems. Everyone is aware that in times  of crisis and in the midst of such adverse circumstances as the  ones we are enduring, the surfacing of the black market is  something ""natural"" from the economic viewpoint. The black  market speculates with the peoples' needs. What we have to do  about this and other social problems is to normalize life in  Cuba, produce more to meet the peoples' needs. This challenge  requires the implementation of very special measures that adjust  to the new circumstances under which we live. This is the reason  for the great nationwide debate to get everyone to participate  in the decisionmaking on these new measures. These measures  will be assessed and adopted by the National Assembly of the  People's Government convened for 1 May.     "

Zaldivar, whose comments were released  today, said he was really impressed with the dramatic situation  affecting the Cuban people, who ""are starving because rationing  is brutally strict.""    Zaldicar, who belongs to the most important party in the  coalition governing Chile, said cooperation must be sought to  find a political solution that would allow Cuba to evolve toward  democracy.    According to Zaldivar, the way to reach a political opening  must be discussed with Cuban President Fidel Castro. He said:  ""Fidel Castro is maintaining his leadership. I saw that. The  people are with Fidel Castro. And we should take note of that.""    Zaldivar has the impression that Cuba is a besieged region  in  the medieval sense, which even creates the fear that the crisis  may evolve into a collective sacrifice, which he believes would  be inadmissible. He added: ""We should follow a path toward  opening up relations, not with the objective of validating a  regime with which I disagree, but in order to help Cuba in a  transition toward democracy.""    During his stay in Havana, Zaldivar met with the Cuban  ministers of finance and agriculture, but he did not have any  contact with the opposition. Christian Democratic Party  President Gutemberg Martinez, however, will meet with all Cuban  political sectors during the visit he will make to Cuba in the  next few days.    Zaldivar went to Cuba as president of the Spanish foundation  Ibero-American-European Research and Promotion Center, which he  created when he was living in exile in Madrid.    Diplomatic relations between Havana and Santiago were broken  in 1973 after the military coup that overthrew the Chilean  Socialist government headed by Salvador Allende. Relations were  resumed at the consular level in 1990 after the return of  democracy in Chile. Various Chilean Socialist and Social  Democratic sectors of the government Coalition of Parties for  Democracy have expressed support for the full reestablishment of  relations with Cuba, which is expected to be achieved in the  next few weeks.

Salinas also states that the ties between Mexico and Cuba  have, throughout history and within the context of their  respectful bilateral relationship, been marked by warm ties  between the two peoples and offered a gateway for international  cooperation. This has come to symbolize the importance of such  contacts.    In his request, Salinas also points out that the profound  and  fruitful political dialogue between Cuba and Mexico, at the  highest levels, has opened the way for all of Mexico's  presidents since 1975 to visit the island during their  presidential term.    He recalls that Cuban President Fidel Castro has also  visited  Mexico on three occasions during the current administration (for  the Salinas de Gortari inauguration in 1988, then to attend the  meeting of the Group of Three [G-3] held on Cozumel Island in  1993, and to participate in the First Ibero-American Summit in  Guadalajara, also in 1993).    The request concludes that the presence of the Mexican head  of state in Cuba will serve to promote an even closer bilateral  relationship, examine the countries' joint agenda, and explore  new ways of diversifying and strengthening their ties. This  visit to Cuba was previously scheduled for last January, but was  postponed due to the armed conflict that broke out in the  southern State of Chiapas.    Regarding the Ibero-American Summit, Salinas states in his  request that this type of meeting has proven its value as a  political forum at the highest level and as an instrument to  promote agreement in fields such as education, science, culture,  Indian development, international law, and social and economic  development. He stated that among the Mexican president's  reasons for going to Cartagena de Indias is that the G-3 nations  (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) planned to sign the Economic  Complementary Agreement during their stay.    The first meeting of the presidents of Latin America, Spain,  and Portugal took place in the Mexican city of Guadalajara in  1991. It was followed by similar meetings in Madrid, Spain in  1992, and Salvador de Bahia, Brazil, in 1993.    Salinas will end his six-year term in office in December of  this year after the federal election on August 21.     "

He said that in the near future a Ministry of Tourism will  be  officially created to replace the existing National Institute of  Tourism (INTUR). The ministry will have a more compact  organization, with 50 or 60 people, and will not be affected by  the administration.    Cienfuegos stated that the ministry will draft the country's  policies on developing tourism, control the activities of  existing or new tourism institutions, participate in  price-drafting policies, and be tasked with initial training.    He said that as a result of INTUR's shutting down, three  hotel chains have been created, each with 6,000 or 7,000 rooms:  Gran Caribe, Horizonte, and Islazul. The first two will be  primarily for international tourists and the third for local  vacationers.    Gran Caribe will control four- and five-star installations  and be led by Javier Ardizones, former Cuban ambassador to  Italy. Another former diplomat, Jose Fernandez de Cosio (until  recently Cuba's ambassador to Mexico), will head the Horizonte  group, and INTUR Director Rafael Sed Perez will take over as  Islazul director.    Likewise, Cienfuegos added, Marinas Puerto Sol has been  created, the Cubatur tour company, plus the territorial  recreation and tourism enterprises, which will operate under the  name Rumbos.    These last ones will be tasked with increasing, organizing,  promoting, and selling products from the areas where they  operate and like the hotel chains or cruise lines, will operate  under the principle of competition and efficiency.    In every case, he stressed, the newly created institutions  will enter the market to compete with the product offered by the  Cubanacan Corporation or the Gaviota Corporation tourist group  -- both also subject to structural improvement processes, but to  a lesser extent.    Asked about future mergers with foreign firms, Cienfuegos  said that each enterprise will determine their particular needs.    Due to the old structure under which the tourism industry  operated, lately there had been sale problems, Cienfuegos said,  which resulted in fewer holiday makers than originally estimated.    Some of the figures were not as good as they should have  been, Cienfuegos said, and added that Cuba received 560,000  tourists during 1993.    Gross income increased 30 percent compared to 1993 [as  published] and increased to $700-$720 million. During the  current year this figure should increase similarly, Cienfuegos  estimated.    He added that at any rate tourism will earn for the Cuban  economy more than $1 billion in 1995, even if the actual number  of tourists does not reach 1 million.     "

Salinas will arrive in this capital on Monday, 1100 local  time, where he will devote most of his time to an interview with  Cuban President Fidel Castro. With Castro, he will engage in an  overall analysis of the bilateral political, economic, cultural,  and trade relations, a high-ranking Cuban Foreign Ministry  official indicated.    Jorge Bolanos, deputy foreign relations minister, emphasized  in an interview with PRENSA LATINA that Salinas' presence in  Cuba represents the continuation of relations that historically  have been maintained at a high level. Bolanos, who counts on a  30-year diplomatic career, also highlighted the independent  nature of Mexico's foreign policy and the priority Cuba puts in  these relations.    Bolanos disclosed that the preparatory mission of Mexican  officials, led by General Director of Protocol Ricardo Ampudia,  has concluded its meeting with the local Foreign Ministry,  during which they agreed that the visit should concentrate on  the official conversations of both high-level delegations.    He highlighted the importance of Salinas' presence in Cuba  at  a time when the United States is attempting to reinforce the  economic blockade, considering this a sign of political  willingness on the part of Mexican authorities to reaffirm their  relations with the Island and to continue developing these in  the future.    Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias gave a  similar  opinion, emphasizing that the conversations at the highest  levels between both nations will be intense and multifaceted.  New ideas and initiatives will emerge from this dialogue to  continue the momentum of bilateral ties, Tello told PRENSA  LATINA.    Another important aspect of the dialogue between the  presidents of Cuba and Mexico will be the exchange of points of  view on the Ibero-American summit to be held on 14-15 June in  Cartagena de Indias, Colombia. Mexico was the only Latin  American nation that decided to maintain its relations with Cuba  in 1962 when the OAS ruled, under Washington's pressure, to have  its member nations break ties with the Island.

Members of the rightist opposition voiced  skepticism.    Yesterday, 4 May, Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa  Serrano confirmed the government's plan to sign a cooperation  agreement with Cuba though he reiterated that an eventual  resumption of diplomatic ties with Fidel Castro's government is  not on the list of subjects that the Chilean Government will  assess in the short term.    Today, Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona said his  party ""enthusiastically supports"" the tightening of friendship  and cooperation ties with the Cuban people.    Christian Democratic Party [PDC] President Gutenberg  Martinez  asserted his party is in favor of cooperating with Cuba ""from a  solidarity viewpoint in view of the difficulties the Cuban  people are enduring,"" adding that cooperation ""should be granted  without imposing any conditions."" Martinez also upheld the end  of the U.S. economic embargo on the island because, in his  opinion, this might encourage the Cuban authorities to implement  a greater economic and political domestic opening. Martinez  will preside over a PDC delegation that will travel to Cuba this  month.    Chilean Communist Party leader Carlos Toro asked Eduardo  Frei's government for the immediate normalization of diplomatic  relations with Cuba while Radical Party President Senator  Anselmo Sule commented that there is a certain degree of  cooperation with Cuba.    Sule mentioned a $10 million credit the Chile State Bank  recently granted the Cuban Government to finance the purchase of  Chilean foodstuff and added that Chile can cooperate with Cuba  ""in several aspects."" Sule said that among the incentives are  the activities that some Chilean companies are developing in  Cuba, the extension of export credits to that country, and the  promotion of social development actions on the island.    The rightist Democratic Independent Union (UDI), voiced its  agreement with the establishment of a cooperation program ""that  does not encourage the perpetuation of the current Cuban  regime."" UDI Senator Beltran Urenda, member of the Senate's  Foreign Commission, believes any aid for Cuba ""should seek a  change in the Cuba Government, a democratic opening."" He said  ""any support"" that may help Fidel Castro's regime to remain in  power ""is dangerous.""     "

Russia is now behind the Serbs and is trying to do its  best to defend its traditional ally. In fact, this trend was  already visible after NATO threatened to bomb the Serbs. Russia  strongly opposed the threat and insisted that the settlement of  the Bosnian conflict be referred to the UN Security Council. If  the proposal is approved, Russia would certainly use its veto  power to defend the Serbs. [passage omitted]    There are several reasons why Russia, which earlier  supported  the West, is now defending the Serbs. First, the Serbs are a  traditional ally of Russia. Although Russia is no longer the  godfather [preceding word in English] of its former satellite  nations, it is still obligated to defend the Serbs, who used to  be part of its hegemony.    Second, Russia appears to have been angry that it has  totally  been ignored by the West in the Bosnian conflict. The NATO  ultimatum, for example, was obviously issued without taking  Russia into account. Russian generals feel that Russia, a  former superpower and former leader of the defunct Warsaw Pact,  has been ignored by NATO. Accordingly, they have tried from the  very beginning to obstruct NATO actions.    Third, in the context of international politics, Russia  wants  to ""reemerge"" as a superpower by showing its opposition to the  Western scenario in the Balkans. The fact that its economy has  collapsed and domestic politics is in disarray is one thing,  while involvement in an international conflict is another. In  any case, Russia still has military strength that needs to be  reckoned with.    The Serbs are, of course, exploiting such a situation. They  believe that the West--half-heartedly and irreversibly dragged  into the conflict--will think twice before crushing them if  Russia is involved on their side.    Of course, Russia will not intervene hastily because it has  to be cautious toward the United States and Europe, whose  assistance is by all means needed to support the reforms in  Russia. Regardless of this, the Serbian policy of using Russia  as a ""shield,"" may, however, complicate the situation in the  Balkans.    Even NATO, the United Nations, and the United States  continue  to have different views about the best way to settle the  conflict. NATO's ""unanimous"" decision to give the Serbs the  ultimatum was in fact not made easily because each NATO member  feels that it has a better way to settle the conflict. Thus,  imagine what will happen if the Russian factor is actually  played in the delicate Bosnian conflict! Obviously, such a  situation will benefit the Serbs the most.     "

According to a Radio Rebelde report, Martinez, who is also  the director of the World Economy Research Center, argued in a  conference with journalists and students at Havana University  that the worst was left behind in 1993 and predicted that the  second half of 1994 will show improvement.    Martinez stated that the improvement will become evident  through a stop in the fall of economic indicators, a trend that  arose following the collapse of the European Socialist Bloc and  the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1991, as well as through  modest increases in some strategic sectors.    Martinez added that the consolidation of the Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] with slight increases in  food production and a significant reduction in costs will begin  to exert a positive influence and so will the financial  reorganization measures that will be implemented this year.    The UBPC operate on state property and are exploited by  groups of workers who employ production means that were bought  from the former agricultural-livestock enterprises.

After maintaining a virtual news blackout on the 1991-1992 sugar crop for five months, the Caribbean island's government is now making the harvest a national public issue. 'Our sole option. . . is not to lose a single tonne of sugar,' it said. The government urged the country's sugar workers to make a maximum effort over the next few weeks, a message reinforced by daily television propaganda spots focusing on the harvest. The official media describe the current season as one of the most difficult ever experienced by Cuba, which has traditionally been the world's biggest exporter of sugar. The 1991-1992 harvest started late and has been bedevilled by shortages of oil, lubricants and spare parts that are essential to keep mechanical harvesters and mills running. Adding to the urgency is the possible onset of spring rains in May which could disrupt a late-finishing harvest. Even more worrying for Cuba, the difficulties come at a time when it needs every tonne of sugar it can produce to exchange for vital imports of oil, machinery spares and food.

Perlamutrov, corresponding member of  Russian Academy of Economic Sciences, doctor of economic  sciences, professor, and deputy director of the Market Problems  Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences: ""Reforming the  Central Bank: Financial-Economic and Political Aspects""]    [Text] A message from the president of the Russian  Federation spoke of the need for reformation of the Central Bank  of Russia, the ultimate aim of which was the creation of a  federal reserve system. How do the reformers envisage the  Central Bank? For the time being it is not clear--there is no  precisely formulated concept. One thing is clear--the process of  reform will be under the president's control. In an interview by  our newspaper (BIZNES I BANKI No 17, 1994), F.Ya. Livshits,  director of a presidential group of experts, called upon the  Central Bank of Russia, scholars, and bankers to express their  opinion on the subject of their vision of a new banking system  for our country. Before posing the problem of converting the  Central Bank of Russia to a federal reserve system, however, the  status and authority of the Federation's constituents should  obviously be determined. This opinion was expressed by those  participating in an applied science seminar (Moscow, 14 April  this year) at which a number of problems related to reforming  Russian banking systems were discussed. It was organized by the  Market Problems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences,  the Energiya Association of Independent Commercial Banks, and  the newspaper BIZNES I BANKI. We offer for our readers'  attention the speeches of the seminar participants.    We have just heard the ideas of F.Ya. Livshits, doctor of  economic science. I have the impression that these are not the  thoughts of a financier, or a loan officer, or a money  specialist, but of an economist in general. The question right  now is really not whether the president does or does not need to  issue a document on organizing financial-industrial groups--this  is a matter for a different level of managing the economy. It is  a question of something quite different, above all, of the  processes in the entire financial-economic sphere. The main  thing is that, after all, we are not simply bringing about a  reform, we are in a profound economic crisis. Industrial  production has dropped by 60 percent, agricultural--by  one-third, and putting new production funds into  operation--almost 100-fold. This is not simply an economic  crisis, it is the collapse of the country's economy. Even the  crisis in the American economy at the beginning of the 1930's  was a lesser one. Now they tell us that a ""constriction"" of  Russian industry has taken place. The Russian language is a  splendid language, and one can find many synonyms for any  concept, but the word ""constriction"" in no way corresponds to  the concept ""crash.""    As a result of Gaydar's reforms, the Russian economy has  arrived at a state in which it soon may not need any banking  system at all. It will either function in a regime like the  economy of ""militant communism,"" when it has no need at all for  either a banking or a monetary system, but needs a Gosplan,  Gossnab, etc., or it will arrive at a state of utter chaos.    There has never been a situation in the 20th century when in  peacetime, in an industrially developed country, production has  dropped on such a scale. In the report which we heard from the  director of the group of experts affiliated with the Russian  Federation president, however, he speaks, in such calm academic  tones, about converting the Central Bank of Russia to a federal  reserve system of the type that exists in the United States.  Generally speaking, this sort of structure for central banks is  characteristic of large countries--the United States, Germany,  India. This is possible, however, when the situation in the  national economy is more or less stable. It is highly doubtful  that, with a general crisis in the national economy, the problem  of reorganizing the central bank into a federal reserve system  should appear as top-priority.    Many regional organs of authority are actively coming out in  favor of reorganizing the Central Bank of Russia into a federal  system. They picture each oblast or autonomous republic as now  becoming a competent member of the federal system. But why? In  those same United States there are 15 banking districts, when  there are 50 states. In general, it is not compulsory, or even  necessary, for the administrative boundaries of territorial  formations to coincide with the boundaries of the banking  districts. It is much more logical for these latter to coincide  with the boundaries of the economic regions of a country, such  as the Center of Russia, the Northwest, the Central Chernozem  area, the Urals, West Siberia, etc.    No reforms in Russia will be successful if we reject, from  the very start, the experience of other countries that have  undergone huge critical shocks and have found a way out of them.  At the beginning of the 1930's a monstrous economic crisis shook  the United States. Industrial production dropped by 48 percent,  one-third of the farmers and 5,000 commercial banks were ruined,  and the nation's unemployed numbered about 14 million. F.  Roosevelt, who had become president of the country, put a series  of anticrisis laws through congress in the early days of his  presidency. The first of them was the ""Emergency Law on Banks.""  The houses of congress passed it in one day and the president  signed it, that is, it went into force, in the evening. The  status of commercial and investment banks was separated, which  could not prevent mass speculation by the commercial banks in  ""short money"" (which is widespread in Russia right now), but  stimulated capital investments, which can only be the basis for  an upsurge in the national economy. Unless there is an increase  in capital investments in spheres such as agriculture, power  engineering, machine-building, and light, food, and  pharmaceutical industry, no monetary, customs, price, or state  budgetary measures will provide a positive return for the  national economy.    The experience of developing European and other countries  after the second world war is extremely helpful to us right now.  The regeneration of the economy, after the military collapse, on  normal market bases, following the rigid state control of  enterprises is very instructive. Once again, the main factor was  the organization of investments, not the conversion of a unitary  central bank into a federal reserve system or vice-versa. For  example, Japan got out of the postwar economic crisis along two  main channels. In the first place, the enterprises existing  mainly through the treasury, in the course of approximately 10  years after 1945 converted to commercial bases, to  self-financing, and moreover they were divided up, merged,  modernized, respecialized, etc., preparing for market conditions  of operation. In the second place, the law established that  commercial banks were obligated to transfer a quota of their  liabilities ""to the custody"" of a central investment bank. This  created a source of investment for regeneration and structural  and technological reorganization of the country's economy. The  results of these measures were manifested in the postwar  augmented growth and improvement in the country's national  economy in 1970-1990.    One more point--the interrelations between the central bank  and the commercial banks. While up to the middle of our century,  the Ministry of Finance and the treasury were the main monetary  center for the state everywhere, since gold or primarily gold  working capital were emitted, now the central banks come forth  as this center. The country's central banks have essentially  become the dictator of its monetary economy and relations with  other countries. In our country the laws in force on the Central  Bank and on commercial banks grant the latter more rights than  is accepted in other industrial countries. This is one of the  reasons why the economy has been brought to an increasingly  chaotic state. For example, the Central Bank cannot or does not  have the right to demand from a commercial bank everything  necessary to analyze the statistics on its activity. Obviously,  a unified law on the country's banking system is needed, in  which the rights and duties of both the upper and lower levels  of this system would be unequivocally stipulated. In addition,  in a period of crisis, a third level of the banking system  should be assigned--investment banks, as was done in crisis  conditions in the United States, Japan, France, and other  countries. On the whole, during the period of crisis, Russia  needs emergency anticrisis laws, including those in the banking  sphere. As we emerge from the crisis, measures can be taken to  convert the present central banking system into a federal  reserve system. But not before that. Preliminary developments,  of course, must begin right now.     "

He said that this decision could only be made jointly by all  members of the group, and that he was fairly certain that this  step would be taken.    He said, however, that the contribution Russia was making to  the world economy was much below that of most advanced  countries. He was confident, however, that once the dust  settles and the reforms were complete, Russia would start  getting rich. Its wealth was in its highly educated and skilled  workforce.    Fall did not think that Western aid could solve all Russian  problems. The West is sometimes criticized for helping Russia  too little too late. There are reasons for that, however.  Numerous entrepreneurs think that Russia is not predictable or  stable enough and demand safety guarantees for their capital, he  said. Russia has to create a more favorable environment for  western private investments. He said that numerous Russian  businessmen preferred to keep their capital in foreign banks.  If Russian money flees Russia, why should the West invest in  it, he asked.    Fall emphasized that the West continued to support President  Boris Yeltsin, not as an individual but as the leader of Russian  reforms. Meanwhile the West understood that Russia had come  across numerous internal problems. This was probably the reason  of the ""painful reaction"" to contacts between foreign political  figures and the Russian opposition. British Premier John Major  had recently visited the U.S. where he had meetings with  representatives of various political movements. Nobody asked  him why he had spent so much time with George Bush or Ross  Perrot or accused him of pursuing a wrong line, Fall said.    He emphasized that a fully-fledged European security system  was out of the question without Russia. He thought that the  geostrategic environment was favorable for a system which  sidelined neither Russia nor East European countries. A  security system must be set up as soon and as broadly as  possible.     "

Shatalin, president of the Reform  international foundation, academician of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, under the ""Point of View"" rubric: ""The Market Needs To  Be Managed""]    [Text] The Economics Division of the Russian Academy  of Sciences and the ""Reform"" International Foundation have  prepared the joint report, ""Socioeconomic Transformations in  Russia: The Current Situation and New Approaches,"" and forwarded  it to the supreme leaders of the state. The report analyzes the  progress of the reform and the outcome of the socioeconomic  development of Russia in the last two years. Conclusions have  been drawn about the need for a new strategy for socioeconomic  transformations which would make it possible to complete the  formation of the model of a socially oriented market economy  that would be suitable for the conditions of Russia and would  ensure its position among the leaders of the world economy. At  the request of the editorial office, Stanislav Sergeyevich  Shatalin, the president of the Reform international foundation  and an academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, discussed  the main provisions of the report.    Two years, 1992 and 1993, is a sufficient period of time to  make it possible to sum up the outcome of ""shock therapy"" and to  evaluate its results. The latter are far from unambiguous, which  is quite natural. Socioeconomic developments always have their  positives and negatives. The final balance and the evaluation of  the consequences of emergent tendencies are important in this  matter.    So, positives first. The process of overcoming the total  statization of the economy and creating diverse forms and types  of economic operation has continued and largely accelerated. The  formation of an infrastructure of a market economy and its  characteristic mechanisms has begun; the mechanism of supply and  demand has begun operating, albeit with disruptions; the first  signs of competition have appeared. The mentality of economic  cadres who are adjusting to the conditions of an emerging market  economy is changing. A new generation of managers--educated,  energetic, and free of the baggage of old dogmas and habits--is  assuming management responsibilities at various levels of  economic operations. A stratum of entrepreneurs has gradually  been evolving.    All of this makes it possible to evaluate favorably the  movement toward a market economy that has gotten under way. At  the same time, we must note the continuously growing, and  largely excessive, ""price"" that our society has already paid and  will be forced to pay for the selected strategy and tactics of a  transition to a market economy.    The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a  result of ""shock therapy,"" and its internal structure are  affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly  painful manner, and are fraught with the danger of irreversible  destruction of the economic and scientific-technical potential  of the country.    In the last two years alone, the fall in production on key  macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the  precrisis level it approximated 40 percent. I will stress,  first, that the drop in production is of a universal rather than  structural nature. Second, it has affected the most progressive  and high-technology industries and types of production to the  greatest degree.    A slump in investment activity is the most profound and  dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the  last two years alone, the volume of investment in the Russian  economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to  about 40 percent of the precrisis level.    The amortization of fixed production assets has already come  close to 60 percent--the threshold beyond which the physical  destruction of the production potential of the country begins.  Our society has become a witness to a growing number of  accidents and disasters. The number of unprofitable enterprises  and those with slim profit margins is growing. The  disorganization of the financial system, the ""war of the  budgets"" between the center and many regions, the payments  crisis, and uncontrolled emissions all testify to the loss of  state control over monetary circulation.    The growth of inflation that was triggered by the  liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. The  failure of combating inflation is explained by a failure to  understand its nature in the economy of Russia, for example, due  to underestimating its highly monopolized structure, ignoring  the factor of cost inflation, and correspondingly opting for  inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of  demand constraints. As we can see, the hope for financial  stabilization without overcoming the slump in production is  turning out to be illusory and theoretically unsound.    The depletion of social resources for the continuation of  ""shock therapy"" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of  this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the  population by a factor of more than two, accompanied by a sharp  differentiation in incomes, has aggravated the social situation  in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent of the  most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same proportion  of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10. One-third of  the population has incomes below the official subsistence  minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about 15 million  people, are below the threshold of physical survival. This is a  signal that the society is entering a social conflict zone. The  social price paid by society for the ""shock therapy"" has  exceeded the maximum permissible limits.    A deep crisis and social calamity are not the result of  unsolved problems that had piled up in the past, isolated  miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative forces  (although all of these have also occurred), but rather an  unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and  the methods used to carry it out.    It appears strange, but it looks as if some political  leaders  both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to believe  that any change in the chosen course of the economic reform  means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system.  The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for  deliberately refusing to seek national accord.    In the December election, the people resolutely came out  against experiments associated with ""shock therapy."" Only 8  percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's Choice  bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and champions of  this course. To continue this course in the future means to act  against the clearly stated will of the people.    The RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Economics Division and  the Reform international foundation believe that, in the name of  rejuvenating Russia as a superpower, it is necessary to evaluate  the results of the past two years critically and honestly, and  to work out a new strategy for socioeconomic transformations.    We have selected the following as the key parameters of the  ultimate objective of reforms in the Russian economy which  should certainly be made more specific and refined with regard  to individual stages and time periods.    It is the orientation of the economy, in terms of its  structure and motivation, toward accomplishing social tasks,  attaining a high standard of living, and creating institutions  and mechanisms that make it possible to combine economic  effectiveness and social justice. It is the formation of a  modern system of market relations and mechanisms with an active  role of state regulation of the economy, a combination and  mutual complementariness of various forms of property and  economic operations that ensure stable motivation for  entrepreneurial and labor activity. Finally, it is the creation  of a highly effective economy that is flexible and receptive to  scientific-technical innovations and continually changing social  and personal needs.    The RAN Economics Division and the Reform international  foundation propose certain initial principles for the  development of such a strategy.    First. Social indicators of the reform should be  specified and set forth: its goals, as well as the borderlines  and limits the transcending of which is impermissible under any  circumstances and for any considerations--a guaranteed  subsistence minimum, an employment threshold, the proportion of  expenditures for education and health care in the composition of  the gross national product, and others.    Second. The naive belief in the automatic nature  of healing the economy with the help of impersonal monetarism  should be abandoned, and the natural and commonly accepted  functions of state regulation should be restored. As we see it,  by way of priority measures the accent must be shifted toward  supporting material production and stimulating business  activity, including investment activity.    It is necessary to develop an effective industrial policy,  including structural policy, which will be called upon to give  the Russian economy a modern image and to improve the  competitiveness of domestic products on the world and domestic  markets. Also, the supreme power of the law should be ensured on  a priority basis, and well-conceived and reliable economic  legislation, stable ""rules of the game"" must be created in the  absence of which it is impossible for entities in the market  economy to function successfully.    Third. We should make a transition to new  principles for financial stabilization in the national economy.  They include the elimination of disproportions between  material-tangible and financial-outlay aspects of reproduction;  the mobilization of domestic sources of  accumulation--depreciation allowances, profits, and monetary  savings of the population; a combination of a firm financial and  credit policy with selective support for priority sectors and  production facilities; the use of various forms of regulation of  prices and incomes, including the establishment of price  parities and cartel agreements; and the improvement of tax and  budget policies.    Fourth. The course toward the formation of a  unified all-Russian market, taking into account the  peculiarities of the federated arrangement of Russia, should be  made the foundation for the reform. This means shifting the  focus of implementing the economic reform to the localities,  with the center retaining the function associated with the  formation and operation of a unified market. At issue is the  development of uniform ""rules of the game,"" the regulation of  monetary circulation, the commonality of the customs territory,  and ensuring the freedom of movement of goods, financial  resources, and labor among regions.    Fifth. The issue of the role of outside assistance  in reforming the Russian economy should be reconsidered, with  orientation toward the domestic scientific, technical, and  production potential and internal sources of accumulation being  made the foundation of this strategy. This does not run counter  to the course of an open economy or of Russia organically  entering the world economy. However, this presupposes that  Russia may and should solve its own problems itself for the most  part.    Sixth. The problem of transforming ownership  arrangements plays a special role. This is one of the key  avenues for the further development and enhancement of the  economic reform.    We should overcome the ownerless, no-man's nature of  property, and help each of its forms (including the state form)  find a real, motivated, and responsible master. There should be  a gradual movement toward a modern multisectoral economy, in  which most diverse forms of property are combined and mutually  complement one another: private and state property, cooperative  and municipal property, the property of public and religious  organizations, foreign property, and various mixed forms of  property.    Ensuring the growth of effectiveness and attracting  investment to expand and upgrade production should be the main  criteria for making particular decisions concerning  privatization. It is necessary consistently to wind down voucher  privatization as a populist direction which is not able to solve  the problem of social justice but boosts the growth of inflation  and the disintegration of the production potential.    The almost complete loss of manageability in the economy has  become an extremely dangerous peculiarity of the current  situation in Russia. A deepening managerial crisis has begun in  the country; virtually not a single state structure remains that  has not lost its authority and has not been deprived of genuine  devices for affecting processes under way in the economy. Laws  and edicts are adopted, decrees are issued, and programs are  approved, but the management mechanism does not operate at any  level.    The continuation of this situation renders the development  of  any program for enhancing the reforms simply nonsensical; the  programs are doomed to failure in advance. Not a single one of  the tasks of overcoming the crisis in the country and a  constructive continuation of reforms can be accomplished in the  absence of immediately overcoming the organizational muddle in  all elements and at all levels and eliminating defects and  disharmony in the management mechanism. The existing power  vacuum should be filled to the full extent by restoring the  status of the principles of state regulation and substantially  increasing the level of manageability of the economy.    The manageability of the economy is an antipode to a power  vacuum and lawlessness, and it should not be confused with a  return to the administrative-command system.     "

Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the resort has several foreign-managed hotels. Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October. This suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba during this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the winter if it proves successful. Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take 1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to 3,000 a year. Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an estimated 3,000 UK residents are believed to have visited Cuba last year. The island is a popular holiday destination for Canadians, Germans and other Europeans. The growth of Cuban tourism has been hampered, however, by hostility from the US. Mr Carrick said he believed the UK market had been slow to take off because attitudes to Cuba had been affected by Britain's close ties with the US. He said tensions between the US and Cuba had led to a 'somewhat jaundiced' view of the island in the UK. Americans made the island a playground of the Caribbean in its pre-Communist days. Mr Carrick said Airtours would not hide Cuba's problems from its customers. Brochures would tell them that buses in Cuba were irregular, that taxis were sometimes hard to find and that petrol was rationed. He said he had been assured that visitors to Varadero would have enough petrol for their hire cars.   Companies:-  Airtours.     Unijet.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

Lestelle told the press that this  agreement will trigger the development of relations between the  two countries within a very short term.    [Begin Lestelle recording] The signing of this agreement  implies, first of all, something very significant for the two  countries. This agreement extends far beyond the regions, far  beyond government decisions, and far beyond other problems. It  will become the main gate between Argentina and Cuba for the  treatment of other problems, which perhaps could be even more  important than the drug issue.    During a week of work in the areas of health, education, and  the police, each group will meet independently and prepare a  program. This program will determine how we will be able to  provide assistance to Cuba, and how Cuba can provide us with  assistance as well. We are going to analyze this further on a  later date, but I also think that Argentine Health Ministry  officials must visit Cuba to see the development of the family  doctor program. We have only a brief sketch of this in  Argentina, nothing else. By virtue of these meetings, we must  establish what we can do here and what you can do in Argentina.  So this possibility must remain open. [end recording]    I wish to add that Dr. Lestelle heads an Argentine  delegation  that has been visiting Cuba for several days, seeking the  signing of this cooperation agreement for the antidrug fight. I  would also like to tell our listeners that Cuba is a signatory  of the UN convention for the fight against international drug  trafficking and has agreed to sign bilateral agreements with  many countries of the region.

From there and as part of  the process of integrating into its geographic surroundings,  Cuba will promote commercial, cultural, and athletic relations  with the entire eastern Caribbean.    Just before leaving for Bridgetown, Cuban Ambassador Lazaro  Cabezas told PRENSA LATINA that the Barbadian Government's  decision to authorize the opening of a Cuban Embassy in its  territory was further confirmation of the Caribbean countries'  willingness to integrate the largest of the Antillean islands  into the region where it rightfully belongs.    ""Cuba and Barbados have had diplomatic relations since 8  December 1972, but based on our country's rapprochement with the  Anglo-Caribbean community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common Market],  we now have the opportunity to establish a Cuban mission in  Bridgetown, Cabezas said.    He reported that the main purpose of his activities in  Barbados and as concurrent ambassador to the eastern Caribbean  region will be to strengthen economic and commercial relations  with the region and promote cultural and athletic ties, for  which there is excellent raw material in the Caribbean and a  considerable amount of experience in Cuba, he added.    Cabezas explained that one of his goals is to implement a  sports and cultural cooperation agreement signed with Barbados  in 1983 but never put into affect.    The ambassador announced he will present his credentials to  the Grenadian Government on 5 April. Cuba reestablished  relations with that country in March 1992. Relations between the  two countries cooled as a result of the events surrounding the  overthrow and murder of Prime Minister Maurice Bishop and the  subsequent 1983 U.S. military invasion.    Cabezas is accredited as concurrent ambassador to the  Governments of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Bahamas, St.  Lucia, and Trinidad and Tobago.    The only Caricom members yet to normalize relations with  Cuba  are Dominica, St. Kitts and Nevis, Antigua, and Barbados. As of  this past December, Cuba has maintained a joint commission  before Caricom.    At the beginning of the current decade, the Cuban Foreign  Relations Ministry launched a diplomatic offensive in the  Caribbean that was crowned by the reestablishment of diplomatic  relations with nearly all Caricom pact members and Cuba's  admission into the organization's cooperation mechanisms.    The climax of the regional rapprochement was Cuban Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina's official seven-nation tour this past  November. On that occasion, Robaina stated that the region has  become one of Cuba's foreign policy priorities.    Cabezas said that at the end of April, Cuba will participate  in the First Global Conference on Sustainable Development by  Small Insular States, which is sponsored by the United Nations  and is scheduled to take place in Barbados.    He added that Cuba expects to participate in the event with  the best proposals prepared by the country's social, scientific,  and ecological nongovernmental organizations. In addition, Cuba  expects to share its achievements in areas of common interests  with its sister nations.     "

The Cuban foreign minister spoke to Paraguayan  businessmen about the island's economic plans and said that  opportunities for investment are open with preference given to  Latin American capital. Robaina said that Cuba can attract  investments because it has raw materials, a highly qualified  labor force, technology, markets, as well as roads, ports, and  airports. The foreign minister also told the Paraguayan  businessmen that Cuba has high production in the nickel, citrus,  tourism, petroleum research, cement, textile, and pharmaceutical  industries, all with a high degree of technical development.

The  government's press service states that beginning 15 March,  Russia implemented extremely high customs tariffs on Estonian,  Latvian and Estonian [as received] goods, tariffs that are  double what has to be paid on other countries' goods.  Instructions to this end were issued by a Russian Federation  state committee on 11 March. Riigikogu economic commission  chairman Ivar Raig, thinks that Estonia should raise the issue  at the international level, while Prime Minister Mart Laar  thinks that an economic war against the Baltic states will harm  Russia first and foremost because a lot of agricultural produce  will not be supplied.    Commenting on the Russian decision, the prime minister  regrets that Russia does not want constructive and  goodneighborly relations with the Baltic states. Foreign  Minister Juri Luik is amazed that Russia would implement  discriminatory customs duty payments against other countries, as  it has voiced a desire to become a member of GATT, the  international trade agreement. Juri Luik stated that this is in  sharp contrast with GATT principles.    According to Prime Minister Laar the Russian decision to  double customs duty on Baltic goods in comparison to goods from  other European countries has demonstrated that the course  adopted by the Estonian Government to orientate the Estonian  economy toward the West is the only correct one. He stated that  Estonia is not dependent on Russia, and for this reason Estonia  has nothing to fear. Those few producers who, as the government  press release notes, orientated themselves unilaterally toward  the eastern market must, according to Laar, simply reorganize  their production.     "

We understood, and suggested that we wait for 12 months  and then conduct an extensive interview.    Now that a year has elapsed, we can offer our readers what  may be the most extensive interview the minister has given to  the Cuban press, in which he answers a variety of substantive  questions on Cuba and its place in a world that has changed  dramatically in the last five years.    Our readers will receive a report with a gestation period of  a year. To some extent, it is a report on the performance by the  head of Cuban diplomacy during this time.    [Vinas Alfonso] There has been persistent talk of a strong  diplomatic offensive since you became foreign minister. Is that  true?    [Robaina] People should instead talk of an ongoing offensive  by Cuban diplomacy in the last 35 years. A tremendous diplomatic  battle was waged by Roa in the United Nations in April 1961,  while in another -- though not precisely international -- arena  our forces repelled the mercenaries' attack at the Bay of Pigs.  That has been our style since 1959: exterior work based on what  we Cubans are doing inside our country. Our foreign minister's  diplomatic arguments were so solid because our people were at  that very time defending their destiny on the battlefield.    Now we have again come to a crucial moment in the history of  the revolution, when not only is the sovereignty of our nation  at stake, but also the very existence of the nation. Our  diplomacy must be capable of meeting the challenge of today's  circumstances, and that requires giving a new impetus to this  offensive. I do not believe it has so much to do with who is in  charge of this work, but instead with the pace that the new  times impose.    I maintain that those of us who have the duty of explaining  abroad what is happening in Cuba face a task that is  incomparably less difficult than the effort a housewife makes  every day in her kitchen, or a worker expends in reaching his  workplace early. At the same time, it is a tremendous challenge  to give the world a true image of Cuba, as we are surrounded by  a powerful information monopoly as unipolar as the world in  which we live.    That is what we are doing now, and we certainly talk of a  diplomatic offensive, which we need now: special diplomacy for a  special period.    [Vinas Alfonso] What are Cuba's foreign policy priorities  now?    [Robaina] Since last year we have established a minimal  number of priorities, so we will know exactly where to focus our  work.    In the very first place is our legitimate struggle against  the U.S. embargo, the growing effort by the international  community to condemn this embargo, and taking steps to  neutralize the negative effects of that policy of economic  isolation.    The dissemination of our real image around the world, with  strengths and weaknesses, but a real image as I have explained,  is another of our priorities. The great information  multinationals have for a long time distorted the Cuban reality,  which was been a way of justifying to international public  opinion specific political actions taken against Cuba. With our  modest resources we must, and we can, every day subvert this  situation. The famous human rights issue is one of the most  extensively manipulated enemy campaigns, and as we honor the  truth, we will not remain seated on the bench of the accused  when the greatest violator is trying to serve as our judge.    Other priorities are working to develop economic relations  abroad; working for the true democratization of the United  Nations and of international relations; our growing ties with  the countries of our continent, and specifically with the  Caribbean nations; and becoming more active in regional  organizations. Finally, we work constantly to strengthen the  solidarity movement with Cuba.    It is easy to realize that our goals are not so great as  everything we need to do to achieve them. Time will have the  last word.    [Vinas Alfonso] Does Cuba have a presence in Africa now?  What  are the prospects for our relationship with the ""Dark Continent""?    [Robaina] I can categorically answer yes to that question;  we  do maintain a presence in Africa, and we could not do otherwise.  Cuba shares with the African countries, in addition to our  strong ties of blood and a similar culture and habits, the fact  that we belong to the underdeveloped world, so we need to work  together to emerge from underdevelopment; this is obviously  related to our combat against the present manifestations of  colonialism, neocolonialism, and racism.    Our presence in Africa is shown by our 16 embassies and  several hundred Cubans who work in various fields, primarily  health care, as well as in education, sports, and other areas of  economic, scientific, technical, and cultural activity. This is  all a consequence of the numerous bilateral accords we have  signed, and of our participation in multilateral cooperation  organizations.    In addition, despite the enormous limitations imposed by the  special period, Cuba continues to provide Africa with  extraordinary support, like the training we provide to mid- and  upper-level technicians and professionals in all fields, who  later will contribute to the development of their own countries.  Africans make up almost two-thirds of the foreign scholarship  students studying in our country.    In our relationship with Africa, we certainly intend to  continue developing these ties that which benefit us both  bilaterally, and the Third World as a whole.    [Vinas Alfonso] Can we now discuss the integration of our  country with the rest of the Caribbean nations, or is that an  objective?    [Robaina] I do not think we can talk about integration.  Integration as such has not been achieved in the region. Nor of  integration as an objective. Instead, I believe this is a  process that in recent years has taken on great momentum. Do not  forget that in the 1970's we began to develop cooperation plans  for sectors like health care and education with other Caribbean  countries.    During our trip to the seven English-speaking Caribbean  states with which we have diplomatic relations, one of the  constants was their governments' gratitude for the aid Cuba has  provided for years in education and health care. Just in  university education, during these years we have graduated over  600 students from that region. The contribution made by Cuban  medical brigades to Caribbean countries like Guyana and Belize  is widely recognized. And this is also part of the integration  process I was talking to you about.    One of the main steps taken recently is the creation of the  Joint Cuba-Caricom [Caribbean Common Market] Commission, which  should promote cooperation and relations with the 13  English-speaking Caribbean nations of the Caribbean Community,  in specific sectors such as biotechnology, fishing, agriculture,  culture, information, and other areas.    In this move toward regional integration, the projected  Association of Caribbean States should play a very important  role. This is expected to become a reality in 1994, and Cuba  should be a full member of this association.    As you see, this process is going at a good pace, and it  really does have great prospects.    [Vinas Alfonso] What might be the future of Latin America if  the FTA [Free Trade Association] were to be extended to the  entire continent? If that happened, what would happen to our  insistence on regional integration?    [Robaina] Free trade has become a trend of our times,  especially in our hemisphere, after the formation of large  economic blocs in Europe, Asia, and North America.    In addition to the recent FTA, there are in our continent  Mercosur [Common Market of the South], the Group of Three  (Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia), the Andean Pact, Caricom, and  SIECA [Secretariat of Central American Economic Integration],  all of which are moving toward establishing free trade systems  among our countries.    Brazil's government recently proposed creating a Free Trade  Zone for South America, and its intention to extend this to  other geographic areas of Latin America. Cuba is watching the  evolution and execution of all these mechanisms.    It would take a long time for the FTA (known by its English  acronym, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement]) to be  extended all over the continent, and many difficulties would  need to be overcome. One difficulty is that the United States  would have to be really prepared to eliminate all impediments in  its trade with our region, and treat us as equals. This would  primarily mean that they would need to take into account the  differences existing between that country and our peoples.    Cuba also supports free trade. Because of our geographic  position and the development of our economy, we have always been  open to integration mechanisms.    However, the embargo the United States maintains against  Cuba  is an obstacle, and one of the contradictions of those who  proclaim free trade as a philosophy, while at the same time they  maintain this embargo, apply pressure, and prevent Cuba from  exercising this right.    If we now moved toward a ""fast track"" implementation of the  FTA on a hemispheric level, our Latin American countries would  have to negotiate separately in bilateral dealings with the  United States, which would obviously be a great advantage for  the United States.    At the next Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias,  one  issue on the agenda will be integration. Cuba will state its  position, which may be summarized like this: before reaching a  hemispheric Free Trade Agreement, we should go through a process  of strictly Latin American integration, which will enable us to  talk with the United States from stronger positions. There is  still a long road to travel before arriving at a continental FTA.    [Vinas Alfonso] Where are our relations with the European  Union?    [Robaina] At a point where we perceive new prospects for  cooperation.    Starting in 1993, a gradual and encouraging change has begun  in Cuban-European relations. An example of this is the aid sent  after the ""hurricane of the century"" and the neuropathy  epidemic, aid for which all our people are grateful. Another  example is the European Union's rejection of the  extraterritorial nature of the Torricelli Amendment and the  European Parliament's condemnation of the U.S. embargo against  Cuba.    The seminar held in Havana last December demonstrated that  it  is possible to talk in a climate of respect and that there is  consensus on continuing to develop bilateral relations.    I am sure we will move ahead in that direction.    [Vinas Alfonso] In Cuba's case, does Spain fully play its  historic role as the representative of Hispanic America in the  European Union?    [Robaina] I really think you should ask Spain that question.    That said, let me point out that, in fact, Spain has  historically served as the bridge between Latin America and the  European Economic Community (now the European Union), and it has  worked to defend the interests of the continent, which Cuba  looks upon with favor.    In the bilateral area, we have very extensive relations with  Spain in all sectors, and we would like them to continue and  expand. This is appropriate because of the strong solidarity,  affection, and shared identity between the peoples of Spain and  Cuba.    [Vinas Alfonso] What about our relations with the former  socialist nations?    [Robaina] After a period of adjustment and even a  considerable decline in ties of all sorts as a consequence of  the changes in the countries of East Europe, relations are  entering a new phase of normalization and a search for ties  which may be of mutual benefit for our peoples.    Of course, the economic ties have been considerably  affected,  not because of a political decision on either side, but rather  because of the lack of real possibilities for fluid trade.  Nevertheless, there are other channels for cooperation, and we  are working on that. The relations we have developed for over 30  years cannot and must not disappear overnight.    [Vinas Alfonso] Can you tell us about ties with the new  republics in the former USSR, especially with Russia and Ukraine?    [Robaina] Bilateral relations with those countries, which  after the dismembering of the USSR were at an impasse, have  begun to revive and we now see fluid exchanges in both  directions.    Cuba maintains relations with the majority of the states  that  were part of the former USSR. We have ambassadors accredited to  the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Latvia, and we also are  represented in Kazakhstan, Moldova, Belarus, and Estonia.    With the Russian Federation the most difficult moment in  bilateral relations is now behind us. People have become aware  of the potential that exists, and there is an obvious desire to  restore exchanges and active cooperation in various areas on  mutually advantageous terms.    With Ukraine relations are proceeding normally; we want to  renew the legal basis of these relations and begin a new phase  in trade. Recently the Embassy of Ukraine was officially opened  in Havana, and in general we maintain a fluid interchange in  political matters. The Ukrainian Government recently approved a  significant amount of humanitarian aid for Cuba, which we will  receive shortly.    In a general sense, our relations with these new states have  a tradition of over 30 years that unites us with their peoples.  Now we need to restructure our ties on new foundations, based on  the changing situation in today's world.    At the end of last year we were working on some new  agreements that have still not been fully executed, but we are  confident that the situation of relative stagnation that at one  moment threatened our fraternal trade ties has been overcome to  our mutual benefit.    [Vinas Alfonso] The ""Nation and Emigration"" conference will  soon take place. How might that help to promote a change in the  now old and stale hostility between Washington and Havana?    [Robaina] In the first place, let me make it clear that the  old conflict between Cuba and the United States is not on the  agenda of this conference. As it has been said, this is a  meeting of Cubans who live in over 50 countries all over the  world. The issues to be discussed concern only that  nation-emigres relationship.    Moreover, it is no secret to anyone that the largest number  of Cuban emigres live in the United States, as it is also no  secret to anyone that for 35 years that emigration has been used  by the aggressive policy of that country against Cuba. In the  same way, I am not saying anything new when I say that in recent  times a large part of that emigre community is changing in terms  of their relationship toward the island and their positions on  U.S. policy toward Cuba. Obviously, all this is the context of  Cuba's relations with the emigre community, and it would be  impossible to avoid touching on this situation during the  conference.    Cuba's relations with the United States will definitely not  be promoted at that conference. I will reaffirm once again our  readiness to discuss the issue directly with that government,  without intermediaries and at any time, but in a climate of  mutual respect, equality of conditions, and without any  preconditions or pressure.    [Vinas Alfonso] Will this meeting be the start of an ongoing  exchange? How does it benefit Cubans both here and abroad?    [Robaina] Contacts with our emigres throughout the world  have  always existed, with some more, with others less, but those  contacts have been maintained. Though to be honest, relations  with the Cuban community living in the United States have been,  as I explained, for a long time tainted by the conflict between  the two countries.    Working to normalize relations with the emigre community is  one of the fundamental objectives of the conference. It was  preceded by the dialogue in 1978, which was certainly an  important step taken by the Cuban Government, by means of which  effective answers were given to specific problems affecting  Cuban emigres.    The forthcoming conference in Havana will provide a followup  to that first meeting and solve new problems in the  emigre-nation relationship. Cubans on the island who have  relatives abroad and those in that emigre community who want to  maintain normal ties with Cuba and their families will both  benefit.    [Vinas Alfonso] In Miami some spokespersons on the far right  are saying that the conference is trying to divide the emigre  community. What do you think?    [Robaina] The fact that they are ""spokespersons on the far  right"" confirms what I already said, that every day that emigre  community is more divided about how to handle their relationship  with Cuba. So it cannot be an objective of the conference to  trigger a process that has already begun on its own.    Obviously, there are different ways of viewing that  emigration, and the presence at the conference of some people  for and others against will actually be the demonstration of a  fact, and not its cause.    [Vinas Alfonso] At all international forums, Cuba insists on  the need to end the embargo. Could there be a possibility of  that happening anytime soon? Might our problems then be  eliminated?    [Robaina] The first is another question that should be  addressed to the U.S. Congress or the White House. But we are  not going to give up our right to denounce the criminal,  antiquated, and ineffective embargo at any forum where a Cuban  representative is present.    And we are working every day to add new forces to the  already  overwhelming mass of countries, organizations, and public  figures all over the world, even in the United States, who speak  out against that brutal step that violates the principal human  right of an entire people, the right to life.    If one day reason triumphs and the embargo is lifted, I can  assure you that would eliminate one of our major problems and  many others that derive from it. But in no way would that be the  end of our difficulties, which have other well-known causes, and  against which we are also working every day.    [Vinas Alfonso] You have just returned from a trip to Asia.  What can you tell us about that region, which is both so remote  and so close?    [Robaina] Precisely that. It is worthwhile to travel that  far, if only to realize that we have very good friends in that  part of the world, some perhaps, our most loyal friends.    The trip included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Myanmar,  Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, and had more or less the  same objectives as our former visits to other areas of the world.    As always, we brought the truth about Cuba and learned from  close at hand about others--experiences like those of Vietnam,  which in some aspects coincide with our own economic  transformations. There is much that we can, should, and are  going to apply here.    With the governments we talked about issues of mutual  interest: bilateral and multilateral relations, and the  Non-Aligned Movement, which is now being chaired by an Asian  nation, Indonesia.    We met with ministers, political leaders, and businessmen,  and saw the possibilities of exchanges in various areas,  including economics of course, and we discussed prospects for  joint investments.    Because of the distance separating us, we have to work  creatively to find the most viable mechanisms to increase our  exchanges.    Finally, I want to say that one of the interesting  experiences of my visit was seeing how our diplomatic missions  in those countries, while small and modest, honorably represent  Cuba and are a true example of how to make up with efficiency  and intelligence for the lack of personnel or greater resources.    [Vinas Alfonso] Your appointment a year ago aroused some  opposition. What is the situation now?    [Robaina] Once again, I am not the person who can best  answer  that. But I can tell you what I think now, a year after my  selection as foreign minister.    These have been 12 months filled with a great deal of work  and learning, of experiences of all types; a year in which I  have traveled to various parts of the world, to some 30  countries in all. I have taken part in numerous international  events and talks with personalities from all over the world. It  has been a year to adapt, while on the job, to new  responsibilities, a new workplace, new comrades. The year has  gone well, and I feel pleased about it, although as I am never  satisfied, I think a lot more could have been done, and in fact  that is now the challenge I face for the next 12 months.

Alekseyev: ""Private Property--A  Factor No Less Powerful Than State Dictatorship""]    [Text]    Thus far privatization in Russia has failed    What could explain the fact that ""radical"" economic reforms  launched in January 1992, despite a number of positive results,  still did not produce the anticipated changes and, on the  contrary, certain tendencies appeared that could bring Russia  more trouble?    The decisive factors, consideration of which may yield an  answer to the question that was raised, are the unusual and  historically unprecedented complexities of the economic and  social situation in Russia, a country that is yet to make a  final break with totalitarianism, one which is entirely  nationalized and ravaged, where the foundations and culture of  ""normal"" private ownership were wiped out and private property  lost its significance as a natural base of economic development  and where monopolistic state ownership, authority for the sake  of authority, imperial state dictatorship, and a system of  compulsory and semicompulsory stimulation of labor by the state  was established.    ""Free"" prices and other monetary measures on the whole  eliminated state dictatorship from the sphere of prices and  trade turnover. On their own they are incapable of transforming  the totally nationalized, bureaucratic, prosocialist economy  into a free market economy, eliminating state pressure from it  (which in many ways has changed its form: from a distributor of  resources and goods the state became the distributor of  subsidies and credits, which, by the way, requires huge taxes).    Radical reorganization of the entire Russian economy may be  attained not only through monetary measures and market freedom,  but primarily through the revival of private property as a  natural basis of economic relations, production, and the entire  economy, under conditions of competition, i.e., a factor, which  is no less powerful than state dictatorship but one that has an  inexhaustible reserve of creative energy, promotes natural  motivation of labor and responsibility, while stimulating  investments in production.    At the same time such a revival of private property capable  of taking the place of the main regulator of production in a  competitive environment did not occur in Russia. Official  privatization, which it would seem should perform that task, was  mainly limited to the sphere of trade and structures  specializing in the marketing of natural raw material and  currency operations abroad. With regard to the rest, however,  attention in such ""privatization"" was focused on a prosocialist  partition of a portion of state property among all  fellow-citizens with the aid of vouchers (which, alas,  intensified parasitical tendencies of ""factory socialism"") and  sale of state property in the interests of the state budget as  well as ""general auctioning"" promoted by the success of the  partition of property using vouchers, which to a great degree  acquired a formal character and often merely consolidated the  status of ""red directors,"" promoting the growth and legalization  of our comprador bourgeoisie.    It was specifically because of the fact that privatization  in  Russia did not succeed and the dictatorial state command system  was not replaced with another, natural, system of regulation and  stimulation in the form of private ownership, that there was a  failure in the economy, and formation of a void. It was  specifically this failure which sent the parasitic ""market""  element spinning and churning, directed at quick and speculative  profits achieved through the channeling of natural raw material  abroad, resale, foreign currency operations, and machinations  with vouchers, stocks, and credits.    Such a situation, a situation involving failure of the  system  of economic regulation and labor stimulation, precipitated  processes leading to the destruction of the economy, a decline  in production and labor productivity along with other alarming  phenomena indicating the possibility that Russian society could  degenerate into an unfavorable, tragic variant of capitalist  development.    The alarming facts of our current reality are clearly  evident, anyone can see them. Adherents of orthodox communism  and a nationalized economy, as well as ""proponents of the state""  are utilizing these facts in full to substantiate the ideology  of ""turning back"" to a ""regulated"" market, to a ""mixed economy,""  or, in any case, to the ""correction"" and ""slowing down"" of  reforms, and an intensification of state regulation in economic  life. Unfortunately, under conditions of a disastrous situation,  such moods have gained a certain popularity and even the support  of some official circles. Even though, there is no doubt that  such a policy would merely strengthen state-nomenclature type  structures in the economy, increasing the state-capitalist tilt  of one of the most unfavorable, dead-end variants of capitalist  development.    One should assume that the way out of the situation which  has  been created must be a radically different one. Not ""curtailing""  or ""slowing-down"" of reforms but, on the contrary, attribution  of a cardinal character to them and extension of reforms, their  decisive conduct and involvement of the entire energetic, active  population of Russia in that truly reformative process.    The key to such large-scale reformative activity is the  revival of private property in a competitive atmosphere. Its  revival in all of its forms -- individual, family, and private  -- collective forms.    The very concept of privatization being conducted in Russia  must be changed radically on the basis of these positions.    It is necessary to be firmly aware that under Russian  conditions the revival of private property is impossible if  privatization is concentrated on the free distribution of  property, on the partition of even a segment of state property  with the help of vouchers. By contrast with other countries,  where truly private property already existed and privatization  with the aid of vouchers merely consolidates and expands its  subjective composition, under Russian conditions such a  privatization policy only breeds consumer-parasitic moods, an  aspiration of becoming a nonworking investor, along with  elements of ""factory socialism.""    The direction which is presently coming into being in  privatization -- the auctioning of items of state property on a  competitive basis, can also hardly be recognized as satisfactory.    The optimal path for development of privatization, which  revives productive private property and competition -- is the  transfer of it to ""real owners"" and the acquisition of property  by them for work. For work, that is for organization and  modernization of rational modern production and a growing output  of goods (services) in demand on the market. Perhaps the only  obligation of the owner, naturally, along with the payment of  taxes in such a transfer and such an acquisition, must be the  obligation to modernize production and make mandatory  investments of his own revenue in production.    It is necessary to note that with all of the alarming  phenomena of the current period, favorable conditions still  exist in Russia, probably uniquely favorable ones, for the  economy to start working and take a path of dynamic development.  They include the existence of significant material means,  resources, and advanced technical and scientific potential in  many areas.    Naturally, all of these are merely conditions, premises,  which, in addition to everything else are being consistently  lost, in the current crisis situation, as our economy is being  destroyed, (they will not even be required very much in our  Homeland if Russia slips into the unfavorable variant of  capitalist development, the raw material periphery of the world  capitalist system).    But the opportunity has not yet been lost and amazing  results  are still possible if our principal hope is realized -- the  power of the Russian spirit and selfless labor.    We are all witnesses to how the elimination of the coercive,  enslaving burden of the state, and the acquisition of freedom  and private property are rapidly releasing labor energy,  tumultuous and frenzied -- like everything Russian.    When production cooperatives and leased enterprises got the  freedom to acquire private property in 1989-1991, the national  economic sector formed by them, in the situation created by the  disintegration of the entire Soviet economy which had already  started, proved to be the only one (the only one!) that  manifested economic growth, including a rise in investments in  production. It is sufficient to recall the amazing success  attained by the Pechora production cooperative, headed by  Vladimir Tumanov, as well as the fruitful work done by other  vigorous supporters of a realistic cause (Svyatoslav Fedorov,  Nikolay Travkin, and others) in order for it to become clear  that even at that time our national economy was on its way to  resolving the crisis and heading toward a general economic  upsurge. Who knows, that may have occurred if the reformist  forces would have been firmer and more systematic and if Russia  was not overwhelmed by political passions and the merciless  struggle for power.    This is why it is necessary to have a clear understanding at  present as well that revival of private productive property has  been called upon to become the decisive ennobling factor,  unleashing creative economic energy.    A daring and decisive step is required by the government and  the president. By those who can and must assume responsibility  for the fate of Russia, for making it possible to withdraw from  the brink of disaster and begin healthy economic development.     "

This was pointed out to Radio Havana by Raul  Amado-Blanco, vice president of the National Bank of Cuba. He  also noted that in spite of this situation, progress may be made  this year, which will prove very useful for all sides involved.    [Begin Amado-Blanco recording] We would like to move the  dialogue along, so to speak. There are many issues to be  reviewed. Our liquidity, from the viewpoint of freely  convertible currency, as you are well aware, is not very good  for conducting any sort of negotiations at this time. However,  I believe an agreement can be reached if we sit down and talk  and if, to begin with, our creditors acknowledge the efforts  Cuba made for a number of years between 1982 and 1986 to repay  its loans. They must also acknowledge the situation Cuba is  currently experiencing. If we accomplish this I believe we will  have established a solid foundation that will change our current  status of immobility where the debt is concerned. [end  recording]    As for the island's real likelihood of obtaining loans, the  vice president of the Cuban National Bank said that some  institutions undoubtedly lack the resolve to grant loans.  Amado-Blanco said he has even discussed all the requirements  for a loan and been ready for the final signature when the other  side said the negotiations could not continue.    [Begin Amado-Blanco recording] In our case, since at this  time we are working primarily with private banks, things are not  done that way, although private banks are sometimes subjected to  political pressure. However, I do not believe this pressure  comes from either the IMF or the World Bank but from certain  governments, the governments of third countries. Bank members  may eventually hold important positions in the United States,  and they fear jeopardizing those positions by granting loans to  Cuba.    There are, unquestionably, countries with which we have  debts, but in spite of this they have still granted loans to  Cuba and have kept open certain lines of credit to the island.  They are aware of our position, but they have political resolve.  There are countries in Europe and on other continents that have  done this and they are worthy of praise. In my opinion, their  conduct constitutes a declaration of independence as far as  their relations with Cuba are concerned.    In general, the issue of financial markets is a complicated  one for Cuba at this time because of the many problems the  country is facing, but we have had some success. We are trying  our best to repay the new loans we have received. We are paying  to the extent that we can, and we are being very careful not to  request loans that we know we cannot repay. This, of course,  restricts us because, as you know, our exports have decreased  considerably. I have remained optimistic throughout 26 years at  the bank, and I believe that as of 1994, or rather 1995, we are  going to be quite successful in some areas. We will improve our  overall image on the market, which is very important. Loan  payments, first of all, are very important, and our  possibilities and prospects are very important as they pertain  to the analyses conducted by banking and financial institutions  when they are considering loans for countries. [end recording]    To conclude, I discussed with Amado-Blanco the loan of $10  million granted by a Chilean bank to finance the exportation of  food products from that South American country to the island.  Amado- Blanco said an institution takes such a step only when  it has confidence in a country, adding that a loan will not only  allow Cuba to import food, which is quite positive, but to  intensify its relations with a country like Chile, with which it  maintained excellent relations until the 1973 military coup.

""My schedule is full,""  the official said in statements published Tuesday in the  influential newspaper EL TIEMPO.    According to media reports from Cuba, the two countries will  sign a trade agreement in Havana next April at a ceremony which  Santos will attend. ""My visit to Cuba is still not definite"",  the Colombian trade minister said in explaining that ""the  agreement only revises the partial agreement Colombia has with  Cuba within the framework of the Latin American Integration  Association (ALADI).""    According to Cuban versions, a bilateral delegation recently  studied the treaty. It reviewed tariffs and analyzed a list of  more than 800 products to be included in the document.    Santos' denial was made within the framework of an offensive  against Cuba by local right-wing groups as a result of the  release of information on the presumed presence of Colombian  guerrilla commanders in Cuba.    The Santa Fe de Bogota newspaper EL TIEMPO published this  story shortly after Mines and Energy Minister Guido Nule  returned from Cuba and announced Colombia would sell between  15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil per day to the island. Colombia  and Cuba renewed diplomatic relations on 28 October after a  12-year suspension given the Cuban Government's presumed  interference in Colombia's internal affairs.     "

The centers are part of  a project financed by the nongovernmental organization ""Bread  for the World"" and are located in the Banao area in Sancti  Spiritus Municipality and on the Nueva Cuba  Agricultural-Livestock Production Cooperative in Cabaiguan.    Cuba and the Dominican Republic have signed a sports  cooperation agreement whereby Cuban swimming and track and field  trainers will offer their knowledge to Dominican athletes as of  March. The agreement provides for consulting by Cuban trainers  in other sports as well.    Guantanamo is to have a provincial biopharmaceutical  laboratory as of next month, for the production of medicines and  vaccines for humans and animals.    ""Camaguey construction workers have built works worth some  77  million pesos. This figure represents a drop of slightly over 50  percent compared to 1989."" Over 1,300 low-cost houses were  finished in 1993.

Radio Reloj at 1952 GMT on 22 June reports that Pinar del  Rio  Province is the leader in the sugarcane planting program with 90  percent of the goal fulfilled. The other provinces are lagging  behind, thus Pinar del Rio has definite possibilities to meet  its planting goals.    Radio Reloj at 1958 GMT adds that Holguin Province has  experienced a slight economic recovery during the first five  months of 1994. During this period, production revenues were  aproximately 306 million pesos, 30 million more than during the  same period in 1993.    Radio Reloj at 1959 on 23 June reports that the Basic  Cooperative Production Units in Havana have planted 37  caballerias of tubers, vegetables, rice, and beans for self  consumption.

Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 24 June adds that 86  percent of the Cuban merchant fleet is operational despite  current limitations. Two years ago, less than 60 percent was  operational. Revenue of over 20 million in hard currency was  attained by the fleet between January and May. A meeting held in  preparation for October's Fourth Merchant Fleet and Port Union  Congress focused on efforts to reduce costs and increase  efficiency. It was also reported that over 400 crew members are  employed in foreign vessels yielding revenue of over $2 million  in salaries.    Cuba Vision Network, in the same newscast, adds that the  American Freedom to Travel activists who arrived in Cuba in  defiance of the travel ban brought along a donation, no figures  given, of medicines and school supplies.    Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 24 June reports that increased  weeding efforts are essential to improve the sugarcane yield.  The Sugar Industry Ministry's plans include manually weeding  more than 144,000 caballerias in the first half of 1994. It was  announced at the 10-day harvest assessment meeting that Holguin  Province surpassed its weeding goals and that Camaguey, Granma,  and Las Tunas Province have made significant progress in this  endeavor.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on June 24 reports that the  Spanish  Politurs Discount Tourism Agency has doubled its sale of trips  to Cuba during the first five months of 1994 in comparison with  the same period in 1993. This means that approximately 3,500  Spanish tourists -- of the 14,000 expected in 1994 -- have  already visited Cuba before the peak season in July and October.    Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June reports that the  Ibero-American Cooperation Institute has granted a $20,000  donation to the Federation of Cuban Women, FMC, to modernize the  documentation center of the FMC Cadres School.

Radio Reloj at 0200 GMT on 25 June adds that the six Basic  Cooperative Production Units in Nueva Paz Municipality are  behind schedule in the spring planting of diverse crops with 20  caballerias planted out of a 49 caballeria program. The delays  were due to, among other things, excess humidity in the soil, a  shortage of tires, and weeds. Candido Palmero, first secretary  of the Communist Party of Cuba in Havana, pointed out that if  this situation continues, the planting goal is not going to be  met, and added that a Youth Labor Army farm will be created to  help with the labor.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 June reports that Cuba  signed  an accord with the UN program for population stability and  family planning. The United Nations will contribute over  $700,000 and Cuba will contribute over 2 million pesos to the  effort. Raul Taladrid praised the UN contribution.     "

Considering it the most important task of the Cuban worker  movement, the editorial urges the leaders of the Cuban Workers  Federation (CTC) and its members to commit themselves to the  success of the process which -- it insists -- must serve to take  action on essential aspects of our economy and society.

Mr Volsky, a close associate of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who has called for 'non-monetary' means to fight inflation and more state intervention in the economy, denied Russia lacked the right political and economic conditions to receive large-scale financial assistance. He also called for 'international compensation' to Russia for 'billions of dollars' it had lost because of its adherence to sanctions against the former Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya. Mr Chernomyrdin has continued to issue conflicting signals about the intentions of his new economic team of former industrial managers. 'They are scared of being blamed for fuelling inflation. They do not know what to do. They have made promises but no decisions,' said one reformer still in the government. On Friday, Mr Chernomyrdin signed a document bringing closer a controversial monetary union with neighbouring Belarus. Although the terms of the proposed union have yet to be made public, this project will inevitably mean increased pressure on Russia's finances. In an attempt to lessen the burden of neighbouring republics, Russia last year cut energy supplies to the Commonwealth of Independent States by 40 per cent for oil and 25 per cent for gas, according to official figures published yesterday. Mr Chernomyrdin also reassured Ukraine that Russia had no desire to take back the Crimean peninsula after Crimea's new president, who has promised a referendum on reunification with Russia, asked a former Russian deputy premier to head his government.

Its executive board yesterday voted to establish a negative pledge clause waiver allowing Russia to pledge assets such as oil revenues as security for loans from other lenders. If no objections are heard by the close of business today, Russia will be able to move immediately forward with a Dollars 2bn loan from the US Export-Import Bank for its oil and gas industry. 'This action has the practical effect of allowing an infusion of capital into Russia at a crucial time in that country's development,' said Mr Kenneth Brody, Eximbank's president. Uzbekistan will also receive the waiver. In Washington, officials said the board meeting had been scheduled for some time and its timing was not directly linked to the Russian election. World Bank policy normally requires borrowing countries to sign a negative pledge waiver, certifying that they will not pledge their assets to any other lender. This requirement helps to ensure that the World Bank ranks at the top of the list of creditors to any country and to preserve its credit rating. The policy has, however, hampered the flow of capital into Russia since investors have been uncertain about repayment. The World Bank had agreed in principle in March to lift the negative pledge clause, but restricted the circumstances in which it will grant a waiver to apply principally to the former Communist countries in transition to a market economy. The conditions required the implementation of a programme of macro-economic adjustment, but yesterday the board agreed to accept evidence that a country was making progress towards a market economy and privatisation. The waiver will also be granted for only two years, rather than the three years originally planned.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9199 General Government, NEC.

Fleites said a letter of intent was signed  ""recently"" by CUPET and Mexican enterprises for the latter to  use the Cienfuegos refinery, located 336 km southeast from  Havana.    Speaking for GRANMA INTERNATIONAL, the official declined to  mention the investment required to activate this facility, which  is capable of refining 21 million barrels of crude oil annually.    Although an agreement with Russia, the largest of the former  Soviet republics, guarantees an annual exchange of 17.5 million  barrels of oil for one million tons of sugar, Cuba requires at  least 42 million barrels of oil per year.    The Cienfuegos refinery is one of the last projects built by  the now defunct Soviet Union. Three years ago, Cuba began  negotiating with several countries to reactivate the plant.    Fleites said foreign firms have invested approximately $120  million prospecting for oil in Cuba and that 16 of the Cuban  territory's 33 blocks have been auctioned off in international  risk contracts.    CUPET is associated with Canada's CNW and Talisman firms;  France's Total and Geopetrol; the UK's Premier and British  Borneo; and Sweden's Taurus.    According to Fleites, the discovery of oil in the Bay of  Cardenas in Matanzas Province in western Cuba ""confirms the  presence of hydrocarbons in the country.""     "

This has wiped out a past in which a person came into the world  with his destiny already laid out for him. A person was born  either as a have or have-not, black or white, man or woman, and  from that moment on, each individual was condemned to patterns  of inequality from which only a few managed to escape with great  difficulty. The revolution, after socializing the basic means of  production, established the right to be born in a society that  ensures access to education and health care services to all  people. These are vital features enabling each individual to  have the same opportunities to develop his physical and mental  capabilities. Equality is not a gift from heaven, it is not a  gift of nature; it is the result of a just distribution of the  resources society produces through labor.    Viewed in this way, equality is not sustainable if it does  not become a stimulus to increased and improved production. In  other words, equality is not only a fine ideal of humanism; it  must also be a condition for economic development.    If, today, Cuba can successfully meet the challenge of  moving  its economy into the changed world we are living in, this will  largely be due to the fact that equality of access to education,  health care, and work have, during all these years, created  invaluable human resources. This is made up not only of a strong  work force with a high educational level, but it is also  composed of a pool of educated people unmatched in any other  country with a similar level of development. One of the most  valuable treasures of the revolution is the love for the ideals  of justice and equality that the revolution planted in the  people, especially in the young people who today constitute the  majority of the nation.    But during all these years, we must admit, our national  consciousness has not always discerned with proper clarity the  limits between equality and egalitarianism.    We have frequently created rights of equality exceeding the  nation's real economic possibilities; often practice has  converted into egalitarianism an idea originally intended to  stimulate production and efficiency based on differences in  earnings. This lack of precise and realistic limits between  equality and egalitarianism may be considered one of the  deep-seated causes of our imperfect application of the socialist  principle of distribution to each, in terms of both quantity and  quality, according to his contribution. The full application of  that principle, the foundation not only of the economy but of  all true ethics and justice in socialist society, is a historic  goal of the workers and their union movement.    Labor must be the leveling force for measuring each  citizen's  merit, prestige, and standard of living in a society of workers.  In expressing these aspirations, we do not forget that at the  present time when, for reasons we all know too well, the  nation's economy is experiencing a critical situation, the most  just and rational thing to do is to share these difficulties  among all the Cuban people, thus in fact reducing the margin of  differentiation based on each person's contribution to society.    Controlled, equitable, and rationed distribution, maximum  support for employment, and the ample use of price subsidies  have helped to save hundreds of thousands of Cubans from  distress, bolstering our capacity for resistance and  strengthening our national unity.    We Cuban workers fully support this profoundly human and  revolutionary policy, but at the same time we must create an  awareness that each step toward economic recovery the country  takes must be accompanied by a revitalization of the role of  salaries and their influence on individual consumption. We  support the idea that as internal financial order and  equilibrium are restored, we must intensify the use of salary  and monetary gradations, as well as other material and moral  incentives. This does not contradict, but reaffirms, socialist  ideology. We believe payment for work must take into account the  importance of the particular economic activity in order to  stimulate areas and sectors that contribute most to the nation  at a given moment. We believe that salary decisions to be made  in the future should be based on the particular features of each  geographic area and provide the greatest incentives for the  least attractive but most essential jobs for the needs of  specific goods or services.    We feel that in the future, decisions on the best rates,  forms, and systems of payment should be more flexible and, as a  rule, should be made in each entity. This must be accompanied  with strict control of the use of the base salary and its  relation to the goods or services made in terms of quantity,  selection, and quality.    Finally, we maintain that wherever a rigorous managerial  climate and labor and technological discipline exist and achieve  improved economic results, the workers should be appropriately  rewarded. In this way, we will work to establish the principle  deeply held by our workers that the inequality to be rejected is  not that which differentiates well earned incomes, but equality  based on equal treatment for persons of different behavior and  ability in their work.

The special session, called in response to the deteriorating economy, will also review the effect of economic changes over the past eight months. Increasingly concerned about its budget deficit, the government announced a 50 per cent cut in the budget for the armed forces last month, saying the military should 'cost the country as little as possible'. Given the central role of the armed forces in Cuban politics, the reduction is a telling indicator of the nature of the economic problems facing the country, diplomats in Havana said. Introduction of income tax is intended to recapture billions of pesos in circulation which government officials say are being used by Cubans to purchase hard currency. The government announced last year that Cubans were free to hold foreign currency. The assembly debate will effectively be a continuation of the regular session which was held last December. That reviewed the government's more liberal attitude to foreign currency, foreign investment and increasing private and co-operative ownership of farms and a range of small businesses. Since then, however, there have been signs that the island's economy is buckling.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

During the 11th full session of the Mexican-Cuban  Businessmen's Commission, the CEMAI established closer ties  between Mexican businessmen and Cuban authorities to make the  initial contacts that will allow more trade between the  countries.    In an interview with EL FINANCIERO near the end of the  businessmen's visit to Cuba, Fernandez Roos declared that there  is a lot of disinformation about Cuba's economic situation and  its capacity to become a real trading partner with Mexico.    Trade between Mexico and Cuba currently amounts to only $150  million with a positive balance in favor of Mexican businesses.  The chemical, agricultural and livestock, health, and  construction sectors are among the most attractive areas for  investment. The CEMAI representative believes political issues  should not affect the choice of an export destination, as is the  case with Cuba.    One of the most important companies participating in this  business meeting is Jugos de Valle, a corporation that considers  Cuba to be among its most attractive export markets. Manuel  Albarran, director of the company's international development  department, asserted that any company that is planning to go to  international operations should consider Cuba because it is  practically a ""virgin"" market. He said the prospects for  introducing bottled drinks to the island are particularly  interesting because they imply introducing new products into the  consumption patterns of the Cuban people, a market of more than  12 million people.    Albarran, who described the 11th meeting of the  Mexican-Cuban  Businessmen's Committee as a complete ""success,"" declared that  Jugos del Valle has not ruled out the possibility of making  direct investments in Cuba.    Diego Fernandez explained that Cuba is ripe for foreign  investment and asserted that Fidel Castro's government is  seeking to widen the island's economic opening. He added that  although the CEMAI has held 10 meetings between Mexican  businessmen and Cuban authorities, there has never been so much  interest shown by the two parties to increase commercial  relations.    Aside from the Cuban Government's large investments in  Mexican corporations such as Cemex, Television Azteca, and  Mexipetrol, there are midsize companies that view Cuba as an  interesting trading partner able to fulfill its payment  commitments.    The National Foreign Trade Bank (Bancomext), in  collaboration  with the CEMAI, sent invitations to Mexican companies interested  in negotiating with Cuba, which has faced a U.S. Government  economic embargo for more than two decades.    Francisco Callarisa Salcedo, sales director of the Mac'Ma  group -- cookies and pasta makers -- declared the Cuban market  could become an important consumer of Mexican products. He  added that it seemed illogical that although Mexico is only a  two-hour flight from the island and only a day and a half by  boat, countries like Spain -- Cuba's second largest commercial  partner -- and France are conducting such a large amount of  business with the Caribbean nation.    Optimistic about statements Cuban authorities will make at  the ""The Nation and the Emigrants"" meeting, the first held since  the Cuban Revolution, Mexican businessmen are convinced that  Cuba is going through a period of change in which Mexico must  participate.    ""The Nation and the Emigrants"" meeting begins today with the  attendance of Cuban emigrant organizations such as Cuba Libre  and with the certainty that Fidel Castro, the island's leader,  has not suffered any attack, according to reports from Cuban  Government sources. Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina will for the  first time address Cuban emigrants, most of whom live in the  United States, on the topic: ""The Relationship between the  Nation and the Emigrants: Current Status and Prospects.""

We are truly facing a  critical moment right now.    The Belarusian leadership sees a stable economic union with  Russia and the unification of currency systems as the only means  for protecting our sovereignty and overcoming the protracted  crisis. However, as known, this approach is not shared by all  political circles. A feeling of relief will supposedly be  experienced by producers and entrepreneurs, if by anybody.    Frankly speaking, economists and financiers think that the  joining of the common ruble zone by Belarus is inevitable. Of  course, it would have been much better to make such a move two  years ago -- the cost would have been far lower. Or, perhaps,  to adopt the direction of Baltic states. Unfortunately, the  opportunity was missed. Excepting the economic union with  Russia, we are rapidly and firmly following the path which  Ukraine is desperately trying to abandon. A persistent general  economic crisis without hope or prospects brings death to any  country. We will be able to keep ourselves in the swim at the  expense of high-tech production -- so-called ""brain"" work -- for  about a year or two. However, if highly skilled specialists,  depressed by petty salaries, leave their labs and workshops in  search of better-paying places under the sun, the world will  embrace yet another ""banana republic."" Then it will be  impossible for Belarus to avoid the penetration and expansion of  Russian capital.    Nobody needs to be reminded that Belarus' interests are,  first of all and above all, in the East, in Russia, in other CIS  countries. The experience of our independence demonstrates that  we are not welcome guests in the West. ""Rotting"" continental  and transatlantic businessmen rate Belarus as last in their  investments priorities because of our allegedly pro-communist  regime and the absolute lack of reform. We must face the truth:  Our Republic is not rated high by Russia, either. This is  testified to by the visit of the U.S. President; Bill Clinton's  behind-closed-doors meeting with [opposition leader] Zyanon  Paznyak also has its significance.    Economic union with Russia is a necessary step for us, but  it  is also a forced step. The Belarusian economy is on the brink  of catastrophe. Taking into account world prices for Russian  raw materials, customs duties, and our horrible tax policy, the  Belarusian leadership -- to rid itself of Russian pressure --  has rushed toward integration with our ""eastern brother,""  notwithstanding the fact that the economic union implies a  limitation of political sovereignty. Nonetheless, it is assumed  that this will help Belarus overcome crises and move beyond its  current standstill. The creation of a single ruble zone with a  single legal tender -- the Russian ruble -- and, as a result,  the implementation of rules and methods of the more liberal  Russian tax system, as well as the widening of markets are the  main roads to civilization.    Still, these are advancements on our behalf. What can we  propose to Russia in return? An economy in crisis and ourselves  -- lock, stock, and barrel?! For Russia, the unification of  currency systems is more of a political step than an economic  one. Former Russian Prime Minister Gaydar has spoken out  against this unification. We, just like that small boy with a  dog on the well-known ""Russia's Choice"" poster, are not welcome.     "

Baker III, in a challenge to Soviet President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev who visits Havana next week, said Thursday that the  democracies of the Western Hemisphere are determined to prevent Moscow and its  allies from using Latin America as ""a dumping ground for their arms or their  failed ideologies.""    Seizing on Gorbachev's ""new thinking"" campaign, Baker called on Moscow to apply  new ideas to Central America by reducing its $500-million-a-year program of  military aid to the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.    Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush has  made clear that Soviet restraint in Central America would ""have a (favorable)  impact in terms of our overall relationship."" Fitzwater said that the U.S. view  has been communicated to Gorbachev, who arrives in Havana on Sunday at the  start of a three-day visit, but he declined to say how the message was sent.    Baker's remarks came in a speech to a seminar on Western Hemisphere affairs at  former President Jimmy Carter's Presidential Center in Atlanta. The text was  made public by the State Department in Washington.      Tough Rhetoric    His words represented some of the toughest rhetoric that the Bush  Administration has directed at the Soviet Union after weeks of conciliatory  statements. They underlined the tacit veto that the Soviet Union holds over the  Administration's new bipartisan Central America policy.    The White House and the Democratic-controlled Congress agreed last week on an  approach to provide non-military support to maintain the Contras long enough to  find out if the Nicaraguan government will conduct free elections, as it has  promised to do. A continued flow of Soviet economic and military aid would  likely stiffen Managua's response to the U.S. plan.    Addressing an audience that included many Latin American leaders, Baker said:  ""Together we must send a clear message to others outside this hemisphere: This  is not a dumping ground for their arms or their failed ideologies. We are  looking for signs of new thinking. The Soviet Union now has an opportunity to  demonstrate it in Central America. This is what the (regional peace) agreement  requires and what the democratic community demands.""    Baker also urged the other democracies in the hemisphere to support U.S.  efforts to pressure Nicaragua to keep its pledge to move toward genuine  democracy. He said that such support is necessary if Central American nations  want the United States to end its support for the Contras.    ""If you ask the United States to forgo unilateral initiatives and work instead  in good faith with the democratic nations of Latin America in a new cooperative  diplomacy to support democracy, then we ask you to join with us in good faith  to turn the promise of that diplomacy into reality throughout this hemisphere,""  Baker said.    ""All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to the region's  conflicts have a responsibility to prove that this is the best and surest route  to achieve our common goals,"" he added. ""We invite Latin America's democratic  leaders to join us in this challenge.""    The presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua  agreed earlier this year on a regional peace plan calling for free elections in  Nicaragua by next February. The agreement also calls for the five nations to  develop a specific plan for demobilizing the Contras who are now camped at  bases in Honduras.    In his speech, Baker also pledged a continuing U.S. effort to help ease ""the  weight of Latin America's foreign debt."" But he emphasized that the Latin  nations must also ""move forward to take the necessary, but difficult steps to  restructure and reform your economies.""    He noted that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady recently unveiled a U.S.  proposal for debt relief, but he said that plan will not work without economic  reforms in the debtor nations.    ""We must negotiate, case by case, the details of that policy to ensure  continued economic reform, a real reduction in existing debt burdens and new  capital flows in the future,"" he said.    State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that Baker discussed the  debt problem with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez on the return flight  from Atlanta to Washington. Perez, who attended the Atlanta symposium, is  scheduled to confer with Bush on Saturday at the White House.    The President plans to discuss the Central American peace process next week  with Alfredo Cristiani, El Salvador's incoming president and Costa Rican  President Oscar Arias Sanchez.    Meanwhile, the State Department sought to refute speculation that Washington  plans to modify its tough policy toward Cuba in the wake of the withdrawal of  Cuban troops from Angola.    In a memo to all U.S. embassies last week, Baker said that the 28-year-old U.S.  trade embargo against Cuba will remain in place.    ""Cuba is involved in a public diplomacy effort to reinforce the impression that  improved bilateral relations are in the cards,"" Baker said. ""Better ties --  especially with the absence of a comprehensive trade embargo -- would benefit  greatly the failed Cuban economy and enhance Cuba's image and prestige.    ""The U.S. government is prepared to resolve problems with Cuba whenever U.S.  interests can be served,"" he said. ""But, Cuban statements to the contrary, Cuba  has not demonstrated a serious interest in improving relations with the United  States.""

We are  looking for signs of new thinking. The Soviet Union now has an opportunity to  demonstrate it in Central America. This is what the (regional peace) agreement  requires and what the democratic community demands.""    Baker also urged the other democracies in the hemisphere to support U.S.  efforts to pressure Nicaragua to keep its pledge to move toward genuine  democracy. He said that such support is necessary if Central American nations  want the United States to end its support for the Contras.    ""If you ask the United States to forgo unilateral initiatives and work instead  in good faith with the democratic nations of Latin America in a new cooperative  diplomacy to support democracy, then we ask you to join with us in good faith  to turn the promise of that diplomacy into reality throughout this hemisphere,""  Baker said.    ""All those who advocate diplomacy and political solutions to the region's  conflicts have a responsibility to prove that this is the best and surest route  to achieve our common goals,"" he added. ""We invite Latin America's democratic  leaders to join us in this challenge.""    The presidents of El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua  agreed earlier this year on a regional peace plan calling for free elections in  Nicaragua by next February. The agreement also calls for the five nations to  develop a specific plan for demobilizing the Contras who are now camped at  bases in Honduras.    In his speech, Baker also pledged a continuing U.S. effort to help ease ""the  weight of Latin America's foreign debt."" But he emphasized that the Latin  nations must also ""move forward to take the necessary, but difficult steps to  restructure and reform your economies.""    He noted that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady recently unveiled a U.S.  proposal for debt relief, but he said that plan will not work without economic  reforms in the debtor nations.    ""We must negotiate, case by case, the details of that policy to ensure  continued economic reform, a real reduction in existing debt burdens and new  capital flows in the future,"" he said.    State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that Baker discussed the  debt problem with Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez on the return flight  from Atlanta to Washington. Perez, who attended the Atlanta symposium, is  scheduled to confer with Bush on Saturday at the White House.    The President plans to discuss the Central American peace process next week  with Alfredo Cristiani, El Salvador's incoming president and Costa Rican  President Oscar Arias Sanchez.    Meanwhile, the State Department sought to refute speculation that Washington  plans to modify its tough policy toward Cuba in the wake of the withdrawal of  Cuban troops from Angola.    In a memo to all U.S. embassies last week, Baker said that the 28-year-old U.S.  trade embargo against Cuba will remain in place.    ""Cuba is involved in a public diplomacy effort to reinforce the impression that  improved bilateral relations are in the cards,"" Baker said. ""Better ties --  especially with the absence of a comprehensive trade embargo -- would benefit  greatly the failed Cuban economy and enhance Cuba's image and prestige.    ""The U.S. government is prepared to resolve problems with Cuba whenever U.S.  interests can be served,"" he said. ""But, Cuban statements to the contrary, Cuba  has not demonstrated a serious interest in improving relations with the United  States.""

Now we can talk, without fear of error, of an ample number of  proposals on which Cuban workers have reached consensus.    Some of these proposals concern price adjustments for  specific products, like cigars and rum; they are primarily  related to basic commodities for which coupon books are used for  purchases.    For cigars, the formulas proposed have two basic variants:  one favors eliminating all quotas, with the unrestricted sale of  this product at a new price; and another advocates eliminating  the additional quota (1.60), and keeping cigar prices  unrestricted.    For rum, the majority of the people who expressed an opinion  in the people's parliaments felt the price should be increased  and it should be offered only on free sale.    These two items, which are not necessities, no matter how  much many people do need them, have the potential to attract  foreign currency in an amount that could reach 4 billion pesos a  year, if Cuba were to ensure a sufficient production of both  items so they could be sold without restrictions.    For essential goods which are now subsidized, the workers'  meetings frequently suggested new prices that would at least  cover production costs.    At the present time the subsidies included in these prices  may be calculated at about 400 million pesos a year; the 1993  budget deficit was 10 times larger.    This means that, financially speaking, the contribution that  cigars and rum could make toward a healthy budget is much  greater. The price adjustment for essential goods, assuming that  it were applied to all subsidized items, would not be decisive,  though it would make a significant contribution.    At this point, it is wise to emphasize one point in order to  avoid misinterpretations of what we are saying. Consensus does  not mean unanimity, and consensus approval does not mean there  is no dissent on this or that aspect of a given issue.    This is also the right time to say that the existence of  popular consensus on a broad group of possible measures does not  mean they will definitely be applied immediately. It is the  responsibility of the People's Government National Assembly and  of other high-level government bodies to decide which are the  most appropriate and possible measures, with what dynamism and  intensity they should be applied, and how they should be  implemented so that they will have an impact on the economy in a  harmonious and interrelated manner, so they will become part of  the system and not enter the financial universe in isolation.    But whether or not all the measures the workers have  recommended on prices are adopted immediately is not the most  important thing. The essential is that the problem of prices is  beginning to become a part of our national economic awareness.    For years, partly because of lack of foresight and partly  because the Cuban economy was integrated in an international  trade system that was essentially fair and certain, the problem  of prices, both domestic and foreign prices, was something that  did not concern the population.    Just remember: the price of sugar in what was called the  world market, an issue that had earlier obsessed our  grandparents, was barely of interest to specialists.    For domestic prices, it was often true that we consumers  paid  for products without even bothering to find out the unit price  of the items we were buying.    Now we are beginning to realize that we have to pay much  more  attention to economic laws if we are going to keep our economy a  socialist economy. And we can understand that prices are a  leading instrument for restructuring our economy that has been  forced by circumstances to become a part of an external world  that is absolutely driven by market laws.    No matter what measures may emerge from the next session of  the People's Government National Assembly, it is extremely  important for people to understand that when they buy a pound of  black beans at the retail price, it costs the state 50 centavos,  while the consumer buys it for 30.    Something similar takes place with almost all grains, dairy,  and meat products, coffee, bread, fuels, and other items. Of 30  essential household items, over 20 are subsidized by the state.    Here we are speaking of merchandise whose real costs could  be  estimated in freely convertible currency, as these items are  mostly acquired abroad. In this world of prices, both the prices  paid by the population and those used in the business economy,  we need to become more aware and realize that everything we  consume, everything we see around us that is produced by labor,  in the end has a specific cost in convertible currency.    This will force us to make a much greater effort to increase  the correlation between real costs and prices, while not  overlooking the fact that in the future it will be virtually  impossible to keep prices immobile, which was the normal  practice during the last three decades.    But this does not mean we are advocating that this  correlation in retail prices should be reached suddenly and  automatically. Prices paid by the people in our socialist  society will always be a means used to promote the just and  equitable distribution of social production; this is not to be  confused with egalitarianism.    The workers are asking that people whose incomes are too low  for them to pay the regular prices be subsidized, in order to  avoid having the state subsidize everyone in an egalitarian  system.    Paradoxically, subsidized prices benefit both the money  hoarder and the retiree, and both the idler and the model worker.    The workers want this to come to an end. They know this is a  process. They know it will take time. They agree that sacrifices  will have to be made, but they have confidence that, in prices  as well as in other areas, we will achieve rationality and  efficiency.     "

Four U.S. congressmen, including Robert Torricelli -- the  author of the law that intensifies the blockade against Cuba --  spoke during the demonstration, which was planned by the Cuban  Unity Movement [Movimiento Unidad Cubana].    Florida's Republican Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and  Lincoln Diaz Balart, as well as New Jersey's Democratic  Representative Robert Menendez, spoke at the demonstration.  They all expressed their support for maintaining the  restrictions, which have cost Cuba over $40 billion in the past  three decades.    Some 1,000 people, who arrived in three planes and 12 buses  from Miami, took part in this demonstration in front of the  Capitol.    A spokesperson for the organization called International  Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz Para Cuba] told PRENSA LATINA  by telephone that the demonstration was staged to protest a  draft bill proposed by New York's Democratic Representative  Charles Rangel, who will submit said bill for discussion before  four congressional committees on 17 February [date as received].    Rangel's draft bill, which is called the Free Trade With  Cuba  Act, has the support of 30 U.S. congress members, religious  leaders, businessmen, academicians, and the moderate sector of  the Cuban- American community.    Paul Asure, an International Peace for Cuba spokesman, said  that the demonstration's organizers sought to get the attention  of U.S. Government leaders in a context in which they are  increasingly becoming a minority, as they are listened to less  and less.    Asure added that they see themselves as losing strength in  their efforts to smother Cuba and are trying to make noise.  However, they are faced with the current situation where people  in the United States and most members of the Cuban-American  community are pressing Washington to change its policy toward  Cuba.    On 12 February the so-called International Peace for Cuba  organized a demonstration in favor of Rangel's proposal and the  U.S.-Cuban Friendship Caravan, which will take humanitarian aid  to Cuba on 12 March.    Today's demonstration in Washington is the most advertised  activity by ultrarightist groups since Havana announced a call  for a dialogue between the government and representatives of the  Cuban community abroad to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April.    According to Andres Romero, president of the Organization of  Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organizacion Cubanos-Americanos por  la Dignidad], this demonstration is ""more or less the same  thing"" and it shows that they ""feel as cornered as those who see  their game is about to end.""    Romero told PRENSA LATINA that representatives of various  groups that oppose the blockade also participated in the  demonstration because if ""this is a democratic country, we are  also entitled to exert our rights.""    When people of this type use their time to threaten the  lives  of 11 million people solely to defend their personal  interests.... their words, predictions, and threats lose their  strength.    The demonstration by blockade advocates is viewed as an act  of protest against those who favor an end to economic sanctions,  including prominent U.S. publications such as THE NEW YORK  TIMES, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, THE JOURNAL OF COMMERCE, THE  WASHINGTON POST, and WORLD TRADE magazine.    Even former supporters of the blockade have changed their  minds, as is the case with New Mexico's Democratic  Representative Bill Richardson, who is a cosponsor of Rangel's  bill.    Former Justice Secretary Ramsey Clark has also challenged  this policy and has raised the question that if Washington ended  the commercial embargo against Vietnam, why can it not do the  same with Cuba, where, as opposed to the former, no U.S.  citizens have died.    However, Warren Christopher, U.S. Secretary of State,  recently rejected the possibility of a policy change as in the  case of Vietnam, because, Christopher argued, ""Cuba and Vietnam  constitute two different situations.""

[Davietjarov] I would like to say first that Paraguay is for  us a new country. Our company is working in nearly every  country in the world, except Paraguay. Second, we always  thought Paraguay was a dictatorship like Russia was. We now  know you are on the road to democracy and as we understand it,  your government seeks to give the Paraguayan people a better, a  more dignified life. This is what we want for our own people: a  dignified life for all. You must know that Russia is one of the  largest oil exporters in the world, but because some of our oil  has run out, we have people looking for oil in different places.  This is why we thought there may be oil in Paraguay.    [Loma] You know the Americans are already here looking for  oil.    [Davietjarov] We know the Americans are looking for oil in  Paraguay. We want to know what is happening here. We want to  know exactly what the possibilities are here. This is our first  contact. We also want to know about the relations you have with  other oil companies. After that we will know what to do. This  is only the start. We can be a good competitors for the  Americans. We have good experts. Not everything that is  American is necessarily better, especially regarding the first  stages of prospecting for oil. We are the best at that.    [Loma] What is the role of Rosnef in the Russian economy?    [Davietjarov] Rosnef controls 70 percent of the Russian oil  market, 65 percent of byproducts, and 65 percent of the sale of  oil fields in the country. From the Russian map, you can see we  control over 70 percent of the oil territory. It is a company  that has more than 1 million workers [as published]. It  controls over 55 percent of the oil business in Russia. I am  the vice president of the consortium that used to belong to the  state, which is now in the process of privatization. This  process will conclude late this year.    [Loma] Could you tell us in what Latin American countries  your company has commercial interests?    [Davietjarov] We have been in Cuba for a long time,  supplying  oil. In Venezuela we buy and sell oil. We also worked with  various U.S. companies with interests in Latin America. We buy  machinery and oil extracting equipment.    [Loma] You do not operate in many Latin American countries.    [Davietjarov] We work mostly with the Americans in this  continent, especially with West-coast companies which deliver  oil and byproducts to the East coast of Russia because it is too  far to bring it through the European part of Russia.    [Loma] What is your opinion of the international oil market  following the imbalances created by the Persian Gulf War, and  the fall of the Communist system in your country and in Eastern  Europe?    [Davietjarov] The market collapsed but our exports did not  decrease. They remained at the same level. The international  oil price dropped but this did not influence the Russian market.    [Loma] What role do you believe Paraguay could play in the  international oil market?    [Davietjarov] Paraguay buys oil from Algeria. You must  produce oil in your country if you are to influence the market.  We believe that because Paraguay is located in the heart of  South America it could become a good platform for exchanging  Brazilian oil, for example, with Chile and other countries after  the Mercosur [Common Market of the South] becomes operational.  A big oil refinery could be built here to produce oil  byproducts for neighboring countries. We met yesterday with  Integration Vice Minister Fadlala and saw many positive points  in the program he showed us. Paraguay can play a major role in  the Mercosur even if no oil is found here.    [Loma] Will you look for oil here?    [Davietjarov] No, but we are ready.    [Loma] Ready, for what?    [Davietjarov] To meet with the minister and discuss the  problems and possibilities. We will then make our offer.    [Loma] This delegation seems to be the most important to  have  arrived in the history of bilateral relations. Does this  represent greater rapprochement between the two governments?    [Davietjarov] Our government program consists of maintaining  good relations with all countries as well as integrating into  the world and working in any country. We are not here only to  carry out propaganda in our favor but also to learn. We have to  learn the good things existing abroad. It would be a great  pleasure for us to learn many things in Paraguay.    [Loma] During your first news conference, as soon as you  arrived, you noted that you did not know much about Paraguay,  but you would be interested in obtaining more information with  the goal of establishing commercial channels. Have you learned  anything significant yet?    [Davietjarov] This is the first time that we are meeting and  become acquainted with the people here -- not only at the  ministries, but also on the streets where we have talked with  various pedestrians. We are becoming acquainted with the city  and everything is going step by step. If you only meet  ministers, you do not get much information. It is necessary to  become acquainted with the people, and we are doing just that.    [Loma] Can you tell me if you have signed any political or  economic agreement?    [Davietjarov] We have been here for a very short time. We  have held and we will hold many meetings. We have presented our  offers. I can only tell you again that we are ready. We hope  our offers will be interesting for Paraguayan entrepreneurs and  businessmen. We are ready to sign agreements. We have more than  1 million people working in our consortium. We are sure some  Paraguayan products will be of interest in Russia or at least  for your consortium.    [Loma] According to assessments by various international  observers, the political situation in Paraguay is not entirely  stable at this moment. What would your enterprise do if the  democratic process were discontinued here?    [Davietjarov] We are interested in good relations,  especially  economic ones, which should take place within an atmosphere of  political stability. Nevertheless, I am sure that we, like any  foreign company established here, can work well under any  political system. Business is business.    [Loma] What was your perception of Paraguay while you were  in  Russia? What is the Russian people's perception of Paraguay?    [Davietjarov] In our encyclopedias we have accurate  information on Paraguay. From the newspapers, I had a factual  report that the political system had changed and that the  country was on its way to democracy. I am mentally blending  this data with what I now see here for myself. We hope that  democracy will continue in Paraguay.    [Loma] Let us now discuss your country's domestic  situation. The IMF has admitted that your program of reforms is  too risky and did not take into account, or took very little  into account, the social cost, which is very high. Do you agree?    [Davietjarov] I can only give your my personal opinion. Our  people, rich or poor, will not back down. Everyone in our  country dreams of liberty. We say in Russia that bread alone is  not enough to live on. Our people are beginning to enjoy  liberty and do not want to lose it. Not just liberty, but also  the privatization program, which is going very fast. For  example, the privatization of the oil industry. Some 25 percent  of our enterprise has been offered to the workers, completely  free of charge. Another 15 percent has been offered to them,  allowing them to purchase shares over three years without paying  any interest. These special measures have been exclusively  implemented in the Russian oil industry. Because our enterprise  is taking the initial steps toward privatization, the majority  of stock must remain in the hands of the government. The  complete process will take about three years. I believe this is  the appropriate way to do things. This is the general  situation. Most people support the government in the  implementation of the program of reforms.    [Loma] President Yeltsin has just replaced the economy  minister, who was very radical, by someone who is more  conservative, seeking to reduce the pace of reforms. Do you  believe this is a timely change?    [Davietjarov] I personally know the new economy minister and  can say that he is in favor of a market economy. Unlike you, I  do not believe this change of ministers necessarily means a  slower pace toward a market economy. There is another, more  simple explanation for this change of ministers. When you are  heading for an unknown location, you must first go slowly, but  on other occasions you must go at full speed. I can tell you  that our government program will not radically change. We have  a new parliament in which there are many economists. I am sure  that their decisions will be correct. Our people understand  perfectly that problems always occur during changes of this  magnitude.    [Loma] What is your personal opinion of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy  and on the great success he achieved in the past elections.    [Davietjarov] I am personally sure, very sure, that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy will never be our country's president.    [Loma] Why not?    [Davietjarov] Because he totally lost the success he  achieved  in the elections following his remarks and visits to various  foreign countries. The Russian people now know him well. I  believe Vladimir Zhirinovskiy should stop considering himself  the future president of Russia.    [Loma] What is your personal opinion on Russia's current  situation? Do you believe the West has abandoned you in a sense?    [Davietjarov] My personal opinion is that Russia, alone,  must  be able to succeed. We have great scientists and intellectuals.  The country can succeed alone and overcome this difficult  situation. If the West moves away, it will return sooner or  later. It is not a problem. (he laughs)    [Loma] Would you like to add anything for the Paraguayan  people? What would you like to tell the Paraguayan people from  the Russian people?    [Davietjarov] No one in my country has given me the right to  speak in his or her name. Nevertheless, as an ordinary Russian  citizen, I hope you will continue on this democratic path and  have good relations with all countries, including Russia. Our  people work hard and, according to what I have seen so far,  Paraguayans also work hard. We have something in common. I  hope Paraguay will be modernized as we are being modernized.     "

He added: ""This pleases us, and we will work  toward that goal.""    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Lage noted: ""This is an  important step in terms of Canadian policy toward Cuba  throughout the years."" ""It is in line,"" he added, ""with an  increase in existing economic and commercial ties, particularly  in the area of tourism.""    In discussing the visit by Christine Stewart, minister of  state for Latin America and Africa, the Cuban vice president  said the visit intensifies relations between the two countries,  which are, in fact, already satisfactory. ""This relationship is  very important for Cuba,"" he concluded.    On Monday night, President Fidel Castro received Stewart,  the  highest-ranking Canadian official to visit the island in more  than 18 years since former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's visit  to Havana in 1976. Stewart described the meeting as fruitful.    Stewart also met with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina;  National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon; Finance and Prices  Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez; and Ernesto Melendez, minister of  foreign investment and economic cooperation.    Together with Lage, last night, the Canadian minister opened  an international businessmen's conference on business  opportunities in Cuba sponsored by THE ECONOMIST magazine. More  than 120 executives from firms in Canada, the UK, the United  States, Europe, and Latin America are participating in the event.    On Monday, Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet in Ottawa and  Stewart in Havana simultaneously issued official announcements  ending the suspension of Canada's official economic aid to Cuba.  The aid has been suspended in 1978 in the wake of the Cuban  military aid to Angola in the face of the South African  aggression.    Eduardo del Buey, a Canadian Foreign Ministry spokesman who  is accompanying Stewart, stressed: ""This is an important moment  in the ties between Cuba and Canada"" based on ""frequent and  honest dialogues.""    ""It is a dialogue between friends who disagree on certain  things, but who feel mutual respect. It is a dialogue that  serves to consolidate the basis of their relations,"" Del Buey  told PRENSA LATINA.    In this regard, Bienvenido Garcia, a department director at  the Cuban Foreign Ministry, explained: ""There are more points of  agreement than disagreement.""    At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart  said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not  only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also  because Canada will benefit.    Canada has large foreign investments in the mining sector,  not only in the traditional nickel sector, but also in  prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as exploring for  oil.    In addition, Canada sends more tourists to Cuba than any  other nation. More than 120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations  in Cuba every year.    Stewart also expressed Ottawa's desire for Cuba to return to  the OAS, where ""it can again play an important role with all of  its privileges and responsibilities.""    On this subject, she noted that ""isolation is unhealthy,""  and  she said her government plans to review with other nations the  possibility of Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization.  Cuba was suspended from the OAS in 1962 as a result of U.S.  pressures. ""This is not something we can accomplish overnight,  however; we believe it is a process we must begin to think  about,"" she added.    She said Canada understands the current difficulties in Cuba  and praised the government's efforts to try to maintain the  benefits of important social programs in areas such as education  and health. On this point, she stressed: ""It is difficult, but  vital, to continue these efforts.""    With regard to the Canadian Government's willingness to  heighten the political dialogue, Stewart mentioned the interest  expressed by Foreign Minister Ouellet to meet with Cuban Foreign  Minister Robaina at ""some appropriate moment.""

Robaina, on the other hand, delivered a message to Rawlings  from Cuban President Fidel Castro, and described the statements  by the Ghanaian leader as a reflection of the historic relations  between the two states. Robaina expressed appreciation for  Ghana's position on such issues as the U.S. blockade of Cuba and  human rights. After stating that 1993 had been the most  difficult year in the history of the Cuban Revolution, Robaina  predicted that 1994 would be the beginning of an ascending  spiral for the Cuban people.

Concurrent [concurrente] Ambassador Lazaro Cabezas presented  his credentials to Governor General Sir Reginald Oswald Palmer  in St. George's on 5 April and held official discussions with  Nicholas Brathwaite, prime minister and foreign minister.    Cabezas, an ambassador stationed in Barbados and accredited  to five eastern Caribbean countries, told PRENSA LATINA during a  telephone interview that the reception in Grenada was  surprisingly friendly despite many years without diplomatic  relations.    ""We felt all of Grenadian society recognizes the important  contribution Cuba made during the government of Maurice Bishop  (1979-1983) to the development of that small island,"" he said.    Government officials and professionals who studied in Cuba  told Cabezas of the importance of Cuba's contribution in  building the Point Salines International Airport, which has led  to an increase in tourism, the giving of advice to the fisheries  industry and health sector, and the offering of scholarships.    The Cuban diplomat said the governor general as well as  Brathwaite conveyed to him their gratitude for past assistance  and their interest in promoting new ties of cooperation, mainly  in the public health field. In a visit to explore means of  cooperation, the Cuban representative met with Phinsley St.  Louis, health, housing, and environment minister, and Shirley  Mcthlin, Foreign Ministry permanent secretary and law school  graduate from Santiago de Cuba University.    Cabezas also met with executives of the Grenada Chamber of  Commerce, whom he invited to participate in the meeting of  Caribbean businessmen scheduled for June in Santiago de Cuba.    In the VIP book of visitors to St. George's Government  House,  the Cuban ambassador left a written testimony of ""this historic  day"" during which Grenada and Cuba grew close again.    Bilateral relations reached their peak during the popular  revolutionary government of Maurice Bishop, who was ousted and  killed by a faction of his cabinet on 19 October 1983.    The United States launched a powerful military invasion  against the small island seven days later under the pretext of  rescuing U.S. citizens who were at St. George's.    The U.S. military occupation lasted a year and a half, and  bilateral relations were frozen during the government installed  under those circumstances.    Following the election of the current Grenadian Government,  Cuba stopped questioning its legality in international forums,  and Grenada lifted its objections of allowing Cuba into the  Caribbean Tourism Organization (CTO). All of these actions can  be considered a process of detente which culminated in the  acceptance of the new ambassador's credentials.     "

The top Canadian official will meet with Cuban Government  officials and deliver a speech at the International Conference  on Business Opportunities in Cuba promoted by the British  magazine THE ECONOMIST, which will begin here on Monday.    A Canadian Embassy representative told PRENSA LATINA that  this visit to Cuba falls within the framework of the political  dialogue between the two countries, which has increased since  1989 with the exchange of official visits.    Former Cuban Foreign Minister Ricardo Alarcon traveled to  Ottawa that year, and the following year his Canadian  counterpart, Louise Frechette, visited Havana, where she met  with President Fidel Castro. Both countries have expressed  their satisfaction over the development of the political  dialogue and the expansion of economic ties.    Since the administration of Conservative Prime Minister  Brian  Mulroney, Canada has been strengthening its relations with Latin  America. The current Liberal administration of Jean Chretien  wants to consolidate those relations, particularly in the  commercial arena, and has taken steps in that direction.    At the recent OAS General Assembly, Stewart called for  breaking the isolation orchestrated against Cuba and advocated  Cuba's return to that hemispheric organization.    Prior to that time, Canadian Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet  stressed Ottawa's rejection of the U.S. blockade against Cuba  and called for an end to the policy.    Canada and Mexico were the only countries in the hemisphere  who in 1962 refused to accept U.S. demands that OAS  member-countries break relations with the island.     "

The basic industry sector includes eight [number as heard]  branches: the production of oil, nickel, glass, paper and paste,  as well as chemistry and mining geology, which have been offered  to potential investors over the past few years for exploitation.    As a result of these negotiations, thus far, Cuba has signed  26 contracts for mineral exploration and exploitation, two for  administrative functions, one for the exploitation of copper in  Pinar del Rio Province, and two partnerships have been  established to conduct feasibility studies of gold, lead, and  zinc deposits.    These agreements, which cover 50 percent of the area up for  bid, include work over an area of approximately 40,000 square km  of national territory; they do not include agreements for the  exploration and extraction of oil. This is another branch of  the basic industry that has made serious progress in the field  of partnerships between the state-owned Cuba Petroleum and  foreign firms.    Regarding oil exploration, 16 of the 33 high expectation  blocks into which the country has been divided, have already  been contracted to French, Canadian, British, and Swedish firms  and, according to Basic Industries Minister Marco Portals, all  of the blocks will have been contracted out by the end of the  year.    The nickel industry, meanwhile, is in the process of  increasing its production after a strong decline that began  following the severing of ties with Eastern Europe, which was  its primary buyer. Cuba diversified its nickel markets and today  exports the mineral to 26 countries. Thanks to economic  partnerships with Canada, The Netherlands, Great Britain, and  Italy, and the efficiency of Cuban specialists and technicians,  production will increase this year. Thus, the growth of vital  branches such as oil, nickel, and cobalt production is  guaranteed by economic partnerships with foreign firms, none of  which, in fact, are from the United States.    Therefore, the economic blockade it decreed against Cuba has  backfired on the United States, which is now deprived of  participation in attractive business opportunities.     "

Different perspectives characterize it in history within the  social transformation launched 35 years ago. Today it strives  to achieve a re-evaluation in volume and scope that will turn it  into the country's foremost industry.    This cannot be achieved simply with sun, beaches, and  verdant  scenery, which is common in many places throughout the  Caribbean. These elements only represent the natural  surroundings of an ongoing explosion.    The people, their sympathy and hospitality, their social  saga, and our current epic multiply the attractiveness that is  now a potential for tourism given the authorities' decision to  open it as a first class market... but that is not enough either.    An economic organization must outline a much more productive  combination of the geographical layout and human atmosphere.  New and not so paternalistic models will strengthen the  required vigor.    Under more realistic considerations, starting at this stage,  bankruptcy appears in Cuba as an economic category that will  bolster spirits, encourage ideas, and guarantee efficiency.    Different View    Until recently, the massive socialization of production  means  and basic services involved a ""responsibility delegated to  high-ranking officials"" in many Cuban economic structures,  meaning a form of blaming others -- particularly the state --  for the deficiencies and problems resulting from the actions  carried out by the people, themselves.    The issue is too complex to explain here, but in tourism, as  in many other sectors, it entailed shortages, deficiencies,  limitations, even losses which directly affected the guarantee  of a salary, job, and social benefits for all those who  participate in the process.    Until now it was normal for the state to finance, subsidize,  support, become indebted, and assume all the risks and  non-reimbursed expenses, seeking an overall financial balance  based on the income from more profitable areas and entities.  The crisis provoked by external reasons further emphasized the  lack of balance by making profitable activities more and more  scarce.    It is as a result of this reality that staunch socializing  views begin to change quite drastically. Agriculture production  groups working as cooperatives are the most recent example, but  not the only one.    Assuming business roles that have been carried out by the  Armed Forces for several years -- a type of pilot plan for high  production efficiency and feasibility -- tourism now faces new  challenges with the economic good sense demanded by the current  situation.    Osmany Cienfuegos, vice president of the Council of Minister  in charge of the sector, explained in detail the concept  currently under way during a closed-door meeting with a group of  journalists, which included this correspondent.    The principle that will guide the country's tourism system,  as it is being done by autonomous enterprises such as Cubanacan  and Gaviota, will be the principle of competition and  efficiency. That is why the ""burdensome and obsolete"" central  structure called the National Institute of Tourism was  dismantled and ""multiplied"" to become three independent hotel  chains, plus another one destined for maritime facilities and a  company that is comprised of territorial sections under the  acronym RT (recreation and tourism).    This network will incorporate transportation, catering, and  advertising enterprises, shops, equipment, and other services  under the supervision and control of a single ministry.    He said the hotel chains Isla Azul, Horizontes, and Gran  Caribe, will have between 6,000 and 7,000 rooms each. The first  one will be a domestic chain, the second one will have up to  three-star hotels, and the third chain will be one of greater  hierarchy.    Jose Fernandez Cossio, former Cuban ambassador to Mexico,  has  been appointed general director of the Horizontes chain.    As part of the different outlook on tourism here, Cienfuegos  said this will be a job in which the entire country will  participate. For example, Cuban ambassadors abroad will be  mainly responsible for carrying out this activity with optimum  quality, something unthinkable for representatives of other  countries.    Without mentioning operational details, the way the  activities and mechanisms will be implemented in the new  ministry will give us a glimpse of the future course of the  economy. For example, to avoid bureaucracy, the services of  specialized institutions will be hired when necessary, as in the  case of audits. That is why there will only be 50 officials  working there.    In addition, decentralization is aimed at getting the hotel  manager or other type of entrepreneur to be held accountable for  what is done at his installation or activity. It means each  person will respond for what happens in his immediate  surroundings, something Cuban society greatly needs.    Likewise, closed preserves, the land plot mentality, and  other subjective limitations that have become a burden for  tourism -- as for many other activities -- will be eliminated so  that, for example, in the sale of facilities and options, the  RT's will not only be working for the ones they run. They will  be forced to give the same treatment to other facilities in  their territory under the risk that they could be stripped of  properties under their custody if they act differently.    Another new feature is that the management cadres of the new  state tourism structure will be subject to contracts, renewable  or not, depending on the specific results of their work, which  in practice means that whoever is not earning a profit will go  bankrupt along with his entity.    Results and Expectations    Without going into many details, Cienfuegos said that in  1993  Cuba reported a 30-percent increase in tourism revenue, with  560,000 visitors, and it is believed that tourism revenue could  be 25 percent higher this year than last.    He said that if the trend continues, tourism revenues could  surpass revenues from the export of sugar cane, the principal  export product in the country. This could become a reality in a  few years.    In addition to obtaining financial results, with the  transformation of Cuba's tourism industry, the country is  publicly starting a transformation of concepts and operational  methods in the Cuban economy that can be used as a guideline for  its progressive but massive introduction into the rest of the  nation's activities and fields, a necessary mechanism to  increase efficiency and productivity. It will help the country  leave behind the present critical period.    According to a survey conducted by a specialized company,  Mexico was the third place country from where the most tourists  visited Cuba in the winter of 1993, with 29,964 tourists, only  surpassed by Canada and Argentina.

This visit is the third  stage of a tour he is making of five African countries.    Robaina was met at the airport by (Estanislus Chiwedere),  permanent secretary of the foreign ministry, who highlighted the  two nations' common interests. In his welcoming speech, this  high-ranking official said he was welcoming the representative  of a nation that has shown solidarity toward Zimbabwe ever since  Zimbabwe was struggling for independence, and with which (?it)  shares many positions.    Robaina, for his part, said his visit was in response to the  interest in explaining how his people live and work and in  exchanging mutually beneficial experiences.    Robaina had earlier been in Angola, where he had talks with  high-ranking Angolan officials. Those talks have been described  as very fruitful. Shortly before leaving Angola, the Cuban  foreign minister held a news conference. Here, from Luanda, is  journalist (Issac Nenei).    [(Nenei)] -- live] As we said, he left Luanda this morning  on  his way to Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, continuing his  diplomatic offensive through southern Africa. Namibia and Zambia  will be the last countries he visits. The objective of this  visit is, as we have already said, to explain what is happening  in Cuba and, at the same time, to find out what is happening in  this part of the world.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] I am really leaving with the  satisfaction of having been able to carry out, in a short time,  an intense program. But I am also leaving with the satisfaction  of now being highly informed, and brought up to date, about a  reality that my people follow very closely.    We Cubans follow very closely what happens in Angola; and,  truly, since we know that the Angolans also follow very closely  what happens in Cuba, we have tried to give them as much  information as possible.    [Unidentified journalist, speaking Portuguese] What does  Cuba  expect (?to obtain) from Angola and other African countries?    [Robaina] Cuba expects from Angola and other African  countries what we expect of the world. And although some may  think that what we expect from Angola and the world, or of any  country in particular, is the solution to our  problems....[rephrases] Please, the solution to Cuba's problems  depends first of all on the Cubans themselves, and on a  mechanism that Cuba maintains with many in the world. Cuba  expects, from Angola and from the world, what Cuba also  advocates for the world: understanding and respect. Simply that.    [Unidentified journalist, speaking Spanish] As regards the  crisis Angola is experiencing right now, Robaina, who is a  member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba, said  that the Cuban people hope Angola will solve its problems [word  indistinct]. [end recording]    [(Nenei)] From Luanda, this is (Issac Nenei) for the  National  Radio Newscast in Cuba.    [In a similar item, Radio Havana Cuba in Spanish on 16 Jan  at  1300 GMT reports that Robaina said that Cuba wants to establish  stronger economic ties with various countries as part of its  policy to neutralize the effects of the U.S. blockade and the  collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe.    Robaina said Cuba is seeking mutually beneficial  cooperation,  a principle that is the basis for the country's opening to  foreign capital and the establishment of joint enterprises. In  statements to the media, Robaina rejected reports of a possible  barter of Cuban weapons for Angolan petroleum.    Robaina will head for Zambia and Namibia following his visit  to Zimbabwe].

Budnitskiy, sector director of the RF  Economics Ministry's Council on Productive Forces: ""Russia, Do  You Know This Itch?: What We Have, We Don't Hold on To""]    [Text] More and more oil, natural gas, copper, and  nickel are being exported to the West from Russia for next to  nothing. The income is coming to rest in foreign banks. Who is  going to put a halt to this economic self-exhaustion? And how?  According to the author of this article, we must restore  legislatively the state monopoly on the mineral trade--if only  for 10 years or so.    Reform of the Russian economy started out to the slogan  about the need for structural perestroyka. What is its  intermediate result? In 1993, the raw materials component of  Russian exports to the far abroad rose to 86 percent, whereas in  1990 the proportion of raw materials in exports was a little  more than 60 percent. This means that structural perestroyka  still has a strongly expressed negative significance.    The increase in the export of raw materials from Russia is  proceeding at the expense of domestic consumption. Domestic  consumption of oil over the last three years has declined by 40  percent, and of natural gas by 22 percent; nonetheless, official  export (not counting contraband export) of these products for  this period increased by 4 and 20 percent, respectively. An  analogous situation is taking shape with metals, cellulose,  ammonia, mineral fertilizers, and so on.    Export from Russia is going to grow. The increased cost of  imports will tend to limit the number of solvent purchasers and,  consequently, to cut the volume of imports themselves. If these  processes are not halted, the physical volumes of raw materials  exports will grow--to the point of completely exhausting our  reserves of the types of raw materials, semi-manufactured items,  and metals being exported.    In addition, we are seeing a relative increase in the cost  of  capital stock in devalued hard currency and a decline in the  price for manpower. The foundations for any possible industrial  development will be undermined in that part and the private  sector.    Russia has been in a similar situation before, during the  NEP  (New Economic Policy), when private entrepreneurship was choked  out precisely due to a lack of raw materials. In those years, up  to 80 percent of the raw material resources were exported from  Russia. Liberalization of foreign economic activity led to the  majority of enterprises in the mining complex, independently or  through the SP [joint enterprises], MP [small enterprises], and  so on, entering the foreign market.    The foreign economic turnover of these enterprises is  subject  to virtually no accounting. According to various data, export of  hard currency received primarily from the sale of nonrenewable  resources and primary output from them totaled $40-45 billion  over the last two years.    The scale of sanctioned and contraband export of raw  materials resources is leading to a sharp decline in prices for  many types of raw materials resources. Prices for copper,  nickel, and aluminum on the London metals market have fallen in  1993 in comparison with 1990 by 22, 42, and 31 percent,  respectively.    Most worrisome, however, is this: the normal work of the oil  and gas, metallurgical, fuel and energy complexes, and chemical  and lumber processing industry--the main suppliers of hard  currency to the Russian Federation (RF)--depend to a significant  extent on imported equipment and spare parts for that equipment.  Due to the ""price scissors"" (low prices for raw materials and  high prices for equipment), the quantity of raw materials being  exported is growing steadily. The increase in the cost of  imported equipment is simply frightening. If in the years  1976-80 equipment worth $12 billion was bought for the Russian  raw materials complex, and in the years 1981-85 about $20  billion, then in the last 5-7 years, according to specialists'  calculations, about $100 billion was needed.    Actually, the export of raw materials from Russia was  also practiced immediately after the conclusion of the civil  war. In the years 1933-34 (at the end of the Depression in the  West), this process reached maximum proportions. Only in 1936  did a decisive decline in raw materials export begin. For  approximately 10-12 years after the end of World War II, raw  materials were virtually not exported abroad from the USSR at  all. This specifically may have been one of the reasons for the  complete restoration of the USSR's industrial potential by 1954,  something the majority of Western analysts thought would take  Russia at least 30 years.    An equally alarming situation is taking shape in what is for  Russia a new economic process--the sale of the rights to  prospect for and work mineral deposits, or simply--the sale of  our depths. At the present time, it is in the raw materials  sector of the Russian economy that elevated investor activity  has been noted. However, Russian interests are virtually not  considered at all in raw materials plans, which envisage taking  abroad the raw materials and the profit received from their  sale. Reinvestment of the profit into Russia's economy is not  being considered at all in these plans.    The absence of an elaborated mechanism for holding  competitions for the right to prospect and work Russian mineral  deposits leads to incompetent, frequently only recently  organized companies that are interested not in exploiting the  deposit but in the resale of the licenses to work them receiving  licenses.    The loss of state control over utilization of the mineral  and  raw materials base and over reliable resource provision for the  country is becoming very real. This could lead to the total  collapse of Russia's economy and, as a consequence, to the loss  of the state's economic and political independence.    Russian legislation on regulating mineral use is limited  essentially to the RF Law ""On Mineral Wealth"" and a series of  resolutions by the Supreme Soviet. In the United States, on the  other hand, a country with developed market relations, the  number of laws actually reinforcing the state's priorities in  the use of the national raw materials base is almost 10. I will  list only a few of them: the law on national policy in the  sphere of materials and minerals; the Mining Code; the law on  strategic resources. . . . The Bureau of Mines, which is part of  the Department of the Interior, takes care of the planning  (""marketers,"" who shudder at the mention of this word, should  forgive me) for prospecting and for opening up national mineral  and raw materials resources in the United States.    Within the framework of forming and implementing RF raw  materials policy, the state must be secured by law the priority  right to dispose of mineral wealth. In all joint and wholly  foreign plans for opening up Russian mineral wealth, the portion  of the raw materials and profit that is going to be taken out of  Russia must be carefully discussed in order to allow us to  determine the volumes of funds for reinvestment into Russia's  economy.    In prerevolutionary Russia, foreign entrepreneurs were  allowed to take out a little more than 12 percent of the raw  materials they mined or the profit received from their sale.  Naturally, no one could take the remainder of the profit away  from them: legislation proposed that they use this capital for  the development of the Russian economy. And they agreed to this.  Many even took Russian citizenship.    In order to avoid mistakes in taking decisions on  large-scale  raw materials projects, it is essential, first of all, to  determine how the exploitation of a given natural deposit  corresponds to Russia's long-term financial, social, raw  materials, and other interests. This has to be done on the basis  of a study of the current state of affairs in the market, taking  into consideration the Russia's changing requirements for a  given type of raw material and their reserves. Secondly, to  assess the geopolitical aspect, taking into account the  influence of the working of a specific deposit on the world  production of any resource now and in the future.    When these issues are decided, a group of deposits will be  determined whose exploitation will not substantially affect  Russia's domestic and geopolitical interests. This group can be  put up for auction. But in such a way that Russia set its own  conditions, and the companies compete in offering the conditions  most advantageous to us.    The most decisive step must be taken in the sphere of  foreign  trade. The state monopoly on foreign trade in mineral raw  materials must be restored legislatively for a minimum of 10  yeas. The need for this step can be explained by the fact that  in the current situation only a state monopoly will permit the  halting of what is essentially the contraband export of capital  from the country on a scale that is at the very least  humiliating for a great country.    I think that our raw materials giants have to realize  the complexity of the situation and reconcile themselves to the  necessity for a state monopoly on foreign trade in raw  materials. Otherwise, in the event of Russia's loss of economic  and political independence, these joint-stock companies,  concerns, and so on will be transformed, in the best case, into  branches of Shell, BHP, and others of that ilk.    One of the main lines of use for this money, undoubtedly, is  conversion. Not ""landslide"" conversion, like now, but sensible  conversion. A gradual decrease in the volume of equipment  imported for the raw materials complex, to be compensated for by  the production of it in enterprises of the military-industrial  complex, will make it possible to decrease the share of  mineral-raw material and fuel-energy components in the structure  of Russian exports.    The prerequisites for the development of a progressive  structure for the RF economy will appear. State raw materials  policy must become (and one would like to believe necessarily  will become) the basis for real structural perestroyka.     "

Savage is heading a delegation of businessmen interested in  initiating trade relations with the island.    The group accompanying Savage is comprised of  representatives  of 16 Nova Scotian companies. Nova Scotia is a territory on  Canada's Atlantic coast. The entrepreneurs see Cuba as a place  with real business prospects.    ""Taking into account the business opportunities available in  Cuba, the entrepreneurs accompanying me are very eager and  interested in doing serious business with the island,"" Savage  said. Savage is making the first working visit to Cuba in 17  years by a provincial chief of state.    The delegation was welcomed by Foreign Trade Minister  Ricardo  Cabrisas Ruiz and Carlos Martinez Salsamendi, president of the  Cuban Chamber of Commerce, who briefed the visitors on the  current economic situation in Cuba, its problems, and  development prospects, as well as on the availability of capital  investment opportunities.    Savage, who became prime minister with the Liberal Party in  a  landslide victory last May, said that the results of the trade  probe and discussions the group expects to complete will surely  be mutually beneficial.    There are now 400 companies that maintain trade relations  with the island. There are 112 companies or joint ventures in  operation, 22 of which are with the Canadian capital.    Canadian Ambassador to Cuba Mark Entwistle commented that  the  Canadian entrepreneurs have a growing interest in the Cuban  market, where they find commercial and investment stability.    Cuba is Canada's fourth most important trade partner in  Latin  America, and first in the Caribbean and Central America.    During their stay, Savage and his commercial delegation will  also be greeted by Lionel Soto, vice president of the Council of  Ministers; Nicolas Rodriguez, the acting foreign minister; the  ministers of health, fishing industry, and agriculture; and  Ricardo Alarcon, the president of Parliament. They will also  visit centers of scientific and economic interest.    Cuba maintains certain agreements, especially in fishing,  with the Atlantic Province of Nova Scotia, whose Halifax Bay is  the world's second largest and is the site of heavy trade  traffic. Now Cuba will be able to broaden such ties to other  areas.     "

With this in mind, the president emphasized that ideological  conflicts are being replaced by a struggle for spheres of  influence in geopolitics, in which Russia's integration into the  world economy is seen as a threat to the national interests of  several leading states who see Russia as a competitor in  everything.    Therefore, Yeltsin said, ""no matter what changes occur in  Russia and the world, it will be a very long time before  counter-intelligence specialists are threatened by unemployment"".    There are those who would like to take Russia's natural  resources and acquire her leading technologies in several  spheres. The recent exposure of several foreign spies in Russia  is evidence of this, the president said. But the work of the  federal counter-espionage people should not be judged by the  number of spies they catch. The most important thing, Yeltsin  said, is preventive work; first of all, ""espionage activities in  Russia must be prevented"".    The president also expressed serious concern over the  ""dissolution of the state secret system"". The reforming of  ministries, the destruction of the control over secrets which  was formerly exercised by individual government and economic  sectors, and the unfounded liquidation of many supervising state  bodies have resulted in the disorganisation of the former system  of keeping state secrets.    Russia has adopted the law, ""On State Secrets"", but a new  system of defending state secrets has not yet been created on  its foundation. Yeltsin expressed his opinion that only the  federal counter-intelligence service is capable of reliably  protecting state secrets under the current conditions.  Non-state structures especially need that department's help in  developing and implementing protection measures, the president  said.     "

You know the  background. The information has been reported by the media.  Today we will discuss this.    [Recio] It is, first of all, one more confirmation that the  U.S. policy toward Cuba on this much-haggled issue of human  rights is based above all on a fallacy. It is founded, above  all, on a fictional script that they wish to impose on Cuba to  continue a policy of maintaining the blockade and doing  everything possible to prevent the Cuban people from fulfilling  its dream of sovereignty and independence.    This case seems to come straight from the movies. It smells  of the movies. Friendly hands have given Cuba a document which  proves that SINA [USINT] has sent a letter to the State  Department, the CIA -- listen closely now -- the CIA [repeats],  and the Immigration and Naturalization Service clearly  acknowledging that in Cuba there is really no evidence of human  rights violations and that those who request U.S. refugee  program protection must invent stories to prove that they are  objects of persecution by Cuban authorities or have been victims  of human rights violations.    [Rodriguez] I also believe it is good to point out something  I was reading in a news agency dispatch that confirms the ties  between these groups, these minuscule groups as we Cubans call  them, and the CIA, and how -- through USINT in Havana -- these  groups are encouraged, financed, and promoted. Recently, thanks  to my journalistic work, I had an opportunity to meet with  several members of one of these small groups. I pointed out to  them in my conversation that they are puppets of Yankee  diplomacy because they had also told me they have free access to  USINT. Every member of these groups, or at least their leaders,  have free access to USINT. What they are truly seeking is the  establishment of a biographical record in order to eventually  emigrate to the United States.    [Roque] The document itself is entitled: Actual Situation of  the Cuban Refugee Program. The document states that the visa  request process keeps encountering dubious cases mostly provoked  by economics. I believe we must comment on this because that is  the way it is.    [Rodriguez] That is very interesting because the  international campaign the United States wages against Cuba is  precisely that the emigration of a significant number of Cubans  to the United Stated is rooted in politics. However, Cuba has  always maintained that those leaving do so above all for  economic reasons. There is a difference between emigres and  refugees. It seems completely normal for Cubans here to admit  that they emigrate for economic reasons. However, the United  States maintains that they are not emigrants, but refugees, or  dissidents, or persecuted, etc.    This document proves... [changes thought] They acknowledge:  We cannot find a way to prove that there are cases of human  rights violations. What we actually find is that people ask to  leave Cuba for economic reasons. This is very important.    [Recio] I believe this proves once again that those Cubans  who wish to move to the United States are held hostage to that  policy. I believe this has been a habit of U.S. policy since the  beginning of the Revolution.    [Roque] You spoke earlier of fallacies. In this case, I  believe that the entire U.S. policy toward Cuba is full of  fallacies, from beginning to end. Today we are talking about new  evidence of the fallacy of U.S. policy toward Cuba based on the  document which USINT sent to the U.S. State Department, the CIA,  and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. As mentioned  earlier, friendly hands delivered this USINT document to Cuban  authorities.    [Rodriguez] I would like to reevaluate this. We describe  that policy as fallacious. However, I consider that adjective  very mild because we are speaking of infamy. We are speaking of  complete infamy because Cuba is accused, and has always been  accused, of violating human rights. They want to place Cuba, in  comparative terms, in a category with those places in the world  where great human rights violations occur.    It is truly offensive to be placed in this position, for  them  to accuse a country which, like any other, has made mistakes;  but something that has never occurred in this country is  continuous, massive violations of human rights, as a policy.  Rather, the contrary is true. We can say this because the people  know this better than anyone. They are witnesses that in Cuba no  one is persecuted, tortured, or missing; no one in Cuba is a  victim of police repression.    Everyday, you can turn on the television and see how police  organizations around the world massively violate human rights.  You do not see this in Cuba. Nevertheless, the United States not  only uses this argument against Cuba, they fabricate  circumstances. Be aware that these groups, or so-called human  rights activists, had been receiving privileges from, were  living off, the USINT. They even had what we call here in Cuba  that purpose [esa busca]. But not anymore.    According to this document, they are even selling fraudulent  claims. Through these sales, they are providing individuals with  fraudulent human rights claims so they can present themselves  for visas.    [Roque] Renato, I believe we could even quote that paragraph  of the USINT document addressed to the U.S. State Department,  the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Immigration and  Naturalization Service that reads: Over the past months,  accusations of fraudulent requests by activists and [words  indistinct] testimonials by human rights leaders have been  persistent. Due to the lack of documented and verifiable proof,  as a rule, USINT officials and members of the Immigration and  Naturalization Service consider cases on human rights most  liable to fraud.    [Recio] Juan Carlos, I believe it is important to reiterate  this about the CIA: Remember that just a few months ago, the CIA  disclosed or acknowledged for the first time ever that it had  conducted several attempts against Cuban leaders, especially  against the commander in chief. In other words, they publicly  admitted that they have been behind the policy of trying to do  away with the Cuban Revolution and making it disappear.    Once again, the CIA appears here as an element that unites  these groups that we could call Cuban opposition -- as they call  it abroad, or as they present themselves abroad. Once again, the  CIA uses various methods, but these so-called stupid children  [hijitos bobos] have not been what they expected, have not been  everything they thought they could be. I noticed that in the  document, they made reference to 225 cases analyzed by U.S.  officials. Of course, I am talking about the original document.  The secret document that we were talking about was disseminated  by the international press agencies.    Of these 225 cases, they say that 47 claim to have carried  out human rights activities. Nevertheless, only 19 of them were  finally approved by the USINT. By this you can see that there is  a generalized fraud behind this. They were taught to commit  fraud. The CIA, which is unquestionably behind all these  activities, was showing them ways to commit fraud.    [Roque] I believe we have left out one important factor: the  special rapporteur.    [Recio] Juan Carlos, that is precisely why Cuba viewed the  report presented by this so-called UN special rapporteur at the  UN Human Rights Commission as interference because as all of  you, and all the listeners may remember, Cuba never admitted the  physical presence of that individual into our country. This man  has been able to fabricate a report that adheres to the U.S.  policy toward Cuba that has to do with the brutal efforts and  brutal pressure the United States exercises to make the UN  condemn Cuba. This document we have spoken about, its discovery  -- in quotation marks -- or its appearance undoubtedly weakens  the U.S. intention to harm Cuba.    This demonstrates, once again, that Cuba does not even  remotely violate human rights and that the United States is the  main violator of human rights in Cuba; above all, by its  persistence and the feats or brutality with which it imposes an  economic blockade on the Cuban people. That is a form of  harassment. As a matter of fact, this rapporteur includes  recommendations in his report that to prevent the violation of  human rights in Cuba, the blockade be lifted. Of course, it is a  politicized way of seeing the problem.    [Rodriguez] Renato, I have no doubt that the speech  presented  by the Swedish rapporteur was drafted and written and given to  him to be read in Geneva by the CIA in the United States. He is  working with a set standard that is being sponsored by the U.S.  policy, and which has its actors.     "

Robaina announced the decision during deliberations of  The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, which began in Havana  on 22 April.    A conference spokesman told PRENSA LATINA that one such  measure will be to lift the five-year waiting period normally  required of people who legally left the island before they can  return to Cuba for a visit. Up to this time, anyone who left  Cuba for good had to wait five years before visiting the country  unless the purpose of their visit was humanitarian.    The requirement for emigrants traveling to Cuba to reserve  hotels during their stay, which they usually spend at relatives'  homes anyway, will also be removed. The spokesman indicated that  Cubans living abroad will also be allowed to study in Cuba but  will have to pay a tuition established for this purpose.  According to the source, the issue of a Cuban publication for  emigrants will also be considered.     "

In  the first quarter the production slump reached the record level  of 25 percent. The unstable internal political situation in  Russia and the deepening economic crisis, which could cause a  powerful social explosion this year, are giving rise to growing  Western concern. Political and business circles in the United  States, Germany, Japan, and other states are increasingly openly  voicing their opinion of the inability of the country's present  leadership to find a way out of the impasse without relying on  strong public organizations.    The Federation of Commodity Producers [FCP] has sent the  Russian Federation president proposals for taking measures  without delay to rescue Russian industrial and agricultural  production. The message makes a hard-hitting analysis of the  very grave situation in the Russian economy and sets forth  specific measures to organize a system of cooperation between  the FCP and the government with a view to working out and  implementing specific joint actions. B. Yeltsin has examined  the proposals and instructed V. Chernomyrdin to arrange  cooperation with the FCP for the purpose of overcoming the  disastrous drop in production and curbing the growth of  unemployment.    The FCP's practical activity in shaping new relations  between  commodity producers and the government and foreign partners is a  real step on the way to creating a self-organizing system of  economic relations. Russia will be unable to emerge from the  crisis without the painstaking, gradual building of working  market infrastructures and new relations in the economy. The  hopes of Ye. Gaydar and his supporters that an unrestrained  market will itself set everything to rights and that the economy  will start working efficiently have, as was to be expected,  proved a bluff. The transition to a civilized market is a  complex process which must be conducted sensibly and  systematically.    This FCP activity is meeting with increasing support from  Russian entrepreneurs, the corps of directors, and trade unions.  This is of considerable importance, since Yuriy Skokov has  declared his intention to run as a candidate in the 1996  presidential election and needs new supporters and broad  support. Today this cannot be achieved with fine promises alone  -- few people believe them anymore.     "

Almost no light is thrown on  them in the Russian press, but if something does appear, it is  with great distortions. In addition, the reasons for the drop in  production and the lowering of the standard of living in the  republic are not explained.    I am Belarusian; I periodically visit my homeland, and I see  that life there is becoming worse and worse. But, after all, it  was not long ago that Belarus was considered the most stable and  reliable republic of the USSR, and after its dissolution the  starting conditions of the new state were better than in  neighboring former republics of the USSR. In 1991-1992 half of  the former Union exported industrial and food commodities from  Belarus that were bought at cheaper prices than in other  regions. Our Lithuanian and Latvian neighbors proved to be  smarter. With a premonition of the quick end of the ruble in  their countries, the Balts bought up and exported everything  they could. Indeed, the Belarusians themselves haphazardly took  cattle to neighbors in the hope of earning money. The dashing  Dzhigits-Caucasians also did not lag behind the Balts. Trains  with conquering hucksters left from Moscow for Minsk, Brest, and  Gomel.    Belarus's proclamation of its independence in August 1991  did  not change anything in its economic activity. Independence Day  was established without taking the history of Belarusians into  account. As if there had been no Belarusian People's Republic,  which was proclaimed on 25 March 1918, no uprising of 1794, no  uprising of Kastus Kalinovskiy in 1863, no Grunwald Battle, and  other remarkable events. The coupon-ticket system of protecting  the consumer proved to be weak in the face of intensifying  corruption, wholesale accumulation of commodities at bases and  warehouses, and given the practical absence of customs offices  at the borders.    Continuously increasing inflation in Russia caused an  enormous shortage in the supply of money with the picture of the  leader of the proletarian revolution. Discontent and strikes  started with demands for payment of wages that were being  withheld in various regions. On airliners to hot spots in  immense Russia, Yeltsin and his companions-in-arms scattered  money that had just come off the printing press. Russia accepted  foreign handouts. The whole Western world jabbered about  rendering Russia humanitarian assistance. Many former republics  of the USSR hurriedly introduced national money. Intimidated by  the April strikes of 1991, the Government of Belarus, fearing  that it would not get its lot of all-Union money coupons,  introduced its own monetary surrogate--the ""hare,"" which was  printed at the Perm Goznak factory. All-Union notes of the 1991  version, Russian notes of the 1992 version, and ""hares"" were  simultaneously in monetary circulation in the republic. In  addition, a distribution coupon system that protected the  Belarusian consumer from his foreign colleague was operating.  Food commodities were sold only for ""hares,"" with presentation  of a citizen's consumer card of the republic. Payment with  coupons of the two systems was allowed for transportation,  municipal services, and public catering. Such a system made it  possible to avoid a sharp drop in production and to maintain  relative stability in the republic for a short time. V.F.  Kebich, chairman of the Council of Ministers of Belarus,  declared at the end of 1992 that the republic was successfully  overcoming the first stage of a smooth transition to market  relations, that the slump in production had been stopped, and  that a slow rise had begun. We will add that S.S. Shushkevich,  chairman of the Supreme Soviet, had refused humanitarian  assistance. The first sprouts of national independence began to  appear at that time: Independent newspapers and journals began  to appear in the Belarusian language, a number of schools began  to teach in the mother tongue, discussions flared up in  parliament about whether the Belarusian language should be the  only official language, and the Belarusian Army began to be  formed. Diplomatic relations were established with many states,  comparatively good arrangements were made with the closest  neighboring states, and it was possible to avoid serious  disputes on territorial questions with Lithuania, with whom  Belarusians lived for several centuries in one state--the Grand  Duchy of Lithuania. The much higher standard of living in  Belarus by comparison, for example, with Russia can be judged by  the psychology of the consumer of food. Thus, on 4 January 1993  in Gomel I ate a glass of sour cream, drank a cup of tea, and  ate two small pieces of bread for 12 Russian rubles [R]. Such a  meal would have been several times more expensive in Russia.    The relative prosperity in Belarus in 1992 and the awakening  of national dignity were achieved in a fierce struggle of the  parliamentary opposition with the communist majority. In  contrast to the unsound Russian shock programs of transition to  the market--""400 days"" and ""500 days""--the Government of Belarus  did not have official programs. At the same time, the  opposition, in the form of the BNF [Belarusian People's Front],  worked out its own program of privatization and transition to  the market, calculated for 20-25 years and consisting of several  stages. In addition, the transition to each successive stage was  to be implemented only to the extent the previous one was  realized. This would make it possible to avoid chaos and tension  in the country. The communist parliament of Belarus rejected the  proposals of the opposition.    The opposition called for the introduction of our own  currency--the taller--the withdrawal of Russian troops from the  territory of the republic, a restructuring of the Belarusian  Army, and the development of real programs for the creation of a  market economy. The opposition indicated that the inactivity of  the government and parliament, the marking time in place, and  the temporizing policy of Shushkevich, who was trying to  reconcile two opposite political directions, will lead to a  crash in the economy and loss of the republic's independence. At  the beginning of 1993 the BNF and other democratic forces of the  republic collected 442,000 signatures (according to the  Constitution of Belarus only 350,000 are required) for a  referendum on immediate parliamentary elections. The parliament  boycotted the constitutional demands of the people. S.S.  Shushkevich, taking a compromise position, passed a resolution  in parliament on ahead-of-schedule elections (by one year) to  the Supreme Soviet. These elections were supposed to have been  held in March 1994.    A big crack occurred in the economy of Belarus in the spring  of 1993, when not enough cash ""hares"" were available and coaches  with new batches of ""hares"" ""got lost"" in the labyrinth of the  railroad lines of the Moscow rail junction. The government  passed a resolution on the ""temporary"" circulation of the  Russian ruble in the purchase of food commodities. Prices began  to rise sharply in the republic. Products disappeared from the  shelves. The ""hare"" began to be quoted lower than Russian money.    The second blow against the economy of Belarus was delivered  in July 1993, when Russia, in a unilateral procedure, conducted  an operation to remove from circulation rubles with the image of  a silhouette of the leader and the introduction into circulation  of the 1993 version of bank notes of the Russian Bank. According  to an existing agreement of Russia with states that were in the  ruble zone, Russia was obligated to notify its colleagues within  six months about the conduct of such an operation. The current  notes of the national bank (""hares"") remained in circulation.  The financial system of the republic was broken. The economy of  the state, which relied mainly on the Russian consumer, began to  drop sharply. For two years the Government of Belarus  practically did nothing to reorient the economy toward other  countries, a Black Sea-Baltic economic union was not  established, which the opposition had insisted on, and the  question of the construction of a Ukraine-Belarus-Baltic oil  collector for the reception of oil from the Near East was not  resolved. Under pressure from the communist majority in  parliament, S. Shushkevich began to yield small gains anyway:  Activity of the Communist Party was authorized, Kebich's  government concluded an agreement with Russia on extending the  period of stationing Russian troops on the territory of Belarus  for another eight years, and Belarus joined the collective  security system.    We will note that Belarus was compelled in the course of  seven years to overcome by itself the consequences of the  Chernobyl accident, when 70 percent of all radioactive emissions  fell on its territory. One-fourth of the territory of the  republic was exposed to radioactive contamination. The republic  expends 20-25 percent of the national budget on elimination of  the aftereffects of Chernobyl annually. At the same time,  Belarus is the most militarized state in the world: In 1991, of  each 1,000 persons, 43 were servicemen.    Belarus did not sustain the repeated increase in prices in  1993 for Russian energy sources: There was not enough meat or  other agricultural products, which were delivered to Russia at  cheap prices. A number of enterprises came to a halt, and many  began part-time operations. Lack of our own policy, and  corruption in the upper echelons of power, which involved even  the family of the prime minister, led to a crash of the  financial and economic system of the republic. Inflation reached  50 percent a month, the exchange rate of the ""hare"" with respect  to the ruble fell by a ratio of one to four. Kebich's government  led the country on a road to nowhere. Striving to hold onto  power a little longer, first two powerful ministries (internal  affairs and state security) were sent into retirement, and  afterwards also S.S. Shushkevich, chairman of the Supreme  Soviet, and the activity of the social military union BZV  [Belarusian Union of Officers] was banned. The elected speaker,  M. Hryb, is striving for dictatorship, declaring the need to  introduce the institution of the presidency, and postponing the  elections of a new parliament until the end of the year.    The inclination of Kebich's government to avoid  responsibility for the inactivity and corruption is now being  covered by joining a unified ruble zone with Russia. The  responsibility is thereby transferred to the Government of  Russia, and all material losses--to the Russian taxpayer.  However, Russia's infusions into the existing economy of  Belarus, considering the composition of the current government,  will be squandered and embezzled.     "

The first step in Cuba's transition from a  totalitarian regime will be the unification of all opposition  forces,"" Carlos Alberto Montaner, chairman of the Cuban Liberal  Union in Exile and head of the influential dissident  organization Democratic Platform, told a group of Czech  reporters in an interview. Montaner has been living in exile  since the age of 18, and currently works as a journalist and  translator in Spain.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you briefly describe the situation of  the Cuban opposition?    [Montaner] We expect fundamental changes in Cuba. The  regime is trying to survive at the cost of constantly  intensifying repressions. The opposition is attempting to find  a peaceful solution that would lead to talks and free elections.  The authorities continue, however, to persecute the dissidents.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Could you say what is the stand of the  Democratic Platform regarding the person of Jorge Mas Canosa  (leader of a strong right-wing exile organization in the United  States -- LIDOVE NOVINY note)?    [Montaner] Mas Canosa represents a group that does not  believe in a peaceful solution to the situation in Cuba, and  expects that the change will be accompanied by acts of violence  against the regime. That certainly is very dangerous because it  could lead to a civil war that would completely devastate the  country.    The main difference between us is that we endeavor to talk  with Castro's government and seek a political solution.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you get any help from the international  community?    [Montaner] Yes. There is a group of Christian democrats and  a group of social democrats in our Liberal Union. They both  maintain contacts with the international centers of their  respective movements.    We have encountered great understanding and help in the  postcommunist countries, also in the Czech Republic, which, as a  former communist state, knows what it means to have a communist  government.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What are the main obstacles in Cuba's  transition to democracy?    [Montaner] First of all, it is Castro's obstinacy. He  created a dictatorship and is now attempting to change it into a  Chinese-type regime, wherein the capitalist economy is  controlled by the communists. For a number of reasons, however,  what works in China has no chance of success in Cuba.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] Do you really believe that the fundamental  changes that await Cuba can be implemented by peaceful means?    [Montaner] Before 1989, we believed that a peaceful  transition was impossible. The changes in Central Europe, which  transpired without bloodshed, gave us hope that the Cuban  transformation could take a similar course. The only possible  way is a dialogue with the opposition. If it was possible in  your country, Poland, and Hungary, why not in Cuba?    [LIDOVE NOVINY] If a violent coup took place after all,  would the United States intervene?    [Montaner] I am convinced it would. If a civil war took  place, the United States would be interested in an intervention.  It certainly would result in an international conflict.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] What will be the priorities of the first  Cuban postcommunist government and how much time is needed to  reform the country?    [Montaner] The first democratic government should orientate  itself toward the market and democracy. As far as the reforms  are concerned, it will depend on political consensus. If the  fundamental political agreements are reached, within four to  five years the new Cuban Government can overcome the worst  difficulties. The situation in the country is so bad that  whatever happens, it will be an improvement.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] How can one explain that Castro remains in  power despite the current catastrophic situation?    [Montaner] In Cuba, we are talking about a combination of  the communist regime and a standard Latin American Caudillism, a  dictatorship. The Latin American dictatorships usually endure  for a long time, just look at Paraguay, for instance.    [LIDOVE NOVINY] A year ago, you said in an interview that a  change will take place in Cuba within a year. The truth is  different. So, when will the change take place?    [Montaner] At this time, I cannot say. It is difficult for  a politician to predict. Perhaps, we could consult an  astrologist.    The estimates differ, it could take three or four years.     "
0,FT931-7728 ,"FT931-7728 _AN-DBWBTAC4FT 930223   FT  23 FEB 93 / Reform club's new member: Privatisation in Ukraine has begun at last      By EDWARD BALLS and CHRYSTIA FREELAND   As he brought down the hammer to open the first privatisation auctions in Ukraine, Volodymyr Pylypchuk, chairman of the parliamentary commission on economic reform, joked that his historic wooden mallet could eventually be worth more than any of the small businesses on sale. Yet last Saturday's modest auction of 17 restaurants and shops in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv - out of a total 4,000 small state businesses in the city - was the most concrete sign yet of the government's intentions. It showed it is serious about transforming one of the most conservative of the former Soviet republics into a market economy. If market reforms succeed, Ukraine could form a stable and prosperous buffer state between eastern Europe and Russia. But if they fail, the region could be destabilised as nationalist forces in Ukraine and Russia, both of which possess nuclear weapons, stoke up simmering territorial and military disputes to distract the public's attention from economic collapse. Ukraine's economy certainly needs radical change. The most populous republic after Russia, it has a budget deficit equal to 36 per cent of gross domestic product and an accelerating inflation rate of more than 50 per cent a month (13,000 per cent a year), which have undermined its fledgling new currency, the coupon. Last November, parliament granted Ukraine's new government the authority to rule the crumbling economy by decree. The cabinet has responded with a stream of reforms to liberalise prices and cut the budget deficit. Food prices tripled at the end of December as subsidies were cut, and the number of people entitled to social welfare payments has been reduced from 20m to 2m. These tough measures have convinced sceptics that the prime minister, Leonid Kuchma, believes in economic reform. But Ukraine's task is even more difficult than that of Russia, where reforms appear to have stalled, because Ukraine faces obstacles to economic change from outside as well as within the state. Ukraine remains heavily dependent on oil from Russia and trade with the other former Soviet republics, which together accounted for more than 80 per cent of Ukraine's trade and more than a third of total industrial production before the collapse of the former Soviet Union. But economic relations with Russia have deteriorated. The breakdown of rouble-financed trade, once Russia stopped accepting non-Russian roubles last summer, has left Ukrainian enterprises with Rbs426bn in unpaid bills from Russian concerns, and no convertible currency in which to conduct trade. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent last year. Meanwhile, the price of Russian oil has increased by 3,000 per cent over the past year, while consumer prices rose by 2,500 per cent. Even at these higher prices, Kuchma says that Ukraine will not be able to obtain enough oil this year. Last week the Russian prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, announced that Ukraine would get only 15m tonnes of oil in 1993, less than half last year's level. In addition, Russia has raised prices for natural gas and threatened to cut off supply if Ukraine does not pay up. The government also faces powerful domestic obstacles to progress. In recent years the economy has been hijacked by Ukraine's industrial elite. Factory managers have sold off company assets for personal profit. Last year, for example, they illegally re-exported 8m tonnes of state-supplied oil. They also managed to get Rbs1,325 billion of unbacked monetary credits in order to pay wages, a rise of 800 per cent in the stock of outstanding domestic bank credit compared with 1991, driving Ukraine into hyperinflation. 'Opposition to commercialisation comes from officials who have very specific economic interests which they are protecting,' says Viktor Pynzenyk, minister of the economy and architect of the reforms. Yet Ukraine hopes for one compensation from its sluggish embrace of the market. By beginning reforms a year later, it believes it can learn from Russia's failure to control inflation and stimulate output. The Ukrainian government argues that Russia put too much faith in stabilisation and the promise of western aid, without confronting the more reactionary ex-Communist forces in the state bureaucracy who still control the economy. Ukraine's reformers, working closely with World Bank officials in Kiev, believe that the key to success is liberalisation and small-scale privatisation in order to bypass the bureaucrats. Without these measures, the government says it will be unable to meet its target of bringing inflation down to between 3 and 4 per cent a month by the end of this year. Agriculture is to be privatised first: 13m Ukrainians are already landowners and produce 25 per cent of total food consumed in Ukraine. Reform-minded regions will be encouraged to pursue rapid privatisation of state property, following Lviv's example. To enforce reform outside Kiev, the government is preparing a package of decrees that will bypass the local councils dominated by ex-communists, by bringing regional governments directly under the control of the cabinet. The directors of Ukraine's 6,000 large state enterprises, at present answerable only to workers' collectives, will have to sign employment contracts with the state in the first quarter of this year. Yet even if Kuchma, himself a former factory director, can control conservative regional officials and industrialists, his reforms are unlikely to succeed if trade fails to revive and Ukraine cannot secure a reliable, affordable energy supply. Kuchma says restoring trade links with former Soviet republics is now a priority and supports moves to establish a new payments union for inter-republican trade. But Ukraine's leaders believe that Russia's motives in raising energy prices and restricting oil supplies reflect not only economic self-interest but also a political desire to bring Ukraine to heel. Ukraine's oil quota this year is 1m tonnes less than Russia has promised Belarus, which is one fifth Ukraine's size but has acceded to all of Russia's political and military demands. Russia's deputy prime minister Viktor Shokhin said last week that Russia will tie the continued supply of fuel to military and political conditions, including stationing Russian military bases in Ukraine. 'I cannot understand the Russian position,' Kuchma said last week. 'It can only be seen as pressure on Ukraine, motivated by something beyond economic considerations. This is a conflict in which there can be no victors.'   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9611 Administration of General Economic Programs.   Types:-  CMMT  Comment  Analysis.

The  present catastrophic situation in Russia and in the space of the  former USSR naturally placed this argument at the center of  endless discussions on the centuries-old Russian question: ""What  is to be done?"" And it seems that it is already not so much  these discussions as it is life itself that answers this  question unambiguously: It is necessary with any measures, right  up to extreme ones, to save the economy, and to restore and to  develop production at a high tempo, which alone can now  extricate the country from the slough of monstrous inflation.    This crying voice of real life is heard by all, but in very  different ways. And this does not at all depend on the extent of  common sense, professionalism, and people's civic  responsibility, but rather on their specific vital interests,  which are determined by social position and social inclination.  And, according to the letter of scientific truth, the ideology  of different social forces and a policy that corresponds to it  express these interests in a concentrated way.    At all times those tendencies and processes dominate the  economy in any country that responds most of all to the  interests of the social stratum or class that has a decisive  influence on the character of state authority and, consequently,  on its policy. Of course, all of this is political science  prescriptions. But, unfortunately, through the efforts of  certain interested social circles during the years of  perestroyka and reforms, such a chaos of ideas and categories  was created that people now have difficulty distinguishing red  from white and brown, and left from right. As for the usual  ""isms,"" they are anathematized and even declared nonexistent in  the modern life of humanity. Meanwhile, the ""civilized world,""  which is dear to the heart of our perestroyka supporters and  reformers, persistently calls its society capitalistic (but the  main thing is it considers it to be capitalistic), ignoring the  lamentation of our Marxist-Leninists that somewhere just ""over  the hill"" genuine socialism is blossoming. But God will be their  judge. But this is not what the question is now.    It is about something else--about the correlation of  political and economic concerns of our Russian authorities. Only  a blind person may not see that they are working most of all on  problems of self-reinforcement. This is its highest and truly  vital priority today. The economy as such and the distress of  the people is of interest to them only to the extent they do not  prevent them from concentrating efforts precisely on this  priority. But its reliable guarantee consists first of all on a  rapid expansion of social support of the authorities in the form  of important entrepreneurs and numerous small and average  knights of profit who will staunchly defend their just acquired  ""beautiful life"" and a government that opens the way for them to  such a life. Hence, the destructive pace and scales of  privatization of the economy of the country, and hence the  almost unlimited scope for the purchase and sale of all and  everything for the enrichment of the leaders of the excessively  growing bureaucratic apparatus.    But, of course, in trying to entrench themselves forever,  the  current Russian authorities are trying in every possible way to  develop friendship with the ""fraternal"" West. Reliance on its  assistance and defense is so great that these authorities did  not and will not spare the price. But the price here is  well-known--economic and every other kind of dependence on it  for a ""reviving Russia."" While perfecting the priceless  moral-political support of the ""civilized world,"" vividly and  opportunely demonstrated by it in the tragic days of  September-October 1993, the Russian powers that be are trying to  impede the objectively necessary transformation of the CIS into  a real union of states in every way possible, for such a  prospect is interpreted in the West as ""the worst nightmare of  all possible nightmares"" in this world, with the exception of a  nuclear war.    The proposals of Kazakhstan in the spirit of this prospect  have long ago and openly been ignored by Moscow, and the  decisive integrational initiative of Belarus was met with  hostility by those influential figures who did everything to  bury the idea of an ""all-Union ruble space""; that is, to destroy  one of the most important economic prerequisites for a political  reintegration of the former Union republics.    In the light of the aforementioned understanding of the  priorities of today's ruling elite, at the very least the  endless reproaches directed at it on the part of our  multicolored opposition look naive in that it, this elite, was  formed out of loonies and professionally incompetent people.    The most urgent task of our reformers is to achieve the  irreversibility of social processes in Russia and to bring it  into the club of ""democratic"" states at any price. Only a  bourgeois Russia can be brought into this club, but it is not  entirely mandatory that it be independent and prosperous and,  what is more, strong and possessing a powerful defense  potential. With these kinds of parameters, Russia is not wanted  in this club. And when ""Russian opposition to its majesty"" in  the person of Skokov complains about the fact that ""there has  really not been any real reformation as such"" and that, he said,  as a result of the spontaneous process there has been some kind  of restructuring of economic management ""that still has not led  to anything intelligible,"" then the impression is created that  it will be difficult to free it, this opposition, from  professional economic blindness. Does it really not see that the  reforms, of which there did not seem to be any, changed the  socioeconomic essence of Russian society and the state system of  Russia in a radical way? There also were the kind that in their  results were equivalent to a revolution or a counterrevolution.    And now the whole problem is only whether the social  upheaval  in Russia will turn out to be bourgeois-nationalistic or openly  colonial-comprador in the final analysis. It appears that Yuriy  Skokov and his like-thinkers in the Federation of Commodity  Producers they head were hoping for the first variant. But then  he, in private, should more carefully weigh the real reasons for  his dismissal from key posts in the government. If this variant  would be necessary to those circles that now determine the  domestic and foreign policy of the country, then it cannot be  ruled out that he specifically, Skokov, would be sitting now in  the chair of the prime minister, devoting all of his official  time to the restoration and development of commodity production  and the creation of hothouse conditions for an industrial  bourgeoisie, and not for a more quickly maturing trade-money  lending bourgeoisie. But he is not sitting in this chair,  inasmuch as the political elite of the country does not now  stand in need of patrons from the commodity producers.    Generally speaking, the need for workers of such an  orientation and such an economic mentality may not even surface  in Russia in the foreseeable future. A majority of them are not  capable of building a colonial-comprador model of the economy, a  model which, as the most likely, shines through everything that  is being done and is occurring in politics, in society, and in  the economy of the country, and also in its relations with the  near and far abroad.    A genuinely creative stage in the development of the economy  of Russia can arrive only when the question of authority, that  is, the most important political question of contemporary  Russian life, is finally and reliably resolved either in favor  of the national-patriotic strata of the rapidly forming  bourgeoisie, which, out of necessity, will push aside from the  state helm the pioneers of bourgeois restoration who are too  closely tied to the West, or in favor of the supporters of a  socialist orientation who are now capable in an incomparably  greater measure than before to combine it with the priority of  national-state interests. (In the latter case, it is a question  actually of the Chinese variant of implementing the socialist  choice on the path of development of a market economy.)    The appeals of the government and of the multifaceted  opposition for reconciliation no matter what happens--and  history indicates the nature of these appeals with the political  amnesty in February of this year--undoubtedly make considerable  social sense at the present time, when there is yet another  regrouping of sociopolitical forces in the country. But the  contradictions in society that were created by perestroyka and  reforms are too deep for these appeals to play a substantial  role in maintaining political stability in the country in the  long term. Without significant adjustments in the positions of  the government in the spirit of national-patriotic demands, or  without a really meaningful personnel renewal of the authority  structures in the very same spirit, social accord in Russia will  be unthinkable.    Any programs, even the most effective ones for getting the  country out of the crisis, will hang in the air, if they run  counter to the interests of strengthening the positions of the  present authorities, to its sociopolitical objectives, and to  its already insurmountable engagement with the West.  Consequently, in the near foreseeable term, the main line of  struggle for the revival of a powerful and prosperous Russian  state, as previously, will lie in the political and by no means  in the economic sphere. And the endless claims of officials and  of the mass media close to the authorities that the people are  tired of politics are called on precisely to disorient Russians  with respect to the location of this main line.

This  was stated by party Secretary General Do Muoi at the reception  given in honor of visiting Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  Gonzalez in Hanoi. The Cuban foreign minister was received by  Vietnamese leaders, who all reaffirmed the Vietnam's unchanged  support for Cuban people and government in their efforts to  overcome present difficulties and their successful carrying out  of the national construction and defense.    Vietnam and Cuba have an age-old traditional relationship.  Vietnamese people appreciate the Cuban party, government, and  people for their long solidarity, strong support, and general  assistance to the Vietnamese people's revolution. The visit to  Cuba by the Vietnamese party and government delegation led by  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet in July last year was a new step in  bilateral relations between Vietnam and Cuba.    Speaking with the newspaper QUAN DOI NHAN DAN, or Army  paper,  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet said: The Vietnamese people will  never forget the support and assistance reserved for Vietnam by  the Cuban people during the years of the anti-U.S war for  national salvation. With the spirit for Vietnam, Cuba was  prepared to donate even their own blood. Vietnamese people deem  it their obligation and responsibility to share with Cuban  people all wealth and woes, especially in the current difficult  time for Cuba.    During the Cuba visit last year, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  reached an agreement where Vietnam is providing Cuba with 10  million tons [figure as heard] of rice annually. Vietnam also  offers to share experiences with Cuban people on its renovation  process. At present, Vietnam and Cuba have strengthened  comprehensive cooperation, especially in education, health,  transport and communication, and agriculture.    The visit to Vietnam by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto  Gonzalez will help further consolidate the fraternity and mutual  cooperation between Vietnam and Cuba.

The Zambian head of state, whom his Cuban  counterpart, Fidel Castro, invited to the island, will meet here  with Zambian students majoring in many subjects.    Some 43 students from the African nation are studying in  Cuba  at university centers in the Provinces of Camaguey, Santiago de  Cuba, and Villa Clara, and in the nickel-producing Moa  Municipality. In the last 10 years, about 79 Zambian students  graduated from college, and six finished their technical studies.    Chiluba has contemplated the possibility of strengthening  bilateral cooperation in activities related to the sugar  industry, agriculture, public health, and the pharmaceutical  industry. One of the issues he analyzed during his stay in  Santiago de Cuba is the ratification of an agreement on having  Cuban technicians build a sugar mill in Zambia financed by  Lusaka.    The guest and his delegation visited such centers of  economic  and scientific interest as the Carlos J. Finlay Biotechnology  Institute and the Ameijeiras Brothers Hospital, one of the most  important hospitals on the island. They also visited an  agricultural cooperative in western Havana Province and the  Mario Munoz Sugar Mill, located in Los Arabos Municipality, in  Matanzas Province.    President Chiluba, 51, is the leader of the Movement for  Multiparty Democracy (MMD), winner of the 31 October 1991  elections, and an heir of Kenneth Kaunda.    Zambia, which has an area of 174,000 [figure as received]  square km, is the world's third largest producer and largest  exporter of copper.

0,FT941-2904 ,"FT941-2904 _AN-ECRDQAD1FT 940318   FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Programmed for failure   Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has been put in an impossible position by the group of seven leading industrial countries. He is in Moscow to decide whether to release the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform. If he does not release them, the IMF will be blamed for the deterioration in the economy. If he does, the economy will deteriorate, nonetheless. His is a doomed mission. So what should the west be doing, instead? First, it must remember that Russia is both a nuclear power and Europe's most threatening neighbour. Its problems cannot be approached as if the country were the Philippines, or even Brazil. Second, it must understand the roots of the disaster, which are the collapse of the communist economy and the attendant moral and fiscal bankruptcy of the state. The claims inherited from the Soviet Union greatly exceed the resources upon which the government can lay its desperate hands. The budget deficit is supposed to be 10 per cent of gross domestic product. In fact, it is at least 15 per cent, before meeting the defence minister's demand for a doubling of the military budget. Third, the west needs to provide enough resources to allow Russia to rebuild both its economy and its bankrupt government, delivered in ways that actually allow it to do so. This means currency stabilisation and funds sufficient to close the budget deficit, conditional upon the establishment of private property, price reform, industrial restructuring and tight control over subsidies. The funds required will be large, but their duration need not be that great. With credibility restored, money could pour into the country, some of it as returning flight capital. But the IMF's Dollars 1.5bn  -roughly half a per cent of Russia's GDP - is neither here nor there. Fourth, the principals should themselves be present in Moscow. The IMF is not even the ideal agent, partly because it is obliged to treat Russia as just another member country, partly because it does not possess the necessary political authority and partly because it does not have the needed resources. If the G7 is to act, it should send someone of the stature of Mr Larry Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, to talk to those who matter, decide whether reform is feasible and then cajole the G7 into offering the assistance that might make it work. Finally, the west must decide whether now is the time. The government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin has made a greater effort to hold the budgetary line than many expected. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, has even started to behave like a monetarist. But the perseverance of the government is highly uncertain and the support of the parliament still more so, particularly when President Yeltsin has withdrawn from the scene. For all that, it is both right to explore the possibilities of today and essential to prepare for the fresh opportunities for radical reform that may, given Russia's economic plight, emerge tomorrow. What makes no sense at all is to prefer the certainty of failure to the chance of success. At present, the G7 has no policy for Russia. It is just making gestures.

The U.S. blockade, initiated three decades ago, ""creates  unnecessary friction"" in the region. As such, Mexico ""has again  and again appealed to the United States to lift it,"" Tello told  NOTIMEX. The U.S. commercial retaliation against Cuba ""puts  stumbling blocks"" between Mexico and Cuba, ""but those stumbling  blocks can be overcome,"" said the 56-year-old diplomat and  economist who this year assumed office as ambassador to Havana.  ""In exercising its sovereignty, Mexico can freely decide with  what country to trade,"" even with third countries outside NAFTA,  Tello said.    The ambassador said Mexican President Carlos Salinas' visit  to Cuba next week will serve ""to underline the deep ties of  friendship"" between the two countries and ""the multifarious  nature of the relationship.""    Salinas will stay in Havana a little less than six hours,  the  ambassador said. ""The hours will be few but intense, with  cordial dialogue between the two delegations,"" he said.    Mexico is the country that holds the most intensive  relations  with Cuba in the areas of technological cooperation, education,  culture, and sports. The two countries hold ""important""  relations in commerce, tourism, and joint investments, Tello  said.    Salinas, the fourth Mexican president to consecutively visit  Cuba, plans to hold a round of talks with President Fidel  Castro, the diplomat reported. The signing of a specific  document is also on the agenda. ""Business deals between Mexico  and Cuba continue at their own pace and rhythm"" and are not  conditioned ""by a Salinas visit in this particular instance,""  Tello said. Mexico seeks to ""strengthen and improve"" the level  of its relations with Cuba and ""explore new forms"" of  cooperation, he said. He said the Mexican Government ""is  determined to strengthen its relations of all types with  Caribbean countries"" and that ""Cuba plays a decisive role"" in  this project.    The creation of the Association of Caribbean States [AEC],  in  which all regional states and territories, including Cuba and  Mexico, will participate, will be ""the first firm step toward a  policy of commercial rapprochement"" in the area.    The AEC charter will be signed in Caracas late this month  during a ministers meeting to prepare the summit of regional  presidents and heads of state to be held in Barbados on 4 July.    With this organization, ""the Caribbean will gradually  participate in the integrationist effort"" of the rest of the  hemisphere, where Mexico participates with free trade treaties  signed with Canada and the United States, as well as with Costa  Rica and Chile, Tello said.    From Havana, Salinas will fly to Cartagena, where he will  sign a free trade agreement within the framework of the  so-called Group of Three with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria  and Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera.

'The accord in itself is a blow to the US policy of blockade,' Cuba's chief negotiator at the immigration talks, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, said on Cuban television on Thursday night. Mr Alarcon, president of the island's National Assembly, said the September 9 immigration agreement, which aimed to halt an exodus of illegal refugees fleeing Cuba by sea to the US, showed the US and Cuba could develop a normal relationship in at least one area: immigration. Mr Alarcon said the US had encouraged illegal immigration by Cubans in the past to try to destabilise President Fidel Castro's government, but had now agreed to work with Cuba to stop illegal departures, including air and sea hijacks. Outlining what else the Cuban government felt it had gained from the talks, Mr Alarcon said they had generated a groundswell of opinion in the US calling for a re-think of US policy towards Cuba and renewed dialogue. He cited editorials to this effect published by leading US newspapers and public comments by senior congressmen such as Lee Hamilton, President of the foreign relations committee of the House of Representatives. Senior US administration officials, however, had repeatedly stressed the talks would deal with the immigration problem and nothing else. But the Cuban government, which says its conflict with the US cannot be solved if the lifting of the US trade embargo is not discussed, is clearly hoping to capitalise on the publicity generated by the talks to keep attention focused on the embargo issue. Mr Alarcon said a fundamental point of disagreement had been the US failure to lift additional sanctions on Cuba imposed by US President Bill Clinton on August 20. These placed restrictions on hard currency remittances sent by Cuban-Americans in the US to relatives in Cuba, as well as reducing flights between the two countries and visits by family members. Mr Alarcon said these latest sanctions were intended to appease the right-wing sector of the Cuban exile community in Miami, which strongly opposed any direct dialogue. But the measures were hurting Cuban-Americans in the US as much as Cubans on the island, he said. Although the outcome of the immigration talks had been encouraging, Mr Alarcon made clear he did not consider that an end to the US-Cuban dispute was imminent. He rejected US demands for Cuba to change its one-party political system, improve human rights and reform its centrally-run economy. 'We are being generous enough in saying we are willing to discuss the embargo. It should be lifted. Full stop,' he said. He cited an existing UN General Assembly resolution condemning the US embargo against Cuba and calling for it to be lifted. Under the September 9 immigration accord, Washington said it would allow a minimum of 20,000 Cubans to migrate legally to the US each year. In return, Cuba moved to halt illegal departures by Cubans to the US following the exodus of around 30,000 Cubans by sea over the last six weeks. The progress of the accord will be reviewed at talks to be held no later than 45 days after September 9.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P9721 International Affairs.

The per capita industrial and  agricultural product in the republic is more than 20 percent  higher than the average in Russia. Tatarstan's economy is  undoubtedly heavily dependent on the stable operation of the  enterprises of many sectors, both of Russia and of other states  that were formerly a part of the Union. An analysis of the  republic's economy requires an examination of common problems,  therefore.    The word ""crisis,"" which has become habitual in recent  years,  is the most common characterization of the state of the whole of  the former USSR, both in the sphere of the economy and in  sociopolitical life. The illusory expectations of an improvement  in life introduced to the consciousness by dishonest politicians  as of the 1980's have led to social fatigue and the apathy of  the majority. It is naive to expect any improvement as a result  of elections, referenda, and so forth. Yet the crisis is not  forever. There is, as a rule, a way out of any crisis, and not  just one even. A society, like any person also, has a choice of  development options. The way out of the present one will be  particularly difficult since the economic and political factors  of development are too intricately intertwined, and the  politicians' actions frequently do not fit within the framework  of common sense and have been, from the viewpoint of the  interests of the majority, of an irrational nature. It should be  obvious to everyone today that the economy will not be  stabilized in a short space of time with painless medicine. What  is needed first and foremost for a way out of the crisis is a  correct diagnosis and then the formulation of measures and  persistent lengthy treatment signifying in practice nothing  other than purposeful, dogged work based on definite priorities.    Speaking of a diagnosis, it is essential to recognize that  two processes are under way simultaneously on the territory of  the former USSR:    1. Transition from the administrative-command state-run  economy to a market economy.    2. The formation and development of a whole number of new  states with their own economic and political interests, which  are being manifested increasingly distinctly and which are  gaining strength.    Both these processes overlay one another, which is leading  to  an intermingling of economic and political problems, and diverse  knots of various contradictions are becoming entangled here,  which is frequently superficially once again, from many people's  viewpoint, assuming an irrational nature. A painful transition  from the domination of one interest--the supreme-power interest,  which was implanted for several centuries, had little in common  with democracy, and was divorced from the individual--to a  polycentrism of interests is under way.    An economy based on the interdependence of the regions, but  with regard to economic expediency, is experiencing, following  the country's disintegration, a particular sort of crisis. The  economy of Tatarstan, as of other states, being a part of the  economic complex of the former USSR, monopolized, isolated from  the outside world, and closely interlinked, therefore, is  experiencing the same difficulties and tackling the same  problems as other regions of Russia and the CIS also.    The slump, therefore, has been caused not only by the  transition to market reforms but also the artificial severance  of economic ties, which has occurred not only on the basis of  market expediency but to a considerable extent on account of a  clash of political interests. It has to be recognized that its  own center of economic and political interests has taken shape  in Tatarstan also, which is the objective basis of the formation  of its statehood. The close interaction of all the republics is  possible today only with regard to a balance of one another's  interests. Attempting to emerge from the crisis without regard  to this and seeking the stabilization of the economy to the  dictation of any center whatever is a lost cause. A particular  feature of the economy of Tatarstan is extensive cooperation by  no means just with the economy of Russia but with all the former  republics of the USSR. In addition, relations are being actively  generated with many countries of the world. Whence Tatarstan's  interest in dealing directly, proceeding from the interests of  the citizens of its republic. It is for this that Tatarstan  today needs the status of subject of international law, which is  recorded in its constitution, which was adopted more than a year  ago and has become an instrument of political stability and  harmony in the republic. Tatarstan's cool attitude toward the  draft Constitution of the Russian Federation, whose authors  completely ignored the wishes of the people of Tatarstan  expressed at a referendum and already recorded in the  constitution of the republic, is not surprising but natural,  therefore. Tatarstan cannot, understandably, forgo the interests  of its citizens to the detriment of its own economy and will  seek to continue negotiations to establish normal relations with  the leadership of the Russian Federation based on a bilateral  treaty.    The program of radical economic reforms of Russia, which  sets  their general tone, put the main emphasis on price  liberalization and assumed that prices would shape the main  production structures. But prices perform this role only in a  developed market economy and with the balance and conformity of  the cost criteria and material structures and also the  equivalent interaction of the domestic and foreign markets. As  we all know, we still have a long way to go to achieve this  ideal.    As of 1992, therefore, the Republic of Tatarstan, proceeding  from the specifics of its sectoral structure of the economy and  possibilities, took a somewhat different path from Russia, and  from the Commonwealth countries also. The maximum coefficients  of an increase in the retail prices of basic foods were adopted,  and this ensured a smoother transition to the market and  supported the population of the republic since prices grew in  line with the increase in personal income.    But the continuing inflation is leading to an increase in  the  cost of living and in the cost, primarily, of basic foods in all  regions of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions the  relatively low retail prices in the republic engendered  speculation and other malfeasance in trade. Protecting the  consumer market became increasingly difficult. There came to be  a situation requiring a serious adjustment of the policy  regulating minimum personal income and preservation of the  interests of the agricultural commodity producers.    In connection with what had been set forth by the parliament  of the Republic of Tatarstan, a program of targeted social  protection of the populace of the Republic of Tatarstan which  was of an innovative nature in the Russian Federation was  adopted. It made provision together with an increase in the  retail prices of basic foods for targeted compensation for  children, retirees, the handicapped, and so forth. In addition,  a big step in the direction of an increase in the purchasing  power of the population was taken, and the minimum wage was  revised and increased considerably.    Thus the idea of the targeted nature of protection during  transition to the market is being realized in practice. Its  further development presupposes the monitoring of the dynamics  of prices and incomes. Specifically, a constant adjustment of  the minimum income at the level of the minimum consumer budget  is contemplated as of 1 January 1994.    A comparative analysis of the weekly cost of a basket of 19  most important foods in various cities of Russia and Tatarstan  on 26 October of the current year shows that the city of  Ulyanovsk and the Republic of Tatarstan remain the cheapest.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weekly cost of a basket of 19 foods on 26 October 1993 (rubles)              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ulyanovsk                             |2,872                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazan                                 |3,857                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ufa                                   |4,383                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cheboksary                            |4,630                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nizhniy Novgorod                      |5,243                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Izhevsk                               |5,323                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |St. Petersburg                        |5,897                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moscow                                |6,280                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average for the Russian Federation    |5,448                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The chosen particular path of market reforms, which are to a  large extent of an evolutionary nature, also encompasses  government regulation of the reproduction processes in the  sectors of the agro-industrial complex. The redistribution of  some budget funds to the benefit of the agrarian sector made it  possible in 1993 to overcome the slump, and an increase in  production began in the meat and dairy sectors of agriculture as  of March. Thus production in nine months of 1993 constituted  compared with the corresponding period of last year 102 percent  for meat, 110 percent for milk, and 105 percent for eggs.  Productiveness both in terms of the per-cow milk yields and the  average daily weight gains in animal husbandry increased here. A  relatively good cereals harvest was gathered in (approximately 1  tonne per capita, which is a good indicator by international  standards), and potatoes, sugar beet, and vegetables were  harvested in a sufficient quantity.    The alternative economy is gaining strength in the republic  simultaneously.    In the course of realization of the State Privatization  Program, 286 enterprises with a total statutory capital of more  than R166 billion, which employ 185,000 persons, had been  privatized as of 1 November 1993. In 10 months of 1993  privatized enterprises of the republic's industry had produced  27 percent of the total commodity product. In addition, there  are altogether a further 1,000 large and medium-sized  enterprises approximately operating in a privatization mode,  among which are such important associations as Tatneft,  Nizhnekamskshina, Tatsakharprom, and Tatnefteprodukt.    The work performed on privatization made it possible to  prepare the necessary economic base for the sale to the citizens  of the republic of the 1992-issue privatization checks of the  Russian Federation and the registered privatization deposits  (IPV) of the Republic of Tatarstan, which our citizens began to  receive as of August 1993. Auctions selling off shares of stock  of the privatized enterprises and IPV have been held in the  Republic of Tatarstan. These auctions have shown that the price  of the shares purchased for IPV and for cash has been five-seven  times higher than their face value. Shares of the Nefis Stock  Company (the Vakhitov Chemical Works), the Melita Stock Company  (fur-product works), and the Tatmetall Stock Company have been  given a high quotation. The sale of stock at auction for IPV has  enlivened the securities market. At the present time their  quotation constitutes on average 1.84 of their face value, that  is, an IPV valued at R30,000 has sold on average for R55,000,  and in certain places, for R75,000.    Reform of the military-industrial complex is a sore point. A  fundamental restructuring of the entire technology is needed for  enterprises of the defense sector's transition to the  manufacture of civilian products. The sharp reduction--85  percent and more in a number of cases--in the volume of military  orders has brought the majority of these plants and associations  to the verge of financial collapse.    According to an intergovernmental agreement concluded with  the Russian Federation, Russia and Tatarstan are to provide for  the funding of the reprofiling of the conversion enterprises.  The manufacture of the TU-204M passenger aircraft is being  assimilated with the support of the ministries of industry and  economics of Russia and the Government of the Republic of  Tatarstan at the Kazan Aviation Production Association. Orders  for the manufacture of machinery and components for oil and gas  industry and for the agro-industrial complex are being placed at  other former defense plants, and the manufacture of components  for the new auto assembly works in Yelabug is contemplated also.  But a substantial number of financial problems of conversion has  simply not been resolved as yet. A special fund for ensuring a  stable policy of the structural reorganization of the economy in  the republic was formed recently.    One further lever of structural reorganization and the  stabilization of the economy of the republic is the attraction  for a solution of its problems of foreign capital and an  expansion of the network of joint ventures. The stability of the  domestic political situation and the relatively normal  ""temperature"" of the economic organism are making Tatarstan  increasingly attractive for Western businessmen. The republic  currently has 103 enterprises in which foreign capital  participates: firms of the United States, Germany, Italy,  Britain, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and others.    The experience of recent years shows that Tatarstan, like  everyone else, has been learning to ""swim"" under the new  conditions of the simultaneous formation of its own statehood  and market reform of the economy. This period will last for  quite some time. A condition of the successful transition to a  new type of economic system is politicians' capacity for  securing the optimum combination of the objective interests of  the citizens residing both on the territory of Tatarstan and  throughout the space of the former USSR. Proceeding from its  possibilities and the wishes of the people, Tatarstan is  endeavoring here to become a worthy part of the world community  and to develop while preserving the evolved economic, political,  and cultural relationships with Russia and the other former  Union republics.

The Russian foreign minister arrived here Wednesday [26  January], taking with him quite a number of officials and  business people from various parts of the country, indicating  that Russia is ready to further its economic and trade  cooperation, including border trade, with China.    Sino-Russian trade volume in 1993 hit a record 7.68 billion  U.S. dollars, an increase of some 30 percent over the previous  year.    Of this, Russia's import from China amounted to 2.69 billion  U.S. dollars and its export to China was 4.99 billion U.S.  dollars, remaining the seventh biggest trading partner of China.    China mainly exported to Russia grain, food, light  industrial  goods and textiles, household electrical appliances and raw  materials, and imported Russian power plant equipment, vehicles,  steel, chemical fertilizer and electronics and machinery.    The economies of China and Russia are mutually  complementary,  and economic and trade exchanges between the two countries,  which is in the interest of both, will cater to the needs of  each other's economic development and life of the two peoples.    China supports, as always, positive development of  Sino-Russian cooperation in trade, economy and technology based  on equality and mutual benefit and encourages its companies and  enterprises to cooperate with Russia in various fields, a trade  official said.    At present, bilateral economic and trade cooperation are  being diversified to cover traditional barter trade,  over-the-counter trade and compensation trade.    During the first 10 months of 1993, China signed 420  contracts with Russia for providing labor services, involving  470 million U.S. dollars.    China also invested some 82 million U.S. dollars in nearly  500 joint ventures in Russia.    China and Russia agreed at a meeting held in March last year  that the two countries would cooperate in the fields of building  materials, information technology, instrument making,  metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals, and micro-electronics.    By the end of last June, China had imported a dozen Russian  technological projects for aviation, power and metal processing,  with a total value of 400 million U.S. dollars, while exporting  to Russia some 50 technological projects valued at 120 million  U.S. dollars.    However, there are some snags in the Sino-Russian trade,  such  as poor transportation facilities.    A trade official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation said that China is willing to make  concerted efforts with Russia in 1994 to consolidate what had  been achieved in trade and cooperation between the two countries.    He hoped that both China and Russia would take some measures  to strengthen management of each other's enterprises dealing  with foreign trade and improve investment environment, so as to  further bilateral co-operation.

[Ross] We cannot talk about expectations, because an  expectation is something that is not yet defined, something what  one wants but there is still uncertainty about it. We believe  we will discuss at the assembly issues related to the present  and future life of Cuban workers and the people in general. The  discussions will be based specifically on the workers' point of  view, workers' opinions, workers' proposals, workers' doubts,  and their aspirations about what should and should not be done  and what they believe is feasible and should be done. In this  light, one cannot speak about expectations. We are talking  about specific facts, because even before the assembly several  decisions have been taken based on proposals the workers made.    We cannot expect one single assembly meeting to adopt all  the  measures needed to clean up the country's finances, to correct  certain economic problems, and to define new policies. We  expect the assembly to make recommendations to the government so  the government can study them, and later implement them. These  decisions will not only be the reflection of what we discussed  with the workers at the parliament in the workplace sessions,  but they will return to the workplace for further study.    This is what we expect to get out of the ANPP sessions. It  will be a public session, and all the foreign guests at the 1  May celebrations will be present. It will be broadcast on radio  and television so our people and the whole world can hear what  we are debating.    [Reporter] We would like to know how the workers movement  has  welcomed the decision to hold this long-awaited assembly on 1  May.    [Ross] The Cuban workers movement greatly appreciates the  revolutionary government's decision to adopt Comrade Fidel's  proposal to hold this specific ANPP session to discuss such  important issues on such a significant date as 1 May. In so  doing, they will honor and express respect for Cuban workers.    [Reporter] One last question. Radio Havana Cuba is  celebrating its 33d anniversary on 1 May. What has Radio Havana  Cuba meant to the world's union movement?    [Ross] Radio Havana Cuba is the vehicle by which we maintain  contact with the workers of the world, as far as the radio  signal of this Cuban radio station can travel. Radio Havana  Cuba has allowed us to express our beliefs, our truth, and our  information. Radio Havana Cuba has been a bridge and a channel  that has shortened distances to keep us united with the other  union movements in Latin America over the shortwaves bands. We  would like to congratulate all the workers, technicians,  journalists, support personnel, leaders, labor organizations,  political organizations, and, in general, all of the workers of  this prestigious Cuban radio station on this 33d anniversary.

As part of an accord signed earlier this year, the agreement  has three purposes: 1) to amortize the Cuban debt with official  Brazilian entities, 2) to make a cash payment, and 3) to  purchase Brazilian products. According to sources, the first  delivery of medicines was completed in mid-May.    Via this transaction, Brazil hopes to receive approximately  $3 million to cover the debts, the greater part of which are  lines of credit from official banks for exporting products from  Brazil to Cuba. Brazilian imports from Cuba traditionally  include about 25 products, including soybeans, poultry, engines,  tires, and polyethylene.    Cuba began delaying paying its Brazilian debt in 1989 during  the process  process that brought about the disappearance of the Soviet  Union, which had been Cuba's leading trading partner and top  supplier of commodities and spare parts.    In 1933, Brazilian exports to Cuba reached $9 million and  imports from Cuba $21 million. To reactivate trade with Brazil,  Cuban officials have offered $300 million in products, mainly  medicines.     "

We have reaffirmed our decision to meet without  the permission of third countries and without any significant  exclusions. Our efforts have borne fruit in many respects; the  advances of the Latin American Integration Association, the  Andean Group, the Central American Common Market, the Southern  Cone Common Market, and the increasingly important Latin  American economic system demonstrate this.    It seems that some were worried by this new, independent  method of action. Our powerful northern neighbor now calls for  another summit that is to take place in Miami, of all places; it  is for a mature hemispheric association. There have already  been alliances for progress and initiatives for the Americas  that no one remembers today. From decade to decade and centery  to century, we have gone from slogan to slogan, from deceit to  deceit. There were also wars, interventions, and conquest of  territories at the expense of our America. What can we expect  from that powerful country, invariably expansionistic,  egotistic, and hegemonic.    Cuba, a country attacked and blockaded for over 30 years, is  prohibited by the alleged owners of the hemisphere to  participate in that meeting. How much cowardice, mediocrity,  and political poverty is truly reflected by this exclusion.  Cuba does not oppose, however, that summit. We are pleased  that the brother countries of Latin America and the Caribbean  will have an opportunity there to defend with complete firmness  and strength the interests of our peoples.    First of all, it is time to demand a right to healthcare;  education; an honest paying job; a cultural and ethnic identity;  that all forms of racial and sexual discrimination cease, an end  to abandoned and homeless children as well as victims of all  types of exploitation, violence, and sexual abuse; an end to  honger; a cessation of conditions that allow millions of people  to die each year who could be saved. These are among the  fundamental rights of man and should be respected.    Cuba has resolutedly supported the revolutionary struggle  for  democratic processes in Central and South America and is happy  that the current U.S. Administration will not foster, as others  have done, cruel military dictatorships subordinate to U.S.  interests. Cuba cannot tolerate U.S. efforts to become the  model and supreme judge of Latin American political guidelines.    Cuba determinedly defends the principle of national  sovereignty. It would be willing to defer only to a united Latin  America, but under no circumstances will it tolerate the  meddling of U.S. power circles in the internal affairs of  countries in the region.    Nothing would please Cuba more than to see the United States  offer all countries of the region, especially the lower income  countries, free access to its markets as a contribution to the  economic development of those countries.    Cuba also finds foreign investment, including U.S.  investments, necessary as a contribution to development on this  continent, but Cuba is concerned about the denationalization of  important sources of wealth and natural resources, a process  under way in the countries of the region.    Trade and foreign investments are not enough to guarantee  the  development of national economies. It is necessary to increase  the influx of development aid, something that the current U.S.  Government has reduced.    Now that the Cold War is over, that country should use part  of its currently unjustifiable military expenditures to  establish a fund to promote the development of Latin American  and Caribbean countries.    The United States should foster a radical and definite  solution to the region's foreign debt, which is already $487  billion. It should stop using intellectual property as a  negotiating weapon. It must derogate the arbitrary Super-301  special disposition that unilaterally punishes trade partners.  It must exempt the Latin American and Caribbean countries from  the brutal demand of having unrestricted access to services, a  demand imposed at the Uruguay Round.    Cuba is happy that the United States is proposing, at least  theoretically, the implementation of what it has called second  generation economic reforms to resolve the continent's social  problems. The resources allocated for this, however, are  absolutely insufficient.    Cuba is pleased to hear that the United States wants to  modify inter-American security precepts prevalent during the  Cold War and to work for a new relationship not connected to the  presence of U.S. military bases in the region.    To be consistent with that policy, the United States must  dismantle the Guantanamo Naval Base and return to Cuba a  territory it has occupied for almost 100 years.    It must withdraw its bases from Panama, as the treaty  establishes, and from any other Latin American country.    If the United States is concerned about sustainable  development in the region and environmental pollution, it must  sign Agenda 21 of the Rio summit.    Cuba agrees with the establishment of mechanisms of  hemispheric cooperation to fight drug trafficking. This must not  be at the expense of the sovereignty of the involved countries,  however.    The concerns of the continent's armed forces which refuse to  act as counternarcotics policemen are valid. The demands for a  reduction in U.S. drug consumption are also valid.    The United States must change its immigration policies for  Latin America and the Caribbean. It must promulgate a law that  automatically legalizes the status of citizens from this region  who enter the United States, as it is doing with Cuba's citizens.    Now that the Berlin Wall no longer exists, the wall erected  along the Mexican-U.S. border should come down.    Cuba deems positive the U.S. idea of convoking the  continent's nongovernmental organizations to make  recommendations about the agenda, but all such organizations  must be invited and the demands of Indians, women, peasant  organizations, labor unions, and other representatives of civil  societies, who have much to say about the issues to be discussed  at the summit, must also be heard without unfair exclusions.    Finally, this is a fitting occasion to demand that the  United  States comply with the UN resolutions on the criminal and unjust  blockade against Cuba, the intention of which is to spill blood  and force our people to surrender out of hunger.    If these issues are discussed at the Miami summit, Cuba  wishes it success, but if all it comes down to is an attempt to  draw lines on the hemisphere, to isolate Cuba, to control the  Latin American and Caribbean market, and to check Europe, Japan,  and the rest of the world, then we would have to recall what  Jose Marti said in judging a similar meeting that took place in  Washington 105 years ago: After seeing with inquiring eyes the  record, rationale, and factors involved in the invitation, it is  necessary to say, because it is true, that the time has come for  Spanish America to declare its second independence.    Thank you.     "

Such expectations were expressed on the first day of the  year  by President Fidel Castro, who estimated that the sector must  continue to increase crude oil production and that initial  exploration, currently carried out in association with foreign  companies, must begin to show results.    For the first time in 30 years, Cuban oil workers produced  more than a million tons of a oil in a 12-month period.  Specialists describe the oil as dense, viscous, and with high  light hydrocarbon content, which makes it more flammable and  thus harder to control.    The 1.1 million tons of oil expected to have been produced  by  the end of the year would represent savings of $45 million to  the national economy and have helped generate 30 percent of the  electricity used in the country.    In addition, hydrocarbon by-products were used to make  cement  and basic oils, the latter basically used to produce lubricants.    Cuba's record high oil production was the 938,000 tons  reached in 1986. Successive productions were 894,600 (87),  716,800 (88), 718,400 (89), 670,800 (90), 521,800 (91), and  882,100 (92).    According to sources at Cubapetroleo, the drop between 1987  and 1991 was basically due to the depletion of the Boca de  Jaruco deposit, approximately 45 km east of Havana.    This last deposit and the one in Varadero (140 km east of  Havana) were the most important in the archipelago; 20  additional deposits have been discovered there in the last 30  years.    During this period -- according to GRANMA -- 65,000 km of  seismic lines [lineas sismicas] were completed; 1.5 million  meters of deep shafts were perforated; magnetic, radioactive,  and geological surveys [levantamientos] were conducted; and the  use of aerial and satellite photography was regularized to study  the natural oil and gas [gasopetroliferas] possibilities.    Oil prospecting gained strength by the end of last year,  when  11 plots on land and superficial waters in the Cuban insular  platform were offered for international bidding in Canada and  London.    This made possible -- according to TRABAJADORES -- the  securing of a large number of contracts with foreign firms,  including the UK's Premier company (to explore 2,990 square km)  and France's Geopetrol (1,600 km).    Jean Louis Remondin, board member of the French enterprise,  told the local press that he was confident that there were  important reserves of the so-called black gold in Cuba.    The geographic location and the geological and geophysical  characteristics of the territory contradict those who doubt the  existence of more oil in the island, the specialist added.    In addition to the exploration contracts, Geopetrol has  similar agreements to recover and improve the Cuban deposits,  especially those in the Yumuri Valley, Puerto Escondido, and  Martin Mesa, all in the western part of the country.

Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the resort had several foreign-managed hotels. Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October. This suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba during this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the winter if it proved successful. Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take 1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to 3,000 a year. Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an estimated 3,000 UK residents were thought to have visited Cuba last year.   Companies:-  Airtours.     Unijet.

Upon ending the visit, however, Savage said  it had met and surpassed his goals.    Savage and his entourage were received by Cuban President  Fidel Castro, and Savage showed his great sensibility as a  person and a doctor. He was impressed with the Cuban people's  determination to move ahead and overcome the current economic  crisis. Savage, who won the post of prime minister for the  Liberal Party last May, presides over the government of a  province of the Canadian Atlantic Coast, 80 percent of which is  forest land. The province has great hydroelectric potential and  is noted for its fishing.    The experience of visitors in this area will serve to  promote  the recently signed fishing accord with Cuba as well as to  analyze additional operations. Not only did both parties sign  accords on fishing, but Canadians and Cubans established a  passenger cruise service for tourists. They also decided to  create a mixed enterprise to produce soap, and Cuba agreed to  purchase Canadian wood while Nova Scotia will receive Cuban  citrus.    In addition, Savage and his delegation showed interest in  the  current transformation process of Cuban agriculture, evaluated  the prospects for greater Canadian participation in mining, and  drafted other mixed enterprise projects with Cuba.    Savage termed the visit by he and his entourage as  advantageous and very fruitful. For Cuba, it represents an  opportunity to expand ties following the loss of its traditional  commercial partners.    This visit, the first to Cuba by a Canadian provincial prime  minister in 17 years, also contributed to coordinating future  cooperation in developing ecological tourism, one of the basic  objectives of tourism in Cuba, which has been given priority by  the authorities.    The contacts proved that the relations initiated have  potential to expand to such areas as culture as well as to  increase in the areas of economic associations and investments.  The businessmen from Nova Scotia and other Canadian regions are  not prepared to lose the commercial opportunities offered by  Cuba, which represent mutual benefits, at the hands of increased  U.S. pressure to frustrate any commercial negotiations to which  Cuba is a partner.    We cannot forget that the Canadian Government maintains a  respectful attitude toward Cuba, that the island represents its  fourth largest trading partner in America, and that 22 of the  112 commercial associations operating in Cuba with foreign  capital are Canadian.

0,FT932-14678 ,"FT932-14678 _AN-DDRATABXFT 930417   FT  17 APR 93 / Leading Article: Clinton, Japan and Russia   WHETHER Mr Clinton will succeed in rejuvenating the US economy may be doubted. What is noticeable, however, is how far he has changed the US domestic debate. The same is true on the global economic stage. The week's events in Tokyo - the Dollars 43bn package of assistance for Russia from the group of seven industrial countries and the Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) emergency spending programme announced by the Japanese government on Tuesday  -bear witness to his impact. It is not that either is an altogether new departure. Assistance for Russia and stimulus packages in Japan were on last year's agenda as well. As often happens, however, developments in policy preceded a change in administration. Where the Bush administration was tentative, Mr Clinton's is aggressive. At the top of its international agenda are the twin aims of helping Russia and dealing with Japan. But its goals for the two countries conflict. Mr Clinton wants to introduce market forces into Russia's controlled economy and controls into Japan's market economy. Naturally, that is not how he would put the point. The US view is that the Japanese trade surplus is the result of obscure obstacles to the proper working of the market. This week Japan announced an overall trade surplus for fiscal 1992-93 of Dollars 111.34bn (Pounds 73bn), up 26 per cent on the previous year. The bilateral surplus with the US was Dollars 46.1bn, up 20 per cent. Such figures reinforce US determination, as Mr Clinton must have told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, in Washington yesterday. Pre-emptive Japan's response was a shrewdly-timed pre-emptive fiscal strike. The Japanese government produced its plump rabbit from the fiscal hat just as Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury Secretary, and Mr Warren Christopher, US Secretary of State, arrived in Tokyo for the meeting of the group of seven industrial countries on help to Russia and immediately before Mr Miyazawa went to Washington. The Ministry of Finance even argued that the spending and tax concessions would produce a 2.6 per cent increase in nominal gross national product. Governments would be sorely embarrassed if laws governing truth in advertising applied to their pronouncements as well. As so often - including, indeed, the Dollars 43bn supposedly on offer for Russia - the rabbit was thinner than it looked. Many analysts believe the Japanese package will generate at most half the growth envisaged by the government. Unfortunately for Japanese international public relations, amongst the doubters appears to be the redoubtable governor of the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno. Even the government claims that its measures would boost the country's imports by only some Dollars 8bn, a mere dent in the surplus. Partly for this reason, but still more because lobby-infested Washington views trade in industry-specific terms, the Japanese package is unlikely to achieve its chief strategic goal, which was to ward off US pressure for 'results-oriented' agreements on trade. Mr Christopher, for example, was not so busy urging more support for Russia that he did not find time to persuade Japan to solve individual trade issues. Bottomless pit Yet if the Japanese government is to secure target shares of particular imports in the Japanese markets, it must first force its citizens to make the necessary purchases. As foreign appetites grow upon what they feed, such arrangements will spread, not just within Japan but to other successful exporting countries. A market-oriented international trading system would then be replaced by a sort of mini-Comecon. Yet Mr Clinton's emissaries also put great pressure on Japan to assist Mr Yeltsin in his attempts to rebuild the ruins left by the collapse of the real Comecon. As usual, Tokyo did not dare to say 'no'. Japan did not raise the vexed issue of Russian occupation of the Kurile islands. Instead, it agreed to increase its planned bilateral assistance from Dollars 1.2bn to Dollars 1.8bn. This it did despite its well known conviction that Russia is the closest thing on earth to a bottomless pit. If this perfectly plausible conviction is to be proved wrong, Russia must have a coherent and effective government implementing a coherent and effective reform strategy. At present doubters have good cause for their doubts. Mr Yeltsin is going into a referendum on April 25 that poses great risks for him. No likely result will give him the decisive victory he needs if he is to rule where now he reigns. It is only the extraordinary importance of the effort that justifies its being made at all. But the same applies to Japan's wish to avoid results-oriented trade. In Tokyo the Europeans - particularly the Germans - insisted upon the importance of helping Mr Yeltsin, but stressed that they themselves had done enough. Germany's position is certainly defensible. But Europeans do have a fresh role to play in the US-Japan bilateral trade conflicts. They should support Japan if it decides at last simply to say 'no'.   Countries:-  JPZ  Japan, Asia.

The sale is part of a wider trade agreement between the two countries, under which Cuba will purchase Chinese food and medicine, according to Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news agency. Diplomats in Havana, the island's capital, said this week that the Cuban government was now estimating sugar production this year at 'no more than 5m tonnes', following last year's 4.2m tonnes. They said government officials had spoken at the start of the harvest of a likely yield of 1m tonnes more than last year. The current harvest has been shortened by the government, which wants it concluded at the end of April to allow more time for planting additional acreage for future harvests, as part of efforts to rehabilitate the industry. Zambia's industry is to receive technical and industrial assistance from Cuba, under an agreement in principle between both countries.

Recently Cuba also had strong ties with countries of the  socialist bloc, ties which were abruptly broken. That, together  with the U.S. blockade, brought our country to the situation of  the special period.    Nevertheless, today, in the midst of these difficulties,  Cuba  is making great efforts to diversify its commercial ties with  the world. In this connection, just yesterday, British  Ambassador Leycester Coltman announced the possibility that  another British firm may come to Cuba to work in oil  exploration. At this moment, important firms from France, Great  Britain, Canada, and Sweden are working in the oil exploration  sphere in Cuba. It is a process whereby we are redirecting and  diversifying our trade with the whole world.    In Great Britain's case, Ambassador Coltman pointed out  that,  years ago, Cuba's exports were up to $50 million. In 1992, that  figure dwindled to $43 million and in 1993 to $21 million.  However, Ambassador Coltman noted that the first quarter of 1994  marked a certain recovery. In other words, it is not only in the  [word indistinct], but other activities as well.    Another thing I wanted to point out was about trade with  Latin America. Economist Osvaldo Martinez, president of the  Commission on Economic Affairs of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, recently said that in 1990, 83 percent of  our exports and 87 percent of our imports were concentrated in  Europe. Back then, Latin America represented only 7 percent of  exports and 7 percent of imports. In 1993, our exports to Latin  America grew from 7 to 14 percent, and our imports from 7 to 47  percent.    This is additional proof, along with Ambassador Coltman's  statements and other elements mentioned by the press and our  leaders, that Cuba is making efforts, in midst of its economic  difficulties, to diversify its ties with the entire world.

It is a myth  created by reactionary propaganda media, both in and outside of  the United States, which dissolves in its own steam while  maneuvers are made to discover ways to present a twisted image  of Cuba to the world.    The great majority of Cubans, more than 95 percent, who have  migrated to the United States and other countries, have done so  by legal means, or at least with the approval of the Cuban  Government. The basic reasons for these migrations has to do  with the economy, given that these people did not want to  resist, together with their people, the difficulties that a  small country has to go through if it wants to be free and  sovereign in the face of opposition by an imperial power like  the United States, which is also a very close neighbor.    For 35 years, the Cuban people have resisted the hostility  of  successive U.S. Governments, which have launched all sorts of  aggressions, both overt as well as covert, against Cuba for the  declared purpose of overthrowing the revolutionary government,  wiping out its will for independence, and inflicting  Washington's political will on this small country.    The evidence behind this statement has repeatedly been given  by the U.S. Government itself when it has publicly stated it  will only lift the economic blockade and begin normal relations  once Cuba makes the political changes the United States wants  and replaces the revolutionary government, headed by Fidel  Castro, with another, supposedly democratic, which will have no  qualms in subordinating itself to U.S. political and economic  interests.    To this end, the U.S. Government has developed an  immigration  policy that scandalously favors Cubans who abandon their country  on improvised rafts, defy the dangers of the open sea in the  hope of being rescued by a Coast Guard vessel and taken to  Florida where they are forced to make politically hostile  statements against the Cuban revolutionary government. Only then  do these Cubans earn preferential treatment by the U.S.  authorities.    With regards to the thousands of Cubans who wish to travel  to  the United States to visit their relatives and then return to  Cuba, they are treated very differently. Last year, of 100,000  Cuban citizens who tried to obtain a U.S. Government visa to  legally travel to the United States, 70,000 were turned down.  Day after day thousands of Cubans form long lines outside the  U.S. Interests Section's doors in Havana with the hope of  receiving the required visa. Only 30 percent have accomplished  this; the rest, after putting up with being humiliated and  mistreated by diplomatic officials, leave disappointed and their  only hope is that one day this will change. Quite a few, after  being turned down by capricious arguments, have undergone the  raft adventure and been received as heroes in the same country  that rejected them because they may have chosen to stay in U.S.  territory and perhaps become a public burden.    It is for this reason that Cuba insists on stating that this  policy is criminal and violates all humanitarian principles. It  is a policy that stubbornly disregards human rights.     "

Robaina is expected to  depart Zimbabwe on Tuesday and go to Zambia on the penultimate  leg of an African tour that took him to Ghana and Angola and is  expected to conclude in Namibia.    Robaina, who was appointed foreign relations minister in  April 1993, indicated that Cuba will not compromise with respect  to positions of principle, such as Cuba's independence and  sovereignty, which, according to him, ""are nonnegotiable. Our  independence and sovereignty is not a matter for discussion,  neither is our capability to speak for ourselves,"" Robaina  stated. Cuba cannot ""revert regarding those sectors that are  sacred to us, sectors such as education and health, with which  my people and no one in the world would forgive us if we decided  to retrogress,"" he added.    However, he explained, Cuba ""is inclined to exchange, adapt,  and trade with anyone who is willing. In order to adapt to this  economic world we must trade with capitalists whether we like it  or not,"" he acknowledged. ""I am not one of those who believes  that all capitalists are bad,"" but ""to trade under the pressure  my country is undergoing is extremely difficult,"" he pointed  out.    In reference to the U.S. blockade and the fall of the Soviet  Union, Robaina explained that ""conditions"" in Cuba ""are  abnormal. My country cannot trade as it wishes and with whom it  wishes. We would first have to disclose who are investing and  how they are doing it. But we cannot do that. If we did,"" there  would be, ""pressure ... blackmail and persecution against anyone  who decides to do business with us.""    Nevertheless, Robaina expressed optimism with respect to  future relations between Cuba and the United States. ""I do not  believe that the new generation of Americans is injected with  that virus of aggression against a country that does not  represent a threat to the United States,"" he pointed out. ""I  cannot believe,"" he stated, ""that now that we are about to begin  a new century, countries such as Cuba and the United States,  which are merely 90 miles apart, can continue to live as we are  currently living."" I am ""convinced that there must be a  solution, but the solution must not imply that my country ceases  to exist as a country. If it means that we have to revert to  being the United States' back door, then we prefer that the  solution never be found.""    Robaina indicated that during his visit to New York last  September he noticed that ""the American people are becoming more  aware of the senselessness of this relationship. Our message is  being heard and more people are now aware that Cuba is not the  hell it is depicted as being."" Robaina explained that ""at the  government level there is no contact whatsoever, except with the  Coast Guard -- border guard contacts with some joint action  against drug trafficking. In addition, we are discussing a  telecommunications project, but there are many differences and  many stumbling blocks.""    In recalling his experiences in Angola from 1988 to 1989  when  he was a member of an ""internationalist"" contingent, the Cuban  foreign minister stated that ""there has been no greater  experience in my personal life."" It ""was the most important  stage of my life,"" he reiterated. ""In Angola we were able to  modestly contribute to Namibia being what it is today, to its  independence."" He added that ""the pages my country wrote in  Angola were written most of all for Angola, not for Cuba.""    Robaina, who at 37 is the youngest member of the Cuban  Government, expressed his ""amazement"" at the interest caused by  his appointment. ""I am simply a visible face, maybe one of the  most visible,"" he insisted. The Cuban minister added, ""I don't  see why the appointment of a minister my age should be a  surprise when there are 5 million Cubans who are younger than  30.""    Our ""fundamental priority lies in the surroundings we  inhabit,"" he pointed out before proceeding to explain that  Cuba's priority is in the ""Caribbean and Latin American"" region,  but that Cuba must maintain ""special relations"" with Africa.    ""My country is what it is because of Africa. Cuba is a mix  of Spanish and African,"" he explained and added that Cuba, ""has  much to contribute in some fields, such as education, health,  medicine, and human resources.""    In addition, the minister declared that he is ""passionately  mad about human rights, because of the human aspect of my job,""  but believes that Cuba is being unjustly accused when ""we are  one of the countries where more human beings know that they have  rights. Ten million Cubans know they have rights because they  know they are humans,"" he indicated. ""The reality for millions  of human beings who inhabit this earth is much more tragic  because they are not recognized as human beings and they neither  know how to read or write. Who speaks about child prostitution  and who is organizing it? Who speaks about the sale of  children's organs? Who speaks about xenophobia,"" the minister  asked before concluding.     "

'I hope we will be able to reach an agreement . . . we are in the final stages of discussions,' Mr Ian Taylor, trade and technology minister, said late on Sunday at the start of a three-day visit to Cuba by a delegation of businessmen and trade officials. The last official visit by a British minister to the communist-ruled island was almost 20 years ago. Mr Taylor said that despite the two countries' different political and economic systems and the recession gripping Cuba, the British government saw good prospects for increased trade and investment. He said he was concerned Britain was lagging behind Europe and Nafta nations in developing economic links with the island. Mr Taylor said he would be evaluating the economic reforms in Cuba since the collapse of its ties with the former Soviet bloc. Reforms to the state-controlled agriculture system were critical, he said. He would also discuss the issue of Cuba's outstanding debt to the Paris Club and to British companies. The latter is estimated to total Pounds 60m. Mr Taylor drew a distinction between Britain's attitude to Cuba and the US trade embargo against the island. 'My view about our trade with Cuba is that it's less influenced by what America does, and more influenced by how strong Cuba's opening towards market forces is,' he said. UK exports to Cuba totalled Pounds 14m last year, a 50 per cent drop from 1992, caused by the recession and a shortage of foreign exchange. But exports for the first half of 1994 were up 180 per cent, mainly due to a rise in cereal sales.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.     GBZ  United Kingdom, EC.

We have thus confirmed this report. In conclusion, Minister, we  would also like to know whether it is in the interest of  Colombia to sell this petroleum to our country?    [Nule] Yes, of course.

The weekly magazine TRABAJADORES indicates there is concern  and uncertainty among the people regarding their income,  following the decisions to cleanse the local economy and reduce  excess cash in circulation, calculated at 11 billion pesos (an  amount equal to dollars).    The measures include increasing certain prices and tariffs  and eliminating several subsidies. The steps are directed at  reactivating production and, therefore, supply. Experts say  these factors will contribute to the restoration of the people's  buying power.    After stressing this is not the time to raise the issue of  general salary increases, the editorial column reminds readers  the amount of cash in circulation does not necessarily determine  the amount received but, rather, its purchasing power.    It goes on to explain that Cuban black market activities are  often awarded certain virtues, but this activity, also known as  the underground economy and deemed illegal and unproductive on  the island, feeds on the state's resources or those that should  be sold to the state. It simply redistributes the goods instead  of promoting production.    Along this same line, and given the black market's inability  to generate more products or services to meet the demand, it  would be inconsistent to raise the people's salary with the  current excessive levels of cash already in circulation.    The article also finds ""salary adjustments to meet the price  increases"" an economic nonsense. This also renders as unviable  production incentives by way of monetary awards or salary  increases.    The TRABAJADORES editorial does recognize, however,  influential sectors of the national economy, such as tourism,  oil, mining, agriculture, the sugar industry, transportation,  power generation, port movement, and other such activities do  receive economic incentives in foreign currency for their  production efforts.    TRABAJADORES underscored this procedure is consistent with  the new economic system the Cuban authorities have designed,  under the present circumstances, ""to bring the Socialist formula  of payment in accordance with the quantity and quality of each  worker's contribution.""

The U.S.-Russian  summit and the documents signed by the two sides indicated that  although there is some progress in building up the U.S.-Russian  ""partnership,"" disagreements remain on a series of issues  concerning their own respective interests.    Clinton visited Russia after Russia had just elected its new  parliament last December. The Moscow Declaration claimed that  the U.S.-Russian relations had entered into a new stage of a  matured strategic partnership.    The first achievement of the visit is that Russia, the  United  States and Ukraine signed an agreement on eliminating nuclear  weapons on Ukrainian soil, removing the major obstacle that has  been affecting Kiev's relations with Moscow and Washington.  Ukraine is the third largest nuclear power in the world with  176 strategic missiles and about 1,500 nuclear warheads, all  aimed at the United States. Russia is concerned about its  nuclear neighbor too. After numerous rounds of negotiations,  while pressing Ukraine, the United States and Russia also made  certain compromises promising security and economic  compensation. Ukraine's consent to eliminate the nuclear  weapons in its territory served to finally relax the United  States and Russia. Clinton pointed out that only after the  United States and Russia have built up this ""partnership"" will  it be possible for Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine to agree to  eliminate their nuclear weapons.    On bilateral relations between Russia and the United States,  Clinton reiterated his support for Yeltsin and his reform  policy. Meanwhile, Clinton also voiced his support for new  political forces advocating ""a market economy and democratic  values"" in Russia. The agreement further pushed bilateral trade  and economic relations forward. Russia's agreement to sell 500  tons of uranium to America in the next 20 years settled one of  the most controversial issues in the bilateral trade war of the  last two years. Clinton also announced plans to lift most of  the restrictions on Russia's commodities entering the U.S.  market, a big gain for Russia which is working hard to become an  equal trade partner with the West.    Another important topic discussed at the summit was  security.  While Russia was worrying about NATO's granting membership to  former Warsaw Pact countries and Baltic nations, Clinton  appeased Russia with the ""Partnership for Peace"" plan which had  just been approved at the NATO summit. To some extent, the plan  has taken into consideration Russia's security interest and  decided to achieve the integration of NATO and Middle and East  European countries through different stages. Thus it put  Moscow's worries to rest.    It was commented that Clinton's visit didn't bring anything  new into the bilateral relations. The disagreements between the  two nations on certain important issues will continue to affect  the development of the bilateral relations, such as the regional  conflicts in former Soviet Union. Moreover, in regard to  bilateral economic relations, Yeltsin reiterated that Russia  doesn't count on America's aid but asks the United States to  open its market and eliminate trade restrictions. In addition,  the two sides have differences on the issue of Bosnia and  Herzegovina and Russia's relations with three Baltic countries.    The prospect of the ""strategic partnership"" between the  United States and Russia depends on not only the Russian  domestic political situation, but also on the stand the two  sides will take on the above issues in the future.

Samadov, chairman of  the Council of Ministers of Tajikistan, took place in Moscow. As  the head of a government delegation, he had many meetings,  consultations, and negotiations here. Nevertheless, this busy  working visit remained outside the attention of the  press--probably undeservedly. Major policies are not made in  front of television cameras or receptions filled with pomp.    [Chernyshev] Abduzhalil Akhadovich, what was the main thrust  of the meetings and negotiations you had in Russia?    [Samadov] It is not, of course, meetings per se that are  important for the fate of the people. What follows is important.  To summarize the results briefly, they reinforced the feeling in  me that Russia not only shares the pain and hopes of Tajik  people. Just like us, Russia is sincerely ready for mutually  beneficial cooperation at the new level of our relations. The  totalitarian past is behind us, and what is ahead is an era of  the civilized market and respect for human rights and dignity.  So we came with the intention of working in this era. In Moscow  we made an important comparison of viewpoints--they are similar  across the entire spectrum of Russian-Tajik relations.    Russia, Uzbekistan, and other CIS countries have been and  will remain our main partners in the foreseeable future. Up to  80 percent of the Tajik economy is contingent upon CIS  countries. And it hardly makes sense for the Commonwealth, with  Russia as its centripetal center, to reject the economic  opportunities of the Tajik market. In terms of not only raw  materials but also finished products.    [Chernyshev] The opinions has been voiced in the Russian  press that bringing a number of CIS states back into the ruble  zone will cause a new round of inflation in the economy. What  can you say on this subject?    [Samadov] Such a viewpoint has a right to exist. But let us  look at this phenomenon from another angle as well. Expansion of  the ruble zone will boost, launch, develop, and strengthen  production, economic, and many other ties. Tajikistan, for  instance, is ready to supply cotton, fruit, vegetables, and  other products. But we need metal, equipment, petroleum  products, and many other things. In the situation of separate  ""zones,"" that is, disrupted ties, Russian textile enterprises  began to experience a dearth of cotton; the trade sector needs  cheap fruit, vegetables, canned products; other consumers need  the variety of products previously supplied by Tajikistan. In  the Russian market all this was being made up for by shipments  of goods mainly from West Europe. For hard currency, of course.  Because the West does not want to buy those Russian products  that in the past went to Tajikistan. Which means that having  broken the ties with the CIS countries, the Russian economy and  society were subjected to a great cataclysm, a shock. But this  did not translate into therapy; in a number of places production  declined sharply. Has the ruble become stronger for this? Has  the people's situation improved? Has domestic production gone up?    We heard these kinds of biting questions and opinions from  competent Russian specialists in finance, economics, and  production. This means that we need different mechanisms to  carry out the tasks we have set for ourselves. Therefore we  noted with great satisfaction the position of a number of deputy  groups and factions in the State Duma and the Federation  Council, the leadership of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Finance and Central Bank of Russia, and ministries and  agencies--a position that is close to the way we see things: The  way to strengthen the ruble should be sought not in narrowing  down its sphere of circulation but, on the contrary, in  expanding it. We cannot look at this problem from the position  of a small merchant. Which is: obtain ruble credit in one place,  turn it over in another, then pocket the profit and pay off  debts. The state economy works according to a different scheme.  We have to look at this process more broadly. For instance, if  Russian rubles begin to flow into the Tajik zone, a certain  shortage of rubles will emerge in Russia itself, as you might  easily guess. The rising demand for the ruble will in turn  affect the exchange rate--it will go up. Of course, not  everything is this simple in real life. This aspect and many  others related to Tajikistan's entry into the ruble zone will be  considered soon by a group of authoritative Russian experts,  whose arrival we are expecting in Dushanbe.    We, in turn, also intend to establish appropriate control to  keep our economy from living on cheap rubles. The point is to  make financial resources reflect adequately in the movement of  many other resources, assist in their forward movement. It is  clear that we do not intend to play the role of spongers in the  ruble zone.    I will ask you a teaser. What do you think: Will the  position  of the American dollar become stronger or weaker if the zone of  its circulation becomes limited only to the territory of the  United States? I doubt that even one American economist will  answer this question in the affirmative. So I also believe that  the ruble zone can and should expand, and the ruble should  become a full-fledged international means of payment.    [Chernyshev] This means that to the relief of business  circles of two countries we may say that after Tajikistan joins  the ruble zone the problem of nonpayments will also become a  thing of the past?    [Samadov] Undoubtedly. Mostly we have inherited nonpayments  as a legacy from the Soviet past. But there is a time for  everything. You do not start building a house with the roof. The  same goes for us: We have to create the proper conditions for  normal economic relations, their legislative foundation. Be our  guests--trade, work, build. Our government will be only too glad  to help. But any particular deals and operations are a  prerogative of the parties to the agreement. Since as a result  of the crisis Tajik society has experienced a textbook case of  force majeure across the entire complex of production, trade,  financial, and other ties with CIS countries, we see it as one  of our vital tasks to prevent this sort of event happening in  the future. When the economy begins to grow, there will be no  reason for people to gather at rallies. They will be busy with  the business at hand. It is like a system of communicating  vessels.    We are very grateful to all those partners in Russia and CIS  countries who, at a difficult time for our motherland, supplied  us with food, clothes, petroleum products, raw materials, and  parts... Behind this stream of rather costly resources was and  is the labor of tens of thousands people. Although we are living  through a very difficult period, I dare say that the time will  come when not a single person will regret helping Tajikistan in  its hour of hardship. This is not in our national character.    [Chernyshev] In your opinion, which directions of  Russian-Tajik cooperation are most promising today?    [Samadov] Practically any sphere. Our traditional export  products. The development of mineral deposits, in which we have  nearly all the elements in the Mendeleyev table. The extensive  potential of agricultural production. But we have to start  small. Areas that can bring tangible returns in the near future,  establish solid ties. Tajikistan has, for instance, great places  for health spas and recreation. We have many resort zones,  including those with curative hot springs. This is a launching  pad for the development of prestigious 7,000-meter-high mountain  resorts. I could spend hours telling you about our land of  plenty, blessed by sun and nature. Spring will come soon to the  southern parts. Valleys will be covered with emerald greenery  and a sea of flowers. Better come and see for yourself. But it  is better still to come to work rather than vacation. We will do  everything to bring people's living standards up to commonly  recognized norms, to establish their direct economic interests.  This applies to a full extent to Russians as well. Especially  those who were literally forced to leave Tajikistan.    As to certain concerns regarding political instability, I  can  tell you unequivocally: Life is getting back to normal. Today  there are no more dangers facing you in our land than in any  other country. ""Isolated incidents"" can happen anywhere, and  they do not happen by the will of governments or peoples.    [Chernyshev] How will the economic reform that is underway  in  your country affect Tajikistan's export potential in the near  future?    [Samadov] The economic reform is a component of our merging  with the Russian economy. We have laws on property, enterprise,  and investment that are similar in many respects... Moreover, we  envisage additional steps that will create a most favorable  status for Russian entrepreneurs. We do not envisage any  obstacles or barriers to the movement of capital.    The formula of our reform is to put in motion productive  forces in Tajik society, to put into action most effectively its  rich economic, scientific, and spiritual potential. To ensure  the formation of a dynamic market economy and the priority of  human rights and dignity, which are deeply consonant with  fundamental values and views in the East and the  sociopsychological traits of our peoples. We are striving to  manage without a ponderous administrative apparatus and red tape  in dealing with various matters. And most importantly, to create  conditions for the forward development of society while not  permitting the state to interfere in the life of its citizens  and entrepreneurs. Our economy must have a ""Tajik face."" We do  not have any other path to revival.     "

In my opinion, they are particularly significant at a  time when the UN Human Rights Commission holds its annual  meeting in Geneva.    Havana -- One of the main goals sought by the U.S. blockade  against Cuba has been to obstruct medical aid to the population  in an effort to undermine support for the island's leaders.    The White House believed this action would be effective  because more than 40,000 pharmaceutical and medical products  (medicine, reagents, disposable material, surgical equipment,  and others) were registered in Cuba up to 1959. More than 80  percent of the products were sent by foreign firms, basically  U.S. firms, while Cuban laboratories purchased most of the raw  materials for their production -- low at the time -- in the  United States.    Aware of this dependence, U.S. officials worked hard to  obstruct that bilateral supply until it was suspended early in  the 1960's. They have later tried everything within their means  to force the rest of the world to do likewise.    The situation substantially worsened for the Cubans  following  the disappearance of socialist markets in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe, which served to considerably lessen the general  effects of the blockade for more than 30 years.    Under these circumstances, aside from receiving less income  in convertible currency, Cuba was compelled to pay higher costs  in freight and product prices -- given the distances and given  the special deals with businessmen who render their services or  supply medical products despite the risk of paying the sanctions  imposed by the U.S. blockade.    As a result of this, on a given year within the first half  of  the 1990's, Cuba had to disburse an extra $45 million to cover  its public health needs. Had it not been for the blockade, the  amount would have allowed, to use an example, the purchase of  enough powdered milk to produce 180 million liters of this  product.    One of the most negative effects of the U.S. policy of  isolation is the high cost of freight paid to import merchandise  from ports and airports in Europe and other distant areas.    Cuba: Were it not for the astronomical freight prices....    It is appropriate to remember that, since the implementation  of this line of conduct, the White House has forbidden U.S.  ships to load merchandise shipped from any country to Cuba or to  dock at any Cuban port; and in 1962 it established the so-called  ""black list"" of ships from other countries that traded with the  island. The provision to be removed from that list was to  suspend all trade with the island.    It is well known that this case history was somehow recast  in  1992 for the so-called Torricelli amendment, to officially  threaten with strong sanctions the ships that carried any  merchandise to Cuba.    As of 1993, official statistics show Havana had an annual  expense of $6 million in air and maritime freight for the public  health sector. The amount would have been $1 million or $2  million if the cargo had been purchased in markets located  nearby and under the normal circumstances which surround these  deals.    The effects of the blockade are simultaneously reflected in  a  foreign debt increase and a greater disbursement of hard  currency given the excessive cost of freight, air freight in  many cases, to guarantee the prompt arrival of critical products  which guarantee the health -- sometimes the life -- of human  beings.    The frequent use of air freight, despite the fact it is  much more expensive than sea freight, is because under current  circumstances Cuba's medical reserves do not always allow the  long waiting time by sea, in addition to the fact the blockade  also restrictions affect the availability of vessels.    The following is one example that illustrates this.    As already known, Cuba has been affected by a neuropathy  epidemic. Airfreight costs from Europe amounted to $237,448  just to cover a partial shipment of a contract for vitamins and  excipients (a substance that dissolves) to manufacture tablets  for the sick and as a preventive measure for the rest of the  population.    Had the blockade not forbidden access to the U.S. market and  access to nearby U.S. affiliates, to acquire these products  freight costs would have been $55,900. In other words, Cuba had  to pay $101,548 extra for just one of the many transactions  carried out to face this epidemic.    Another case.    When examining payments made between 1991 to 1992 for 32  products used in medical assistance from Europe, one can see in  airfreight alone $26,037 was spent. From the United States this  would have only amounted to $2,413.    With the $23,624, which Cuba was forced to pay due to the  blockade, Cuba could have purchased 10,453 packages of  methotrexate, which is used to treat children suffering from  acute leukemia, in other words, 87 percent of this product's  yearly requirement.    The Obsession To Leave Cuba Without Medicine [subhead]    For three decades the White House explicitly forbad Cuba to  acquire medicines in the U.S. market, the world's most  important. At the time, THE NEW YORK TIMES harshly criticized  this.    Something similar occurs with chemical reagents, which are  essential for the clinical analysis that guarantees health  services to the people and vital products for the development of  the medical- pharmaceutical industry.    The U.S. siege surrounding these essential materials has  forced Cuba to pay between 30 to 40 percent more to  intermediaries and spend more time to obtain the products it  needs, sometimes urgently.    If one considers the fact Cuba has very few financial  resources, one can better understand all the efforts the Cuban  authorities have to make to maintain the level of medical  assistance Cuba has, despite everything.    The neuropathy epidemic serves as an example for a better  idea regarding this.    Let's take, among the numerous documents, a contract Cuban  sanitary officials made available to me, covering only three  products (reagents) earmarked to fight the neuropathy epidemic,  which were purchased from a European supplier. The complete  operation, including freight, cost $1,938 per shipment.    To have some idea of how this affects the Cuban economy,  let's say that according to the price catalogue of the U.S. firm  Sigma, had there not been a blockade, the f.o.b. [free on board]  price for these products would have been $827; that is, 134  percent less for each purchase.    If this saving could have been made, with the money  difference, approximately 2,485 milliliters of cattle fetal  serum could have been obtained. This is an essential reagent  component used to test pregnant women for abnormal fetuses.    Another comparison serves to demonstrate more crudely the  realities of this uncommon process.    A contract for 1992 to 1993 which includes prices of 24  medical products turns out to be particularly significant when  it is compared with the supply of similar merchandise offered by  Miami- based Talgrex International Export Company.    In one single purchase, $986,386 in excess of the prices  announced by Talgrex were invested. This does not include the  burden that was imposed additionally by the freight.    For instance, one of the medications included in that  contract, the niphedipine [nifedipine], which is used for  treating cardiovascular disease, cost Havana $111.67, while in  the Talgrex catalog it was sold for $61.56, namely 81 percent  less.    There is another angle to the problem -- the multiple  obstacles that the blockade creates for Cuba when it wants to  obtain specific medication. The situation worsens even more when  it is necessary to resort to a costly and prolonged medication.    Third generation antibiotics are part of this intricate  general context. They are an essential part of the work carried  out at intensive care units and the cytostatic treatment of  cancer patients.    An important U.S. company, Lilly, and its branches in Latin  America manufacture insulin, which -- as it is well known -- is  essential for diabetic patients. However, these companies  refuse, using the blockade as an excuse, to sell this product to  Cuba, which has tried to resort to the distant European market  to guarantee medical attention for these persons.    There are 16.5 diabetics for every 1,000 inhabitants on the  island, and a considerable part of them are insulin dependent.  This means their lives are closely linked to the existence or  lack of this much sought after pharmaceutical product.    Please ... give handicapped Cubans a chance in Geneva.    Another significant example is shown in Havana's relations  with the Dutch firm Enraf Nonius, which supplied equipment and  spare parts for the rehabilitation of handicapped patients until  1991, to the extreme that 80 percent of the facilities came from  that source.    On 16 July 1991 the Dutch company sent a message to the  Cuban  capital notifying that it was suspending its shipments because  George Bush's Republican government did not grant it the  authorizations demanded by the blockade for products which have  a certain degree of U.S. components.    Since this step jeopardized the treatment of numerous  handicapped patients, the Caribbean nation's authorities were  compelled, as in other cases, to seek more costly solutions in  the world despite the country's precarious financial situation.    In the technology sector, the Cuban health system is  compelled, essentially by the blockade, to resort to  extraordinary measures to purchase textbooks and magazines,  while facing multiple limitations when its specialists want to  participate in courses and scientific meetings held in the  United States.    Books also fall prey to this attitude. The Spanish firm  Inter- American Publishers House, Inc. sold Cuba the medical  books it needed, but transactions were suspended in 1991 when  the enterprise was bought by the U.S. firm McGraw-Hill.    Despite all this Cuba has achieved extraordinary development  in the public health sector, a fact that is recognized even by  relevant members of U.S. scientific institutions which have  participated in neuropathy research since 1993 in what  represents the pioneer group involved in a noble activity that  should be carried out some day in the third world.    What the United Nations now demands as a foremost goal for  underdeveloped nations on the brink of a new millennium, Cuba  already achieved and surpassed years ago -- sometimes at levels  that are similar to the ones which currently prevail in  developed countries. In fact, it protects its basic  achievements in this area despite Washington's systematic  efforts to jeopardize its health care system. Those efforts are  part of an overall plan to create internal problems and  undermine the lifestyle which currently prevails on the island  and, eventually, cause it to revert.     "

The Chilean Government adopted two  positions, probably in an attempt to seek a fair position on the  Cuban situation when this issue was raised again at the annual  session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva. A  resolution condemning human rights violations in Cuba was issued  during this session. This initiative was approved by 24 votes to  nine, while 20 abstained from voting.    The UN commission pointed out the need to observe freedom of  the press and association in Cuba. The U.S.-sponsored resolution  was supported by the Chilean Government, which stated, however,  that the economic blockade of Cuba should not have been allowed.  In this regard, Silva Cimma said:    [Begin recording] [Silva Cimma] You should not only report  that Chile voted against human rights violations in Cuba, but  that Chile backed the Cuban request to condemn the unilateral  support for the blockade.    [Unidentified reporter] This means that Chile has adopted  different positions on the economic blockade of Cuba and on the  human rights situation.    [Silva Cimma] Merely because... No, not about the human  rights situation, but human rights violations. We believe that  unilateral blockades are very harmful, and that human rights  must be protected worldwide    [Reporter] Minister, does Chile concur with the special  rapporteur's report on systematic human rights violations in  Cuba?    [Silva Cimma] It would be an open lack of respect to  question  a report by a human rights rapporteur. For many years we have  demanded respect and positive votes for the rapporteur's reports  on human rights in Chile. We continue supporting this position.  [end recording]    Silva Cimma said Chile is concerned about any human rights  violations in Cuba. He specifically mentioned the right to life  and to freedom for people. He said the substantial progress that  has been made in Cuba in the social and health areas were  admitted especially in Geneva, and that consequently it was not  appropriate for the Rio Group to support the blockade of Cuba in  that forum.

But it appears  that the main purpose of the visit was something else  altogether: to find out how seriously the FRG and the West as a  whole are about partnership with Russia. Are they not tending,  concealed by declarations of ""partnership,"" to place Russia in  the dependent position of a ""junior partner"" and thereby cement  their ""victory"" in the Cold War? These issues have been the  subject of public discussion.    In January of this year, during a meeting in Moscow,  presidents Yeltsin and Clinton asserted ""that relations between  Russia and the United States have entered a new stage of mature  strategic partnership, mutual benefit and recognition of each  other's national interests."" However, the overall evolution of  relations between Russia and the United States and other Western  countries -- most importantly, practical steps in the field of  mutual relations -- indicates that the actual state of those  relations is very far from a ""partnership"" as that term is  understood in international usage. In fact, the West has  undertaken a number of actions -- from the bombing of Serbian  positions in Bosnia over Russia's objections, to the humiliating  refusal to invite Russia to attend the 50th anniversary of the  opening of a ""second front"" in Europe -- which cannot be  interpreted as anything except an attempt to ""put Russia in its  place.""    Correspondingly, there is no way that relations between  Russia and the West can achieve the balance, the optimum  formula, that would calm politicians on both sides and would  correspond to their objective needs. And it is unlikely that  empty talk about ""partnership"" will help matters any. What are  needed are practical actions that will in fact lead to an equal  partnership (if such a thing is possible), or else Russia's  relations with the West will continue to be characterized by  nervousness and unpredictability.    Therefore, so as not to mislead the public and the decision  makers, it would be advisable to think about just how justified  it is at the present stage to speak of partnership as an  accomplished fact in Russia's relations with the West, or  whether this is still just a cherished dream that is very far  from being a reality.    There Is `Partnership,' Then There Is `Partnership'    The Americans first began seriously talking about  ""partnership"" as one of the key principles of their foreign  policy under President Nixon in the late 1960's. The failure of  aggression in Vietnam, the accompanying acute domestic crisis in  the United States and disarray in political circles all forced  Washington to stop regarding its allies as ""junior partners"" and  attempt to fashion a system of relations with them based on the  principles of partnership.    Thereupon followed years of intensive efforts to find the  most adequate forms of partnership, including active efforts by  the Trilateral Commission, which in the 1970's prepared  documents on all the main issues in international relations,  with consideration for the interests of the United States,  Western Europe and Japan, and meetings of the Big Seven  countries beginning in1975, though as a rule these took place  without a great deal of commotion or public notice. On the  whole, one must honestly admit that while the countries of the  ""socialist commonwealth"" were unswervingly heading for the  collapse of that commonwealth, in the 1970's and 1980's the Big  Seven countries were, on the contrary, moving toward a higher  level of cooperation and consolidation.    Russia has virtually no experience establishing that kind of  relations. Therefore there is little reason to expect that it  can immediately, within a few years' time, wade through the mass  of obstacles that objectively stand between Russia and  partnership with the leading Western states. One will be able to  speak of real ""partnership"" when a solid foundation for it  exists in the form of a mutual stake in economic relations and  closeness or similarity in the social base and political  structure of and cooperation among kindred parties of a  democratic, Christian or liberal orientation. When, finally,  governing circles have similar or comparable social experience.    There is not even a hint of these things in Russia's  relations with the West today, and it will take years (if our  country develops successfully) for them to begin to appear.    The Foundations of a Possible `Partnership'    If one were to attempt to assess prospects for a partnership  between Russia and the leading Western countries, in particular  with the United States, first of all one must acknowledge the  marked inequality or asymmetry in the two sides' position.    Following the end of the Cold War the United States lost  virtually nothing in terms of its international standing. It  remains the largest nuclear superpower, its military and  political blocs have not collapsed, and it continues to play the  role of the largest provider of aid to other countries. The U.S.  economy, though experiencing some difficulties, is nevertheless  successfully weathering a technotronic era, assuming positions  of leadership in virtually every advanced technology. The United  States remains a country with one of the highest per capita  incomes and well-developed health care, social security and  educational systems. The same can be said of the FRG, Great  Britain, Japan and other Western countries. Without idealizing  their situation, in which problems do exist, one must  nevertheless admit that the West is a wealthy and developed  society with good prospects for the 21st century.    Russia comes up looking badly by comparison. The USSR has  collapsed, but virtually no one except the elites of the new  republics gained by that, with the possible exception of the  Baltic countries. As the largest country in the former Soviet  Union, Russia inherited its military status and its role as a  great power. But its economy is in deep crisis, a majority of  the population is barely making ends meet, and over 35 percent  of the population (according to various estimates) are living on  the verge of poverty. The country is characterized by  instability, and institutions of government are fighting among  themselves, unable to propose either a socioeconomic future that  is acceptable to the majority or, at the very least, a tolerable  existence. The center and the regions are in a state of constant  competition, and ethnic minorities are rebelling. A country that  has the potential to be the richest in the world is in a state  of semi-collapse.    It is clear that in this situation there is only one point  for Russia to a ""partnership"" with the West: obtaining a source  of funding, technology and know-how to rescue its economy from  crisis. Consequently, from the very start the West regards it as  a burden on the West's quite frankly somewhat limited available  resources, because the United States, Germany and other  seemingly ""rich"" countries themselves require loans and credits  to maintain production. Even prosperous Germany is having  increasing difficulty coming up with foreign aid funds as it  spends approximately $100 billion annually on reconstruction of  the former GDR.    What does Russia have to offer in exchange? Vague promises  of  future income from Russian mineral resources? Equally vague  promises to open up its capital investment market to foreign  corporations? It is hard to imagine that this is an adequate  attraction to the West, which is very well aware that even  Russian entrepreneurs, though secretly and illegally, are taking  their own capital out of the country, and that with current  taxes and laws and the reign of the bureaucracy only a madman  would risk investing his own money. These concerns increase in  proportion to Russia's internal instability: what if  Zhirinovskiy comes to power? Or the communists? What then?    The only thing that Russia can offer as an adequate  contribution to a ""partnership"" is cooperation in the area of  arms control and resolution of international crises. In that  regard one must admit that the real partnership that emerged in  relations between the USSR and the United States in the course  of profound changes in the international arena (this  ""partnership"" was first mentioned by President Bush during a  meeting with CPSU Central Committee General Secretary M. S.  Gorbachev in Malta in December 1989) could serve as a serious  foundation upon which both powers could build broader and more  lasting partnership relations.    Subsequently events took their course: at the end of 1991  the  Soviet Union collapsed, and the United States was skeptical of  Russia's attempts to replace it as a ""partner."" This did not  prevent the United States from signing the START II Treaty with  Russia. But that was most likely due to inertia from previous  years, because the treaty left out Ukraine, Belorussia and  Kazakhstan, which were also nuclear heirs of the USSR.    As for crises and examples of cooperation with regard to  resolving them, the Americans are increasingly disinclined to  trust the Russian Government, which is definitely not always  prepared to risk unpopular decisions (for example, supporting  the West's anti-Serbian course in Yugoslavia) and at times is  incapable of defining a given region's degree of importance to  Russia.    ""Partnership"" between Russia and the West, if it were  actually to begin functioning now, would most likely mean a  tremendous inequality between the partners, an inequality that  would become increasingly difficult to correct with the passage  of time.    A weak Russia that has lost its traditional image and has an  inefficient economy cannot be an equal partner for the United  States or the European Union. It will continue to ask for loans  and extension of its debt repayment schedule. Gradually there  will emerge (or perhaps already has emerged) between it and the  West a dense network of dependency that will ensnare the  country, its resources, its policy and even its culture. That is  what must be avoided at all costs. We must resolutely focus  primarily on fixing the economy, without pinning any particular  hopes on anyone curing our ills for us.    We should be oriented toward a partnership with the West,  but  only in some distant future. Entering into one now would be to  risk the free future of our nation.    The Convergence Has Begun    Despite all these seemingly obvious facts, the Russian  Government has set itself the task of rapidly building  ""partnership"" relations with the West. As a rule, the response  it gets consists of polite ambiguities, vague sentiments and, at  the same time, some rather harsh demands. Moreover, those  demands apply to the realms of politics, economics, security and  even, in a number of cases, internal affairs. Very often those  demands give absolutely no consideration to Russia's specific  circumstances, and can even take the form of dictates.    One can imagine that Western politicians have too thoroughly  perceived the ""smiling diplomacy"" of the Russian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs as evidence of Russia's willingness, like a  wayward schoolboy, to listen to lectures and commentary in hopes  of some unspecified reward in the future. Even in a matter in  which Russians could well take pride -- the overthrow of the  communist regime -- there has been the usual expression of  gratitude to the West for its ""energetic efforts,"" even though  it is a well-known fact that after the end of the war in Vietnam  the West renounced ""crusades"" and was prepared to cooperate with  the communist Soviet Union or China, if that was in line with  its own needs.    The initial and quite naive attempts to depict Russia as  virtually a ready-made ""partner"" for the West have given rise to  a very incorrect reaction there. There people often forget that  Russia, despite all its internal weakness, was and still remains  a great power. There people have dared to flagrantly interfere  in Russia's internal affairs in the Baltic countries and in  Russia's relations with the CIS countries. There people have  deemed it possible to reproach Russians over Zhirinovskiy both  publicly and on an official level in a way that would be  unthinkable if the subject were any Western politician (for  example, publicly ridicule of the eccentric American millionaire  Ross Perot during the presidential campaign).    Western dictates have taken particularly ugly forms in the  area of Russian economic reforms. Threatened with the cutoff of  loans or refusal to extend debt repayment, Ye. Gaydar's  government was forced to take measures that had not been  prepared, worked out in detail, carefully considered or  discussed in public. Of course, Gaydar was not just a passive  observer; he, too, had a burning desire to create a market  economy in Russia as quickly as possible. But one would like to  think that he did realize how many objective social, political  and cultural obstacles there were to accomplishing that. And he  probably realized that without painstaking preparatory work that  could provide at least a minimal political base for reforms they  should not be adopted.    There are plenty of examples of Western high-handedness in  dealings with Russia. They include the cancelled rocket engine  deal between Russia and India, attempts to restrict the Russian  arms trade, slowness in repealing formal bans and restrictions  on trade, an obvious unwillingness to accept Russia as a member  of the Council of Europe, and many more. Among the latest acts  of a hostile nature toward Russia one could cite the infamous  NATO plan called ""Partnership for Peace"" and the bombing of  Serbian positions in Bosnia carried out by NATO aircraft.    One gets the impression that the nascent convergence between  Russia and the West, in which ""smiling diplomacy"" played such a  visible role during the first stage, has produced some not very  positive results. The foundation without which partnership is  impossible -- mutual respect for each side's legitimate  interests -- has not been laid down. The West was happy to  believe A. Kozyrev when he claimed that Russia does not have any  special, ""private"" interests, and concluded that it could impose  its own ""values"" and ""ideals"" on Russia as a guide to  understanding of what Russia should do in the international  arena.    These thoughts are brought to mind by the bombing of Serbian  positions in Bosnia. It should be noted that on the whole the  NATO ""initiative,"" which arbitrarily declares former Yugoslavia  a zone under its ""responsibility"" (unaligned Yugoslavia never  was such) and offers its services to the U.N. as a ""peacemaker,""  evokes the strongest reservations.    Simple logic says that this military and political bloc, a  creation of the Cold War, should follow the Warsaw Pact's  example and dissolve itself, as there is no real threat of a  major war in Europe. U.N. forces are fully capable of monitoring  the conflicts that do occur in Europe, such as the Yugoslavian  conflict, and there is no need to assemble huge air armadas to  resolve them. The very idea that air strikes could be used to  put an end to a highly complex ethnic conflict with a tragic  history is simply beneath serious politicians.    Nevertheless, despite the vigorous objections of Russia,  which has its own interests in the region, the NATO air strikes  were carried out. In effect Russia's interests were publicly  ignored, and no one even remembered to consult her president.    All the doubts that have been expressed about ""partnership""  with the West should not be interpreted as a rejection of its  value for the international system in general and for Russia in  particular. ""Partnership"" has become a fairly good form of  mutual relations between groups of countries and ensures that  balance is maintained between their interests. Russia also needs  ""partnership,"" but only the kind of partnership in which it  respects other countries' legitimate interests without any harm  to its own legitimate interests.    Then Russia's entry into the world community would not  destabilize that community, but rather would markedly strengthen  it. However, in order to achieve that level of relations both  Russia and the United States, as well as all of our country's  other possible partners, still have a long road to travel. And  that road begins in Russia, not in the West. It is only possible  to build partnership relations with other countries if we have a  healthy economy, a transparent process for the development of  foreign policy, a strong system of democratic institutions and a  clear and unambiguous image of our country in the rest of the  world.

The Maximo Gomez thermoelectric plant, one of the nation's  largest with an installed capacity of 600 megawatts, suffered  damages and had to be removed from the national network. Other  plants throughout the country have also been damaged by Cuba's  heavy oil, which can cause serious damage if it is not  adequately treated or if adjustments are not made to the  industrial equipment in which it is used. Cuba has been forced  to use this heavy oil to generate a considerable amount of the  electricity required by the country, because there is an  insufficient amount of light oil for all of the generators.    Workers at the Maximo Gomez plant are struggling tooth and  nail to repair this important power plant before the month is  over in an effort to restore services to the limited level the  people were receiving before the plant went off-line. Problems  like these, which pose a daily inconvenience for the entire  population and generate severe economic problems because they  paralyze various services that require electricity, are  characteristic of the critical economic situation Cuba has  suffered ever since the USSR collapsed and the full burden of  the criminal blockade imposed more than 30 years ago by the U.S.  Government was brought to bear on the country.    This blockade has now been intensified by the well-known  Torricelli amendment, whose purpose is to extend the so-called  embargo to all of the countries that maintain commercial ties  with Cuba. This is yet one more difficulty the Cuban people  must deal with. It is perhaps one of the main difficulties, if  you will, but certainly not the only one, because the industrial  sector is nearly paralyzed by a shortage of fuel, replacement  parts, lubricants, fertilizers, and numerous other resources  which, in turn, has created the worst economic situation in the  country's history.    A situation like this would have made the best of the  capitalist or so-called democratic-representative governments  collapse. In Cuba, however, we have a heroic people who are  resisting, because they know what they are defending, and  because they are fully aware of what they would lose with the  disappearance of their socialist system, which has brought them  so many achievements, not only material, but also moral and  spiritual. This is why the Cuban people voted overwhelmingly in  favor of the revolution headed by Fidel Castro during the recent  elections. This is why Cuba has so much strength and prestige  throughout the world. This is why the Cuban people will  continue fighting until they achieve victory.     "

In statements to the media during a recess at the Nation and  the Emigrants Conference, which started this morning, Alarcon  noted that such changes had been discussed for some time, and he  added that they are designed to adjust the structure of the  island's central government to the current situation.    He stressed that the idea is to do at the government level  what the people have already been doing to reduce expenses, to  rationalize by way of austerity, and to make the best use of  resources. ""We cannot, however, throw anyone into the streets,""  he stressed.    ""The idea is to simplify structures and, in turn, reduce  excess payrolls without affecting workers,"" Alarcon said. He  added that this is precisely what makes Cuba's situation  complex. There is a need to overcome this difficult phase, to  clean up the nation's finances, and to revive the economy  without adopting capitalist models.    In the United States, for example, there are a lot of  unemployed people in the streets looking for jobs, medical  attention, and something to eat, although that country is not  facing a blockade and a special period (the name given here to  the years of economic crisis), ""but this is not and will never  be the case in Cuba,"" Alarcon added.    Today, the Cuban Government announced the creation of a new  structure that eliminates several ministries and central  government organizations and creates new ones, such as the  Ministries of the Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism.    Decree-Law No. 147, which was issued by the Cuban State  Council and was published in GRANMA, explains that the goal is  to reduce the size and adjust the duties of the government  apparatus through measures already under way to confront the  crisis prompted by the disappearance of the socialist bloc.    Alarcon added that the decree is designed to better adjust  the government structure in accordance with the trade relations  and cooperation the island is developing within today's  international situation.

Radio Reloj at 3052 GMT on 17 March reports that a tourist  installation, the (Villa Don Lino) on the north coast in Rafael  Freyre Municipality, Holguin Province, has already met its plan  to bring in $450,000 in hard currency, 1.5 months before the end  of the season. The manager said there are agreements with  Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Canada that will allow  the installation to continue receiving tourists from those  countries during the month of April.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 18 March reports that Mario  Medero, director of the 10 de Octubre Power Plant in Nuevitas,  described as extraordinary the efforts of plant workers to find  solutions to problems and increase efficiency. Last week,  workers worked 14-hour shifts to solve problems in the plant,  and Unit No. 3 is being repaired to increase its productivity.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 18 March reports that 21,000  caballerias of planted sugarcane fields were hand weeded during  the first two months of the year: 8,000 caballerias in January  and 12,000 caballerias in February. The objective for this month  is to equal or surpass the record achieved during the same month  in 1980 when approximately 20,000 caballerias of cane fields  were weeded.    Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 18 March reports that the 1993-94  potato harvest in Matanzas is going well. The province's  agricultural organizations are expected to surpass 300,000  quintals by 19 March. The harvest is scheduled to continue until  mid-April in the 145 caballerias planted in potatoes for  consumption.    Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 18 March reports that Matanzas  Province has a second millionaire mechanized canecutting brigade  among the National Association of Small Farmers (ANAP) forces.  This second millionaire brigade is from the 19 de Abril  Cooperative in Perico Municipality. ANAP has 40 mechanized  canecutting groups.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 19 March reports that Carlos  Martinez Salsamendi, president of the Cuban Chamber of Commerce,  and Javier Taverna, president of the Chamber of Commerce of  Navarra Province, Spain, have signed in Havana an agreement for  the exchange of publications of the two chambers of commerce;  exchange of scientific-technical, commercial, and economic  information; courses; symposia; and technical support -- as well  as cooperation in projects for building buses and in the graphic  arts industry.    In the same newscast it is reported that under a joint  management agreement between the Spanish corporation Hoteles de  Espana and Cubanacan, the Camaguey Hotel in the city of Camaguey  will join the Hoteles de Espana chain on 1 April. Installations  in Sancti Spiritus and Holguin will also be operated under that  system.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 19  March  report the following:    The potato harvest has begun in Sancti Spiritus Province,  which ""planted close to 40 caballerias"" in potatoes this time.  Because better quality seed was planted this year and crops were  tended better, the province expects to harvest more potatoes  than last year despite the fact that a smaller area was planted.    On 18 March, the provincial bureau of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Pinar del Rio Province called for an intensification of  effort in the tobacco harvest, ""a campaign that is becoming  tough because the planting plan has not been met, yet the aim of  arriving at the number of quintals promised for this year is  being maintained."" Over 50 percent of the 1,809 caballerias  planted in tobacco in Pinar del Rio is still unharvested; and at  the present time, 411 caballerias are behind as regards  different kinds of tending. The availability of electrical  energy to dry blond tobacco has improved in the last few days.    The workers of the Jose Antonio Echeverria Contingent are  working intensely in order to finish the isotopes center -- the  only one of its kind in Cuba -- this year. The center, located  on the border of Guanabacoa and San Jose de las Lajas  Munipality, will research and produce compounds for use in  nuclear medicine.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 on 19 March reports that the Spanish  firm (Hoteles C) reached an agreement with the National  Institute for Tourism to manage and market the Camaguey Hotel in  Camaguey, the (Pernec) Hotel in Holguin, and the caves of Sancti  Spiritus.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 19 March reports that Cuba and  Venezuela are negotiating an agreement having to do with the  specialty of ecological tourism.    Radio Reloj at 2047 GMT on 21 March reports that a group of  65 Uruguayan municipal-level unionists visiting Cuba donated a  shipment of medicines and school supplies on 21 March.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 21 March reports that a  new cane Basic Cooperative Production Unit, La Polka, has been  formed in Santa Cruz del Sur Municipality, Camaguey Province,  and is showing excellent results. Close to 200 caballerias of  cane were planted in Cienfuegos Province during January and  February. Cienfuegos' cane planting plan for January-June calls  for planting 1,000 caballerias and weeding all the fields  planted.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 22  March  report that ""thanks to Cubanacan S.A., Cuba has an international  sky-diving center that guarantees that any international quality  event can be held here."" The center is located in Varadero and  possesses the latest technology and constitutes a very  attractive hub in every way. ""At the official inauguration, a  group of athletes from western Cuba performed sky-diving  demonstrations. At the end of this month, 50 Brazilians will be  diving as part of their preparations for the Latin American  championship.""     "

Trapped in the web of the Cuban-U.S. dispute, used by  several  U.S. Administrations in their campaigns against the island, the  emigrants witnessed in the past decades how their relations with  their country of origin have became tangled and have felt an  isolation that goes beyond the family circle.    The conference, convoked by the Cuban Foreign Ministry, also  had the virtue of revealing the existence of groups of nationals  who are located in dozens of countries on several continents,  even though, due to its geographic proximity and that it is a  historic path, emigrants have always headed for the United  States as their first choice.    The people present at the conference held a wide range of  political and ideological positions. They, however, concurred  in rejecting Washington's economic and commercial blockade of  Cuba.    The main topic of the previously agreed agenda was  emigration  regulations. The level of information, however, offered to the  participants with regard to the country's economic,  institutional, and cultural situation amply exceeded rigid  models or undesired exclusions.    Four special interventions introduced very important  explanations of further bilateral relations and also served to  specify the level of participation the emigrants can have in the  life and daily business of their own country.    Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the  People's Government (parliament,) exhaustively explained, not  only the operation of that government body, but also the truly  participative nature of Cuba's current democratic system.    As an example, Alarcon described the people's recent debates  on measures to reorganize the country's finances. He rejected  the adoption of multiparty politics due to its divisive nature  and the damage it could cause to the unity of the population in  such difficult times.    Of great interest to all, according to what was said by  several of the guests, was the panorama of Cuban cultural life  portrayed by Abel Prieto, president of the Union of Writers and  Artists (UNEAC). Prieto called for maintaining Cuban culture as  the central theme in every work, whether it belongs to an  emigrant or not.    Vice President Carlos Lage examined the situation of the  Cuban economy and said the efforts being made by the entire  population, which can also include those who live abroad, will  give Cuba the possibility of surmounting the crisis triggered by  the U.S. blockade and the disappearance of the eastern European  socialist bloc.    It fell on Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina to announce the  package of measures dictated by the government in its wish to  contribute decisively to the normalization of ties with the  emigrants, which is desired by all.    Truthfully, the measures corresponded, in some cases, to  requests that had already been made by the guests. Robaina's  announcement was received enthusiastically by the plenary.    The creation of a special department in the Foreign Ministry  to handle emigration affairs, the authorization to allow  emigrants' children to enroll in Cuban universities, and the  elimination of the clause that sets five years as the minimum  period between visits to Cuba by those who reside abroad were  some of the measures. Also, the revocation of the requirement  that those who come to visit relatives pay for a hotel room, the  possibility of investing in sectors that have been earmarked as  a priority by the Cuban Government, and the printing of a  publication addressed to the emigrants abroad, completed the  announcement. The main breakthrough, however, came just a few  hours after President Fidel Castro received the conference  participants at the Palace of the Revolution.    The participants met directly with parliamentarians to study  the draft citizenship bill, with youth and women leaders, and  later with the UNEAC board to study other levels of future  participation. Those were the first steps in consolidating the  endeavor that started with the conference.    The positive climate, which was witnessed by more than 150  domestic and foreign journalists, was present in the opinions  expressed by many of the participants in the conference,  including those who, possessing a political position different  to that of the Cuban Government, sought to contribute to the  common effort.    Several analysts and media representatives have pointed out  that confronted with such a reality, the attacks of the ultra  conservative groups living in the United States turned out to be  totally futile.

He said Cuba has signed similar  documents with Italy and Switzerland and that another is being  negotiated with Great Britain. Spain is Cuba's most important  trade partner.

The last activities by the Cuban chief  of state were separate meetings with Colombian groups that  support Cuba and with Colombian businessmen. The Cuban  President reiterated in Cartagena de Indias that the importance  of the Ibero-American summits stems basically from the fact that  it is the first time the Latin American countries meet without  anyone convoking them.    At a meeting with representatives of Colombian organizations  that support Cuba, Castro referred to the progress and  perspectives of Latin American integration and the so-called  Summit of the Americas, convoked by the United States for later  this year. He called the presence of Cuba in the Ibero-American  summits exceptional because for the first time it is not  excluded. In this regard, he said the support of Mexico, which  hosted the first summit, and the support of other friendly  countries had a lot to do with Cuba's presence at the summit.    The Cuban president noted that the summits have contributed  to combating Cuba's isolation, to creating awareness of the  blockade it has endured, to giving a lesson to the United  States, to increasing Cuba's relations with many countries, and  to enhancing rapprochement among Latin American countries.  Fidel Castro said that currently, there does not exist a true  integration conscience in Latin America, but that the summits  are contributing to this. He said the main obstacle is the  United States, which is attempting to prevent Latin America from  being more independent.    The Cuban chief of state said the Ibero-American summits are  so important that the northern enemy was envious and invented  another summit, precisely in Miami, which it wants to turn into  the capital of Latin America. He reiterated, nonetheless, that  Cuba is not opposed to that summit, despite the fact that he  believes Cuba's exclusion is cowardice. He explained this is  because U.S. Government leaders are afraid of words, ideas, and  truths, which denotes political weakness. Castro noted that he  is not opposed to the summit in Miami because he hopes that the  Latin American countries there will firmly defend the interests  of the region.     "

We almost always  receive information from just one source. The ability to talk  directly to somebody from Cuba, to somebody who holds an  important post there, is like a breath of fresh air. We would  like you to formally introduce Cuba to society. This may be  quite a wide-ranging question, but what is Cuba like in 1994?    [Robaina] Well, I am very pleased by what you have just  said,  because the fundamental objective of my trip to Paraguay, and  indeed of my tour of several countries, is to present our point  of view concerning Cuba's reality.    It is very difficult to discuss Cuba's situation today  because today implies, above all, yesterday. Cuba is an island  that is facing many pressures that stem from different  situations. It is experiencing an extremely difficult and  complex period, but it is armed with cultural, technical, and  scientific qualifications. This has enabled it to confront the  harsh situation, the terrible ordeal to which it has been  subjected.    When I say a terrible ordeal, I mean a worsening blockade  that was compounded by our loss, in 1989, when the long-standing  privileged relationship between the island and the Communist  bloc was brought to an end. Having endured the former and  confronted the latter amid many constraints and a quasi-silence  campaign, we have struggled to come to grips with a model that  would enable us to find a place in the sun and, above all, to  achieve a level of economic results that will enable us to  maintain a handful of conquests that we deem sacred.    My country does not want to go backward in education, health  care, science, sports -- the few areas in which Cuba has proven  to be efficient and has accomplished results. It simply wishes  to embark upon the path of economic transformation as we already  have at our disposal raw materials, capital, and technology.    It should also be pointed out that the population profile  has  also changed on the island -- there are 5.7 million Cubans under  30 years of age. Half the population was born after the Cuban  project proved to be successful. On the one hand, this has its  advantages, but on the other hand, it also has its drawbacks.    [Reporter] One former Cuban education minister once told us:  ""We may change everything, but we will not give up the present  levels of education and health care."" Is this correct?    [Robaina] That remark could even be much more to the point  now because the country is in even more serious jeopardy.  Everything is negotiable, anything may be discussed, except our  sovereignty, our independence, our ability to speak with our own  voice, which today are indeed at stake.    We can discuss anything except what may entail going  backwards in our achievements in education -- as the former  minister said -- in health care, science, and sports, because  these are the areas where we have made conquests and can show to  the world.    [Reporter] You have said that many things, indeed nearly  everything is negotiable. Is Fidel Castro's leadership  negotiable?    [Robaina] The Cuban people have never questioned Fidel  Castro's leadership or considered the need to negotiate it. The  Cuban people are not willing to take this issue to the  negotiating table. I believe Fidel's presence and work are more  important than his mere physical presence among us. I believe  it was Fidel himself who brought up this issue for public  discussion because he has no interest in staying in power  forever. He remains in power, and with Cubans it is not because  he decided to do so, but rather because Cubans wanted it. I  believe Fidel is a testimony to the extent to which we guarantee  the continuity of the project. To us Fidel embodies dignity to  a superlative degree. He personifies a historic role in his  time and now. He has such an important role to play today in  the country's economic transformation process that he cannot be  left aside on any account. To us, Fidel is too important to  negotiate over or to allow anybody to demand that we include him  in a series of alternatives in order to reach a certain  agreement.    [Reporter] With regard to Fidel Castro's possible  succession, is there any alternative political scheme under  consideration or will his successor come from the same party,  the same revolution?    [Robaina] I believe succession must come first, the  succession of Fidel himself, who has taught us Cubans not to  worry about change because changes should not be traumatic for  Cubans. I believe succession affects both he who assumes  office, no matter who that may be; but above all it affects the  project in which many participate collectively. In my view,  that is a phenomenon. Now, concerning the possibility of a  political system different from the one we now have, that does  not even depend on whether Fidel is in office. It is my  considered opinion that any modification to the chosen system  depends on the deep causes that led us to this system.    My country opted for an ideology and embarked upon a certain  path due to an ongoing threat that has not disappeared. I am  not referring to a military threat, as I am aware that some may  wonder if we believe we are in danger of being attacked. My  country is enduring an aggression that is much more difficult  than an act of military aggression. My country contends it has  been strangled through economic means and therefore, as long as  these conditions prevail, my country cannot afford to make  changes right now, as many countries living under normal  conditions think we should. My country has to think about  surviving first in order to be able to change later. While  conditions continue unchanged it is impossible for my country to  accomplish what other countries accomplish under normal  conditions.    [Reporter] Is it possible to consider a capitalist Cuba in  terms of a market economy? How is Cuba facing this reality?    [Robaina] No. Cuba is facing a reality in a world that up to  now has had a bipolar structure and that at present is unipolar.  For us, a Cuba that follows an economic model that renounces our  conquests is out of the question. Notwithstanding this, we  Cubans want -- and we are striving for it -- a Cuba that, in a  changing world where options are so difficult and complex, is  able to maintain some ties and economic relations without  renouncing its very essence. To do this we must embark on a  process of mixed partnerships in those areas where we are  seeking markets and capital. We continue more than ever  committed to a model that will enable us to make headway in our  conquests and in social justice. We are aware that we have  drafted and are implementing this model under a lot of pressure  and at a time when working conditions have changed tremendously.  This is why we say that the most important thing for us now is  to defend the essence. We will defend ideals that for us are  really sacred, given the conditions found along that path. My  country is not, and does not intend to be included among those  countries that, to overcome a crisis, state that the only way  out is to adopt a model which, in my view, continues to make the  rich richer and the poor poorer.    [Reporter] Will Cuba give up a centralized economic system  or  will it negotiate quotas, as you said concerning education and  health care, despite the fact that these are not negotiable  either. What is Cuba not willing to forego, to leave behind?    [Robaina] No, Cuba already has a new economic model. Cuba is  no longer talking about a totally centralized and state-run  economic model as we had up to now. Cuba wants to maintain its  achievements and under the government's participation, has  already embarked upon a process of mixed partnership. Moreover,  Cuba is not the only country doing this. We are assessing other  countries' experiences. We have opened the country to foreign  capital, liberalized the labor market, and allowed the use of  the land by farmers whether or not they work on sugar cane  plantations. The decentralization of many duties, until now  performed by the central government, speaks of an economic model  that is being sought in order to adapt it to the Cuban reality.    [Reporter] We expected the ceremonies to welcome a guest of  your stature by our authorities would be more grandiose, but the  important thing is that you are here, as you have said, and have  brought this new approach to relations, this new air that is  beginning to be breathed between our countries.    [Robaina] For me, the most important thing, as you said, is  that a new channel of communication is being opened.    Much has been said about this being a private visit, but I  can assure you that I could not have made a more public visit.  Anyhow, I am really pleased to have been able to know the  Paraguayan people and with the many representatives I have the  honor of meeting.     "

In a statement to Barbados' CBU [as received] Television  that  was broadcast today by Cuban television, Castro said: ""The  effort made (by the Cuban fighters) helped safeguard Angola's  independence and hastened the independence of Namibia and the  elimination of apartheid.""    Castro also extolled the sacrifices made and the struggle  waged by the South Africans and the Namibians to reach their  objectives, saying: ""Sooner or later, Namibia would have been  independent, and apartheid would have disappeared anyway.""    Castro praised African National Congress leader Nelson  Mandela (who won the elections). He mentioned Mandela's  leadership capabilities and wisdom, which allowed him, the Cuban  leader said, to remain firm but at the same time flexible to  reach ""this political miracle,"" which I view as a very great  victory for the people of South Africa, the world, and the  progressive forces.    The Cuban leader has been in Bridgetown, the capital of  Barbados, since 4 May. He went there to participate in the  high-level sessions of the first World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which concluded  yesterday.    When asked about conditions for normalizing relations  between  Cuba and the United States, first, Castro cited the end of the  economic blockade Washington has imposed on Cuba for more than  30 years, a blockade he characterized as hard, unjust, and cruel.    Second, the Cuban leader also believes it is necessary for  the White House to understand Cuba is an independent and  sovereign country. Third, the Cuban people's right to have the  political, economic, and social system they consider best must  be respected.    Saying it is not Cuba who is besieging another country and  that Cuba does not want to change the social system or install  socialism in the neighboring nation to the north, Castro  affirmed: ""We have nothing against the United States.""    The Cuban president praised the recently concluded  conference  in Barbados. In his opinion, it made politicians and  industrialized countries aware of the need to prevent the  degradation of the environment.     "

In a tactic that clearly exasperated the Cubans, the US stonewalled all Cuban efforts to make the embargo an issue at the talks, which reviewed a September 9 bilateral immigration accord. 'I don't see how you can really proceed to an expanded programme of normal immigration if you have reduced flights and other restrictions,' said Cuba's chief negotiator, Mr Ricardo Alarcon. He was referring to curbs on flights and dollar cash remittances to Cuba introduced on August 20 by President Bill Clinton to tighten Washington's embargo. The US wants Cuba to introduce political reforms, such as legalising opposition parties, and to improve human rights. The talks in Havana ended inconclusively on Wednesday night after three days. Both delegations said they were satisfied with progress made in some areas, such as a US commitment to quickly introduce accelerated visa procedures. Mr Alarcon said the talks had identified some problem areas that still needed to be resolved. He gave no details but differences had emerged during the talks over exactly how to deal with 32,000 Cuban refugees sheltering at US safe havens at Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and in Panama. Meanwhile, Wednesday's overwhelming but widely expected United Nations General Assembly vote against the US economic embargo on Cuba was being hailed by the Havana government yesterday.

According to the newspaper, which is published in this  capital, Foreign Minister Amorim referred indirectly to the U.S.  embargo against Cuba at a lunch with Lage on 3 February when he  condemned some countries' adoption of unilateral measures,  disregarding international law.    According to this publication, Amorim kept reiterating such  actions undermine both Brazil and Cuba's development.    Commenting on this, Amorim said his country rejects the  imposition of extraterritorial law (Torricelli Law) on third  countries, although he did not specifically mention the  Torricelli Law, also known as the law for democracy in Cuba.    Amorim discussed his expectations regarding political  changes  in Cuba, and expressed his support for Cuba's reintegration in  the hemisphere.    He pointed out that Brazil and Cuba can join forces to  overcome their weaknesses, and cited as an example the benefits  that should result from a recent bilateral agreement, by which  the Brazilian market will obtain Cuban medicines.    Amorim said the Federal Government will distribute the  medicines to the poorest people of this country for free.    Amorim also referred to cooperation with Cuba in sugar,  science, and technical areas.    Meanwhile, in an interview by a Brazil news agency, Lage  emphasized that the U.S. blockade against his country has caused  many problems, and he said Latin American rejection of this  aggression is important.    According to the news agency, Lage told Amorim that Cuba is  interested in paying off a $30-million debt with Brazil, making  the medicines' agreement possible. The value of the medicine is  greater than the debt.    Lage noted that the medicines' agreement will also promote  Cuban-Brazilian economic relations, and added that Brazilian  businessmen are interested in investing in Cuba, especially in  tourism, health, agriculture, and biotechnology.    According to JORNAL DO BRASILIA and the Brazil news agency,  Cuba has placed special emphasis on tourism and oil. The  newspaper says Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum], a state oil  company, invested in oil exploration in Cuba, but stopped its  operations. The publication stresses that the Cuban Government  wants Petrobras to resume those activities.    According to the sources, Lage believes his visit to Brazil  will help achieve an increase in bilateral trade.    JORNAL DO BRASILIA says that, according to Lage, in 1992,  Cuban cash purchases to Brazil totaled $47 million, and  consisted mainly of food, spare parts, chemical products, and so  on.    On the third day of his visit to Brazil, Lage will lunch  with  Health Minister Henrique Santillo, then later he will meet with  the vice president of the Brazil-Cuba Friendship Associations.  The itinerary will conclude with a news conference.    On Saturday, Lage and his delegation will arrive in Rio de  Janeiro for a 48-hour stay. Lage's official visit will conclude  on Monday with his departure to Santa Fe de Bogota, Colombia.     "
0,FT931-13355 ,"FT931-13355 _AN-DAXAVAEYFT 930123   FT  23 JAN 93 / Muddling towards democracy: Truth of the Matter - Patti Waldmeir on the problems that face South Africa and Russia      By PATTI WALDMEIR   OF ALL the nations struggling toward democracy, few seem to have less natural aptitude for the task than Russia and South Africa. Neither is politically tolerant by nature: throughout history, both have proved themselves excellent autocrats, corrupt and terrible tyrants. But now Moscow and Pretoria, bitterest enemies for decades, have become strange comrades in battle: falteringly, they fight the tide of culture and history to pursue a liberal democratic goal which seems to recede as often as it draws nearer. Neither is likely to follow a straight path to democracy - if indeed, they ever get there. But both are committed to ruling by consent and not coercion; and a return to either totalitarianism or apartheid is out of the question. Both must therefore search for a more or less democratic form of government which can hold anarchy at bay while protecting the minimum of civil liberties. So far the move to democracy has fostered chaos, crime and violence in both countries. Many already yearn for a strong man to restore order. In South Africa, a prominent mixed race politician complains (only half in jest) 'I miss apartheid'; and most Russians would probably understand this nostalgia for authoritarian certainty. But in the longer term, a betting man would probably conclude that Russia will stay the course to full democracy - however circuitous - and that South Africa will not. Both face formidable obstacles to democratisation, chief among them problems of ethnicity and economic hardship. But South Africa has a further overwhelming disadvantage: the rigid correlation between wealth and race decreed by apartheid. For democracy is scarcely the obvious solution for a country where the majority is poor, black and impatient and the minority white, rich and powerful: democracy invites the individual to use his vote to obtain a fairer share of wealth; but any government which indulges the urge to redistribute wealth will alienate white skills and capital, and jeopardise economic growth. Either way, the incumbent government would suffer at the ballot box - and would probably soon decide to dispense with democratic elections. As Alexis de Tocqueville pointed out more than 150 years ago: 'When the people rule, they must be rendered happy or they will overturn the state.' But in South Africa, the 'state' would not give up without a fight; a new government may well be tempted to impose its will - in the national interest, of course - rather than hand over to the opposition. Not surprisingly, most South Africans reject this scenario: indeed, they find cheer in the midst of political upheaval by counting their considerable blessings in comparison with Russia. South African democrats will inherit intact the one most necessary condition for democracy: a market economy. That economy may have been damaged by 40 years of 'Afrikaner socialism', which used state capital to set up nationalised industries dominated by the 'white tribe of Africa'. But repairing its flaws is a small task compared with that facing Russia's economic reformers. From nothing, they must create financial markets, draw up a detailed body of company law and construct all the institutional supports necessary to capitalism. South Africa inherits these things from the apartheid state; and before the African National Congress decides to tamper with this inheritance, it should reflect on the ways in which capitalism underpins the democratic system which the ANC professes as its goal. In developed democracies, the private sector functions as an important check on the power of governmental authority; and the market economy holds out the best hope of a prosperity which is essential to bolster democracy from below. Paradoxically, South Africans will also inherit from apartheid - a most undemocratic ideology - the infrastructure of a thriving political democracy which Russia struggles so painfully to build. South Africa has political parties, independent courts, lobby groups and all the paraphernalia of parliamentary democracy, which can surely be adapted for a multi-racial future. But in Russia the Communist Party, which invaded every aspect of personal and public life, has deeply discredited the very notion of 'party'; indeed, there are few coherent party alternatives to President Boris Yeltsin, himself something of a one-man band. Progress towards the establishment of an independent judiciary in Russia is perhaps more advanced: the new Constitutional Court represents a milestone on the path to democracy. But Russia has no tradition of challenging state power through the courts - certainly not under communism, when challenging party decisions was effectively forbidden - and it lacks the institutional depth (the courts, the judges, the independent lawyers) present in South Africa. Even in the worst days of apartheid abuse, South Africa's courts managed to preserve much of their independence. But democracy requires more than political parties, elections and courts: a vigorous civil society (everything from trades unions to churches, women's groups to chambers of commerce) is necessary to frustrate the would-be tyrant. Such civil infrastructure is well developed in both black and white South Africa - and almost non-existent in Russia. Organised business and labour in South Africa could counter-balance government power; civic associations in black townships could prove a further check on central government; and with three-quarters of the population actively religious, the churches will remain a major political force. What is more, South Africa will inherit a state machine which actually works; in Russia, where party and state were practically indivisible, the collapse of the one has destroyed the other. No new South African government is likely to face the crisis of executive power which currently assails Moscow. So that is the triple challenge facing Russia: to create a modern state, a modern market economy and democratic political institutions, and to do so simultaneously under conditions of great economic hardship. But however daunting the immediate crisis, Russia will probably muddle through in the end to democracy and prosperity. And South Africa, whatever its early advantages, may not. Western democracies will continue to provide moral support to Russian democrats (however unreliable their financial backing), while South Africa will rapidly be left to itself on the remote tip of a forgotten continent. And over time, the gross inequalities of South African society could prove too much for a fledgling democracy. Both face problems of ethnicity and economic deprivation which threaten democracy; but in South Africa, crucially, they are linked. While Russians struggle (more or less) equally to survive, race determines the degree of hardship experienced by each South African. As long as that is so palpably true, it is hard to see how democracy can take root. But even if South Africa - perhaps Russia too - reverts temporarily to authoritarian rule, there can be no returning to the specific abominations of the past. Totalitarian communism and apartheid are ruled out forever. The future can scarcely be worse.

Is this what we fought for? Why are our neighbors  reaping the fruits of market reforms while we are making no  headway? Moreover, we are sliding ever closer to economic  carnage. Why is Belarus -- whose standard of living was one of  the highest in the USSR -- lagging behind our Baltic neighbors  and Russia? Production is falling, hopes are expiring....    Professor Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov, deputy director of the  Institute of Economy at the Belarusian Academy of Sciences, is  one of those few people who can see a real way out of this  predicament.    Today, Vladimir Ivanovich Tarasov visited our editorial  office. I hope that our interview with him will help some people  to differentiate between the ""black"" and ""white"" sides of our  economy. Some years ago, many residents of Minsk started making  ""shopping-tours"" of Poland and Turkey. Currently, most of them  have accumulated the initial capital. The second wave of  ""shopping- tours"" rolled into the Baltics, Moscow, Smolensk, St.  Petersburg.... They have literally stripped the Belarusian  foodstuffs market. Some of my acquaintances state that Belarus  has raised market reforms in Baltic states and Russia with its  dairy products... What is your opinion on the issue?    [Tarasov] I would support such commercial junkets if our  economy was healthy and sound. Why not? Exports which  stimulate production are growing.... Our Belarusian ""merchants""  make profits of around 500,000 rubles [R] on every commercial  trip.    Nevertheless, given our deficit economy and falling  production, these exports will not bring us any good. I would  like our merchants to bring back to Belarus some Russian goods,  however, they do not do this. They bring Russian rubles and one  ruble is worth three or four Belarusian ""hares."" You see:  Money makes money. However, it is not provided with goods  produced in Belarus. Next, the twist in the price spiral  follows....    The next problem is the trade deficit. It turns out that we  import more goods than we export. Nobody has yet calculated  this deficit amount. If we could receive precise statistics  from our state customs checkpoints and the Belarusian National  Bank, we would be able to coordinate the prices for Belarusian  goods with the constantly changing prices for imported raw  materials and energy.    If we had these data, we could realize that constantly  increasing prices for energy resources leave our command economy  far behind and raise the prices of goods produced in Belarus.  The main reason for this is the expansionist economic policy of  Russia. Therefore, we should draw some conclusions. First of  all, our government should start watching the price policy  changes of our neighbors. Do you remember the increase in  prices for glassware in the Baltics when the price of one bottle  stood at R3 there and 20 kopeks in Belarus? Our neighbors  started with bottles and since then have achieved serious  economic reforms.    [Markina] Maybe our wages and salaries should also be  increased, along with prices?    [Tarasov] We need a Belarusian currency. Only then we will  be able to pursue our own policy in the sphere of price changes.  Currently, we do not have a rate for our Belarusian ""hare""  currency.    [Markina] Vladimir Ivanovich, can we expect that everything  could be automatically resolved when we join the so-called ruble  zone, which had been promised by our government and the Supreme  Soviet?    [Tarasov] What will this ruble zone look like? That is the  question. Russia will hardly agree to the establishment of a  1:1 exchange rate giving the possibility of introducing single  prices. Everything could have been different if Belarus were a  subject of the Russian Federation. Meanwhile, Belarus is an  independent state. Therefore, in my opinion, it is unlikely that  Russia will introduce a 1:1 exchange rate. Hence, we should  speak not about a single ruble zone but about a currency union.  In addition, all the cataclysms of the Russian economy will  effect the exchange rate of Belarusian payment notes.    By the way, this currency union will not be a novelty in the  realm of international economic relations. For example, the  Austrian schilling is linked to the German mark. Thus, all  changes in the German mark affect the financial sector in  Austria.    Our government should demonstrate its political will  regarding the introduction of our national currency. We have  been using Belarusian payment notes for some two years.  However, have they become a solid monetary unit? Yes, they are  used in payment operations but they do not fulfill another  function -- the accumulation of capital. Who saves ""hares"" in  Belarus? People are saving dollars. Sometimes, they are saving  Russian rubles. Moreover, Belarusian ""hares"" are not used in  export-import financial operations. This means that ""hares"" do  not fulfill the function of international money.    It is evident that we should introduce our own national  money. We should not be scared that this will break our  relations with Russia. On the contrary, they will become  stronger. Pay attention to the fact that Russian Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin has already visited Lithuania, which introduced its  own currency, but he has never been to Belarus.    It is high time for Belarus to take analogous steps.    We should not rely on the ""kind uncle."" To my regret, many  people think the opposite. For example, Prime Minister Kebich  has visited Valday, where he spoke with Chernomyrdin on  increased deliveries of oil to Belarus. However, where is this  oil? Currently, the political situation in Russia is extremely  unstable. Belarus should conduct talks on all levels, including  contacts between government delegations, individual enterprises,  and commercial structures.    Russia has started creating joint stock companies. We could  do the same. Belarus can attract Russian partners. However, we  have no favorable conditions for foreign investments. Belarus  has hundreds of joint ventures with French, German, and English  partners, however, not a single one with Russia. At the same  time, our economic potential depends primarily -- 70-80 percent!  -- on Russia. We could have no problems with gas if we had  joint ventures with Russian oil structures. The Baltic states  do not experience any gas shortages due to the fact that Latvian  and Lithuanian businessmen have found a common language with  Russia. I want to emphasize: Progress is obtained by private  initiative. So, we should stimulate our own Belarusian private  initiative.     "

The pontiff, who repeatedly applauded what he called East Europe's return to  ""freedom's road"" on his two-day Czechoslovak visit, had not been expected to  travel to Cuba until some time in 1991.    Meeting with reporters while the Pope celebrated Mass here, his spokesman,  Joaquin Navarro, said that the visit will come before Christmas and probably  will last five or six days. Navarro said that John Paul was formally invited to  make the visit by Cuba's Roman Catholic bishops and by the Cuban government.    The Polish-born John Paul is applauded throughout Eastern Europe as a symbol of  the human rights struggle and an important catalyst for change.    Fidel Castro, Cuba's Marxist president, has adamantly rejected perestroika in  the Soviet Union that has made change possible in East Europe, but of late, he  has muted a longstanding antagonism toward religion.    Precise dates and details for the Cuba trip are still being worked out, Navarro  said, but the Vatican expects that the pontiff will arrive in Havana around  Dec. 9. He is expected to travel throughout the country, visiting each of the  seven Cuban dioceses.    If he follows his usual pattern, the Pope will also meet privately with Castro,  with Cuban intellectuals, with the diplomatic corps and with leaders of other  churches.    Under Communist rule since 1959, Cuba is the largest Roman Catholic country and  the last major Western Hemisphere country that has yet to be host to a visit  from John Paul.    The 69-year-old John Paul, in the 11th year of his papacy, usually makes four  foreign trips each year. The addition of Cuba makes six for 1990.    In January, the Pope visited five Sahel countries in West Africa. After his  Czechoslovakia visit, he will begin a new round of visits to Latin American  countries in Mexico on May 6.

The announcement of closer ties reflects concern in Brussels over the collapse in Ukraine's economy and a desire to use the prospect of stronger western trade and political ties to dampen extreme Ukrainian nationalism in the March poll. At the same time, there was continued confusion over whether Thursday's vote by the Ukrainian parliament had gone as far as ratifying the Start 1 disarmament treaty, although it was widely acknowledged to have removed obstacles to ratification. The UK interpreted the vote as a decision to ratify, which it 'warmly' welcomed, but the US did not go as far. Mr William Miller, the US ambassador in Kiev, said the US was 'very pleased' that the vote had marked the 'removal of the parliament's reservations to ratification of the Start treaty'. During Thursday's debate MPs insisted on more specific details on financial compensation, security guarantees and dismantlement procedures. Parliament told the government to finalise these technical agreements with the exchange of ratification instruments. This leaves a loophole for the Ukrainians on ratification should the technical agreements not be concluded to parliament's satisfaction. Parliament did not ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation treaty on Thursday, but will reconsider in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile, EU officials said partnership pact with the Kiev government could be signed before a similar agreement with Moscow. High-level talks between Russia and the European Commission continued yesterday, but there were few signs of progress on the two most difficult obstacles, the treatment of Russian uranium exports and the need to safeguard the position of foreign banks operating in Russia. These issues have held up an EU-Russia partnership accord since President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Brussels last December. The uranium dispute is particularly tricky because Russia wants uranium imports to be subject to the liberal safeguard clause in the planned partnership agreement; but France wants to protect its own industry, which supplies its nuclear power programme. On Monday, EU foreign ministers will discuss progress on the Ukraine and Russia partnership agreements at a meeting in Brussels. Ministers are expected to agree to a mandate for the Commission to negotiate proposed free trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, with Estonia likely to receive more favourable treatment because it has liberalised its economy faster than its Baltic partners, a Commission official said. Ministers will probably make clear that the Baltic-EU free trade pacts are a significant step toward an association agreement with the Union on the lines of those already agreed with the Czech republic, Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.

Lourdes de Urrutia, a Havana University sociologist  and member of a group who conducted a study on the matter of  illegal emigration, explains.    [Urrutia] ""I believe it is interesting to point out why  those  who choose to leave illegally do so. The fact is that 53 percent  of those interviewed do not meet immigration law requirements,  [passage indistinct] first-degree blood relationship that is  required in order to be legally sent for by relatives in the  United States. A certain percentage of those interviewed who do  meet the requirements, or have first-degree blood ties with  relatives in the United States, opt to leave illegally because  they believe it is speedier than leaving via legal channels, and  circumvents all the paperwork required to depart legally. Thus,  I believe illegal departures are conditioned by the  restrictiveness of U.S. policies and by the parameters for  people to be able to emigrate legally to the United States that  that country establishes.""    Specialists are of the opinion that economic reasons, as  well  as the difficult situation Cuba is going through, are the main  reasons people weigh in choosing to leave Cuba illegally.    [Urrutia] ""Among the economic reasons these people mention  is  the frustration they are experiencing because of the conditions  of the special period. There is also the fact that over 70  percent of them decided to leave Cuba during the special period,  after 1990. Therefore, these are not people left behind from  past surges of emigration. They are people who reached their  decisions between 1990 and the present, and primarily during  1993, which is the year our study was on. This is the year when  the difficulties of the special period were most acutely felt.  We believe that all this supports our conclusion that this  emigration is of an economic nature.""    The matter of illegal Cuban emigration to Florida reflects  the status of immigration relations between Cuba and the United  States. It also shows that this matter continues to be part of  this bilateral conflict.     "

Robaina spoke to PRENSA LATINA after holding a news  conference here today. He emphasized that his visit to Vietnam  ends what was announced as a diplomatic offensive in several  regions of the world to explain to several governments the truth  about Cuba and to study economic experiences.    Our tours to the Caribbean and several Latin American  countries in the past months and our tour to Asia now have given  our interlocutors a broad vision of the process that is taking  place in Cuba within a climate of respect and understanding, he  explained.    Robaina indicated that in those contacts, Cuba was allowed  to  explain its current situation in its own words and was able to  say things that are generally omitted by the big international  media sources.    We are a country open to dialogue and willing to negotiate  everything except our independence, sovereignty, and basic  revolutionary achievements. We are willing to do so without any  preconditions but based on the respect due to us for the place  we have won in the world, he sentenced.    Cuba is not the hell it is said to be or the paradise it  wants to be and, thus, does not have to be placed on the  defendant's bench. From this moment on, we will coin the phrase  offensive diplomacy as part of our legitimate aspiration to  consolidate and expand our country's international relations, he  added.    Robaina, who is probably the world's youngest foreign  minister (38 years), said 1994 would be a year of very arduous  work that would include a new tour to Latin America. The tour,  which is to start in April, will include visits to Peru,  Ecuador, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.    His project also includes a visit to the Middle East in the  near future. However, before this, he will host an encounter  called ""The Nation and Emigration"" to which members of the Cuban  community abroad have been invited.    The meeting, scheduled to be held on 22, 23, and 24 April in  Havana, will be attended by Cuban citizens who reside in the  United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela, Argentina, the  Caribbean, and other countries.    The Cuban foreign minister remarked the purpose of the  meeting was to normalize ties between Cuba and its community  abroad as all other nations do. ""All the Cubans of goodwill who  want to talk to their fatherland are invited. Only  aggressiveness and hysteria have not been called,"" he added.    Going back to his tour of Indonesia, Thailand, Laos, Burma,  Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam, which he started on 8  March, Robaina emphasized the importance of exchanging ideas and  of analyzing very valuable economic experiences in one of the  world's most flourishing areas.    He highlighted that Vietnam had been one of the most  important points in his tour due to the traditional bilateral  ties of friendship and cooperation and reiterated that Cuba  applauds and studies with particular attention, the economic  process started by Hanoi eight years ago.    At his farewell, Robaina confessed to Deputy Foreign  Minister  Le Mai that he was impressed with the progress made by this  Indo-Chinese country since he last visited it in 1990. He  reiterated his government's gratitude to the Vietnamese  Government and people for their concrete actions of solidarity  with the Cubans.    Accompanied by Ambassador Tania Maceira and adviser Carlos  Amores, among other officials, Robaina traveled to the southern  Ho Chi Minh city where he will end his tour to Southern and  Southeastern Asia tomorrow.

At the end of a tour of Cuban central provinces, Robaina  explained to a group of newsmen that ""Cuba is not just Havana;  we must show the world what the rest of the country is, and for  that, we must wage diplomacy in accordance with our times.""    For the second time since he was appointed minister, a  little  less than 1 year ago, this time, Roberto Robaina invited the  diplomatic corps accredited in the island to go on a three-day  tour through Villa Clara, Sancti Spiritus, and Cienfuegos  Provinces. With the minister leading them, the ambassadors  visited everything from a military industrial plant to a mule  breeding farm, peasant communities, child care centers, an  agricultural school, an imposing raw sugar storage center, among  other things.    Robaina insists that all of this is necessary because  ""Cuba's  image abroad is frequently distorted, and that is why we must  show the world the truth of our situation."" In this manner, the  ambassadors learned that the Armed Forces has not only reduced  its expenses but it is using part of the military industry for  civilian purposes in order to make some business and obtain  benefits.    At the ""Comandante Ernesto Guevara"" military enterprise in  Villa Clara Province, General Luis Perez Rospide explained that  this factory not only produces conventional armament and  cartridges, but also kitchen equipment for tourist installations  as well as plows and wagons for farmers' use. The general  emphasized that this industry is open to foreign investment and,  of course, to the possibility of forming a mixed association for  obtaining technology, market, and capital. ""What I need are  clients,"" said the general, ""and we are willing to manufacture  any product here which is within our possibilities and which is  good business.""    The diplomats were then taken to a peasant community in the  Escambray mountain range where they received a long explanation  of what the Turquino Plan for mountain agriculture is, which --  according to the people in charge of this program -- has  obtained ""great results"" and prevented migration from the  mountains to the cities. Obviously, the speakers were always  local authorities who occasionally made some criticized the  inefficient work of past times when Cuba was closely linked to  the former USSR, and they always concluded with some statement  along the lines that ""we will get ahead.""    In Cienfuegos, one of the most beautiful and developed  cities  of the island thanks to the established industrial capacity,  even though many industries remain idle, the diplomatic corps  specifically asked about the fate of the Electronuclear Plant,  the construction of which was halted a little over 18 months ago  due to a lack of resources from both Russia as well as Cuba.  Manuel Menendez Castellanos, party secretary in the province  said ""that plant is a plum,"" after explaining that there are ""at  least 30 countries"" interested in that installation because ""it  has been proven to be well built and in excellent condition.""  Menendez went on to say ""the problem is that a large investment  must be made and the negotiations are very complex,"" but he did  not explain which the countries have been contacted.    The tour not only included visits and explanations, but also  nights for dancing in which the ambassadors danced up a storm.  Even the foreign minister showed he could move to the rhythm of  salsa music like any other Cuban. His demonstration was brief,  but sufficient. ""Believe it or not, these things ease tensions  and relations,"" a Robaina adviser told the newsmen.    At the end of this tour, some said it was worthwhile  because,  in general, the chiefs of diplomatic missions are too secluded  in Havana while others, a few of them, thought it was a waste of  time.

Cuban-Mexican Relations Face a Very Complex, but Also  Promising, in More Than One Way, Future""]    [Text] Havana -- Passing over hurdles and skirting  stumbling blocks and snares, Cuba and Mexico have consolidated a  relationship that, due to its duration and fruitfulness, is  unique: above empty rhetorics, the times, differences in  projects, foreign pressure, and circumstantial emergencies.    Forefather Benito Juarez' expression ""peace is the fruit of  the respect shown for the rights of others"" had shaped the  already lengthy period that began when Mexican President Adolfo  Lopez Mateos refused to break relations with Cuba when the rest  of the Latin American governments obeyed an order to that effect  from Washington.    At that moment, the already excellent relations ascended to  that of exceptional relations, and this was the diamond that  topped the tiara of a historic phase of respect for Cuba's  decision to take its own road in exercise of the principle of  self-determination, and the Mexican decision served as a lesson  and example for others who, in due time, decided to follow suit.    This recounting is timely in view of the visit to Cuba by  Mexican President Carlos Salinas, the fourth Mexican president  who by his visit, a very brief one, will endorse ties and  nurture feelings that transcend authorities and promote a sense  of brotherhood and not just unite neighboring nations.    Salinas' visit upholds a tradition that was initiated by  Luis  Echeverria in August 1975 and preserved by Jose Lopez Portillo,  in July 1980, and Miguel de la Madrid in 1981. On those  occasions, the rejection of the isolation the United States  wants to impose on the Cuban process was made evident.    Today's situation is more complex for the two nations: Cuba  is enduring an intensification of the blockade that has  compounded a crisis produced by the vanishing traditional and  unfaltering trade partners. Mexico is facing a massive process  of integration with two big economic powers, one of which is  Cuba's main antagonist.    Domestically, Mexican authorities are facing what is,  perhaps, the most rickety election process in its history, with  unprecedented political tension (the armed uprising in Chiapas  and the assassination of the presidential candidate of the  governing party, among others).    In this context, Salinas' visit to Cuba can be interpreted  as  a diplomatic gesture or, perhaps, as a tactic, or as an  expression of a more important and profound will.    The visit could represent all of this. The truth is that the  visit has come as a U.S. legislator, who has the airs of a  proconsul, has launched overseer-type demands against Mexico's  rights to self-determination the same way he headed the  anti-Cuban campaign in the U.S. Congress to make Cuba yield to  its particular vision of what democracy and liberty mean.    It could be the sight of stable and promising relations that  are unaffected by eventual problems have moved the industrious  inquisitor Robert Torricelli to aim his guns at a government  that definitely does not yield to blackmail despite powerful  economic commitments and remains firm to a tradition that has  overcome all types of pressure.    Current Situation and Outlook    Salinas will find in Cuba a situation different from what he  found when he visited the island in March 1987 on the occasion  of the 6th Conference of Ministers and Chiefs of Economic  Planning of Latin America, when he was the Mexican Government's  programming and budget secretary.    Although the island's current economic situation is more  difficult than ever, Cuba's relations with Mexico during this  period have been most intense in the fields of cooperation,  investments, and cultural, sports, scientific and technological,  and educational ties, among others.    One recent example is the celebration of the 11th plenary  session of the Bilateral Business Committee, in which 50 Mexican  firms participated. This session strengthened the decision to  increase Cuban exports and promote negotiations capable of  benefiting trade between the two countries.    As Cuba imports food, chemical products, and raw materials,  Mexico buys tobacco, rum, marble, construction materials,  equipment, and products from the health and veterinary sectors.    Since the trade balance favors Mexico, the challenge of  increasing these relations is being met by balancing the  difference ""through the creation of patrimonial interests,"" read  investments, by Mexican businessmen in Cuba.    Luis Miguel Porras, who was Mexico's commercial adviser on  the island until his recent death, reported that in 1993,  Mexican annual exports to Cuba, which in the 1980's had been for  $60 million or $80 million, reached a record high of $150  million.    Porras once told newsman Fernando Davalos that ""Mexico is  interested in Mexican investors getting settled in Cuba because  as Cuba's agricultural, industrial, and services sectors  increase their activities and are able to export, the island  will be resolving its trade balance deficit.""    This is why here there is talk about the possibility of  exporting to Mexico goods such as sea products, essential oils,  zeolite, citrus, and computer software, and about joint  productions, reestablishing industrial production using Mexican  raw material, and servicing markets from Cuba.    There is a hush about this because there are abundant  examples of how Washington's anti-Cuban paranoia and meddling  have worked to frustrate more than one important deal for the  two sides.    This is why it is not possible to give details about the  growing patrimonial links being established here by Mexican  businessmen whose interests are linked to the development of  Cuban products intended for Mexican markets. For example,  investments in tourism, such as Varadero's Tuxpan Hotel, and in  textiles and tourism.    The same diplomat said that there is work going on on  projects such as the refining of oil and mining and that there  are studies ""for participating in the exploitation and  processing of nickel.""    In some important operations, he said, it has become  necessary to consider the problem of the Cuban foreign debt (the  amount of which he did not report but that some believe is  around $400 million, peanuts compared to others that exist  throughout the world).    There is a tacit understanding on this between the two  countries. This has been confirmed by Foreign Minister Roberto  Robaina. He has said: ""There are many ways of resolving the  debt, and we are in no position to say which ways these are""  because ""there is all sort of pressure"" on whoever tries to  trade with Cuba.    In February, the Cuban foreign minister told LA JORNADA of  Mexico that he has ""much evidence on how Mexico is capable of  overcoming pressure."" He noted that ""the situations of the  world, of Mexico, and Cuba are different.""    Bilateral ties have checked facts that were not appreciated  here, such as President Salinas receiving Cuban  counterrevolutionaries, and episodes of boat people and of  persons who forced their departure from the country with illegal  actions.    Robaina would explain this in a few words: (With Mexico)  ""there are exceptional relations, respect, and understanding...""    The fact is that beyond the ups and downs of politics there  is progress in projects in key sectors such as agriculture and  livestock, industrial, telecommunications, fisheries, and food  sectors and the importance of the recent visit by an significant  Mexican Parliamentary delegation to the island cannot be ignored.    It is almost commonplace to report that 90 Mexican sportsmen  have participated in eight disciplines in competitions held in  Cuba during the first four months of the year, that university  rectors from the two countries will meet in Mexico during the  second half of June, and that cities like Monterrey and Holguin  have become sister cities.    It is also commonplace to report that Foreign Secretary  Manuel Tello fully agreed with his Canadian counterpart in  condemning the U.S. blockade on Cuba, or that he told Warren  Christopher that the Cuban issue is one of the differences his  country has with the United States.    In a recounting of this we cannot fail to mention the  powerful and active movement of popular solidarity with Cuba in  Mexico, a movement that serves as a liaison for the breaking in  U.S. territory of the blockade against Cuba.    Cuban-Mexican relations are a very complex issue, but  promising, in more than one sense. This situation is endorsed  by those who, like colleague Luis Soto likes to say, no longer  fear U.S. Government threats and dare ""pull the tiger's  whiskers,"" even if it gets angry.    One does not have to be a sorcerer to imagine how the White  House sees Salinas' visit to Cuba only a few weeks after William  Clinton raised the tone of his anti-Cuban discourse to almost  the regressive level of his predecessors. The Mexican gesture  will be interpreted in many ways, but it cannot fail to be seen  as a sign that Cuba and Mexico continue blazing a trail as they  march on.     "
0,FT924-4906 ,"FT924-4906 _AN-CK3BQABXFT 921130   FT  30 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Russia before the Congress   THE CONGRESS of People's Deputies which meets in Moscow this week is a leftover from Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika, which demolished the old communist system but failed to erect a new one. Many of its members represent the interests of the old, centralised economy, which made the Soviet Union a deformed military superpower but never delivered prosperity, because it was not designed to do so. Before the Congress these men tried to pursuade President Boris Yeltsin that the monster designed to make the Soviet Union militarily powerful can be re-targeted, to make the Russian successor state prosperous and efficient. Powerful men such as Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of the industrialists' association, have sought to weaken the market reformers in the government led by Mr Yegor Gaidar. They have demanded the resignation of reformist ministers, accusing them of trying to foist an inappropriate western model onto Russia. They have also pushed for a further slackening of financial and other restraints on the military-industrial complex and an economic strategy which would make state enterprises the engine of modernisation. Recent events have already provided indications of what such a policy would mean. For a start, it means a new effort to provide work for military factories by a determined export drive. Russia is offering tanks, submarines, aircraft carriers, aircraft and arms and equipment of all descriptions, in competition not only with western manufacturers but also with arms plants in Ukraine and other former Soviet states. It also means a new emphasis on 'self-reliance', as in the decision to place a multi-billion dollar contract for the development of the giant Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea with a consortium of Russian defence industries, and the expected decision to go ahead with the Udokan copper project. This would provide thousands of jobs, but is never likely to provide an economic return. Given Russia's shortage of hard currency, and the spectre of mass unemployment, it is understandable that the managers should wish to keep their empires together by mammoth projects like these. That is what they were designed for. But the Soviet Union paid highly for the obsessive concentration of resources on a few prestige projects, like the White Sea canal under Stalin or the BAM railway through the Siberian wilderness under Brezhnev. Russia needs a new type of economy, responsive to market forces and the demands of ordinary people for the 'thousand and one tiny things' which central planning could never deliver, from a decent shirt to tasty foods and good medicines. That is the kind of economy being created in post-communist central europe. It is the kind of economy which Mr Gaidar and his government have also been striving to create. Mr Gaidar agrees that Russia should produce more and better equipment for the oil and gas industry and many other products designed to improve Russian efficiency and satisfy long-neglected needs, where necessary with the help of western finance and investment. A painful compromise has been worked on between the government and Civic Union conservatives. But Mr Gaidar is right to insist that four basic principles be retained. These are: no return to a state distribution system; tight control over the ballooning money supply; no wage or price freeze; and no artificially low exchange rates. Mr Yeltsin dismissed Mr Gorbachev's efforts to merge the contradictory plans for reform of market-oriented economists and the industrial bureaucracy as a 'marriage between a hedgehog and a snake'. He should remember those words and insist that Russia re-build its economy along market lines, with state industry playing its part within these disciplines.  The Financial Times   London Page 14  "

The agreement was signed at the conclusion of the Sixth  Session of the Mixed Intergovernmental Commission which was  presided over by Cuban Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas.  Hao Jianxiu of the Chinese Planning Commission served as vice  chairman of the meeting. Hao arrived in Havana on Sunday.    The high-ranking officer described the agreement as positive  and told the press that he is aware of the difficult economic  situation Cuba is confronting, which translates into serious  cutbacks in supplies and services for the people.    Without going into detail on the protocol that has just been  signed and which encompasses commercial trade goals for 1994,  Cabrisas said the most important thing is that these agreements  ensure the future development of cooperation between the two  countries.    During the meeting, four documents for bilateral cooperation  were signed including the final document of the meeting.    The Chinese delegation was received by Carlos Lage, vice  president of the Cuban Council of State and the person  responsible for supervising Cuba's economic activities, as well  as other high-ranking officials from the light, steel, food, and  sugar industries.    Cuba holds second place in Latin America in terms of trade  with China. These trade activities exceeded $400 million in  1993.    The Chinese have sold rice, bicycles, and even machinery  spare parts to Cuba in exchange for Cuban nickel, biotechnology  products, citrus products, and sugar.     "

We will  take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor  Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we  would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed  and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban  delegation?    [Amat] The meeting of Ibero-American justice ministers is a  conference that has been held for several years. As you stated,  this is the 10th conference. On this occasion we touched on  topics that appear to be permament topics on our agendas. One  is the topic of the fight against drug trafficking. This topic  does not have the same implication in Cuba as in other countries  because our society does not engage in using, trafficking, or  producing drugs. For other countries, however, it does have a  serious connotation. Some of those countries are drug producers  and are hard hit by the drug trafficking problem. Although we  do not have this problem in our country, it is a very useful  topic because the experience of countries that are victims of  this situation can always be learned from. They are teachings  that benefit us because Cuba is fighting hard to prevent drug  trafficking from invading us. This does not mean, however, that  we are immune to it or are exempt from it. It could happen to  us. Our duty, therefore, is to prepare technically and to learn  about the problem, to be able to wage an anti-drug program if  necessary. There are isolated cases, however, involving  tourists. It is not a problem that affects us to the extent it  affects other countries, however.    Another topic, which has been very important, is the topic  of  the family, which was discussed in recognition of the  international year of the family. In this sense, the essence of  the debate has centered on children who are abandoned and on the  problem of adoption.    Of course, such topics are discussed fundamentally from a  legal standpoint, considering juridical aspects. In the case of  the family, the social aspect also plays an important role.  Cuba has had many years of experience in which it has dedicated  much attention to minors and devoted much attention to working  mothers, so that children can be taken care of. Legally, our  laws recognize the adoption problem. We have a family code  which provides for discussion of the topic with special  relevance. This shows the importance the revolution has always  placed on the family, as the nucleus of society. In this sense,  Cuba was able to contribute to the discussion. We had the  opportunity to explain our experiences. Our proposal was well  received. Many questions were asked and we heard of situations  that exist in other countries.    [Otero] Thank you, Cuban Justice Minister Carlos Amat, for  your statements for Radio Havana Cuba.     "

[Lapshin] Many postcommunist states, after the initial stage  of tough reforms that were painful to the population, came to a  ""softening"" of the socioeconomic policy. Do you have the  possibility of carrying out an adjustment toward ""softening""  without slipping into the ""comfortable"" bosom of the  administrative-command system?    [Yasin] If we were to slip that way we would arrive at  either  a distributive economy or hyperinflation. When they proclaim the  slogan ""socially oriented market economy"" and, moreover, suggest  making this phrase the banner of the reformation, I do not  believe in it. Not because I consider it necessary to cast the  person who has ended up below the poverty line to the will of  fate and not because everything that is being done seems fair to  me. But what can we suggest? Increasing pensions and wages? But  unless we increase production, all this will end up tomorrow as  higher inflation and nothing more. We must be clearly aware that  inflation is the most reliable means of fleecing the poor. I  will say outright that talk of a social-market economy is cheap  demagoguery.    [Lapshin] But do you really not think that certain aspects  of  the social policy must be reinforced?    [Yasin] Yes, I think we need serious measures that would  contribute to fairer distribution. But this does not mean the  onset of a stage of a social-market economy. The latter is the  destiny of rich countries. After all, it is no accident that  when Erhard conducted the reform in Germany he said nothing  about it. Only after the very severe policy had led to financial  stabilization, an upsurge of the economy, and an increase in  business activity was it possible to begin to speak about  distribution. After all, what is a social-market economy? It is  above all the principle of distribution. Take from some and give  it to others through the state. As for the countries of Eastern  Europe, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia have just reached  the stage where they have basically achieved macroeconomic  stabilization. They are now faced with the problem of  production, and they do not know what to do with it.    All countries that are in a process of transition from a  communist system of economy are experiencing largely similar  stages. Achieving macroeconomic stabilization is the simplest  thing. But then comes the most difficult task: how to breathe  life into this economy, how to make people work, how to make  goods appear.    [Lapshin] Do you think the Russian economy has reached this  point?    [Yasin] Unfortunately, we have not yet achieved  macroeconomic  stabilization. But I think that, while continuing our efforts to  achieve it, we must now create the necessary mechanisms, above  all financial ones, for increasing the effectiveness of our  development.    [Lapshin] There is a point of view according to which the  economic reform is being conducted in the interests of less than  10 percent of the population of Russia. If this is so, it is  almost frivolous to speak about any nationwide campaign for  increasing effectiveness.    [Yasin] I do not subscribe to the theory of conspiracies  against Russia and its people and I do not think that anyone in  the government is conducting a policy in the interests of a  narrow stratum of the population. Anyone who exploits the  conspiracy thesis is a demagogue and a populist. The current  policy basically reflects the interests of Russia and its  future. Of course one could say that it is turning out to be bad  and wrong. But the possibility of changing the policy that is  being conducted exists within a very narrow range. I have  emphasized repeatedly that any reasonable government of Russia  would have to pursue approximately the same policy. There are no  alternatives to it.    [Lapshin] Let us assume that there are no alternatives. But  it is possible and probably even necessary to make some  adjustment to the course.    [Yasin] We can now begin to focus on the tasks of the next  stage, which involves the creation of preconditions for economic  growth. We can relax our monetary policy and pay wages to  miners, peasants, and scholars, from whom the state (not the  suppliers and not the consumers, but namely the state) is  holding back payments. This will lead to a certain rise of  inflation, but all of these steps must be taken within that  narrow range of possibilities I mentioned earlier. In other  words, we must set in motion a very delicate and precise  mechanism for fine-tuning our economy. And we simply do not have  the possibility of making any global changes: If we pursue any  true alternative, social explosion and economic chaos are simply  inevitable.    [Lapshin] Nonetheless the policy being implemented now is  also generating mass dissatisfaction among the population.    [Yasin] Indeed, it will lead to significant negative social  consequences. And we have reached a point where we must regulate  it. For example, it is necessary to regulate the growing  differentiation of incomes, but only in a reasonable way. Thus  if you put the squeeze on the rich again now it will be bad not  only for them. Because the appearance of this stratum of people  is a positive phenomenon for the Russian economy. If the  authorities provide the possibility of investing private capital  in the economy, they will do it more quickly and effectively  than the labor collectives who have seized a large share of the  property of privatized enterprises.    [Lapshin] You frequently meet with representatives of our  private business circles, what do they absolutely insist on?    [Yasin] First of all, personal security. Second, guarantees  for their private property. Third, certain tax breaks which they  could have by investing capital namely in the Russian economy.    [Lapshin] Excuse me, it is impossible to speak about any  stage of effectiveness when a decision is being made to unify  the monetary systems of Russia and Belarus. It would seem, thank  God, that the unification process has proceeded, but why should  Russia have to pay for it?    [Yasin] So far there is no actual agreement. There is some  kind of memorandum about intentions. It seems to me that the  unification must be carried out in a well-thought-out way,  precluding, for example, a ""one for one"" exchange of the ruble  for the ""rabbit,"" having agreed on a single well-controlled  mechanism for emission.    [Lapshin] Will it not turn out that all your discussions of  a  new stage of Russian reforms will remain merely good intentions?  After all, many citizens of Russia will not take any more, they  are tired, and they are ready to believe in another miracle.    [Yasin] If we decide to curtail the reforms we will be  defeating ourselves once again. I am in favor of applying state  power and supporting the reformation. Out-and-out populism is  incompatible with the reforms and life without the reforms holds  no promise. And if such a policy is begun it is above all the  simple people who will have to pay for it.     "
0,FT932-6552 ,"FT932-6552 _AN-DE0B8AHXFT 930527   FT  27 MAY 93 / Survey of Russia (2): Economic transformation is under way - Inequalities emerge and risks are high as the private sector economy develops      By EDWARD BALLS   DESPITE the chaos, confusion and acrimony which continually dog the government's halting attempt to embrace market reforms, Russia's economic transformation is under way. Accelerating economic and social change is readily apparent in the bustling street markets and newly fitted office blocks, both in Moscow and regional urban centres. But signs of this emerging private sector economy have yet to be reflected in the government's state-sector dominated economic statistics. Indeed, a casual glance at the official economic record would suggest that the Russian economy has stood still or even moved backwards over the past year: Measured industrial output fell by 18.6 per cent last year and may still be falling; Inflation continues to fluctuate between 20 and 30 per cent a month as the government and central bank pump out credits to loss-making state enterprises at very low interest rates; There are few signs of the unemployment and bankruptcies which many observers believe will be needed if industry is to be restructured; The domestic oil price is still less than a third of world prices, while other energy prices are even lower; and Measured living standards per head fell by a half in 1992 compared to the previous year, with the hardest hit being pensioners and other people who depend on state incomes. Since 1985, the average pension has fallen by a quarter relative to the average wage. But the statistics omit an important element of the Russian economic story: the growth of an unofficial, unmeasured, often anarchic, but increasingly significant private economy, which appears to be liberating a vibrant, entrepreneurial streak in a growing number of Russian citizens. This new activity is not restricted to the capital city alone, although Moscow is, not surprisingly, ahead of the rest of the country. Street markets, private banks, unofficial taxi services, new restaurants and stores selling imported goods are springing-up across the republic. The growth of this private economy has been encouraged by the liberalisation of most state-controlled prices last year; the privatisation of over 33,000 small-scale state enterprises in 1992; the government's nascent medium and large-scale privatisation programme; the removal of many state regulations on private activity; the withering away of the state's ability to enforce those regulations which remain; and the seizure and exploitation of state assets and resources by managers, workers and local bureaucrats. Russia is, as a result, developing a dual economy: a state industrial sector, biased towards military production, weakened by the collapse of trade between Russia and the other republics, dependent on government subsidies for its survival, but responsible for social infrastructure and the employment of the mass of the population; and an unofficial, sometimes illegal, private economy in which most agents are engaged in trade and the provision of services, rather than production, and in which much of the economy's Dollars 35-40bn annual export earnings circulate. The activities of the state sector dominate the official production statistics and the state budget. Experts at international financial institutions estimate that the government distributed explicit budget subsidies equivalent to a little over 20 per cent of gross domestic product last year, mainly to state enterprises. But the same amount again was paid to enterprises through off-budget credits from the central bank and the ministry of finance, channelled through the state banking system at very low interest rates. But it is the new private sector, emerging from the black economy of the former Soviet union and reminiscent of the wild capitalism of nineteenth century America, which seems to be the main dynamic force that generates and distributes wealth throughout the economy. This unofficial economy is serviced by the mushrooming, unregulated private banking system, whose growing wealth and power is illustrated by the large number of advertisements for Russian banks, paid for in dollars, which appear in this survey. The activities of Inkombank, a new Moscow-based private bank, are typical of this new private sector. Inkombank has assets equivalent to 212bn roubles, of which 70 per cent are held as hard currency. The bulk of its activity consists of finance of commodity exports through its network of correspondent banks abroad, explains Alexey Kuznetsov, the bank's smart, young first deputy chairman - 'we finance exports of fertilisers, copper, aluminium, arms, lumber and construction materials and refined oil,' he says. This private, un-regulated economy has space for many smaller fish. Some are official privatised companies, a sample of which appear later in this survey. Others are individuals who do extra work in addition to, or instead of, official jobs. Vladim, a 28 year-old Moscovite, fluent in English and Italian, earns 18,000 roubles (Dollars 19) a month from teaching. But he supplements these meagre earnings from taxi driving, at which he can earn Dollars 20 a day and pays Dollars 60 a month to the local 'mafia', who control taxi access at the Olympic Penta hotel. The growth of this unofficial economy partly explains how the government has been able to maintain support for reform, despite rampant inflation and falling real wages - 'people do not care too much about their wages,' ways one senior western official based in Moscow. 'Much of the important economic activity now occurs outside the wage economy.' But this dollar-based economy means a growing gap in income and living standards between those with the power and influence to take, and flaunt, their share of this new wealth and those who remain dependent on the state sector for their livelihood. It has also meant growing public resentment of the associated corruption and illegality. 'Pensioners are not primarily concerned with how badly off they are, or how hungry,' says social affairs minister Ella Pamfilova. 'Price increases are only their second priority. Their biggest concern is crime and corruption.' The government's problem has been to manage the political reaction to this growing inequality and lawlessness, while keeping the reforms on track. Over the past year, it appears to have managed the former at the expense of the latter. Support for reform remains surprisingly strong, boosted perhaps by the populist mass privatisation programme. But that is partly because the government, or at least the relevant ministers in the increasingly divided cabinet of ministers, have failed to take the tough decisions needed to bring inflation under control. The reformers have tried to pin the blame for inflation on Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank governor, who has been portrayed as an enemy within, recklessly flooding the economy with inflationary credit. His stubborn insistence on supplying credits to other former Soviet republics, to the tune of 10 per cent of Russian GDP in 1992, has certainly made controlling inflation very difficult. Many reformers argue that Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, should take over the central bank governor's job. But the responsibility for high and rising inflation belongs as much to the government. For cutting state subsidies to state enterprises, however necessary and desirable, means bankruptcies, unemployment and the risk of social discontent. Unemployment benefits are minimal, less than a fifth of the average wage, while many social benefits are still provided by enterprises. In these circumstances, neither the government nor the central bank have been prepared to ignore parliamentary opposition and start to cut state subsidies. 'The central bank should be responsible for monetary policy while the bankruptcies of state enterprises are a matter for the government,' says Mr Alexander Khandruyev, a deputy governor at the central bank. 'But if we simply stop credit emissions, then our government would face mass strikes tomorrow.' The result has been rapid inflation. Total credit grew, as a result, by 3,140 per cent over the course of last year while prices rose by 2,500 per cent. The government had some success in raising tax revenue, particularly from the value-addded tax which now accounts for a third of revenue collected. But on- and off-budget credits accounted for 40 per cent of GDP last year. If anything, the government has moved further away from controlling its budget deficit in recent months. Recent monetary data had been relatively encouraging, with the monthly inflation rate falling to 21 per cent in March from 26 per cent in February and the growth of central bank credit dropping into single figures. But a rise in government spending and bank credits in the weeks preceding the referendum are expected to push inflation back towards 30 per cent over the next few months. Mr Sergie Vassiliev, director of the government's Centre for Economic Reform, confirms that government demands for credits from the central bank increased in the weeks before the referendum - 'thirty per cent monthly inflation reflects the government's inability to control its expenditures,' says Mr Vassiliev. The central bank and government had agreed in early April that credit emission in the second quarter should be limited to 3,000bn roubles, of which 1,300bn roubles would go to the government's budget. But the consequence of pre-referendum pledges to raise the paltry level of pensions and the minimum wage, and increase in subsidies to the agricultural and energy sectors, mean that the government deficit is already expected to be 2,300bn roubles. The government's failure to curb inflation is therefore a direct result of its desire to avoid the harsh distributional consequences of imposing tough budget contraints on the state enterprises, many of which would be bankrupt. But the resulting inflation is proving to be both an obstacle to reform and inegalitarian, for two reasons. First, the inflationary credits are not tied to industrial restructuring and thus allow the state enterprises to avoid commercial realities. So long as state enterprises continue to receive credits at negative real interest rates, they face no incentive or necessity to restructure. According to various western financial institutions, neither macroeconomic stabilisation nor enterprises restructuring can proceed without a rationalisation and reduction in the volume of state subsidies. Second, high and unstable inflation is one reason why the flow of investment into Russia has so far been negligible. No sensible investor wants to hold rouble assets. The result is an artificially low exchange rate, falling towards 1,000 roubles per dollar, which leaves the average wage equal to a mere Dollars 30 a month and makes imported goods too expensive for most citizens. The reformers are relying on western aid to square the circle by substituting western budget support for inflationary central bank credits. The government's financial programme envisages that total available credit will fall from 40 per cent in 1992 to 17 per cent of GDP by the final quarter of this year. But total domestic credit falls to 7.2 per cent of GDP, consistent with a monthly inflation rate of 5 per cent, while western aid fills the gap. Western officials appear increasingly sympathetic. Officials from the Group of Seven industrialised countries say they are determined not to see a repeat of last year, when much of the original Dollars 24bn aid package was not disbursed because the Russian government was unable to meet the IMF's tough financial conditions. At their meeting in Tokyo four weeks ago, the G7 foreign and finance ministers announced a headline figure of nearly Dollars 44bn of assistance to Russia over the next year from the IMF, the World Bank and in bilateral aid. Senior officials at the group of seven industrialised countries envisage that budget support could become available over the next few weeks following recent negotiations between the reformers and the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is now offering each former Soviet republic fast disbursing aid - labelled a 'systemic transformation facility' - half of which would be paid immediately to any government demonstrating a 'credible' reform strategy. For Russia this facility will provide Dollars 3bn. G7 officials list four key conditions which should be met before funds can be released: Strict limits on central bank credit creation; A rise in interest rates; Significant reductions in all state subsidies; A viable budget programme that is consistent with low inflation. By helping the government to manage its distributional dilemma, the western hopes to help the reformers fight off the threat of hyperinflation and start the difficult process of restructuring and slimming the military sector, while the nascent private economy continues to grow. The challenge for the west is to ensure that aid does substitute for central bank credits, rather than merely adding to their sum, and is closely tied to industrial restructuring. That, according to World Bank officials, means ensuring that general subsidies are cut so that the social safety net supports the unemployed rather than loss-making enterprises, while remaining subsidies to large military enterprises are time-limited and linked to specific transformation plans. The G7 strategy is risky. Senior officials at both the World Bank and the IMF fear that, however committed the reformers in Moscow, their inability to control inflation combined with Russia's lack of market infrastructure mean the western money will be wasted. They are worried that the reputations of both the World Bank and the IMF will be damaged in the process. Certainly, if aid is to materialise and reforms are to progress, the Russian government will have to be considerably more bold, and willing to take greater political risks than it has been in recent weeks during which President Boris Yeltsin's economic appointments have seemed to suggest he is less than fully committed to reform. But if it works, western aid might, in the words of one senior western official, 'grease the wheels' of Russia's economic transformation by 'buying time for the invisible hand to do the work.' By injecting dollars into the economy through government channels, the west hopes to enable the reformers to control inflation and mitigate the growing inequality that the developing private sector economy is bringing. The risks are high - that is the nature of the G7's gamble.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           THE G7 AID PACKAGE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Bilateral governments  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Public debt rescheduling                             Dollars 15bn Export credits and guarantees                        Dollars 10bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- International Monetary Fund  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Systemic transformation facility                      Dollars 3bn Stand-by loan                                       Dollars 4.1bn Currency stabilisation fund                           Dollars 6bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- World Bank  --------------------------------------------------------------------- World Bank loan commitments                         Dollars 3.4bn Import rehabilitation loans                         Dollars 1.1bn Oil sector loan                                     Dollars 0.5bn  --------------------------------------------------------------------- European Bank for Reconstruction and Developm't.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Small and medium enterprise fund                    Dollars 0.3bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

This was  stated by Oleg Davydov, the Russian minister of foreign economic  relations, when he spoke today in the Moroccan city of Marrakech  at a plenary meeting at the level of ministers of the GATT  committee on trade negotiations. He expressed the hope that the  principles of free trade and fair competition, which were  endorsed by the results of the Uruguay round, will produce  increased mutual trade between countries and on this basis a  growth of national economies and the world economy as a whole.    Russia, the minister went on to say, is interested in  strengthening the multilateral trade system and also assumes  that it will be able in the shortest possible time to become an  integral part of the system. In striving to join GATT and the  World Trade Organization (WTO), whose creation will be announced  in Marrakech, Russia is pursuing absolutely specific practical  goals and the realistic creation of more favorable conditions  for its exports. Full membership of GATT is an essential  condition for Russia's integration into the world economy, which  is of particular importance for the country. The Russian  minister noted that this process will seriously facilitate the  speeding and deepening of market reforms in Russia on the basis  of the experience amassed in GATT over the decades. In this  connection the speaker on behalf of the Russian Government  confirmed its firm intention to complete creating a  market-oriented open economy at minimum social cost.    Speaking about the Russian economic situation, Oleg Davydov  said that in the space of just over two years fundamental  changes have taken place in Russia. The state monopoly in  foreign trade, which existed for over 70 years, has been  dismantled in the process of economic liberalization.  Administrative barriers with respect to imports have been  lifted, and restrictions on export operations have been  significantly decreased. The customs tariff is now being used  as a basic instrument of Russian trade policy. The price  mechanism and currency regulation have been liberalized to a  considerable extent, and large-scale privatization is being  implemented.    Russia's aim is to enter the World Trade Organization. A  flexible mechanism needs to be worked out to enable the process  for its accession into GATT to be transformed into entry into  the WTO. Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization will  be an important event for others besides Russia. On the basis  of a reasonable balance of rights and obligations, the sides  reaching agreement will gain in the shape of Russia a capacious  market of goods, services and capital. Even now, in the  conditions of economic instability caused by the transition from  a strict planned system to a liberal market system, we are  seeing a great interest in cooperation with Russia, the minister  noted. He stressed that the obligations which Russia will  assume as a member of the WTO will be an additional guarantee of  the stability and predictability of the conditions for doing  business with it and for the access of foreign goods to its  market. We hope that the Uruguay round was the last which our  country observed from the sidelines, the Russian minister of  foreign economic relations said.     "

Guliyev, chairman of the National  Assembly of Azerbaijan, by Anatoliy Blyudin, under the rubric  ""Visits""; place and date not given: ""Rasul Guliyev: We Will Not  Yield a Single Square Meter of Land""]    [Text] Rasul Guliyev, in Soviet times a prominent  functionary of the oil industry of Azerbaijan, and currently the  chairman of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan and, they say,  the second most important person next to Aliyev in Baku, will be  arriving in Moscow today on an official working visit.    Rasul Guliyev has given an interview to NOVAYA  YEZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA.    [Blyudin] Rasul Bayramovich, what is your attitude toward  the  present-day problems of the CIS? In general, do you believe in  the viability of this union?    [Guliyev] This is not the first case in history of an empire  falling apart. The same thing happened in Italy, England, and  other countries. Indeed, this process is proceeding very  painfully here, and there are many reasons for this: Some of the  new states are still young, and do not have adequate experience  in statehood. Strong mutual mistrust is the second factor. Let  us not dwell on explaining the reasons for this mistrust; let us  acknowledge that it exists. Well, the third factor--it seems to  me that there are still many people who would like to return to  the past--a single Union, centralization, etc., once again. A  general economic crisis is, to my mind, the main reason for  difficulties in the CIS. In the Union, the economy was  completely subordinated to political interests. Important  economic decisions were made not only without any serious  scientific analysis but also contrary to common sense. We are  now having to pay for this.    We must reconcile ourselves to this because there is no  other  way to a better life. History indicates that time passes, wounds  caused by the disintegration of empires heal, and life returns  to normal. Look at India, it now has normal economic relations  with England. The old enmity has been forgotten. We should now  have courage to admit that we will be drawing closer to one  another for a long time to come and with difficulty and, well,  also to believe that this will happen anyway.    [Blyudin] Numerous facts have been reported in our newspaper  which testify to the anti-Russian sentiment in Baku: Russians  are being evicted from their apartments, they are leaving the  republic. What is your attitude toward this?    [Guliyev] Yes, the Russian-speaking population emigrated  from  Azerbaijan during the reign of the People's Front. However, the  situation has changed since Geydar Aliyev was elected president.  We see that people are already coming back.    There are about 200,000 Russians in our country; some of  them  have lived here for more than 200 years. Our parliament will  pass laws that will securely protect their interests. Nobody  asks you in America what your ethnic background is; everybody is  American there. We should build approximately the same relations  in Azerbaijan. The idea of mononationalist politics is a dead  end. We want the Russian-speaking population to feel that  Azerbaijan is their motherland.    I am convinced that the parliament will pass the necessary  legislative acts as soon as the first half of the year.    [Blyudin] What role do you assign to Russia in stopping the  Armenian-Azerbaijan war?    [Guliyev] Of course, we believe that the Russian state will  assist in solving all the problems that have accumulated in our  region in recent years. I am convinced that Russia has such an  opportunity; both its political and economic resources are  sufficiently powerful. International organizations could take  part in these issues, shall we say, arithmetically, to the tune  of 20 percent.    We understand that complex and contradictory processes are  underway within Russia. However, we see that the above  notwithstanding, the real political forces are striving to solve  the problems peacefully. Nonetheless, political stabilization is  underway in Russia, and I attach great hopes to the growth of  the role of Russia in the peacemaking process along with this.    [Blyudin] What are the objectives of your visit to Moscow?    [Guliyev] First of all, I would like to become better  acquainted with my colleagues in Russia and share our views on  our common problems, learn where we are close to each other and  what we differ on: We must simply know each other before  anything is resolved. I would very much like a regular  businesslike relationship to develop between our parliaments.    Strong economic relations have historically evolved between  us. This is why borders between Russia and Azerbaijan should not  exist as far as investment and the economy are concerned.  Naturally, the laws our parliaments pass should promote rather  than hamper the processes of integration.    Russia is our big neighbor; we want to open all borders for  the economies. There will be no barriers to Russian investment,  but Russia should not throw up barriers to Azerbaijani  investments, either. We are in favor of civilized relations.    I worked for 12 years as the director of an oil refinery. At  that time we reported to a Union ministry; I know many Russian  oilmen well and have many friends in Russia. I come to Moscow  with great hopes because I believe in the power of common sense;  I believe that if there is enough will, a compromise may be  reached on any difficult issue.    Naturally, discussing the issue of stopping the war is also  an objective of my visit. Neither the Azeri nor the Armenian  people need this war. People are dying on both sides. I think  that everybody has ascertained this: We will not yield a single  square meter of our land. This should be understandable. If they  try to compel us to make a certain decision by forcible methods,  this means that we will fight. However, I would like to say  again that the war is not needed. Political decisions are needed.     "

Committee President Raymundo Del Toro has said this meeting  will be the appropriate venue to support the Free Trade With  Cuba Bill, sponsored by Democrat Charles Rangel, a New York  representative.    Del Toro has said the time has arrived for the Clinton  administration to change U.S. policies toward Cuba now that the  United States has renewed the most-favored-nation status to the  PRC and lifted the trade embargo on Vietnam.    According to the committee president, President Clinton is  associating with the reactionary minority of the Cuban exiles,  making, he believes, the economic blockade against Cuba a  lucrative business.    Del Toro has said the U.S. head of state lost the 1992  elections in Florida and will lose again in 1996 if he insists  on associating with this minority group of the Cuban exile  community.    Delegates of the Cuban-American Committee in Miami, New  Jersey, Ohio, North Carolina, Chicago, and Philadelphia will  attend this meeting.    These demonstrators will be joined by such groups as the  Cuban Change, the Cuban-American Education Committee, the  Antonio Maceo Brigade, and the Cuban-American Organization for  the Dignity of Miami.    The president of the Cuban-American Peace Committee said  that  religious and public health organizations, such as the American  Public Health Association, the Free Trade With Cuba Association,  the General Council of Churches in Society, the United Methodist  Church, the Global Exchange, and the Pastors for Peace, among  others, will be represented at the demonstrations to support the  lifting of the blockade.

By virtue of this legislation, Vice President Osmany  Cienfuegos Gorriaran will be the chief of that portfolio, one of  the three created (the others are the Economy and Planning  Ministry and the Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation  Ministry) as part of the downsizing and reduction of the Cuban  state apparatus.    In a recent chat with local reporters, Cienfuegos said the  Tourism Ministry will consist of a very small apparatus  (approximately 50 to 60 people) and will be unrelated to all  administrative areas.    The ministry's main functions will be to devise the  country's  tourism development policy, to oversee the operations of the  various tourism institutions, and to ensure the training of  personnel, Cienfuegos explained. He said specialization and  territoriality will be the basic principles that will support  work in this area.    To this end, following the dissolution of the National  Tourism Institute (Intur), Cienfuegos said three hotel networks  will be created: Gran Caribe, Horizontes Hoteles, and Islazul.  Maritime organizations will be grouped under the firm  Puertosol, and hotel activity outside the mainland will be  promoted in the territories by Rumbos Recreation Enterprises.  There will also be a tourism company that will operate under the  name Cubatur, in association with the Spanish air company  Iberia, which has extensive experience and prestige in this area.    The defunct Intur was created in 1976 and was tasked  exclusively with developing the incipient Cuban tourism industry  until 1987, when the Cubanacan S.A. International Commerce and  Tourism Corporation was created. Shortly thereafter, a third  entity, the Gaviota S.A. Group, was added to the efforts to make  tourism the biggest source of foreign currency on the largest of  the Antillean Islands. Though on a lesser scale, these last two  institutions also underwent structural readjustments this year  aimed at achieving greater efficiency and quality in their  endeavors. Their goal, together with the Tourism Ministry, is  to achieve more than $1 billion in gross revenues for 1995.    According to Cienfuegos, last year's tourism sector provided  the Cuban economy with between $700 million to $720 million (30  percent more than in 1992) and brought 560,000 tourists to the  country. This total is lower than the one foreseen but much  higher than the total for the same previous period (488,300).  Cuba received 243,000 tourists in 1985, 340,00 in 1990, and a  little more than 424,000 tourists in 1991.    The country has approximately 24,000 hotel beds distributed  throughout 11 tourism sites that offer the most varied  recreation, from beach bathing, mountain climbing, and diving,  to ecotourism and health tourism [turismo de salud].    Development of the tourism industry has gained strategic  importance, particularly at the end of the 1980's when the  Socialist Bloc crumbled and the U.S. blockade was intensified,  placing the island in a difficult economic situation.    To boost the sector's development, the Cuban Government has  resorted to various types of associations (joint ventures,  management contracts) with foreign companies. Up until now,  these associations have involved businessmen from Spain,  Germany, Canada, Jamaica, the Netherlands, Mexico, Colombia, and  Italy.     "

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ortega noted actions carried  out by Nicaraguans in 1993 in support of their Cuban brothers,  stressing the importance of these actions in light of existing  poverty in that Central American country.    Amid poverty that affects 70 percent of the population, with  more than six of 10 citizens unemployed and suffering the  effects of the neoliberal policy of the Violeta Barrios  government for the past three years, our people generously  showed their solidarity, Ortega said.    He added that people from the humblest neighborhoods and  towns, patients who received free medical treatment in Cuba,  professionals and technicians trained in that contry, and  relatives of others now in Cuba on scholarship participated in  the campaigns to collect milk and food for the children and  people of that heroic Caribbean nation.    In addition, he said, thousands who have never been to Cuba  but who completely identify with the people of Jose Marti also  participated.    As an organization, the Sandinist National Liberation Front  (FSLN) actively participated in these efforts, guiding its  militants and followers to strengthen the solidarity committees  in all departments and permanently condemning the blockade on  Cuba at all international forums.    Ortega added that in its relations with the Nicaraguan  Government, the FSLN obtained from President Barrios official  support for transferring the collected food and has always  insisted on the need to maintain normal diplomatic relations  with Havana, despite pressures.    During the past three years, he stressed, there have been  campaigns to have Nicaragua break relations with Cuba and  withdraw its embassy in that country. In countering those  campaigns, the FSLN has maintained a permanent struggle with the  government -- although in silence, understandably -- to prevent  our country from participating in the isolation of the island.    In Central America, Ortega stressed, the FSLN carried out  actions in 1993 to counter U.S. pressures to have the Cuban  issue included in presidential summit agendas.    Ortega said that after the signing of the Salvadoran peace  agreements Washington should contribute to detente in Latin  America by lifting the blockade of the Cuban revolution, which  is the desire of most nations as expressed during the past two  UN General Assemblies.

In brief statements to reporters, Lage commented on the  current state of the economy and its outlook and then added that  the meetings with the emigrants were held in an atmosphere of  mutual respect.    The meeting began last Friday with the primary objective of  normalizing ties between the country and Cuban nationals living  abroad.    Lage pointed out that the main obstacle to achieving that  objective is the hostile policy that the United States has had  toward the island for the past 35 years.    He added that the blockade imposed by Washington is also an  obstacle to the emigrants' aspirations to participate in the  official plan to increase foreign investment on the island.    He pointed out that the blockade, which has lasted for more  than three decades, is a serious violation of the human rights  of 11 million Cubans. That is why anything done to eliminate it  is the fairest and most just course of action.    Lage said the emigrants could help the country by increasing  their awareness of the damage inflicted on their nation of  origin by U.S. policy and of the need to fight against the  blockade.     "

Also, an Italian delegation  from the cultural association called World Liberation presented  two packages of antibiotics, anesthetics, and cortisone to two  hospitals in Santiago de Cuba.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 February reports that  Chile's minister of public health ""has announced that Chile is  going to begin a field test in March with meningitis vaccines  from Cuba and Norway."" The test will study the vaccinated  persons' response to the different vaccines. ""The test will be  supervised by the Pan American Health Organization, a Cuban  physician, and international experts.""    In the same newscast, Cuba Vision reports that ""the  important  Canadian hotel chain Delta Hotels has begun operating, with  Cubanacan, several hotels in Santiago de Cuba: the Sierra-Mar,  the Los Galeones Diving Center, and the Salton, all located west  of the city -- a total of over 260 rooms.""

He explains that the  Sabana-Camaguey archipelago area off the northern coast of  Camaguey is being studied because it is one of the areas most  greatly changed by man in recent years, and ""is beginning to be  exploited, from a petroleum point of view. That is, platforms  are being built offshore. This is the first time this has been  done in Cuba.""

Both ATT and MCI were due to open telephone lines to Cuba yesterday evening, offering a much easier and cheaper service to Cuban exiles, who have had to resort to special services in Canada and Italy to get around a bottleneck that restricted the number of calls to the Caribbean island. Telephone service is the one significant area in which the US has wanted to ease its long-standing embargo against the government of President Fidel Castro. The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act, which otherwise tightened the embargo, offered new opportunities to improve telecommunications links. Much of Cuba's telecommunications equipment dates from the 1920s, and only an estimated 1 per cent of the 60m calls placed from the US to Cuba go through.

The Juragua nuclear power plant is the most ambitious symbol of  industrial development in this province.    The causes of the momentary interruption of this  construction  are well known, but Cuba has not given up. All efforts are now  aimed at the preservation of the existing construction.  Continuous contacts are under way with the Russians concerning  technical aspects of the temporary paralysis of construciton on  the nuclear power plant as well as the supplies that are  essential for its preservation. At present, 2,000 workers are  engaged in its maintenance.    Several potential foreign investors are evaluating the  possibility of investing in the Juragua project. A state  committee was recently created to conduct these negotiations.  The committee is also responsible for coordinating the aid that  the national economy, despite its limitations, can give to this  project. A number of organizations in Cuba have sufficient  resources to meet the needs of the project at this stage and to  guarantee the fulfillment of the maintenance program agreed upon  in September [year indistinct] when the decision was made to  halt construction on the plant.

In an interview with PRENSA LATINA at the end of his  official  six-day visit to Brazil, which concluded in Rio, Lage said an  example of this isolation is the UN General Assembly's approval  of resolutions against the U.S. embargo for two consecutive  years.    He noted that the second time, more countries supported the  resolution.    The 44-year-old Cuban vice president indicated this is the  result of Cuba's refusal to renounce its socialist principals  and the admiration this position produces in the world.    Regarding Washington's lifting of the embargo against  Vietnam, Lage said this is the result of ""the heroic Vietnamese  struggle and victory,"" and makes it even more evident to  international public opinion that ""the U.S. blockade against  Cuba is unjust and cruel.""    In Brazil, the Cuban leader and the delegation accompanying  him visited Sao Paulo, Brasilia -- the capital of the country --  and Rio de Janeiro. They met with President Itamar Franco,  Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique Santillo.    Shortly before ending his visit, Lage said he found, in the  aforementioned officials, a great understanding and a firm  attitude against unilateral measures, like the blockade against  Cuba and the so-called Torricelli Law, which seeks to influence  third countries with the objective of attacking Cuba.    Carlos Lage, one of the Cuban Government's officials in  charge of the economy, said the objectives of his official visit  to Brazil were to contribute to the development of bilateral  political, trade, and economic relations in general, to promote  important scientific cooperation agreements in the field of  agricultural, and discuss issues of interest to Latin America.    Brazil, he underscored, is an exporter of food and  industrial  products that Cuba needs, but he clarified that he wants trade  with the South American giant to be balanced.    He indicated that the increasing amount of exports to the  Brazilian pharmaceutical market will contribute to that  stabilization. A $30 million contract for Cuban sales of those  products was signed this year.    He emphasized that Cuba owes Brazil $48 million and it is a  debt that still needs to be completely paid, but it will be  eliminated through the growth of bilateral trade.    Regarding the vaccine against type B meningoccic meningitis,  which Cuba manufactures and which Rio authorities requested to  fight an outbreak here, he indicated a Brazilian national  commission is still examining it in order to approve it being  imported.    He added Cuba can wait for those results because its health  authorities are convinced the vaccine is effective, given its  parameters comply with all international regulations and was  successfully used in Cuba during a mass immunization campaign.    In the area of general Brazilian-Cuban cooperation, he said  Brazilian firms provide specific services to companies with  concessions for petroleum-producing studies in Cuba, but he  stated there were no talks on petroleum during this visit.    In the agricultural field, he expressed Cuba's interest in  intensively studying Brazil's experience with alternating sugar  cane and soybeans crops in the same soil.    Regarding Cuba's situation, he said it is expected that in  1994, along with economic growth in tourism and the production  of domestic petroleum, there will be an upsurge in other  economic sectors that have been in decline.    This will depend, he clarified, on various factors,  including  the fluctuation of prices on the international market, and,  because of the complexity of that situation, he suggested  caution in making predictions.    Finally, regarding Cuban predictions for economic relations  with the United States if that country lifts the blockade, Lage  said that in the last few months the Clinton administration has  intensified the blockade and approved the Torricelli Law.    ""At this time, we are not yet in a condition to anticipate  that situation with the United States,"" he stressed.     "

On its pages the  paper raised a most urgent question which touches on the  long-term vital interests of Russia. Once again I was convinced  of the terrible situation (let us call a spade a spade) in which  our navy has existed for the last two or three years, that same  avy which for the first time in history had ranked second in the  world in terms of power. The peoples of friendly countries on  all continents welcomed ships flying the white and blue flag,  and enemies treated it with respect on all the waters of the  World Ocean.    The Deputy Chairman of Goskomoboronprom [State  Committee of the Defense Industry] of the Russian Federation G.  Voronin, straightforwardly and with facts in hand, sketched the  rapid fading of our fleet and its dismal prospects. In five  years the complement of the navy has been cut by 40 percent. For  the second year not a single new ship has been started. The  basing system has been destroyed, alert-duty service has been  cut, the squadrons of the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean  have returned to their own coastal waters, some ship-building  centers have broken away, and the financing of fundamental and  exploratory research has stopped. Deprived of its navy, the  country will inevitably lose its great-power status.    This prospect is dismal and ruinous for the state. Still,  some estimates demand clarification, some predictions require  discussion.    First of all I want to note that one can speak of the navy  only with allowance for the geopolitical factor. In contrast to  island states, England, Japan and (in a sense) the U.S., which  does not have the million-strong armies of neighboring states  nearby, Russia must first protect itself from the possible  invasion of ground troops. Nor is invasion from naval axes ruled  out.    As many now assume, world nuclear war is not very likely.  But  nuclear weapons will remain weapons of deterrence and prevention  of aggression for many years yet. It is no secret that before  the start of perestroyka, when no expense was spared  on defense, the USSR put the emphasis in the nuclear triad on  heavy ground-based missiles (ICBMs), which the U.S. most feared  and which most met the geopolitical interests of our state. At  that time it was easier and cheaper to form the Strategic  Missile Troops than the Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces.    A change in the structure of strategic offensive arms to  increase the naval component up to 50 to 70 percent, as G.  Voronin proposes, will lead to another naval arms race. Voronin  acknowledges that it would be unrealistic and inexpedient to try  to achieve quantitative parity at sea given the great economic  superiority of the U.S. Our country would not be able to breath  freely under the burden of excessive military expenditures. He  suggests concentrating strategic missile submarines and their  supporting forces in the North and East as part of the Northern  and Pacific Fleets. Allowing for the great economic importance  of the Northern and Far-Eastern Seas, the author believes that  ""our navy must provide full superiority in these zones.""  Accomplishment of this task would require too many forces.  However, temporary control over certain waters with the goal of  blocking amphibious assaults, for example, is a realistic task.  The new grouping of Naval Strategic Nuclear Forces also demands  balance by conventional forces, to prevent skewing in the  direction of any single weapons system. Forces to combat  submarines, aircraft carriers, and other strike vessels are  needed. All this requires an ""air-defense umbrella.""    Everyone remembers the Caribbean crisis of October 1962,  when  our forces in Cuba found themselves beyond the reach of Soviet  conventional weapons and we were compelled to withdraw our  missiles from Cuba literally under the muzzles of American guns.  Thus in every theater, a complete structure of the present-day  navy must be established.    So we must save the navy. To do this, the main forces of the  navy must be concentrated in the North and Far East. What then  of Russian interests in the Baltic and Black Seas? The U.S. has  already announced that the Baltic countries and Ukraine are  zones of their vital interests, and consequently they are  prepared to defend them by force of arms. On March 19 of this  year, on the ""Vesti"" [news] television show the new U.S. Defense  Secretary W. Perry, allowing for the instability in Russia,  spoke in favor of further development of nuclear forces,  including the ""Trident-2"" sea-launched strategic missiles.  Interest in the Baltic and Black Seas has also increased in  other states.    Remember, however, that the appearance of a regular navy in  Russia was prompted by an historical task, to penetrate the  community of European states. Peter the First, after building  St. Petersburg and creating the navy, had formed a great  European power. Since then Russian has not been a guest in  Europe, but an equal partner. Cooperation with European  countries supported commercial and other interests in the  Mediterranean. With the help of the navy dispatched from the  Baltic, the Far East, Alaska, and Russian America were  conquered. For Russia, remaining in the community of European  states means having an army to protect it from possible invasion  from the West and having freedom of navigation in the Baltic  Sea. The latter must come from the small but combat-ready forces  of the Baltic Feet. Here one must remember that during the Great  Patriotic War, in the Northwest Strategic Axis the goals of the  war were achieved through the joint efforts of the fronts, the  navy, long-range aviation, and the National Air Defense Forces.    Russia's second geopolitical task has been and remains the  furtherance of free trade of states at the crossroads of three  continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. The annexation of the  Crimea and the creation of the Black Sea Fleet met the needs of  rapid development of the southern regions of the state. Rivalry  with Turkey, England and France in this region led to wars, the  demise of the fleet and its new restoration. Now the Near East  is an enormous storehouse of oil. It is also a tangle of ethnic,  religious and cultural contradictions, as was demonstrated by  the Arab-Israel wars and the punitive operations against Iraq  (""Desert Storm""), effected from naval and ground axes.    For Russia, remaining a Black Sea power is an historical,  unending task. How can it be achieved without reliance on the  base system in the Crimea, after losing the ship-building  capacity in the south of the former USSR? Clearly we must  continue to look for new forms of cooperation with Ukraine and  the other Black Sea states.    It has developed historically that in Russian foreign  policy,  Far-Eastern and Pacific problems derived from European-Atlantic  problems. The flood of international capital into Southeast  Asia, and in particular to China, led Russia to create the  Pacific Fleet, and resulted in two wars with Japan. Now in this  region the task clearly is not to ""ensure full superiority"" but  to maintain a reasonable balance of forces between the U.S.,  Japan, China and Russia. According to reports from the SMI [not  further expanded], all ship-building plants have stopped running  in the Far East, and without them there can be neither military  bases nor a fleet.    At present public opinion supports the idea of a need to  create more mobile and better armed forces. In this we cannot  help but allow for past experience. In the 20th century, Russia  (the USSR) participated in two world wars without having  concluded the formation of an ocean-going fleet. This made the  ""Russian front"" very dependent on the status of the battle in  the European-Atlantic and Asiatic-Pacific theaters of war.  Retention of naval might exerted a great influence on the  results of wars. In the period of the postwar confrontation and  the ""Cold War,"" the USSR constructed a powerful ocean-going  fleet, but excessive military expenditures, including those for  the fleet, were one of the causes of profound economic crisis.    We should support in every way the proposal of Gennadiy  Voronin regarding the need to discuss the question of the navy  before adopting a 10-to-15-year ship-building program and  assigning the appropriations, not only in the Security Council  but also in the Parliament. We need a Law on the Navy. The  situation of the navy is so serious that perhaps its rescue  should be started with the formation of an independent Ministry  of the Navy.     "

With respect to this issue, the head of the Cuban delegation  participating in the 50th session of the CDH described the  appointment of the aforementioned rapporteur as part of  Washington's hostile and unmerciful policy toward his country.    In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA [PL], Perez Novoa  stressed that at a time when the end of the so-called Cold War  is being used as an instrument to demand an end to hostilities  in regions such as Palestine and South Africa, as well as  between bloc relations, ironically, that same policy is still  being used and reinforced against Cuba.    To the diplomat, it is unacceptable to discuss an anti-Cuban  resolution promoted by the United States such as the one  scheduled to be voted on next week when the CDH is expected to  end its current session.    In this respect, Perez Novoa indicated that ""we did not come  here on the defensive, nor did we arrive and feel that we are on  the defendant's seat.""    This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the  overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and  negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved  already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24  February [date as received].    Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking  place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner,  completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward  Havana.    In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not  concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged  resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this  cause us to lose sleep.    The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result  of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the  presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH  rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are  no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups.    Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an  institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that ""in  Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights  violations.""    That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that  the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive  policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba.    In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new  administration still clings to such a position which has no  basis whatsoever.    That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with  respect  to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory  treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the  rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda.    Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true  situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing.    ""They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to  accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the  one it has despite hostilities from the United States,"" Perez  Novoa indicated.    When correlating Washington's position with respect to the  so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new  administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to  confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in  relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy  toward Cuba.    How can they explain to the world that they continue this  Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador  asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to  the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even  resort to the false but much used argument that we are ""a Soviet  base"" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists.    Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained,  is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with  the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and  without any preconditions.    The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want  to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal  relations and discussing differences.    ""An example that obstinacy remains is this false and  manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a  new resolution,"" he said.    Cuban Cooperation With the CDH    Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad,  frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights  system and rapporteurs throughout the years.    In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized  by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which  are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or  force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the  complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in  turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have  nothing to hide, he said.    On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the  human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have  been able to accomplish what we have in this respect.    He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without  discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez  Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is  doing so, and will continue to do so.    On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba  invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives  visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and  made a report. The report was presented the following year and  discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations,  and observer governments during three sessions.    Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the  CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be  assigned a rapporteur.    What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote,  they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to  the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to  continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general  with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries  (Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the  EEC. [sentence as received]    Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been  assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote  (1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and  transparent cooperative relations.    Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a  report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and  had it analyzed.    The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable  cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously  established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC.    As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana  had been registered as a human rights case because it was under  topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes  in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the  disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This  situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment  to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by  approximately 20 representatives.    The only thing our people have always objected to in their  history and will continue to object to is when something is  imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm,  affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those  who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed.    Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called,  they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones  needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being  implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he  said.    The diplomat was clear when he said: ""We will not turn our  backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However,  we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and  political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the  essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as  received]    To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to  make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to  secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not  ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under  the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and  sovereignty, he stressed.     "

This is why Cuba's participation is directed toward the  overall context of the CDH programs which has encouraged and  negotiated dozens of projects, some of which were approved  already during the CDH's second voting round on Friday, 24  February [date as received].    Moreover, the Cuban delegation's participation is taking  place in an integral, multivalent, and comprehensive manner,  completely divorced from any perception of isolation toward  Havana.    In this respect, Perez Novoa stated that they are not  concerned or apprehensive about the ghost of an alleged  resolution against Cuba. In nothing -- he insisted -- does this  cause us to lose sleep.    The proposal for a special rapporteur came about as a result  of a U.S. imposition in its vendetta against Cuba. During the  presentation of the report to the general assembly, [CDH  rapporteur] Carl Johan Goth pointed out that in Cuba there are  no missing persons, torture, murders, or armed groups.    Later on -- Perez Novoa stated -- he tried to justify an  institutional system, but what is very clear to him is that ""in  Cuba there is no indication of massive and flagrant human rights  violations.""    That is obvious, insisted the ambassador, who believes that  the real source of this resolution is the hostile and aggressive  policy of U.S. Administrations against Cuba.    In this respect, Perez Novoa regretted that the new  administration still clings to such a position which has no  basis whatsoever.    That is why Cuba maintains its rightful position with  respect  to there being no reason for selective and discriminatory  treatment by this CDH, nothing to justify the existence of the  rapporteur or it being included as item 12 of the agenda.    Nothing of the sort -- he stated -- corresponds to the true  situation in Cuba or what its people are experiencing.    ""They simply cannot acknowledge that Cuba has been able to  accomplish a social, economic, and political program such as the  one it has despite hostilities from the United States,"" Perez  Novoa indicated.    When correlating Washington's position with respect to the  so-called Cold War, the ambassador indicated that while the new  administration calls for an end to the Cold War and to  confrontation in Palestine and South Africa, as well as in  relations between blocs, it continues and reinforces its policy  toward Cuba.    How can they explain to the world that they continue this  Cold War policy and harass our small country, the ambassador  asked, when Cuba does not constitute any danger whatsoever to  the United States. Today -- he indicated -- they cannot even  resort to the false but much used argument that we are ""a Soviet  base"" because the Soviet Union as such no longer exists.    Perez Novoa insisted that Cuba has historically maintained,  is, and will always be willing to discuss its differences with  the United States under an equal condition of sovereignty and  without any preconditions.    The ambassador asserted they are the ones who do not want  to accept and evade the responsibility of having normal  relations and discussing differences.    ""An example that obstinacy remains is this false and  manipulative human rights policy, and this is why they seek a  new resolution,"" he said.    Cuban Cooperation With the CDH    Jose Perez Novoa recounted what he called Cuba's broad,  frank, and transparent cooperation with the entire human rights  system and rapporteurs throughout the years.    In this regard, he described how, encouraged and subsidized  by the United States, the rapporteurs receive complaints, which  are sometimes presented without any evidence, legality, or  force. Nevertheless, he said, the rapporteurs received the  complaints and sent them to the government. The government, in  turn, answered them without any doubt or fear because we have  nothing to hide, he said.    On the contrary, the ambassador said, we feel proud of the  human rights situation prevailing in Cuba as few nations have  been able to accomplish what we have in this respect.    He added that cooperation is valid for all countries without  discrimination, selectivity, or political imposition. Perez  Novoa observed: Cuba is willing to cooperate, has done so, is  doing so, and will continue to do so.    On this subject, he mentioned the time in 1988 when Cuba  invited a CDH delegation for a visit. The CDH representatives  visited the island, met with all those they wanted to see and  made a report. The report was presented the following year and  discussed publicly with the media, nongovernment organizations,  and observer governments during three sessions.    Perez Novoa said the report was discussed as no other in the  CDH session and no evidence was found to justify that Cuba be  assigned a rapporteur.    What's more, he said, when the issue was taken to a vote,  they [the United States] lost. The ambassador then referred to  the phase after the debate, when Cuba negotiated its desire to  continue cooperative relations with the [UN] secretary general  with the Group of Latin American and Caribbean Countries  (Grulac) [Grupo de Paises Latinoamericanos y del Caribe] and the  EEC. [sentence as received]    Cuba, he said, was not included on the agenda, had not been  assigned a rapporteur as the United States lost that vote  (1989), and -- as was accepted by then UN Secretary General  Javier Perez de Cuellar -- the island maintained smooth and  transparent cooperative relations.    Not satisfied with the situation, Washington asked for a  report from the secretary general in 1990, who presented it and  had it analyzed.    The fact that Cuba had maintained permanent and stable  cooperation with the [UN] secretary general was obviously  established in the negotiations with Grulac and the EEC.    As it did not further [U.S.] propaganda goals to say Havana  had been registered as a human rights case because it was under  topic 12 or had a rapporteur, it took advantage of the changes  in the correlation of international forces. At the time, the  disintegration of the Socialist field had already begun. This  situation was used by the United States to impose an amendment  to the resolution presented by Grulac, which was signed by  approximately 20 representatives.    The only thing our people have always objected to in their  history and will continue to object to is when something is  imposed upon them, he asserted. Our people are open, warm,  affectionate, and compassionate, but we will never accept those  who try to impose their power upon us, the ambassador stressed.    Regarding the changes [in Cuba], as they are usually called,  they are the ones born from our own national identity, the ones  needed by our country and, based on this, the ones being  implemented because they are not meant to satisfy the world, he  said.    The diplomat was clear when he said: ""We will not turn our  backs on the world. We know there have been changes. However,  we also know we have to protect the great social, economic, and  political accomplishments of the revolution, which is the  essence of the Cuban program. [no ending quotation mark as  received]    To further this objective, he manifested, we are obliged to  make adjustments in the country -- including economic ones -- to  secure those achievements as much as possible. What we are not  ready to do, under any circumstances, pressure, or even under  the threat of weapons, is to surrender our independence and  sovereignty, he stressed.     "

With the latest agreements signed, these actions will increase  further, mainly in trade, cultural cooperation, and science and  technology.    Two recent examples are Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin's visit to the island and today's signing of documents  authorizing the recent resolutions of the mixed commission that  met in this capital last month to establish new cultural and  educational agreements.    In the first semester of 1994, a monumental effort by the  two  Latin American countries led to a decision to work together on a  number of projects in public health, cattle and farming, energy,  and cultural and educational exchanges.    Likewise, in the metallurgical, the iron and steel,  pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and construction materials  industries, common interests were found which could result in an  important increase in the total volume of bilateral trade.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Jesus Martinez Beaton, the  Cuban ambassador in Bogota, referred to current negotiations on  the eventual supplying of crude oil to the island, as well as to  increasing trade between the two countries.    Martinez said that following the agreement under which  Colombia would accept Cuban products in payment for a debt of  approximately $40 million, a list of products was exchanged upon  which broader future trade relations could be based.    Martinez said the possible sale of Colombian hydrocarbons to  Cuba is being studied, as are methods of payment, shipment, and  other issues common to trade negotiations. This was confirmed  by Foreign Minister Sanin upon her arrival in Havana.    The ambassador was optimistic about advances in Colombian  and  Cuban trade relations and emphasized visits to Cuba in recent  months by the South American nation's ministers of mines and  energy, health, and agriculture, the result of which was the  signing of trade agreements in each area.    In the case of Agriculture Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo, it  was revealed recently that during his stay in Havana an  agreement was reached on joint ventures in fishing,  phytosanitation norms, biological control of plagues, and the  marketing of veterinary and farming products.    Another result of the conversations held by Ocampo was the  decision by a delegation of Colombian sugar cane and coffee  growers associations to visit Cuba in June to discuss joint  ventures with their Cuban counterparts.    Ambassador Martinez said that this month a large delegation  of Colombian investors will visit Cuba for a first-hand study of  areas for possible joint ventures with the Caribbean state.     "

0,FT944-13871 ,"FT944-13871 _AN-EJZDWABDFT 941026   FT  26 OCT 94 / Sanctions prove a thorny issue in US-Cuba talks      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   Punitive sanctions slapped on Cuba by Washington in August have emerged as a point of contention in US-Cuban talks which opened in Havana on Monday. The talks, which end today, are intended to review a 45-day-old bilateral immigration accord under which the US agreed to increase the number of US entry visas granted to Cubans each year to a minimum of 20,000. This is to be done through accelerated visa processing, expanded criteria for refugee status and a visa lottery to begin November 1. Mr Dennis Hays, the US delegation leader, said restrictions on flights and dollar cash remittances to Cuba announced by President Clinton on August 20 were not part of the immigration issue. 'They will not be dealt with at this time,' he said. Cuba took the opposite tack arguing that the August package of sanctions contravened the spirit of the bilateral immigration accord signed on September 9 in New York. The US sanctions 'have as much to do with the accord and immigration as the air that we breathe,' said Mr Ricardo Alarcon, Cuba's chief negotiator. 'If you want normal, orderly immigration, you should not create obstacles to it,' said Mr Alarcon, president of Cuba's national assembly. Havana had hoped the immigration accord might lead to a wider dialogue on ways of solving the US-Cuban conflict. Mr Clinton introduced the latest sanctions against Cuba in August after Cuba's President, Mr Fidel Castro, temporarily lifted restrictions on Cubans fleeing illegally in boats and flimsy rafts to the US. Some 32,000 refugees, barred access to the US in a sudden change of policy by Washington, were sent to US bases in Guantanamo Bay in eastern Cuba and in Panama.

""Economic efficiency is the solution to many of the Cuban  problems that stand in the way of attaining a stable future and  a more rapid way out of the island's difficult financial  situation,"" Ross, also a member of the Communist Party of Cuba's  Politburo, said.    Cuba is experiencing a serious economic situation, the most  serious since 1959, due to the dismemberment of the Soviet Union  and the Eastern European bloc. In addition, Cuba's standard of  living has declined due to shortages ranging from fuel and  energy to food and consumption goods. Speaking to the morning  newspaper GRANMA, Ross reported on ideas and proposals that  arose from the so-called Workers Parliaments, which are being  held in almost 80,000 places of employment, on the country's  economic crisis and how to cope with it.    According to government sources, the results of these  meetings will be considered for a special session of the  National Assembly (Parliament), the date of which has not yet  been set, to discuss other economic reforms.    Ross confirmed both measures to improve efficiency in each  labor center and the general economy have been discussed during  these debates in plants and offices, debates which will end on  16 March.    He admitted, however, efficiency must be closely linked to  internal finances, on which a number of proposals, including  tightening control on the country's resources, were presented.    He also said the nearly 3.5 million workers repudiated  theft,  carelessness, dilapidation, illegal acquisitions of wealth, and  people who profit from the population's needs.    The government-run magazine BOHEMIA admitted recently the  underground economy, or black market, whose operations reached  incalculable levels last year, draws mainly from state supplies  and enterprises.    Although Ross also admitted the existence of contradicting  criteria on tax measures, he said there is a general consensus  on the need to protect essential services such as health,  education, and social security.    After reporting most of the workers regard it as necessary  to  eliminate certain free services and subsidize people rather than  products, Ross said the latter measure inflicts yearly losses  worth 4 billion pesos on the island economy. (The peso is  equivalent officially to the U.S. dollar, although on the black  market one dollar equals 100 pesos).    Ross mentioned certain probable measures that will be  established in the immediate future, such as higher prices on  nonessential articles, such as rum and cigars, but with  controlled distribution to try to counter a monopoly.    Criticizing strongly union leaders and workers, Ross said he  confirmed a general lack of information about how much the  country must pay to buy specific products abroad. People are  also unaware that the prices of certain products are still the  same as 20 or 30 years ago, when the cost of raw materials was  lower.    He said after concluding the Workers Parliaments, the  proposals will start to be debated in the country's 14 provinces  on Thursday and that on 29 March the CTC National Committee's  plenary will devote its session to a debate on this subject.    The probable measures to be debated in the National  Assembly's special session include cutting state subsidies,  reducing the labor force, and introducing an income tax system.     "

The agreement, which could pave the way for a slow improvement in broader US-Cuban relations, was agreed after over a week of meetings between the two sides in New York. It was welcomed by President Bill Clinton as a measure that 'will help ensure that the massive flow of dangerous and illegal immigration will be replaced by a safer, legal and more orderly process'. The US has agreed to admit at least 20,000 Cubans this year, in line with the existing US immigration quota, and could grant visas to another additional 6,000 Cubans currently on the waiting list. Although fewer than 4,000 Cubans have entered the US through legal channels in the past year, the immigration and naturalisation services set aside 27,835 visas for Cubans every year. Cuba is understood to have promised to curb the exodus of refugees. This would involve restoring the border patrols which prevent people from attempting to leave by boat. The Castro government encouraged the migration by allowing border guards to look the other way as rafts left Cuban shores. Cuba was understood to have sought a commitment from the US side to future talks on broader issues of the US-Cuba relationship, in particular the 32-year US trade embargo. Before this week's meetings with Cuba, the Clinton administration insisted that it would not discuss anything other than migration issues even if the Cuban side raised broader questions. However, evidence that the two countries can co-operate will have strengthened the hands of those within the administration who wish to open comprehensive talks with Havana. More than 32,000 people have fled Cuba over the past month. Most are being held at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a detention centre opened earlier this week in Panama. The agreement did not include any provisions to allow them into the US and the Clinton administration was not expected to reverse its decision to interdict and detain rafters. The US is likely to encourage detainees to return to Cuba to proceed with legal immi-gration. Cubans bullish over UK delegation's visit, Page 3   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

The Cuban airline intends to gradually replace these Russian  airplanes by others which are more economic and more comfortable  for passengers. These are Netherlands-made planes and their  brand name is Fokker F-27-600. They are easily convertible from  passenger to cargo planes.    Aviaco and Iberia cover all Spanish national routes.     "

[Begin recording] [Sanin] Since the reestablishment of  relations, we have sought to obtain in-depth knowledge of our  mutual circumstances. Therefore, we are going to address  bilateral topics, exchange opinions and information on our  respective countries, and review the bilateral agenda on  commercial, cultural, and educational topics. There might also  be an opportunity to talk with important Cuban personalities. I  want to obtain in-depth knowledge of the reforms undertaken by  Cuba in economic and political areas, because we all have great  hopes that current problems will be overcome and there will be a  greater opening at different levels as a result of Cuba's  achievements and the reforms that have begun, based on Cuba's  self-determination.    [Unidentified reporter] What are the most immediate trade  prospects between the two countries?    [Sanin] Well, our overall trade amounts to $12 million.  There are great opportunities. Colombian businessmen will be  paying a visit. I am interested in speaking with the Cuban  authorities about some points which are important to promoting  greater Colombian investment in Cuba and improving trade. This  brings development and opportunities. Many of our products can  have a market here and many of your products can have a market  in Colombia. I think we have to review certain conditions, such  as the possibility of signing an agreement on investment  protection. I also want to review with the Cuban authorities  the possibilities for foreign investments.    [Reporter] Does Colombia uphold its decision to sell  petroleum to Cuba?    [Sanin] Colombia will sell petroleum to Cuba without any  problem as long as Cuba can pay within the terms and conditions  Colombia establishes for the sale of oil. If you can accept the  Colombian terms, we see no problem in selling it. The letter of  credit and the terms are being discussed.    [Reporter] In your view, are relations with Cuba going well?    [Sanin] They are going well because they are developing with  mutual respect for domestic affairs and with a great sense of  cooperation and understanding. There is interest in all sectors  of the two countries.    [Reporter] How much petroleum is being negotiated?    [Sanin] I do not have that exact information because the  quantity would be established based on the terms and conditions.    [Reporter] What priorities or topics does Colombia, as  host, have for the fourth [Ibero-American] summit?    [Sanin] Economic topics as a basis for political reforms and  their sustainability, because economic and political reforms  cannot be carried out without emphasizing social aspects. In  addition to the extreme poverty of a large part of our  population, Latin America's great problem is the inequalities in  our societies. We are going to review the opportunities that  integration provides for economic development and prosperity for  our peoples, but always based on in-depth social reforms.    [Reporter] Will your visit lead to a possible visit by  President Gaviria before (?the end of his presidential term)?    [Sanin] It is not scheduled. The president's agenda is  already quite heavy. We had not [words indistinct] but in any  case we will hold the Ibero-American summit in Cartagena and we  will receive President Fidel Castro on 14 and 15 (?July).    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] expect an agreement?    [Sanin] The transaction is being carried out like two normal  countries. There is talk of prices, duration, and guarantees.  The duration is being discussed. You are asking for a longer  duration than what Colombia is willing to offer and you are  offering a guarantee different from the one we are accustomed to  receiving. Nevertheless, it is a normal discussion in commercial  terms. We want it to be a normal commercial operation and we  are discussing it. Therefore, if we reach agreement, there is a  sale, and if not, it will be like so many other commercial  operations that are not carried through. It would not mean  [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Passage indistinct]    [Sanin] That is what we want, that it be a step in the  strengthening of relations, a sign of cooperation and mutual  respect, and of my country's desire to learn up close about the  reforms under way in Cuba. Everyone knows that Cuba is  experiencing various difficulties, but we are very hopeful about  the political resolve and President Fidel Castro's statements  yesterday about this being the beginning and that you are  willing to establish [words indistinct] reforms to resolve the  island's problems. We have great hope that these measures will  be effective. We respect that the reforms will stem from Cuba's  self-determination and we hope that the political resolve that  has been expressed will be clear and real. We all want the  Cuban people to be prosperous, enjoy well-being, and be able to  maintain the reforms the country has achieved in social aspects  such as education, health, and other fields. [end recording]    The program for the Colombian foreign minister's 24-hour  visit to Cuba includes meetings with Carlos Lage, vice president  of the Councils of State and Ministers, and a working luncheon  with Army General Raul Castro. In addition, she will visit the  National Library and the Casa de las Americas to deliver  donations of books and crafts. Along with the Cuban foreign  minister, she will confirm the work program of the joint  intergovernmental commission that was recently created and will  sign an educational agreement. Before leaving Cuba, Mrs. Sanin  de Rubio will hold a news conference.     "

How To View the Current Russian Economy    [Nukazawa] The Keidanren's Japan-Russia Economic Committee  and the Russia-Japan Economic Committee, which centers on the  Russian Industrialists and Enterpreneurs Federation, held their  first joint conference in Moscow for four days beginning 2 June  1993, and discussed a variety of problems based on the present  new situation. The Japan committee also made efforts to grasp  the realities of Russia's economy and civilian life through  visits to plants and a tour of the city of St. Petersburg. These  activities were very helpful in increasing mutual understanding  between the two nations, and progress was made concerning a  number of problems.    Opinions about Russia's present economic conditions were  sharply divided between those who perceive an underlying  strength and those who see utter confusion. What are your  opinions?    [Yamashita] Russia's economy is said to be gigantic and  similar to an elephant. It is not a healthy elephant, but an  ailing elephant. We are small and have absolutely no idea why it  is flailing its trunk, or in which direction it is walking.  Although we attempt to view the present condition of the  elephant itself, it is extremely difficult to get an overall  view.    At present, the Yeltsin administration seems likely to  endure  for a while longer. Judging from the national referendum held in  April, we can perhaps conclude that he still holds the reins of  power. Conversely, we cannot debate anything unless we establish  such a premise.    The Russian People Are Beginning To Enjoy Freedom    [Kawake] I believe it is realistic to say that present-day  Russia is difficult to understand. However, I received the  impression that, still, Russia is moving in a forward direction  in its own way. The strongest indication is the bright look on  the faces of the people we saw in walking through the streets  and in the department stores. The young girls wear miniskirts  and look stylish, which seems somehow to be a change.    I believe that they have begun to enjoy ""freedom."" Despite  the high prices of goods, with the money they earn, they can buy  anything without forming queues. This is natural for us, but it  is a great change for them. Their previous custom of buying food  and clothing at the state stores was similar to our distribution  of rationed goods during the war. Today, however, buying goods  at the GUM stores means shopping at one's option despite the  high prices.    I do not think that the ""freedom"" experienced by the people  can be easily taken away.    [Rokugawa] I also felt a brightness in their future. We  stayed in Moscow for a week before the conference, and later for  about a week in Vladivostok. It was the season of new greenness,  and the looks on the faces of the people walking by were  etremely cheerful. We met many corporate leaders who were really  gungho. They were full of ideas and eager to test them, saying  that they would like to trade and cooperate with us in joint  ventures.    After returning to Japan, I talked with Director Hisao  Kanamori of the Russia-East Europe Economic Research Institute.  He said that Russia's economy has declined compared to the same  period a year earlier, but it has improved when the  January-April period of this year is compared with the same  period last year, for example, and it made me feel optimistic.  Japan-Russia trade also has shown some definite signs of  monetary improvement during January-April.    Russia's Present ""Dual Economy""    [Aiko] From a macro viewpoint, after World War II, India,  the  USSR, and China--socialist nations that were under planned  economic management, that is, three regions with the world's  largest populations--were shut inside the socialist freezer. The  ""energy"" was released with the collapse of the system, and the  planned economy shifted to a market economy. As to which of the  three will get on track first, it is China. Next is India, and I  believe that today's Russia will require some time. I believe  that, in the future, every phenomenon of 21st century politics  and economics will result in an upheaval due to the ""energy""  released in the three regions, and will be prescribed by it.    The present state of Russia's economy seems to be a dual  economy in which coexist an economy of the heavy industrial  sector, which has been encumbered by the shadow of the state-run  corporation, and a real economy, similar to the black market  economy in Japan immediately after the war. In looking at the  sector centered on the heavy industrial state-run corporation,  we become extremely pessimistic, but the real economy at the  grassroots is considerably more sound. I feel that the views  differ according to where the focus is placed. I received the  impression that confusion arises when observing Russia's  economy, due to the problem of where to focus one's sight.    [Nukazawa] What are your views on the observation that,  despite the privatization of the state-run corporations, it will  result in monopolies that deny the advantages of competition?    [Kawake] In a careful consideration of the nation called  Russia, companies in the real sense apparently did not exist  during the more than 200 years that include the tsarist era, and  I believe that a major problem lies in how Russia without such  experience should learn about the market economy. It is true  that, despite privatization of the state-run corporation, only a  monopolistic corporation will result. I believe that it is the  responsibility of Japan and other nations to advise them on how  to go about it and to think for them, which is more important  than capital assistance.    Regarding the formation of a framework, Japan and Germany  have a variety of experiences. Both have lost in war,  experienced inflation, and privatized state-run enterprises. I  believe that, as Russia's neighbor, Japan should provide such  assistance.    Japan's Experiences Effective for Russia    [Nukazawa] I heard recently in Moscow that, among the 49  foreign advisers in the Russian Government, 48 were advisers  sent by the United States. However, in the case of the United  States, its experience in promoting the economy happened a long,  long time ago, and I believe that it is more useful to tell them  about Japan's experiences. It is important to send advisers from  Japan.    [Aiko] I believe that there are two major problems  concerning  the current reforms.    First, the effect of the same prescription is totally the  reverse, depending on when there is surplus supply capacity and  when there is a shortage. You say that virtually all of the  advisers are Americans, but the Americans have never experienced  an absolute shortage of supply capacity. Looking at Russia's  recent circumstances, it appears that they are trying to apply  the common sense of a nation with surplus supply to a nation  with a shortage of supply.    Regardless of price liberalization, there is no way for it  to  become an incentive for a rise in supply. If prices are  liberalized when there is an absolute supply shortage, goods  will sell regardless of how high the prices, so the prices will  merely climb without a rise in supply. Therefore, under such  circumstances, I believe that it is necessary to retain the  supply or control system to some extent, and to gradually  liberalize in accordance with an upgrading of the supply system.    Second, the previous system concentrated outstanding people  of talent in the Communist Party and formed a bureaucracy. In  one aspect, due to a personnel shortage, ignoring these people  and attempting to press for reforms will not work smoothly. In  fact, they must be asked to work together to achieve reform. In  Japan during the Meiji Restoration, the detectives and officials  of the Tokugawa shogunate were used adeptly for continuity.  During the last war also, in the process of discarding control,  the prewar government organization was used intact. Russia has  had a world-class bureaucratic system, and I believe that it  should consider pushing for reforms by cleverly using it with  its cooperation.    Regarding these two points, we could probably provide unique  advice by utilizing Japan's experience.    [Yamashita] If we narrow down the areas in concrete terms,  Russia has state-designated industrial product standards called  GOST [All-Union State Standard], which is like the JIS [Japan  Industrial Standards]. This is a huge organization that has more  than 50,000 members in the capital area and about 38,000 members  in the outlying regions. However, despite the large number of  members, application of the standards is quite lagging, and  Russia's standards have been omitted from the joint standards of  the ISO [International Standards Organization] which was started  by Europe. If it is unable to win ISO approval, as a practical  problem, Russian products, except military weapons, will no  longer be exportable to Europe. Therefore, if it adopts a joint  approach with Japan, which is slow to conform to ISO standards,  it will probably be able to win approval.    As this example illustrates, I believe that it is more  useful  to exchange advice on a specific theme.    [Nukazawa] However, perhaps because it has been exposed to  the view from Europe and the United States that ""Japan has not  really become a market economy, and therefore it is not  advisable to learn from Japan,"" there was an atmosphere of an  element of caution against learning from Japan, was there not?    [Kawake] Conversely, there was a view that, for Russia's  sake, it is easier to accept the Japan-style economy than the  U.S.-style, and that it would serve as a reference. The problem  of privatization of the national railways is one not found in  the United States, nor is inflation in the United States so  conspicuous. I believe that Japan will of greater reference in  various ways.    II. What Will Become of Russia's Economic Reconstruction?    [Nukazawa] In any case, inflation is quite serious. Today,  the dollar has risen much higher than 1,000 rubles, and it is  apparently rumored in Moscow that it may go as high as 3,000  rubles between this fall and the yearend.    The price of coal, which was deregulated on 1 July,  instantly  doubled, and is expected to rise six- to eightfold in the near  future. Incidentally, the coal miner's monthly wage will rise to  about 400,000 rubles or 10 times the general wage. With the  price of coal climbing, the prices of steel and other principal  raw materials will rise drastically. In terms of dollar prices,  they will surpass international prices. Therefore, if we  calculate in reverse to correspond with the international  prices, the ruble will drop considerably. Because the central  bank is granting state subsidies rampantly, inflation is fed  constantly. If this continues, one cannot afford to conduct  business selling rubles in Moscow. I feel that, before talking  about a market economy, there is a need to expel inflation.    [Nukazawa] When I hear about coal, steel, and subsidies, I  am  reminded of the postwar declining industries.    After the war, Japan restricted foreign exchange  transactions  and accumulated foreign currency. However, present-day Russia  has adopted no measures regarding foreign currency and its  capital is constantly flowing out. For example, there is  reportedly $400 billion worth of dollar deposits in New York  banks. Is it not rather strange that it wants to borrow money  from foreign countries while leaving that money there?    [Rokugawa] Actually, the Russian authorities themselves are  unable to control and regulate the foreign deposits of residents  in Russia. In Japan also, there are requests received by the  Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan [Zenginkyo] not to  accept such deposits. Based on this, Zenginkyo reportedly has  sent written requests to its subsidiaries not to accept the  establishing of accounts with such mysterious Russian funds.    [Nukazawa] In Japan since the war, the government has  strictly supervised the recovery of export payments through the  standard settlement system, checking how, when, and how much  payment is made during export, and where it is destined.  However, Russia is unable to do this.    [Aiko] They cannot do it unless they regulate by linking the  outflow of goods and the flow of funds. The transactions are  based on formal contracts, and they will be able to regulate to  some extent if they check the method of payment at the time of  the contract, and if a bureaucratic system functions to enable  the bank to back the entire payment. However, under the present  circumstances, they are unable to do so.    Recovery of Ruble's External Convertibility Still in Future    [Rokugawa] In the case of exports to Russia, we dare not  export without prepayment or a form of barter, but bartering is  banned in Japan. Therefore, it is conducted under a quasi-barter  form of advance export by the Russian side.    From the standpoint of the ruble's convertibility, both  Russia and East Europe are confusing the convertibility of the  nonresident account with the resident account. Japan and the  West European nations have assiduously worked to promote exports  after the war, thereby accumulating foreign currency, and have  not recognized foreign currency holdings by the residents. They  also took considerable time to liberalize overseas travel. Once  a sufficient amount of foreign currency was accumulated, they  first restored the convertibility of accounts for nonresidents  and eventually the accounts for residents.    On the other hand, Russia left it up to the desires of the  masses. It did not adopt a policy of concentrating foreign  currency, but first recognized foreign currency holdings by the  residents. Despite the external nonconvertibility of their  currency, they restored domestic convertibility between  residents within Russia. Consequently, their hard-earned foreign  currency flowed outside, with the volume reportedly totaling $16  billion or even $20 billion.    Therefore, I believe that it should induct comprehensieve  foreign exchange management, concentrate the foreign currency  holdings of the residents in the central bank, and then  liberalize. It is surprising that the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund have completely overlooked guidance  in these respects concerning foreign exchange policy. Therefore,  restoration of the external convertibility of the ruble is still  far in the future.    [Kawake] The present cabinet is implementing to a  considerable degree two policies that could not be implemented  during the leadership of former Premier Kaidar--i.e.  tranquilizing the hyperinflation and controlling the central  bank. By beginning to cope seriously with these aspects, Russia  is seen as finally lining up on the starting line. Certainly,  its energy is extremely cheap by international standards.  Therefore, if Russia itself upgrades its system to cope with the  extremely difficult task of curbing inflation while raising the  prices of its energy, I believe it will be important, first of  all, for everyone to give support and offer advice.    Black Markets, But No Corporations    [Nukazawa] Here and there on the street corners in Moscow  are  seen foreign exchange trucks which are remodeled buses. The  people all exchange rubles for marks, francs, and dollars, and  they deposit the foreign currencies. It is regrettable when the  people have a low regard for the currency of their own country.  The foreign exchange brokers, like the postwar black market  operators (in Japan), reportedly buy and accumulate coupons  which they trade for stock shares to be issued when the national  enterprises are privatized. Can sound privatization be realized  under such conditions?    In postwar Japan black marketeers were rampant, but the  established enterprises also remained. In today's Russia, there  are black markets but no corporate enterprises. How the other  advanced nations will support them in this respect is important.    If Russia's market economization makes progress, there may  be  a stage when further privatization of the national enterprises  will be attempted. At this stage, however, like postwar Japan  and Europe, or like the United States following the Great  Depression, it should aim for economic reconstruction with the  public sector as the business core.    Regarding the mode of management, it could probably bring in  enterpreneurs from Japan and the United States, and let them  take over management temporarily.    Outlook of Japan-Russia Economic Relations    [Nukazawa] Regarding Japan-Russia economic relations, unpaid  trade payments and the freezing of foreign investment accounts  are two problems that weigh heavily and became the focus of  attention at the recent conference.    [Yamashita] The Russian side said that they will be reviewed  by a committee chaired by Deputy Chairman Shokhin. Although they  say that it will suffice to pay foreign debts with $150 billion  worth of foreign currency credits, it is rather difficult for  the money to be returned when the debtors are nations like Cuba,  Vietnam, and Angola. It is a hopeless situation to be told all  of a sudden that ""your debtor is Cuba,"" or ""your debtor is  Angola.""    [Kawake] We would hope that the Shokhin committee will  carefully review the method of solving the problem of unpaid  foreign currency. However, I do not think the Japanese could go  in to participate in the discussion and suggest ways to go about  it. The position of the Japan side of the committee is to urge  and remind, but not to formulate concrete plans.    [Nukazawa] Regarding the clarification of authority and the  transfer of authority to the regions, which were mentioned  during the era of the Japan-Soviet economic committee, did you  feel that there has been some progress?    Until now, progress was made when the talks were held in  Moscow, but recently nothing could be achieved in Moscow alone.  As to whom the talks should be held with, it is the respective  enterprises or the local governments. However, they have no  legal backing. In effect, they have no authority.    In other words, adequate talks cannot be held in Moscow and,  although concrete talks can be held at the regional level, they  have no authority. Therefore, I believe that the direction of  the debate by the present constitutional council is extremely  important. If the constitution works out smoothly, not only will  the president's authority be enhanced to some extent, but the  regional authority will also be clarified. I believe it is  important for them to first form the framework.    [Aiko] A major problem is that it is not clear who the  competent persons in charge are. Regarding the 200 or 300  presidential decrees also, it is not stipulated at all who the  implementers are, or whether there are any punitive measures,  and we have heard that no one bothers to obey the presidential  decrees.    [Nukazawa] To begin with, there is apparently no concept  that  the infrastructure is the government's responsibility. Perhaps  they think that everything can be done by the stock company.  They must clarify the infrastructure of the public sector as  being responsible, because the basic role of the public sector  is based on social capital. They are mistaken in thinking that  such-and-such a port or harbor is the responsibility of  such-and-such a company.    [Kawake] For example, when considering joint ventures, if  the  company is asked to build not only a pulp plant but also roads  and a port, it will not be done.    [Nukazawa] There is a similar problem with respect to  Vietnam. If we say we cannot invest because there is no  infrastructure, they say: ""Well, Japan can build an  infrastructure for us also.""    [Yamashita] At least it is inconceivable for a private  company in Japan to provide such assistance. Unless there is  clearly an economic profit on this side, a private company  cannot do it. As you know, the time span is sometimes long and  sometimes short, and it cannot be done unless there is an  overall plus for the company.    Japan Must Work for Far East Development    [Nukazawa] It depends on the direction of the constitution,  but if a certain degree of authority is transferred to the  regions and autonomy is increased, there will probably be a  arising mood in Japan to work for resources development in the  Far East.    [Kawake] Regions with expansive resources that can be  reached  by aircraft concentrate on the regions eastward from Siberia and  Irkutsk, and east of the Ural region. The Western nations are  making rapid inroads into western Russia, and entry by Japan  will not make a conspicuous mark.    [Aiko] It is something else if there is no potential in the  Far East, but there is a potential there in its own right. If  Russia does nothing and lets the status quo stand, I feel that  Russia's Far East region will become a center of competition  between China and Korea. If Russia itself has a certain amount  of strategy policywise for economic development, there is a  possibility that more Russians will be transplanted there. Thus,  for example, Russians who find life unbearable in Central Asia  and the Baltic countries will be given opportunities for  employment, and I believe it will be very good politically.    [Rokugawa] Japan's support should be a more visible form of  support rather than through the G-7 or IMF. Particularly  regarding the Far East region, ports and harbors come first.  Among those related to the development of the Tumen River in  East Asia, if we make efforts to improve the port facilities in  such places as Sarbino [as translitered], Vanino, and Sovetskaya  Gavan, they will stand out. Or, in view of the deterioration of  the Siberian Railway, I believe there are many things we can do,  such as improving the infrastructure of railway transportation.  Or, since it is a cold region, if we construct something like  the Tokyo Dome with a wholesale market, a supermarket and an  amusement center inside, it would probably be greatly  appreciated.    [Yamashita] Without transportation, construction requiring a  huge volume of materials would not be feasible in European  Russia. In that case, products that use less materials and are  easily transportable must be produced in European Russia. In  that sense, the upgrading of transport routes is urgently needed.    [Nukazawa] If the Far East builds a solid position as a  resource supply source for Japan, it will be very good for  Japan's security.    A Realistic Investment Plan    [Kawake] After all, Japan itself should set priorities  regarding investment, trade and various development plans.  Russia is asking for projects worh tens of billions of yen. It  would be more realistic to take an approach toward small-scale  and really necessary projects, or to figure out how the present  facilities can be remodeled.    [Rokugawa] When we received a request for a survey on the  conversion of the Bulgarian military facilities to civilian use,  we asked Juki Corporation, the sewing machine maker which has  experience in this aspect, to conduct a review of various local  surveys, we found, for instance, that it is technically feasible  to produce 100,000 pieces of machines and equipment annually.  However, they say that they can sell 10,000 pieces, leaving  90,000 pieces which they want us to sell overseas. However, we  do not have the confidence to sell 90,000 pieces outside of  Bulgaria. Stymied by this, the idea was dropped. It is quite a  task when production is not possible without our thinking about  marketing and sales for them.    Therefore, regarding conversion of military facilities to  civilian use, they should not talk about such large-scale  projects as artificial satellites, but utilize the munitions  plants in the environs of Khabarovsk. For example, their casting  technology is reputed to be extremely good, so if Japan consigns  production of mechanical equipment and parts like flanges and  buys up the entire volume, or initially has them produce simple  communications facilities on a small scale, or seeks cooperation  on conversion of simple military facilities to civilian use, I  believe Russia will appreciate it. Conversion of high-level  military facilities on a grand scale is too costly and extremely  difficult to materialize, and it is clear from the standpoint of  productivity and cost that their products cannot possibly  compete with the products of Europe and the United States.    [Kawake] I believe that, in terms of the present relations  with Russia, it is important to understand the present  conditions. We must go over there to conduct fact-finding  surveys in order to formulate some kind of concrete plan.  Further feasibility studies are also a prerequisite.    [Rokugawa] When we went to a munitions plant in the  Vladivostok suburbs where they are working on general  telecommunications called ""Radio Pribor"" [phonetic], we were  told that we were the 98th company from Japan. It indicates how  many companies in Japan are conducting studies. They probably  all investigated and found it difficult to handle, so they gave  up.    [Nukazawa] Russia has broad territorial lands and is rich in  rsources, so the potentials are great. However, it is deterred  by its legacies from the past, so it is probably necessary for  us to advise them and make smooth circulation possible. However,  it is difficult to know where to begin.    Image of Russia as a Great Power Must Be Dropped    [Yamashita] The problem is that the Russian side is not very  receptive to advice. They probably believe that they are smart  enough. In any case, all they want from Japan now is money.    [Aiko] When we listen to people in charge of projects for  overseas advancement, I believe the greatest point in a minus  sense is pride. Where pride exists, the situation is difficult.  Once that pride is put aside, the rest seems to go smoothly. In  a region which has previously produced TV sets, there is a fixed  concept of TV production and, if we try to introduce a  completely different method, there is terrific resistance.  However, in a region where they produce nothing except farm  products, there is no resistance, but a receptive attitude  toward new technology as is. In that sense, because Russia has a  high-tech industry in its own right and also a high level of  technical education, it is probably difficult for them to ask  for advice.    [Rokugawa] As a historical and diplomatic power, Russia has  looked down on Japan for a long time and, unless such power  consciousness is dropped, I do not believe that they can humble  themselves and ask for advice.    [Kawake] The Russian side approaches us by asking whether we  have an interest in their project. They do not say what they  would like to do, but what they want us to do. Because they  demand what our interests are, it is difficult for us to reply.    [Nukazawa] Even when we go to East Europe and Vietnam, they  say that many people come from Japan to see, but the talks are  not fruitful at all. Do you mean that the reason is on the other  side?    [Rokugawa] The Japanese side is very cautious, as you know.  We take pains to check before we invest.    [Kawake] The Americans often tell us that the Japanese are  not very decisive. However, once we decide, we follow through.  According to the Russians, the Americans invest very quickly,  but they also pull out quickly. Therefore, each side has its  merits and shortcomings.    [Yamashita] From Russia's viewpoint, they receive numerous  inquiries from America.    [Nukazawa] That point is important. Unless they understand  the difference, they get the impression that we go over merely  to browse and do not buy anything.    Take Time and Start From the Feasible Aspects    [Kawake] Judging from my experience of having been interned  in Sakhalin, the Soviet system is bad, but the Russians people  are extremely nice, once you get to know them. Therefore, I  believe that it is vital to build human relations. However, the  remaining vestiges of the old system obstruct the forming of  human relations.    [Rokugawa] It will be better appreciated by the other side  if  we help them when they need it. After all, Japan has the most in  terms of personnel, money, goods and technology. I feel that, at  this stage, it will be more profitable for Japan's future if we  start by giving support and adopt the posture of solving various  issues including the problem of the Northern Territories.    [Yamashita] In such a case, based on Japan's present  situation, information on problems of the Far East region is  received relatively easily. Therefore, it is more practical to  begin with the solution of such issues, and it will probably be  more effective vis-a-vis the people of the region also. It is  with such an intent that we are offering railway passenger cars  for use in Sakhalin.    [Rokugawa] Also, it is a problem when they rampantly throw  nuclear wastes and bombshells into the Japan Sea. There should  be some change in order to eradicate such actions.    [Kawake] There are definitely problems in Japan-Russia  relations. In any case, it is a nation that can be reached by  plane in just over an hour, so I believe that, basically,  emphasis should be placed on our relations with them. At the  same time, it is of course important to take time and to start  with projects which are feasible.    [Aiko] Apart from economics and politics, Russia is a very  nice country.    [Nukazawa] Certainly, it is a wonderful country in terms of  its literature, music, ballet and sports. Also, the individual  Russian is a warm person with humane touches. Thank you all very  much.

Resillez begins the program by noting that many Cubans  believe that the only thing discussed by the UN Human Rights  Commission is the so-called Cuban case. He goes on to point out  that the Human Rights Commission discusses other things related  to political and social issues, such as child pornography,  trafficking of children, etc.    In that sense, Caballero says: ""I am very happy that this  has  been brought up in this program for our viewers -- the work  carried out by the Human Rights Commission. I myself have  sometimes had the perception that the Human Rights Commission is  related to the Cuban case only, when that is only a small part  of the work that our delegation does in Geneva.""    In reviewing some of the issues discussed at the Human  Rights  Commission, Mora says: ""Cuba is not sitting on the stand as a  defendant regarding Human Rights. When we talk about human  rights we must talk about human rights violations that are  taking place around the world."" Mora goes on to say: ""Small  countries, like Cuba, are developing different initiatives in  defense of the interests of the World, the Third World,  defending the interests of the greater populations of the Third  World. Cuba has been making headway in this area every year. As  a matter of fact, Cuba has received the recognition from the  Third World for the sacrifices that Cuba has to face.""    Answering Resillez's question on how many propositions and  resolutions Cuba participated in during the 50th session, Mora  notes: ""Cuba was the delegation that presented the largest  number of initiatives at the 50th session. They totaled 10, six  of which were discarded despite the large support by the Third  World. Some were even adopted by consensus, such as the issue on  the environment, which is an issue of great concern among many  countries of the North as well as of the South. Cuba sponsored  amendments to approximately 20 resolutions, and cosponsored  another 25 resolutions.""    Mora goes on to say: ""We are talking about space gained by  Cuba on the international scene, which represents a great deal  of respect in the international arena.""    Resillez asks about the vote on the special rapporteur for  Cuba to which Caballero responds: ""Something important happened  at the session. The fact is that the United States, despite all  its capacity to apply pressure and being the power that leads  the unipolar world, lost three votes in favor while the number  of abstentions rose from 15 to 20. In UN terms, this sends a  message. This means that this year, the majority of the  commission of 53 members was not dragged by the United States  into this vendetta against Cuba. If we add the abstentions, of  which there were 20, with the votes in favor of Cuba, in this  case against the resolution, which totaled nine, this means that  29 countries, more than half, pronounced themselves against it.  I believe this is significant because the United States reached  the highest point it could reach on the manipulation of the  issue against Cuba, and now the retreat has begun. That is the  best reading or analysis.""    Resillez asks about reaction from other delegations to the  secret U.S. Interest Section document. On this topic, Mora  responds: ""I believe this document favored the vote. In other  words, it was an element that supported something we had been  saying for several years, which is also recognized by the great  majority of the members of the United Nations. The document  caused a great deal of bewilderment among the U.S. delegation.  It was a scandal where they had been caught red-handed in their  action of condemning alleged human rights violations in Cuba,  when it was demonstrated through the document that it was all a  great lie.""    In that sense, Mora goes on to say that the document was  important because it characterized those people and groups in  the United States who are interested in subordinating the  revolution to the will of the empire.    Regarding the special rapporteur Caballero says: ""The Cuban  people should not feel complexes or be worried about the fact  that there is a special rapporteur or that the Cuban case is on  the agenda of the Human Rights Commission."" He goes on to say:  ""The international community, including countries allied with  the United States, understand that in Cuba there is no  systematic violation or problem with human rights. That is well  understood by the international community. Sometimes -- Ivan has  seen this -- after voting against us many of these delegates  approach us to excuse themselves and to say that they are sorry  that they voted that way, but that they had been forced to do  so. In other words, there is an understanding on the  international arena that we do not have this type of problem in  Cuba.""    Caballero adds: ""The most important thing is that just a few  days ago, in New York, the Latin American group endorsed Cuba's  reelection to the Human Rights Commission.""    Answering Resillez's question on the group of Nobel Prize  Winners who will visit Cuba, Mora remarks: ""The Foreign Ministry  is studying the composition of the group that will visit us. We  reject the imposition of the special rapporteur since it was  done violating all the procedures established by the United  Nations, but at the same time we have absolutely nothing to  hide. That is why we want international personalities, Nobel  Prize winners, to see what our actual situation is. It will be a  good opportunity for them to see the effects of the U.S.  blockade against Cuba.""     "

The visit's objective is to become familiar with the  situation prevailing in the island, in all sectors.    Martinez justified the presence of Castillo Velasco and  Bustos in the delegation:    [Begin Martinez recording] We deemed it appropriate for this  type of delegation to include a former DC president like Jaime  Castillo, whose opinion has been heard on topics dealing with  doctrine and democracy and who also has international  experience. In the case of Manuel Bustos, he is our party's top  labor leader. We believe the DC lives not only in the political  but also in the labor arena. [end recording]    Martinez ruled out that the visit will be sort of an advance  step by the government coalition with a view toward the possible  reestablishment of diplomatic relations. He admitted however,  that the issue, which -- as he put it -- has many sides, is  being analyzed by the government and the DC.    On the other hand, Gutenberg Martinez said Cuba has placed  no  restrictions on the delegation's visit. Cuban General Consul in  Chile Humberto Hernandez made a similar statement:    [Begin Hernandez recording] They will make good contacts  with  (?social sectors), Cuban authorities, and party and government  officials. They will see the actual situation in Cuba and they  will form their own opinion. [end recording]    Asked whether the delegation will be able to visit  everything, even jails, the consul said specific conversations  should be made about the subject in Cuba.    Asked about the presence of Fidel Castro and the holding of  democratic elections, Hernandez replied that there is democracy  in Cuba, although with imperfections.     "

Cuba wants to boost the so-called smokeless industry and  plans to attract 1 million visitors in 1995.    The names of new Cuban tourism businesses were presented  only  a week ago at Varadero.

The objective of their visit  was to collect data on the Chilean economic model.    As a result of this visit, last week, Minister Maira  reported  the implementation of a cooperation plan with the Caribbean  island.    Pressed by its worst crisis since the 1959 revolution, the  Fidel Castro regime is opening up its economy as the only  solution to the crisis that followed the fall of the Soviet  communist bloc in 1991.    Last week, Castro's administration implemented drastic  reforms and austerity measures to fight the scarcity of  currency, the budget deficit, the drop in the production level,  and the black market. Among these reforms and measures are an  increase in the price of basic services; new taxes; and the  freezing of bank accounts with deposits higher than 10,000 Cuban  pesos.    Along with these measures, Cuba also began to send expert  missions to collect information on the economic experiences of  five countries. One of the countries chosen by the Cuban  Government was Chile.    For a week, the Cuban experts talked with officials from the  Chilean Central Bank and the Ministries of Finance, Foreign  Affairs, and Planning and Coordination. ""They wanted to learn  about the mechanisms of administering Chilean economic policy  and the technical instruments with which we work,"" Maira said.    The Cuban experts took copies of already executed programs  from the Planning and Coordination Ministry as well as plans for  integrated projects and the national investment system. They  also learned about regional policies in detail.    At the Central Bank, the Cubans analyzed subjects such as  monetary, banking, and credit policy. They collected  information on similar subjects in other ministries. According  to Maira ""it was something like an exhaustive trip to learn  about the Chilean economic system, and they collected useful  information because they are studying deep economic reforms.  The short-term work they are carrying out here will therefore  be very important for them.""    He stressed that ""the Cubans know they must adjust their  administrative apparatus, as their planned economy is  inefficient,"" and that is why they are studying various  experiences throughout the world that could inform their own  decision.    ""They are seeking changes that will allow them to preserve  the national elements of independence and the accomplishments  attained through their former economic model. Their greatest  asset is that from being a colony in 1959, they have become a  country with national dignity,"" Maira said.    He added that ""we showed the Cubans our house; we explained  to them our procedures, and they thanked us for this  information."" Maira said the Cuban delegation received a good  impression of the capability and efficiency with which Chileans  have administrated their economy in the public and private  sectors.

In statements to the U.S. television network CNN, the top  Cuban leader said that popular participation on the island is  more practical than in the rest of Latin America.    Castro said Latin America's land and wealth distribution  systems are among the worst in the world and that Cuba,  meanwhile, has made the greatest social progress in the  hemisphere's history.    As for the Ibero-American summits, Castro underscored the  positive mark they have left in addition to fostering friendship  among the nations of the region.    Regarding the U.S. blockade against the island, Castro  explained that he had to attend the summit to express his  concern about the lack of opposition to that unfair measure  aimed at making the Cuban people give in to hunger.

He said the agreement provides for creation of ""two emission  centers or two central banks with a single currency, the ruble.""  However, as he underlined, it does not provide for efficient  mechanisms to control emission.    Consequently, Illarionov summarized, ""there appears an  opportunity for Belarusian residents to transfer monetary funds,  bypassing the Central Bank of Russia."" ""Belarusian residents  receive an opportunity to compensate their expenditures at the  expense of the Russian Federation,"" he added.    Illarionov reported that the agreement between Russia and  Belarus also provides for the creation of a joint fund of gold  and currency reserves and ""it will be a hard burden for Russia  as it is quite obvious that Belarus has no such reserves.""    According to Illarionov, creation of such a single monetary  system could become an additional stimulus for the inflationary  process in Russia, totaling 10 percent. ""At the same time such  an agreement creates a precedent for other CIS republics to sign  agreements with Russia on similar conditions,"" he noted.    Illarionov also reported that according to the governmental  working center of economic reforms, in December inflation was  10.9 percent (according to the state statistics committee -- 12  percent) and will remain the same until April 1994. After that  ""there could be a substantial rise in the level of inflation,""  he believes.    The working center reports that the industrial production  level remained stable over the last 5 months but the number of  unemployed is growing. In December there were already 1.5 Mn  [million] unemployed in Russia or 1.2 percent of Russia's  employable population.    ""Growth in unemployment is the reaction of the Russian  economy to the toughening of the government's monetary policy,""  said Illarionov.     "

Representatives of Russia differed greatly  in their views on the situation.    Yakov Urinson, first deputy minister of the economy, was  optimistic on the whole. He cited his ministry's forecast,  according to which the situation will be held under control in  the months to come provided the tough economic policy is  maintained, the state budget revenue strengthened and  institutional transformations and the privatisation drive  continued. This will slow down the slump in 1994, and the gross  national product will dwindle by eight per cent as against 12  per cent last year. Urinson spoke in favour of supporting  specific groups of population in the hope that stabilisation of  social life will be possible this year, as well as an increase  in the labour and business activity of the middle class.    There are no political forces in Russia capable of stopping  privatisation, the seminar was told by Vice-Premier Anatoliy  Chubays, who is chairman of the State Privatisation Committee.  According to Chubays, 70 per cent of shops, stores, restaurants  and other enterprises in the same sphere had been privatised by  January 1, 1994. He stressed the need for dialogue with the  parliament concerning further privatisation. ""The bulk of the  population supports reforms, and this is the source of my  optimism,"" Chubays stressed.    Although the political situation in Russia in 1993 was very  complicated, the market reforms continued, according to  ex-finance minister and parliament member Boris Fedorov. He  said he viewed as a success the continued deregulation of  prices, an end to import subsidies and financial infusions in  the Commonwealth member-countries, and the struggle against the  budget deficit. ""Without these measures the inflation rate could  have been much higher,"" he said. Fedorov announced that the  rouble exchange potential against the dollar increased  three-fold last year, but this increase was too slow and too  painful. The reform objectives were not made quite clear to the  people, he said. For all that, he stressed that the term ""shock  therapy"" is not fully applicable to Russia's economic policy.  As concerns the short-term perspectives, Fedorov said that  recent changes in the policy and playing up to the public were  fraught with an economic disaster in the next few months. But  in the mid-term, one may reasonably be more optimistic.    According to economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, one of the high-  priority tasks is the toughening of control over the inflation  rate. He spoke against soft credits and stressed the need for  further privatisation, particularly in agriculture. He  recommended Western investors to concentrate on Russia's  regions. ""I am optimistic about the future, but not about this  year,"" Yavlinskiy said.     "

Alarcon, who is heading a Cuban delegation that began a  visit  to Belgium on Sunday, met this afternoon with the Foreign  Economic Affairs Commission of the European Parliament headed by  Belgian Liberal Deputy Willy de Clerq.    During the meeting, De Clerq expressed the European  Parliament's interest in increasing contacts with Cuba. He  noted that he was one of the supporters of a resolution that  rejected the U.S. blockade, which was approved at the European  Parliament plenary meeting in Strasbourg last September.    During an extensive, lengthy debate on various topics, the  visitor stressed the need to expand cooperation and trade  relations between Cuba and the EU and between Havana and the  member-states of that supranational organization.    Alarcon also met with Egon Klepsch, chairman of the European  Parliament, who expressed interest in the current situation in  Cuba, especially the economic reforms now taking place.    At both meetings he underscored the importance that any  economic measure to be adopted in the current circumstances in  Cuba should have the broadest consensus of the people, who have  been the basic historic backbone of the Cuban project.    Among other activities, the Cuban leader attended a dinner  with Belgian businessmen in which the new product line of Cohiba  1492 was presented by the Sutter Co. -- the Havana cigar  distributor in the Benelux nations.    Ramon Pez Ferro, secretary of the Foreign Relations Standing  Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government,  and Rosario Navas, Cuban ambassador to Belgium and the EU,  participated in today's meeting.    Alarcon will stay in Belgium until 30 January. During his  stay, he will meet with representatives of the Belgian  Government, the parliament, and European political groups and  friendship with Cuba associations.     "
0,FT933-8084 ,"FT933-8084 _AN-DHRCGABJFT 930818   FT  18 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Caribbean pact with Cuba draws US fire - A look at the regional repercussions of plans for trade and technical co-operation      By CANUTE JAMES   SEVERAL Central American states have stepped into a simmering diplomatic dispute between the US and the Caribbean Community (Caricom) over a recent trade and technical co-operation agreement between the community and Cuba. Amid indications of increasing US concern over the agreement, Central American diplomats in Washington told US congressmen their governments opposed the pact. They fear the region could suffer from any action taken by the US against the Caribbean countries. Earlier this month a US House of Representatives foreign affairs subcommittee sent a letter to the governments of the 13 members of Caricom condemning the Cuban agreement. It said that the pact could have adverse implications for future trade agreements between the Caribbean and the US, and that Caricom should rescind its decision. The US government says the agreement does not oblige Cuba to improve its human rights record or move towards democratic government. But leaders of Caricom - set up in 1973 and consisting of English-speaking countries in the Caribbean basin, Belize in Central America and Guyana in South America - have rejected the US criticism. They say the agreement is part of a programme to improve relations with all countries in the region, and that they have not asked other countries with which they have concluded similar pacts for commitments on human rights and democracy. Discontent in Washington has been fuelled by revelations that the draft of the agreement setting up a joint commission between Caricom and Cuba did contain references to human rights and democracy. The scheduled signing of the pact in Havana in April was aborted when Cubans objected to the 'political' nature of the draft. But at the annual summit in the Bahamas last month, Caricom's leaders agreed to the changes. 'Clearly we are disappointed that the agreement signed by Caricom with Cuba did not include any human rights or democracy conditions,' Ms Donna Hrinak, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs in the US State Department, said in a radio interview. 'I think it is particularly unfortunate as it is coming from Caribbean countries which have their own, very strong democratic traditions, and which have been supporting efforts to restore democracy in Haiti.' While some Caricom leaders, including Mr P J Patterson, the Jamaican prime minister, say that they understand the reaction, they are not moved by it. 'I think there are particular groups in the US which will have reservations, but we have to decide on our own affairs,' Mr Patterson said. 'The cold war is over. Countries in Europe are negotiating with Cuba. It is appropriate for us to have agreements with Cuba in the framework of a joint commission.' The community represents a market of 5.5m people and is attempting to create a customs union and a common market by next year. The setting up of the joint commission with Cuba to oversee co-operation in several areas follows several years of Cuban efforts - with little reward - to improve relations with its neighbours. The commission is aimed at increasing the volume of trade between Cuba and Caricom, enhancing sugar cane yields, boosting co-operation in developing livestock and fisheries, and will combine research in biotechnology, particularly for agricultural and technical applications. Caricom officials say the wording of the agreement was changed to make it consistent with that of similar agreements signed with countries such as Venezuela and Mexico, and one which is being negotiated with Colombia. 'People will need to have it explained to them why Caricom believed that Cuba should, in effect, be given a bye on democracy,' said Ms Hrinak. US officials had earlier complained that Caricom was 'rewarding' Cuba by improving links without winning commitment to political change. 'I do not expect the US to be happy with what Caricom has done,' said Mr John Compton, the prime minister of St Lucia. 'But the Caribbean is consistent in its position. Mexico and Canada never broke ties with Cuba, yet the US has embraced both of these countries warmly in the North American Free Trade Agreement.' US President Bill Clinton has invited the leaders of Bahamas, Guyana, Jamaica, Barbados, and Trinidad and Tobago to discuss hemispheric issues on August 30. 'The meeting will provide an opportunity for the president and the Caribbean leaders to advance their common agenda of promoting democracy and good governance, stimulating trade opportunities and job creation, protecting the environment and fighting drug trafficking,' a statement from the White House said yesterday. Meanwhile, Cubans are clearly happy that the agreement with their neighbours has been concluded to their satisfaction. Mr Lazaro Cabezas, Cuba's ambassador to the eastern Caribbean, said it represented a deepening of links between his country and others in the region. 'Cuba has been training doctors from Caricom countries and providing technical assistance to many,' he said. 'But the prospects for trade between Cuba and the Caricom states has increased significantly with this agreement on the joint commission.'   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.

And the primary goal, of  course, is to preserve the accomplishments attained over these  years. However, abroad, in Florida specifically, there are those  who have plans that differ from these changes. What is the  alternative they advocate?    [Sexto] I could answer with a cliche, a standard phrase, or  slogan and say that Cuba has no other alternative but socialism;  but it seems to me that this is not the time for jaded phrases,  slogans, or cliches. I believe it is time for arguments, for  thinking, for meditation. Evidently, speaking clearly, Cuba has  no other alternative, but then something curious happens. The  changes taking place today in Cuba, changes aimed at reversing  the crisis we are experiencing today, aimed at perfecting the  economic means of our society, are seem by some as a form of  frustration. In other words, some people, including honest  Cubans, believe that everything being done in Cuba -- tourism,  investments by foreign companies, hard currency  decriminalization -- are measures that forcibly lead to  capitalism.    This is, of course, an opinion that in certain cases I  understand, because it is shaped by a very agonizing or  desperate view of the situation. Others, of course, believe that  these changes, this path, frees them from any commitments, and  they are very opportunistically moving to the opposite path to  take free shots at the Revolution which yesterday gave them  everything, including an opportunity to develop their talents,  potential, and raise and educate a family without major  problems. Both opinions, however, are wrong. Cuba is not headed  toward capitalism. That would be silly because it would mean  opposing ourselves. Cuba is engaged in a hard, burdensome  struggle to overcome this objective period. This is an objective  period of economic crisis designed to preserve this whole  project which for 35 years has shaped the lives of Cubans.    [Roque] All this is being done to reinsert Cuba in the world  of today, from which it cannot remain apart.    [Sexto] Exactly. I believe that at the beginning of the  special period Carlos Lage said in an interview that Cuba is  making a socialist opening to a capitalist world. I believe that  everything should be seem from this perspective, which is a very  broad vision, a vision that has to be flexible because it is  subjected one way or another to the demands of a reality that  changes very frequently and is at present very hostile. Cuba, of  course, has to have the flexibility required to adapt to the  emergencies of the times.    [Roque] These are paths we cannot relinquish.    We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the enemies  of the Revolution.    [Sexto] Something curious happens: While certain highly  concerned Cubans fear that Cuba might be moving toward  capitalism, fear that the Communist Party of Cuba, the  Revolution, the Cuban social project might end up being a  capitalist society, others, at home and abroad, are thinking  about pushing Cuba toward capitalism.    [Roque] What are the alternatives they advocate?    [Sexto] We cannot speak of alternatives, we have to speak of  an alternative. For example, what would be the program of a  counterrevolutionary government in Cuba?    [Roque] I can imagine it.    [Sexto] I believe that any intelligent Cuban knows what the  alternative is. I took the time to research the information,  read magazines, read cables, and I made a synopsis of the  alternative that a counterrevolutionary government might offer  the Cuban people, who they claim are greatly burdened.    [Roque] For example, there is the Cuban American National  Foundation [CANF].    [Sexto] The CANF is the most powerful lobby in the United  States. It is the most powerful for the simple reason that it  has the most money and because until recently it enjoyed  absolute support from U.S. administrations. It is a  counterrevolutionary association created by businessmen. That is  enough to make one apprehensive, for one to begin to worry. It  is a group made up of businessmen that advocates an alternative  for Cuba.    [Roque] These businessmen, of course, make monthly  contributions to the foundation.    [Sexto] That group had up to a few years ago approximately  50,000 contributors, of course, businessmen. A few years back it  had a membership of 276,000 people. All these figures should be  taken with a grain of salt. There is no doubt that these figures  may have been altered, there is no doubt that the CANF leaders  might be saying that they have more supporters than what they  have in reality. You know that Miami politics are a little  extreme.    [Roque] Coming back to the issue: the alternative of the  Miami-based CNAF.    [Sexto] What does the chairman of this organization,  millionaire Jorge Mas Canosa, advocate? Mas Canosa believes that  poverty ends with private ownership. We would have to ask him if  he became rich sharing his money with the poor. That is the  first question I would ask Mas Canosa. Mas Canosa believes that  economic progress is only attained with a free market. We would  have to ask Mas Canosa if the good life for 30 or 40 percent of  the population in exchange for the poverty, pain, and misery of  the other 60 or 70 percent could be called economic progress. Is  it economic progress maintaining balanced budgets at the expense  of the pain of the hungry, working majorities. I believe that  all this is highly debatable. For the CANF and its president,  the economic progress of Cuba can only be attained by becoming  dependent on the United States. Of course, for a smart Cuban,  all this is highly suspicious. I believe that we would have to  say: Hey buddy, don't bother to defend me. What kind of an  option is that? You are giving me the rock and the hard place  option.    [Roque] We are discussing the alternatives advocated by the  enemies of the Revolution. When I said alternatives, it is  because we are going to refer not only to the one advocated by  the CNAF but also to that of other groups which are not that far  from that idea.    [Sexto] A few Sundays ago, the JUVENTUD REBELDE newspaper  published an interview by journalist Luis Baez with a  counterrevolutionary pundit named Tony Cuesta, whose crimes I  believe everyone is familiar with. I believe that he recently  passed away due to a heart attack. The interview was conducted  when Cuesta was released from prison. He was jailed following an  infiltration. A grenade had exploded in his hand; the  Revolution's doctors saved his life. He served a few years in  jail, was later released, and returned to Miami. In that  interview, which was published many years after it took place,  Tony Cuesta said that the great problem of the counterrevolution  had been that it did not have an ideology, that the lack of an  ideology had disunited them and that that had been their  disadvantage in confronting the Cuban Revolution, which is a  tightly knitt group of ideas, a highly cohesive political body.    I, of course, do not share this opinion. I believe that the  Cuban counterrevolution does have an ideology. Its failure  against the Cuban social project, the Revolution, is due to the  fact that that ideology suffers much in a comparison with ours.  It is not the lack of an ideology. Therefore, those groups have  an ideology -- in this case a bourgeoisie ideology, a capitalist  ideology. Anyhow, all these groups hostile to the Cuban  Revolution hope for a return of capitalism in Cuba, of  capitalism with its entire structures and laws.    [Roque] And therefore their platforms.    [Sexto] And therefore their platforms with some minor  differences. For example, a few months ago I read an article by  Carlos Alberto Montaner, the leader of the so-called Cuban  Liberal Union, the heir of the liberals whot fled in disarray.  He said in the articles published in the Miami NUEVO EL HERALD  that Cuba, under a different regime, under different  circumstances should never hope for economic development, that  that was an idealistic chimera. He goes on to say that Cuba  should forget its hope to develop the sugar industry because, in  the end, sugar is worth nine cents, that it was better for Cuba  to grow flowers, that Cuba would become wealthy selling flowers  to Florida, of course, if the United States were to allow Cuba  to export its flowers to Florida. More or less, you can see the  ideas advocated by these men.    [Roque] That is his alternative.    [Sexto] That is his alternative. It seem laughable coming  from a man with pretensions of being an intellectual.    [Roque] There also are platforms or alternatives advocated  by dissidents at home.    [Sexto] I believe that the so-called dissidents at home....  [changes thought] I find it hard to use the term dissident. I  fully agree with Silvio Rodriguez [Cuban singer], when he says  that we have let them steal that word from us. A dissident is he  who disagrees. A revolutionary can disagree with something he  thinks is not right. That is a revolutionary attitude. We have  lost the word dissident, and I find it hard to refer to  dissidents within Cuba. I do not believe they are dissidents at  home.    [Roque] They are counterrevolutionaries.    [Sexto] They are counterrevolutionaries. What alternative do  they advocate for Cuba? The same as Mas Canosa: dependency on  the United States; a return to capitalism. And in the political  arena: freedom and democracy. This is even the motto of the  CANF. We could think that the Cuban who today lives in Miami,  mostly controlled by the influence of the powerful CANF, lacks  the liberty to even express himself. We have spoken in this  program about the Americas Watch investigation that concluded  that freedom of speech in Miami is fully suppressed by the  prevailing counterrevolutionary thinking. What freedom can we  speak of? What democracy? We would have to ask Mas Canosa if in  the future parliament he wants to organize in Cuba, the  communist will be represented.    [Roque] Summarizing: There is a congruence among all these  platforms, those abroad and those at home.    [Sexto] The alternative advocated by the counterrevolution  is  capitalism. The alternative advocated by the Cuban Revolution is  socialism. There is no other alternative. All Cubans have to  agree. All Cubans should think with national awareness. Cuba is  only saved through the Revolution's options. There is no other  way.    [Roque] Start thinking.     "

The article is based on the research that Nicanor Leon  Cotayo  has been carrying out for 15 years on the isolationist policy  Washington conducts against Cuba. Leon Cotayo discusses several  issues in collaboration with the Public Health Ministry,  particularly the finance office. The article is especially  significant now that the UN Human Rights Commission is meeting  in Geneva.    Because of the blockade, in one year of this five-year  period, Cuba paid an additional $45 million in health costs.  Cuba could have bought 180 million liters of milk with that  money. Nicanor Leon Cotayo points out that this effect of the  blockade is reflected simultaneously in the increase in the  foreign debt and a greater outlay of hard currency for excessive  transportation costs -- in most cases air transportation -- in  order to ensure the swift delivery of highly critical products.  Despite these difficulties, the article adds, Cuba has preserved  its accomplishments in this sphere regardless of Washington's  systematic efforts to damage our health care system.     "

0,FT922-3424 ,"FT922-3424 _AN-CFKBHADZFT 920611   FT  11 JUN 92 / Cuba opens doors wide to foreign investment: Damian Fraser takes a business trip to Havana      By DAMIAN FRASER   THE Cuban government yesterday stepped up its latest and most visible attempt to attract foreign capital, to shore up the island's battered economy. About 125 potential foreign investors arrived in Havana to be awarded celebrity status by the government, and a rare meeting with President Fidel Castro. They included officials from subsidiaries of Eastman Kodak, ICI, Philip Morris, American Express and Procter  Gamble, and a large number of US lawyers, some of whom were said to be representing camera-shy Cuban-Americans. Eighty of the participants were from the US, although US law forbids them to invest in Cuba. One delegate suggested the Cubans were unwittingly making arrangements for life after President Castro. 'We can't invest now, but we need to be ready in case Fidel goes,' one US visitor added. The visitors were to meet the foreign trade minister, the national bank president and senior officials from their respective sectors. The investors had been briefed on Tuesday by other government officials at the Mexican resort of Cancun, as part of the conference on investment in Cuba organised by Euromoney magazine. The clear message was that almost all foreign investment was welcome, and that rules to limit foreign ownership to 49 per cent of an enterprise could be partially lifted. 'It is,' said Mr Oscar Alfonso Montalvan, of the state committee for economic co-operation, 'a socialist opening for a capitalist world.' Cuba claims to have received about Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m (Pounds 217m-Pounds 271m) in foreign investment last year, mainly in big hotels built by, among others, the Spanish company Grupo Sol. Mr Ernesto Melendez Bach, of the economic co-operation committee, said that due to this, Cuba would attract 1m tourists in 1995, up from 500,000 this year and 250,000 in 1988. He said that the typical foreign tourism developer in Cuba recovered his investment in 3 1/2 years. Mr Melendez and other officials said Cuba was open to investment in oil exploration, nickel, capital goods, textiles and agriculture, and could refine oil for foreigners. The government says it has given individual state enterprises authority to make most of the decisions in their sector, in an attempt to ease bureaucracy in foreign investment. Mr Orlando Hernandez Gui-llen, commercial director at the foreign trade ministry, claimed that, for example, approval to set up a textile factory in Cuba would take a mere 25-30 days. Mr Raul Amado Blanco, Bank of Cuba vice-president, said Cuba would consider debt-equity swaps to attract foreign capital, although he emphasised that fresh money would have to be part of any such arrangement. Cuba is in default on some Dollars 6.5bn of its foreign debt. Mr Blanco said there were 'possibilities for fruitful dialogue' with banks on the debt, but there remained an impasse between Cuba and its official creditors. Foreign investment is now seen as the last hope for Cuba, whose gross domestic product dropped by 25-30 per cent last year after the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union. The potential foreign investors seemed unsure what to make of Cuba's overtures. One fund manager enthused: 'Cuba is following the China model. We could easily have closed-end investment trusts with joint ventures with Cuban partners that would trade in non-American stockmarkets.' A time-share tourism developer from Miami was not so sure: 'Right now, all we have heard is that they want our money. But what about legal certainty? Can they buy you out when they want?'

The Canadian-built facilities are located in the Castellanos  bed and use a system of zinc precipitation, which is widely used  in the international gold industry, to extract the mineral.    According to mining authorities, this mine opens new  possibilities for Cuba to diversify its economy. In addition to  Castellanos, Cuba has gold deposits in the Isle of Youth  (Delita), in the central province of Villa Clara (El Descanso),  and in the eastern provinces of Camaguey (Jobabo) and Holguin  (Aguas Claras).    The most promising of those gold deposits is the one located  in Delita. Experts have concluded, however, that this is where  gold extractions will be more difficult because the mineral is  accompanied by large amounts of arsenic, which is definitely an  undesirable element.

This is why the reforms are  made within our political system without being associated with  any transformation, said Carlos Lage, executive secretary of the  Cuban Council of Ministers, during an interview published today  in the Spanish daily EL PAIS.    Lage indicated that it is possible to improve the Cuban  political system, however, not through elections in a multiparty  system. The Cuban leader explained that the Caribbean nation is  being flexible in its economic model and is willing to make the  necessary changes, but not by moving toward capitalism, rather  by consolidating an efficient socialist economy.    When questioned about groups of Cubans who are in the  Belgium  and German embassies and the Chilean consulate here in Havana,  Carlos Lage said that occupying a diplomatic mission is not the  way to leave Cuba because the country grants permits to whoever  requests them. Moreover, he reiterated that the sole solution  to the conflict is for those people to leave the buildings they  are occupying with the government's guarantee that there will be  no reprisals against them.

Questioned by the media, Robaina said this type of meeting is  held only when a country inspires confidence and security for  businessmen, who have realized there are true investment  opportunities here. Due to Cuba's proximity to Caribbean Basin  countries, Robaina commented on Caribbean ties.    [Begin recording] [Robaina] Fortunately, we are climbing a  path toward normalizing and broadening relations, and we are  about to make a very important decision for the Caribbean and  Cuba, which not only receives from the Caribbean, but -- to be  modest -- also has many things to offer to the Caribbean. We  are about to create the Caribbean States Association, thereby  taking one important and valid step toward joining the process  to participate in the world economy.    [Unidentified reporter] [words indistinct] and Cuba and the  United States could become trade partners in view of the first  [words indistinct]    [Robaina] I do not believe in establishing normal relations  with the United States. We have a document listing those  countries that were with us when we were being besieged. Those  countries that helped us when we were being blockaded will  continue to play a special role. As for establishing relations  with the United States, it may or may not happen; it may come or  it may not. To us, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada  will always be Latin America, the Caribbean, and Canada, because  they supported us first.    [Reporter] [words indistinct]    [Robaina] We will not negotiate the establishment of  diplomatic relations. These are things that go without saying;  they go without saying insofar as the process to establish  relations advances. We can say that we maintain diplomatic  relations with China and Belize and that we have contacts with  Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Establishing  ties, however, is not part of our plans. We do not want anyone  to feel pressured by Cuba, which maintains relations with 147  countries. I believe that should we talk about isolation, we  would be the most supported isolated nation.    [Reporter] As for last week's OAS meeting held in Belem,  Brazil, how do you view Cuba's role within the OAS? How do you  view Cuba's rejoining the OAS? What are the steps you think  Cuba will take in the near future?    [Robaina] As far as Cuba is concerned, we will not take any  steps. Being part of an organization that expelled us is not  one of our priorities. I believe it is the OAS that must decide  whether the conditions to amend an unfair decision have already  been met. I believe the OAS will have to make a decision; only  then will we issue our opinion. We have much more important  priorities than joining the OAS.    [Reporter] As for the U.S. blockade on Cuba, when do you  believe it will be lifted?    [Robaina] I believe this is an important question because  our  front-door neighbors are the ones blockading us. You will have  to ask the same question to the United States with as much  fervor as you are asking me now. I believe, however, that  sooner or later the U.S. blockade will be lifted; this is a  situation that cannot go on forever, but we do not expect the  blockade to be lifted sooner rather than later. I believe the  U.S. Government is still refusing to lift it. For the first  time, however, public opinion and U.S. businessmen and  businesswomen are beginning to reject this policy because Cuba  is not the only one that is blockaded; they are as blockaded as  we are. In the country of freedom, they cannot visit Cuba; in  the country of freedom, they cannot invest here. In other  words, we Cubans are blockaded, and so are they.    [Reporter] Can Cuba survive five more years of U.S.  blockade?    [Robaina] We already survived 35 years, and I think that, if  we survived 35 years under worse conditions, then five more  years is nothing. If you ask me, however, I do not want this to  happen; but we are willing to accept it. [end recording]     "

Arcal is a program that includes  17 Latin American countries, which seek to give their  specialists access to state-of- the-art nuclear techniques and  enable them to study the use of those techniques in all possible  areas regarding the economic and social development of their  nations. Here is Daniel Codorniu, vice secretary of the SEAN  [Executive Secretariat for Nuclear Affairs], organization  responsible for the Cuban nuclear program, with details:    [Codorniu] ""Arcal is sponsored by the International  Organization of Atomic Energy in order to promote cooperation  among various Latin American countries for the peaceful use of  nuclear energy. Cuba has participated in this program since  1987, and in the past years, our participation has increased.

Cuban technicians and specialists will have an opportunity  to  exchange views and results in this area during the 11th Arcal  Coordination Meeting to be held in Santa Fe de Bogota from 16-20  May.    [Codorniu] ""During this meeting in Santa Fe de Bogota, we  will discuss plans for 1995 and 1996 in addition to reviewing  the program for the remainder of 1994. We are planning to  include some new programs that Cuba has been supporting because  they have a strong influence in our development. For instance,  we are proposing a new program called induced mutations related  with [word indistinct] and technology for improving crops in  Latin America. This new program supports the joint use of  nuclear and biotechnological methods to produce a better variety  of crops.""    Other events confirm Cuba's advances in nuclear technology.  Daniel Codornieu believes the best example is Cuba's acceptance,  at the end of 1993, as a full-fledged member of the prestigious  American Nuclear Society's Latin American Division. The  American Nuclear Society also seeks to coordinate nuclear  efforts on the continent.    [Codorniu] ""This is important because, as you saw [word  indistinct], the former program is basically linked with nuclear  applications in areas such as agriculture and medicine.  Although the Latin American division deals with application  concerns, it concentrates on energy problems -- the issue of  developing nuclear energy to generate electricity -- and  investigations in the area of nuclear energy [word indistinct].  As a result, we are also able to collaborate in the area of  nuclear security.""     "

In statements to the press, the official said that the  Mexican Government has always maintained a very close  relationship with Cuba, not only because of their close border,  but because of the obvious ties of friendship and affection  between both peoples. Regarding the upcoming visit to Havana by  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Pinto Mazal said that the  idea is to maintain a ""very open and fluid"" bilateral relation.    According to Foreign Affairs Secretariat sources, during  Salinas de Gortari's visit to Cuba, planned for 13 June, there  will be contacts at the highest level with Cuban officials,  which reaffirms Mexico's policies and principles toward Cuba.

0,FT941-6761 ,"FT941-6761 _AN-EB1DPAENFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Survey of Jamaica (11): Caribbean competition - Tourism is a sunny spot in the economy      By STEPHEN FIDLER   Tourism has been a bright spot in the Jamaican economy. With the markets weak for its traditional exports - bauxite, bananas and sugar - growing foreign exchange receipts from tourism have been an increasingly important source of foreign exchange. The industry generates close to Dollars 1bn a year in gross foreign exchange receipts, according to government estimates. The estimated net receipts of between Dollars 500m and Dollars 600m make it the single most important source of foreign exchange in the economy. It employs about 26,000 people, more than double the level of 10 years ago. Some 1.6m tourists arrived in the country last year, 3.4 per cent up on 1992. The number of visitors stopping over jumped 7.7 per cent to 979,000, while the number of arrivals on cruise ships slipped 3.1 per cent to 630,000. The tourism recovery came after two weak years at the end of the 1980s, and difficult times for international tourism worldwide at the time of the Gulf War and in the depths of the US recession. In Jamaica, it underlined the heavy dependence on the US market. According to Ms Camille Needham, general manager of the Jamaican Hotels and Tourist Association: 'The US recession had a powerful effect that in fact did us a lot of good. We decided that we could not have all our eggs in one basket.' At times in the 1980s, visitors from the US accounted for more than three-quarters of all tourists making stopovers coming from the US. Visitors from Canada accounted for a further 15 per cent. In 1992, 61.9 per cent of visitors were from the US, 11.1 per cent from Canada. The proportion of visitors from Europe has risen above 20 per cent; more than half come from the UK, encouraged by the development of the charter tour business. Numbers of visitors from regions such as Latin America and Japan have also grown. Along with this, the seasonality of the trade has been reduced. Most Europeans - unlike many holidaymakers from the northern US and Canada - vacation in the summer months. Jamaica's tourism business is not without its problems. Rising crime levels (attacks on tourists have grown and two have been murdered in the country in the last two years) attract bad publicity, which may deter visitors if the situation becomes worse. Some of the country's infrastructure - for example, the telephones and the provision of electricity - has improved. But much remains inadequate. 'We have to improve the roads, reduce the number of potholes. Electricity and telephone services have improved a lot. We are working on the water situation but it's moving a bit more slowly,' says Ms Needham. Part of the problem is that infrastructure has not kept up with the growth of the industry. Much of the development has been haphazard and resorts have not been planned. 'We have to think of planning and zoning to make the resorts more interesting and attractive,' she says. Other problems - such as air access to the region - are less under Jamaican control. The future of Air Jamaica, the national airline, is uncertain. Mr Omar Davies, the finance minister, says the government will stop providing funds for the loss-making airline from the start of the new fiscal year in April. Pan-American and Eastern airlines, which were the main carriers from North America to the Caribbean, have collapsed, although American Airlines has scheduled additional flights. Furthermore, competition is becoming intense, and may become more so. Several US states have started promoting themselves as holiday destinations. Resorts in the Dominican Republic and Cancun in Mexico offer competitively priced vacations. Cuba is attracting substantial hotel investment. Cuba seems to offer an important medium-term threat, although its emergence as a true competitor will depend on the lifting of the US embargo. Of all the Caribbean islands, Cuba appears to offer most of what Jamaica has in sand, sea and scenery. 'We can't compete with rates offered by Dominican Republic,' says one Jamaican tourism official. 'We can't sell our rooms for Dollars 20-Dollars 30 a night.' Despite this competition, there has been more of a co-operative approach to Caribbean tourism in recent years. Once fiercely competitive, the resort countries including Jamaica have implemented a big advertising programme in the US to market the region as a single destination to potential north American visitors. The tourist authorities hope that one spin-off may be the development of more multi-centre holidays. In common with other cruise ship destinations, there have been concerns in Jamaica that cruise visitors do not provide enough benefit to the local economy. However, a decision to increase the cruise ship passenger tax from Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 has been delayed, apparently following pressure from the cruise ship owners. Government officials have said that the increase would be implemented over three years from January 1994.   Countries:-  JMZ  Jamaica, Caribbean.

The estimates, prepared in the course of negotiating the IMF loan, anticipate that debt relief from all Russia's creditors would provide some Dollars 26bn, by far the biggest share of the total financing requirement. However, the Fund envisages Russia will also obtain additional loans totalling Dollars 5bn from bilateral creditors and grants of more than Dollars 2bn. Russia can also look forward to credits from the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The IMF expects Russia will be able to increase its foreign currency reserves this year after boosting them by more than Dollars 3bn last year. However, success would be dependent on preventing large scale capital flight from Russia. At a meeting with journalists yesterday, Mr John Odling Smee, the IMF director in charge of Russia and the other former Soviet republics, said capital flight was reversed in the middle of last year after the Russian authorities tightened their monetary policy. The IMF tentatively estimates that capital flight last year may have declined to Dollars 8bn last year from Dollars 13bn in 1992, although officials stressed that the statistical basis for such estimates was far from perfect. The Dollars 1.5bn loan approved last week is conditional on a stringent economic policy programme agreed between the IMF and the Russian government. The programme, the third such pact, was preceded by two other programmes. Yesterday Mr Ernesto Hernandez-Cata, Mr Odling-Smee's deputy, admitted that Russia's performance in both previous programmes was 'not impeccable'. However progress had been made and this, together with assurances from the present Russian government, helped the IMF to make the latest agreement. Mr Hernandez-Cata, who played a leading role in negotiating the IMF loan, said Russia had been able to cut its budget deficit to 8 per cent last year from 18 per cent in 1992. Credit growth had also be curtailed to 350 per cent last year from 550 per cent the previous year. The monthly rate of inflation had also come down from 20 per cent last year to a single digit level. It was 'too early to declare victory' in Russia, Mr Hernandez-Cata said. However, the Russian economy had reached the point of no return in its transition from communism to a market-based system. The latest IMF programme would achieve a good result if it was implemented. 'It is now up to the Russians to see that that happens.'   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

He said Russian future will much depend on whether the  country will continue to create a genuine market economy,  whether Russian citizens will remain adherent to democracy and  prevent any limits on it and whether Russia will keep to its  previous role on the international scene or change it.    The President expressed his admiration with Russian  achievements in literature, art, on the battle field and in  space. He said the Communist system suppressed people and led  to the cold war. Nevertheless, greatness of the Russian people  has been always evident and it has a prospect to become powerful  and prospering on the eve of the 21st century.    Despite the fact old human vices -- hatred and racial  intolerance -- remain, the greatness of peoples in the 21st  century will be determined not by their ability to impose their  will on others but by the ability to enable everyone to use all  possibilities of modern and future world regardless one's race  and sex, said Clinton.    As for Russia and the United States they are bound to make  their contribution to the consolidation of the spirit of  cooperation and partnership throughout the world and improvement  of everyday life of each person, including Russian citizens.  Clinton stressed Russians themselves are to make their own  future.    In their turn, the U.S. people and President want to be  partners and sincere friends of Russia, he added. Clinton said  he ran for U.S. President to make sure changes for the better  come true.    Dwelling on the development of Russian economy, the U.S.  President agreed transition to market economy was painful and  difficult, it even disoriented Russian citizens. However, in  his opinion, Russia would have to pay more for being idle or  trying to turn back. State-controlled economy does not work in  the modern world, said Clinton. The old system was doomed to  failure, and if Russians try to re-introduce it it will fail  again, assured the President.    Speaking of Russian economic problems, Clinton noted high  inflation rates. In his words, the inflation must be curbed  down, but it will also claim some price. Another problem is the  need to create a system of social guarantees for people affected  by swift economic development. Clinton said the Americans will  do their best to make the difficulties easier as Russians  progress on their path.    Clinton said a major task of the Russian people is  consolidation of democracy, since it gives the most reliable  guarantees of observation and protection of ethnic minorities'  rights. In order to ensure democracy, everyone should denounce  intolerance, hatred and antisemitism, said Clinton.    The U.S. President focused on human rights and said America  warns other states against disrespect for rights of ethnic  Russians.    Clinton said he is concerned with some irresponsible  statements recently made on the Russian political scene and,  without mentioning Zhirinovskiy's name, added with a smile he is  not going to return Alaska to Russia.    The President expressed the assurance the future measurement  of Russian greatness will be its ability to be a peace-loving  neighbour.    Speaking of common European problems, Clinton noted this is  the first time ever Europe is not divided, it is united with  adherence to democracy, free market economy and the availability  of common borders.    The U.S. state head said he is satisfied with the Russian  president's decision to participate in the Partnership for Peace  initiative and work for integration of Europe. He especially  praised the historic Russian-U.S.-Ukrainian agreement on  elimination of nuclear arms signed in Moscow.    In his opinion, it is sign the future will be considerably  different from the past. The Russian fate may also influence  that of America and the United States wants Russia to make  decisions that will be good for itself.    Many people gathered in the Ostankino studio to meet the  U.S.  President. The studio was also connected with some Russian  cities whose residents were welcome to ask questions.    Part of the audience, mainly philology students, asked  questions in good English, which made Clinton wonder whether  everyone in the studio is from Moscow State University and  speaks without an accent.    Asked what is the difference between the United States and  Russia, the President said Americans have created their  democracy for 200 years, and Russia has the world's youngest  democracy. Still, he said there is plenty of similarities in  characters of the two peoples.    A representative of Stavropol Cossacks asked Clinton in what  form the United States may participate in settlement of  conflicts in Russia. The President gave an evasive answer and  spoke of Yugoslavia where the U.N. peace-makers are trying to  help avoid victims.    The President was asked two questions about the Baltic  Republics. The first question wondered why America does not want  to render assistance to states striving for democracy, including  the Baltic Republics. The other wondered why America helps the  Baltic states despite their infringement on rights of the  Russian-speaking minority.    Clinton said he wants to render assistance to the Baltic  states and invite them to the Partnership for Peace together  with Russia. They will participate in outlining joint military  plans, military operations and so on. If they decide to join  NATO, they will have to take certain obligations, safety  guarantees, said the President.    In the opinion of the U.S. President, the withdrawal of  Russian troops from Lithuania testifies to the Russian  Government's satisfaction with the state of bilateral relations.    Problems with Estonia and Latvia remain unsettled, added the  President and said an international group representing CSCE is  studying the human rights situation in these states. In the  words of Clinton, he has warned heads of the Baltic states that  if violations of rights of the Russian-speaking population are  revealed, this will tell on the U.S. policy towards those states.    Asked about prospects for U.S. economic assistance to  Russian  businessmen, the President said he thinks there should be much  more U.S. investments in Russia. In his words, the U.S.  secretary of commerce will come to Russia in March with a large  group of U.S. businessmen to persuade them to invest in Russia.    The question of a 13-year-old boy ""When did you decide to  become U.S. President?"" came somewhat unexpectedly. Clinton  said he was sixteen years old when he shook Kennedy's hand and  approximately at the same time he understood he wants to serve  for the state.    He shook the boy's hand and said maybe one day he will  become  Russian president.    Speaking to the audience in Nizhnyy Novgorod, the President  said it would be good for U.S. college and school students to  come to Russia for studies. If Boris Yeltsin addresses a U.S.  audience, few U.S. students would be able to talk to him in  Russian, admitted the U.S. President and again praised language  abilities of his young Russian interlocutors.    A youngster asked the President whether he would play  saxophone for them, but Clinton answered he had played saxophone  at Thursday's dinner for President Yeltsin and added he has a  one-time saxophone play quota for each country.

0,FT943-21 ,"FT943-21 _AN-EI3DUAIIFT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Eastern Europe (49): Painful legacy of the past - Russia and the former Soviet Union states      By JOHN LLOYD   The former Soviet states have suffered, and are still suffering, a series of external and internal shocks more serious and crushing than any developed country has had to withstand since the second world war. They are reeling under these shocks: their economies - with the exception of the three small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania - are still plunging because of them. There are signs, especially in Russia, of improvements, but not yet of sustained recovery. These shocks were: the steady degradation of the Soviet economic system, already evident in the early 1980s and made worse by the misconceived economic reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev; the steady drop in energy - especially oil - output, which continues; the ending of the Comecon trading bloc in 1990; the multiple declarations of national independence at the end of 1991 which exacerbated the already-evident breaking of industrial and economic links between the 15 Soviet republics; the creation of separate currencies, forced on most republics by Russia's decision to make the rouble a national currency; the ending or curtailing of Russian energy and other subsidies to the other republics; and the inability or unwillingness of the new national elites to introduce market economic institutions and practices, even as they can no longer depend on the old collective institutions. These have been common in one form or another to all of the states: in some cases, they have been exacerbated by civil wars - affecting all three of the transcaucasian states of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia; Tajikistan in Central Asia; the transdnestrian region of Moldova; and the north Caucasian republics of Russia, especially Chechnya. In these states and regions, economies have been ruined for a decade or more. Each has to cope with hundreds of thousands of refugees, and the state or regional governments are largely overwhelmed with day-to-day crises, unable to plan or rebuild. Even in those states which conflict has not touched, the shocks described above have been numbing in their effects. Industrial output in the most developed states - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus - has plunged by at least a half (on official figures, which are unreliable: nevertheless the trend is clear and is dramatic). Inflation is endemic - and where curbed, as it is in Russia and has been in Ukraine - the drop in its levels is achieved by simple axeing of government commitments and programmes which include paying workers their wages. There are signs of change. The Baltic states, which now dislike the reminder that they are 'former Soviet' republics, have wholly (Estonia) or partially (Lithuania) succeeded in stabilising their economies and have begun the road towards integration into the European Union which their leaderships have unambiguously identified as their main goal. In Estonia's case, this was achieved by text book 'shock therapy' - indexing the kroon to the D-Mark overnight two years ago, and rendering it illegal to issue credits to fund a budget deficit. The tiny state now has the highest growth levels in Europe - though its economy was already the richest of the former Soviet states and it had relatively little heavy industry. Russia is the critical case. When, in spring of 1994, the government agreed with the IMF to bring inflation down to 7 per cent a month this year and to keep the budget deficit under 10 per cent of GNP in return for the Dollars 1.5bn second tranche of the systemic transformation facility, it seemed a commitment which would never stand the test of time and of the pressures of the manifold lobbies which have in the past derailed efforts - including those of Yegor Gaidar, the former acting prime minister - to keep the economy on track. However, as of early September, the government has kept to its pledge - bringing inflation down from more than 20 per cent a month in January to under 5 per cent in July, and claiming to be running a budget deficit of under 10 per cent on an annualised basis. Encouraged by these signs of monetary stability, foreign portfolio investment in the Russian privatisation process is climbing very sharply. This impressive feat - which has reversed the conventional view of Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, from being one of a barely-altered Soviet 'red director' to a politician determined to institute market reforms - has not been achieved without pain, nor is it seen as having definitively shifted the Russian economy on to a reform path. The government has cut down heavily on credits, but this has meant that workers have not been paid, investment has been postponed and debts between the enterprises have rocketed to vast levels. At the same time, there is little sign of large-scale strategic investment, either by Russian companies or by foreigners - though the large corporations are increasingly making at least token investment, while ABB Brown Boveri, the power engineering company, has taken a (still all but unique) decision to locate much of its production in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Russia thus hovers between the past and the future, with no unambiguous sign that it is prepared to move one way or the other. The size of Russia, and its virtual monopoly of oil and gas production, means that all other republics are hugely dependent upon it. This fact of life has impressed itself on the elites of Ukraine and Belarus, the two other Slav states, and they have now produced a political leadership anxious for close ties with Russia and for a continuation of supplies of cheap energy. Ukraine's inability to grasp the nettle of reform initially appeared to mean stability - but in the past year has seen the country's economy sink rapidly to the point where much of industry is idle at least part of the time, the currency is chronically prone to inflation and the vast Donbass coal region sinks under debt. For the IMF and for the World Bank, the success of reforms in the former Soviet states is critical to their strategic choices of how reforms should be conducted elsewhere. Both institutions, especially the Fund, have been heavily criticised for offering an 'off-the-shelf' prescription emphasising monetary stability and budgetary discipline: but the critics have yet to propose a convincing alternative and the Fund has been strengthened by the acceptance by the Chernomyrdin government of its strategy for this year, and its success so far in carrying it through. The reform process here remains the most important in the world: and it remains among the most uncertain.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.

This is the explanation that the Ministry gave for  reinforcing security around diplomatic missions in this capital  in the wake of the incident provoked by the forceful entrance of  a group of persons into the residence of the Belgian ambassador.    In statements for domestic and foreign media, Ministry  spokesman Miguel Alfonso said that Cuba and Belgium continue to  reject the permanence of such persons in the building and are  holding talks to enforce commonly accepted principles.    As part of such contacts, the Belgian Embassy handed to  Cuban  authorities an official list of the residence's occupants, 121  men, women, and children.    The Cuban Government recognizes the inviolability of the  Belgian facilities and will abstain from taking any measure that  could affect it although the occupants entered through violence,  Alfonso pointed out.    They also agreed on the impossibility of accepting the use  of  force to avoid established regular procedures to leave the  country, a position that Cuba has already reaffirmed.    The Foreign Ministry offered medical services to the  Belgians, even to the occupants, as well as food, which is  already being supplied with the help of other European embassies.    Alfonso noted that reprisals would not be taken against  those  who leave the residency nor would any obstacle be placed in  their efforts to depart Cuba through the normal procedures.  Nevertheless, if any of them have cases pending in Cuban  courts, this would be taken into account.    When referring to other illegalities detected, he pointed  out  the distribution of political statements to the international  media, after their elaboration inside the building, even though  only authorized personnel can enter and exit the site.    To conclude, Alfonso said that no dramatic developments are  foreseen in the Belgium residency situation in the coming hours.     "

Venezuela supplied between 60,000 and 70,000 barrels of oil  per day to Cuba up to the latter part of 1991, based on an  agreement in which the former Soviet Union supplied a similar  amount of oil to the refineries of state-owned Venezuelan  Petroleum in Europe.    Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta said the  possibility of renewing this agreement ""is an international  policy decision"" which the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry will  handle.    The initial agreement was suspended after the Soviet Union  disappeared, but both Russian and Cuban authorities, who have  visited Venezuela, have expressed their interest in renewing the  agreement.    Arrieta did not reveal if the agreement will continue under  the former premises. A Russian delegation that visited  Venezuela in late 1993 reported the idea is for Cuba to pay for  the oil by supplying them with sugar.    Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli Rivas said  this week Cuban authorities have ""a great interest"" in reaching  an agreement on this matter and that it will be one of the  topics to be discussed during Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomydin's visit to Venezuela in June.

In a news conference,  the activists of the U.S. Freedom To Travel movement said that  in the Clinton administration and Congress, there are those who  support an end to the prohibition on visits to Cuba. They  indicated that hundreds of people backed the bill and that in  only one week, they collected $25,000 to make the trip after the  Treasury Department's decision to freeze $43,000 of the  organization's bank account. They emphasized that Freedom To  Travel is composed of 50 organizations from 25 states and is  committed to ending the restrictions on visiting Cuba and  lifting the economic blockade.    The group, which will stay on the island until 30 June,  plans  to visit sites of historic and social interest and meet with  Cuban officials.    We hope that the Freedom To Travel group will achieve its  objective of changing the unjust laws with which the U.S.  Government seeks to prevent visits by U.S. citizens to Cuba,  Medea Benjamin, executive director of the Global Exchange  Project, said in Havana. In remarks to this station, the  spokesperson of the group said this second defiant action is  greater than the first and that something very important has  been achieved in recent months: a Congressional resolution that  stipulates that the president cannot restrict the U.S. citizens'  rights to travel. Medea Benjamin added that through these trips,  the members of the group can confirm the Cuban people's  affection and verify how irrational and unjust the U.S. policy  against Cuba is.    Last year, the Freedom To Travel group made its first visit  to the island, and, when it returned to the United States, many  of its members experienced coercive measures, such as having  their passports withheld and their bank accounts frozen and even  being threatened with imprisonment.

Nelson and Irina Y. Kuzes M. E. Sharpe Dollars 19.95, 267 pages Russia has changed so rapidly during the past three years that it is difficult to understand just how it happened. The country's evolution - from a socialist, centrally-controlled economy toward a capitalist, privatised one - has been moulded by the volatile political fortunes of Russia's leading politicians and economists. The most tangible result of economic reform - the privatisation of Russia's shops, factories and agricultural land - was by no means pre-ordained. So it is most welcome to all students of Russian political economy that Professor Lynn Nelson, of Virginia Commonwealth University, and Russian urban planner Irina Kuzes have published a study of what is clearly the first chapter of the Russian privatisation story. The book, which covers the period from October 1991 through the Yeltsin referendum in April 1993, offers an account of the privatisation process, with particular emphasis on the political background to key economic events. The authors base their analysis on interviews with the architects of Russian privatisation, Anatoly Chubais and Dmitri Vasiliev, on Russian news coverage, opinion polls, and on their own survey of decision makers in four Russian cities: Moscow, Ekaterinberg, Voronezh and Smolensk. What the authors do best is to unravel the economic strategies and political motives of those who have been involved in Russian economic reform. The period prior to the attempted putsch in August 1991 was characterised by a struggle for power; Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, Grigory Yavlinsky, Stanislav Shatalin, Abel Aganbejian, and Yegor Gaidar all vied for the right to steer Russia's economic course. The book helps to explain their different approaches, and to analyse why certain proposals were never implemented. The book also documents the extent to which Mr Yeltsin's popularity has been tied to economic performance, and how he has personally intervened in every major economic decision. The fascinating fourth chapter of the book sheds new light on the events that led up to the creation of the State Property Management Committee (GKI) and its privatisation programme. For example, in the controversy surrounding the use of cash-redeemable vouchers, the authors state that Yavlinsky had argued against vouchers, predicting that they would either lose value or fuel inflation. However Mr Yeltsin saw vouchers as a way to divide state property among millions of people; hence the political objectives of the voucher idea came to override the potential economic drawbacks. Regarding Mr Gaidar's fall from power in December 1992, the authors cite a mismatch between Mr Gaidar's upbeat economic predictions and the deteriorating economy. And the authors document how inflation became the pivotal issue in the power struggle between reformers and conservatives. The book covers the nitty-gritty details of the privatisation law, describing the auction process, the role of local privatisation commissions, and the voucher distribution system. What is new is the perspective of those on the receiving end of privatisation - gleaned from the authors' survey of decision-makers in four Russian cities. Responses to the questionnaire, which includes measures of job satisfaction, decision-making authority, and attitude to privatisation, are woven into the text and also recorded in the appendix. The analysis shows that in 1992, an overwhelming majority of people supported the idea of privatisation, although fewer supported the government's methods of implementing it. One hesitates to criticise a book which is one of the very first studies of Russia's remarkable privatisation drive. Nevertheless, the book suffers from the fact that neither Nelson nor Kuzes are economists. For example, the authors are dismissive of GKI Deputy Minister Vasiliev's defence of the price liberalisation in October 1991, reporting that acute food shortages occurred three months after the price liberalisation was put in place. They imply that price liberalisation caused the food shortages. Although some economists have linked these two events, the subject is controversial and complex, with factors such as contracting gross domestic product, a complete breakdown in storage and distribution, and falling productivity all contributing to the shortages. Overall, however, this book is highly recommended reading for anyone who has watched the Russian economy during this period. With the second phase of privatisation now under way in Russia - covering divisive issues such as land and health care - the authors' second volume will be eagerly awaited.

Garcia]    [Text] Havana, 4 Feb (PL) -- Representatives of Cuban  immigrant organizations are interested in holding talks with the  Cuban Government to review links between both sides without  discussing matters related to the country's internal situation.    The Cuban-Americans have told PRENSA LATINA that whatever  happens in Cuba only concerns Cubans who live there and that  they would like to talk, preferably, about normalizing the  relations between Cuba and the Cuban community abroad.    Subjects such as immigrations, communications, family  reunification and aid, the need for cultural exchange, and ways  to facilitate the lifting of the blockade could be the main  points discussed during the meeting, which has created great  expectations in the United States, where more than 1 million  Cubans live.    Alicia Torres, a Cuban-American who arrived in the United  States when she was four and today heads the Cuban-American  Committee in Washington, has said it is time to discuss certain  aspects that could contribute to normalizing the links between  certain moderate political groups and authorities.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina announced the dialogue at  the end of 1993 in New York. The meeting is expected to take  place during the second half of 1994.    The Cuban Government has not yet decided the date or the  list  of participants in the meeting in which, according to Torres,  all sectors willing to participate in a respectful dialogue  should participate.    The Cuban Parliament has rejected, however, the  participation  of groups of immigrants supposedly interested in talking with  the authorities but which have the support of the CIA.    A statement issued by the Foreign Affairs Commission has  said  Cuba ""has never closed the possibility of reaching agreements  with Cuban immigrants and has been talking with groups that  oppose the Cuban political ideas, as long as those groups are  not linked to the CIA or to positions that favor the blockade  and aggression. [no closing quotation mark as received]    Foreign Minister Robaina said some time ago that individuals  linked to Miami-based terrorist organizations or those who want  to give away or sell the country (Cuba) will be excluded from  the talks.    Robaina said the Cuban Government is willing to hold talks  and establish fluent and normal relations with those segments of  the community that maintain a respectful position and will not  estrange themselves from their homeland.    Coincidentally, Andres Romero, president of the Organization  of Cuban-Americans for Dignity [Organization Cubanos-Americanos  por la Dignidad] has agreed that representatives from terrorist  groups should not be invited to the meeting, adding that his  organization rejects any attitude of confrontation or violence  that could lead to a bloodshed.    Extreme-right groups should not be invited to the meeting,  because in Miami they oppose, in various ways, assistance to  Cuba, even if it consists of medicines or powdered milk for  children, he has said.    We are accused of being communists, which we are not... we  simply act as decent Cubans who want to help. They, however,  distort the truth, saying that our shipments are sent to the  government, when they are really for hospitals, schools, and  nursing homes, something which has already been confirmed.    Romero, one of the organizers of the fleet that on two  occasions has brought humanitarian aid to Cuba from Key West,  has said that during the meeting neither side should try to  impose their ideas on the other, and he stressed the importance  of reviewing the subject of immigration.    Regarding a similar dialogue held in 1978, during which  Torres was the youngest participant, she said ""there have been  some advancements on the challenges we had at that time.  Obviously, new subjects will emerge, as times have changed  since then.""    She recalled that under current circumstances there are more  complex aspects, such as the economic situation in Cuba and the  illegal departure from the country of Cuban citizens who receive  the U.S. Government's protection when they arrive in U.S. waters.    Both Torres and Romero have agreed that whatever happens in  Cuba only concerns Cubans who live on the island and that the  Cuban community abroad has no right to decide what should be  done.    It is a different situation, Torres said, when Cuban  immigrants want to help their families, keep in touch with them,  or return to their country of origin, among other things.    Meanwhile, Romero has said no one abroad has a right to  impose changes in Cuba and that any proposal in that regard  should be made respectful of the island's sovereignty.     "

Castro is wearing a guayabera and is  seated at a long table with various persons on either side,  facing approximately 60 businessmen and officials who are  attending the meeting.    President Castro begins the meeting with the following  statement: ""We are here full of hope for encouraging this  fraternal, friendly spirit that has been created, the  perspectives that have opened. The only thing I really deplore  about this is that we are not the PRC instead of Cuba. Cuba is  tiny; it is a small country, while the PRC is enormous, millions  of square km, with a population of 1.2 billion. All the  businessmen, industrialists, and investors want to go there, to  the PRC. Cuba is small, but we can certainly do something in  Cuba. We can fulfill a principle, above all -- to develop  economic, friendship, cooperation, trade, and peace relations  among nations. We can encourage economic and trade ties.    ``We are willing to cooperate based on one essential thing,  seriousness. I can tell you that whatever can be done in Cuba  will be done with absolute and total seriousness by us. Since  this is the case, I am sure you want to know about many things.  I will not tell you about the summit. The newspapers have  already reported it. Perhaps we can appoint a moderator. Whom do  we appoint governor? No, not governor, [chuckles] moderator. He  must play the role of governor to act as moderator here.''    Castro and those seated at the main table speak softly among  themselves and decide who will be appointed to act as moderator.  Castro is heard commenting: ""He must have tremendous experience.""    An unidentified moderator in the front row stands and begins  by ""cordially greeting"" Castro ""on behalf of the business  community in Cartagena and the region;"" adding that ""the  resumption of diplomatic and trade relations between Colombia  and Cuba"" led to ""unusual intensive activity. In Cartagena de  Indias' case, this was a result of the declaration of sisterhood  signed between Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena de Indias."" He  adds: ""The Cuban ambassador and his cultural and trade"" attaches  have already visited Cartagena de Indias and participated in ""a  series of meetings that have already shown various excellent  perspectives"" between this region and Cuba.    The moderator says the meeting is being attended by  representatives of many business groups in the region -- large  and small industries, hotels, stores, investment firms,  fisheries, etc. -- and ""they want to comment on the possibility  of establishing trade with Cuba. They also have questions  concerning issues they have already reviewed with the Cuban  ambassador,"" including ""the mechanisms that will be implemented  to facilitate these relations."" The moderator asks businessmen  to stand up, identify themselves, and give the name of the  company or activity they represent.    Miguel Parra stands up, introduces himself, and says he is  ""the owner of Milpa Investments, which operates coal mines in  the central part of the country"" and has ""been doing business  with the Cuban company MAPRINTER [Cuban Raw Materials and  Intermediate Products Import Enterprise], a branch of the  Foreign Trade Ministry, for the last two years. Within this time  we have sent 23 shipments -- worth over $4 million -- of this  product to Cuba, through the port of Barranquilla."" Parra then  mentions the medal he was given by the Cuban Government at the  1992 international fair in Havana, in a ceremony that was  personally attended by Castro.    Parra specifically asks ""the Colombian people,  industrialists, and businessmen to have faith in Cuba, to  believe in Cuba, to pay little attention to international  propaganda because, in our case and with the experience acquired  in two and a half years, we have realized that what the  international media shows is not reality. Cuba is a country with  credibility; it is serious concerning its commitments, as the  president has said. In fact, on three occasions, we shipped  merchandise without a confirmed letter of credit. This does not  mean Cuba does not have the money to pay because Cuba pays us  when it pledges to buy something. Instead, due to the blockade  we all repudiate, we have to go the long way around, through  other countries, to legalize our operations in U.S. dollars; and  this obviously delays the procedure. Today, in fact, we are  sending a shipment of our product -- coke coal -- to Cuba and we  are doing it without having received the letter of credit  confirmed by the president. But I repeat, this does not mean you  do not fulfill your pledges.""    Castro says: ""We can stay here as a guarantee."" [laughter,  applause]    Parra says he and Mayra Tomas, MAPRINTER official, already  have plans to establish a port in Barranquilla that ""will  expedite coal shipments"" and give priority to Cuban ships or any  ships chartered in other countries, ""to overcome the gap that  has occurred in maritime transportation."" He explains that  Thomas has already managed to get various ships to send  refractory bricks and other products to Cuba. He promises Castro  that a port will legally operate in Barranquilla soon and that  the facilities will be at his service so he may use them to ship  all the Colombian products he wants to Cuba.    Castro says: ""Thank you, thank you. [applause] Which Cuban  industry is using this coal right now? The steel industry?""    Parra answers: ""It is used to manufacture gas for domestic  use; it is used in the steel industry, in foundries, to  manufacture acetylene. It is specifically used by Minaz  [Ministry of the Sugar Industry] industries....""    Castro interrupts: ""And the metalworks industry and basic  industry, particularly the one that manufactures gas for the  population in an old plant we have over there.""    The next speaker is Carlos Banegas, manager of Exclusive  Minerals, who invites Colombian businessmen to buy Cuban  products and explains that he is the local distributor of Cuban  zeolite, which is used in the agriculture sector, ""to  manufacture fodder, soft drink filters, and beer filters.""  Speaking of trade with Cuba, he says his company has ""imported  3,000 tons of zeolite this year"" and has plans to import 5,000  tons by year end. Banegas says he is also the local  representative for a new Cuban product, a vaccine to innoculate  bovines against ticks. He said ""protocol research has been  conducted"" and its sale should be approved in a month, when it  will be available in the local market. Banegas adds that his  company expects to initially sell ""5 million doses of this  vaccine in Colombia.""    Banegas is followed by Freddy Lehner, manager of BIOLEHNER,  local representative of the Genetic Engineering and  Biotechnology Center's recombinant vaccine against hepatitis.    Castro turns to Banegas and asks: ""What is yours?""    Banegas answers: ""A vaccine against bovine ticks.""    Castro adds: ""Ah, yes, the vaccine against ticks. It is very  important and yields good economic results.""    Lehner says the Colombian Health Ministry has purchased ""a  large number of hepatitis B vaccine doses for a large-scale  vaccination program"" in the country; adding he is also the local  representative for the Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology  Center's (Eyverkinasa), which is a recombinant streptokinase  used in case of a heart attack; (Evermin), which is an epidermic  growth factor; and Interferon.    Castro states: ""(Ateromixol) comes from another center. It  is  the famous PPG [expansion unknown].""    Lehner suggests that it be called (Ateromixol) in Colombia  rather than PPG.    Castro replies: ""Yes. Coincidentially, the name was  arbitrarily invented when they were involved in its research.  One day they went to register a product in Spain and discovered  a product named PPG in Spain. Imagine, what a coincidence. So  many letters, so many combinations; yet they could not register  it as PPG, but it is known as PPG almost everywhere.""    Lehner smiles and says: ""I am always asked why the product  is  called PPG, but I still do not know.""    Castro answers: ""It was an arbitrary decision, yet people  invent names for the PPG.""    Lehner says his company is also the local representative for  the Carlos J. Finlay Institute's meningococci vaccine, which was  tested with ""excellent"" results in Antioquia, where 20,000  children were inoculated with doses donated by the Cuban  Government.    Castro says: ""That vaccine is important because meningococci  disease sows terror. It is not only a matter of how many  children are saved, which is priceless, but the fear this  disease instills in the family. It involves millions of people,  parents, siblings, uncles, everyone. Whenever a person sees a  child with fever or any symptom, he immediately thinks about the  possibility of meningococci. We eradicated that scourge, that  terror in our country precisely as a result of that vaccine. The  use of this vaccine has expanded considerably; it is being sold  in Argentine. Its sale is being discussed with the Brazilians  and other countries. It is a product with many perspectives.""    Lehner explains that the Colombian authorities are working  hard to inoculate children in rural areas and poor sectors,  adding that maningococci cases have been detected in  Barranquilla, Buenaventura, Cali, and Cartagena de Indias, and  every effort is being made so the people learn about this  vaccine.    Castro states: ""It is the only vaccine of its kind in the  world. The same goes for the tick vaccine. It too is the only  one of its kind. We have people working there, wracking their  brains, to see how they can help the country counter its  difficult situations. We have made important investments in the  research sector. We are now completing the construction of a  center that has already begun to produce monoclonal antibodies.  These are tremendously important, not only for the diagnosis of  diseases, but also for the struggle against cancer, where new  theories and possibilities have appeared.    ``I think there is a possibility of finding a cancer  vaccine,  above all, one dealing with viruses. The goal is to find  specific antibodies that directly attack malignant cells because  the medicine available right now attacks all the cells and has  damaging side effects. Nevertheless, I think the center we are  completing right now has a possibility of doing this because it  will be one of the leading centers, one of the best centers in  the world. I am glad we were able to help. I am glad we were  able to meet; it is a pleasure. I am proud that [words  indistinct] symbolically representing [words indistinct]''    An unidentified speaker asks about AIDS research in Cuba,  to which Castro answers: ""Yes, we are working on AIDS, too.  Research began in the very beginning and we have achieved great  success concerning AIDS. It is a terrible threat right now and  apparently, it is very difficult to control because it is a  mutant virus. A mutant virus is difficult because you may find  the way to attack a specific type of virus -- for example the  flu virus -- but if it mutates, it becomes another type of  virus. [Words indistinct] using Interferon, an antiviral [words  indistinct] from blood, and we have been using special measures  to prevent its propagation because AIDS spreads like wildfire.  Sometimes all it takes is one case to infect 30, 40, or 50  persons. People have a mentality. Sometimes they ignore this,  granted, but we know of cases in which people know they are  infected, but do not care if others become infected. The  situation concerning that disease is truly dramatic and everyone  has a responsibility to work on AIDS, cancer, parasites, and  virus research.    ``We are trying to find a multiple vaccine that immunizes a  person against many diseases with a single dose. We are trying  to do this through genetic engineering, which will perfect the  vaccine. We now have the maningococci vaccine and the hepatitis  vaccine through genetic engineering, just as we have the  streptokinase through genetic engineering. Just see the  difference between this and the natural product. Some people  manufacture it from natural products, extracting the serum from  people and all that, but what does a dose cost? $1,500. How much  does a dose of streptokinase cost? More than $300 -- I do not  know what the current price is, but the cost is five times less  when the same medicine is a result of genetic engineering.    ``I am taking this opportunity to tell you that part of the  medicine we currently export to Colombia is destined to pay some  old debts that are still pending. We intend to honor our  commitments and pay some debts this way. I believe the  possibilities are many because you have a large population -- 30  million, or more than 30 million.''    The moderator says: ""33 million.""    Castro exclaims: ""How you have grown! You were half that  many  a few years ago. You also have different climates -- tropical,  temperate -- and yours is one of the countries most concerned  about people's health. Let me tell you, the recent Colombian  Governments have been most concerned about health programs.""    The last speaker is Rizo, president of the Cartagena de  Indias Chamber of Commerce, who has reviewed Cuba's progress in  the technology, science, and engineering sectors. Colombia has  achieved various degrees of development, which entails various  degrees of technology. Rizo says he ""believes an enormous  exchange of technology could occur between Cuba and Colombia in  this concern,"" and he would like to exchange information with  Cuban professionals, engineers, and consultation firms. This  would enable them to carry out excellent work, both in Cuba and  Colombia because ""if there is something Cuba has done, it has  been to improve the quality of people's lives. We still have a  lot of people whose quality of life must be improved, and  advanced technology is too expensive for them.""    Castro asks: ""Does this include low-cost housing?""    Rizo answers: ""Yes, Sir.""    Castro emphasizes: ""You must work hard to find solutions, to  build low-cost houses, as we call them.""    Rizo says this also includes sewers, aqueducts,  communication, roads, and all the services needed for a better  lifestyle.    The meeting ends with Castro's statement: ""I wanted to tell  you I feel very satisfied about this meeting with you. The  Fourth Ibero-American Summit has just been held. Its main goal  was integration, and we are specifically working on issues  dealing with our two countries' integration. We have achieved  progress and who knows how far we can go -- until one day we are  fully integrated. We should strive to be fully integrated, and  we must first do it with our neighbors. As I said, the flight  from Havana to Santiago in a turbo- prop aircraft takes  practically as long as the trip from Havana to Cartagena de  Indias in a jet aircraft. I was astonished by this. I had not  realized this even though I was here recently. This time, I sat  down, read some papers, and chatted for awhile, and suddenly we  were landing here. The communications revolution has brought us  closer.    We are very similar; at least we are quite similar to the  people in Cartagena de Indias, perhaps because we live in a  warmer, more tropical climate. Maybe the people in Santa Fe de  Bogota are not so communicative because they live on a plateau  and it is colder over there. It is colder there, and I am told  the city has grown so much and there is so much cement that it  is now like Mexico City, where the average temperature has  increased. We are very much alike however, and it is a truly  promising step to discover there are so many possibilities for  getting closer, working together, developing the economy  together.    ``Once again, we have reason to dream what our liberators  dreamed of -- that one day our Latin American nations would be  united, a strong united front. We speak the same language, have  the same culture, and we can speak here without translators. We  know we can talk, while it is difficult to do this in the world  today if you do not speak another language. If we have no other  choice but to learn English, then we will learn English. In the  end, it is not our fault that the English were great colonizers  and spread the language throughout Asia, Africa, Canada, and  other places. We will do this to speak with the others, with  outsiders, but we only need to speak Spanish among ourselves --  except for one or two words that have different meanings here  and there. It is a language in which we can perfectly well  understand one another. What an advantage this is for becoming  closer; what an advantage for us to unite; what an advantage for  becoming a union someday. When I have a meeting like this, I  believe more than ever in the things I have always believed in.  Thank you.'' [applause]     "

Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 5 January reports that Holguin  Province has begun 1994 with water levels in its reservoirs of  slightly over 83 percent of potential, ""one of the best  situations in recent times, in this respect.""    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that the David Diaz  Guardarrama Recapping Plant in Villa Clara delivered over 4,200  recapped tires for harvest use in the provinces of Santa Clara,  Villa Clara, Cienfuegos, and part of Matanzas.    Lastly, Rebelde reports that ""ICAIC [Cuban Institute of  Cinematographic Arts and Industry] is urging all inhabitants of  Plaza de la Revolucion Municipality, Havana City Province, who  are interested in participating"" in the filming of a joint  French-Cuban movie, to apply at its offices in the Vedado  section of Havana.    Radio Reloj at 2050 GMT on 5 January reports that the  Spanish  consortium Caguama Caribbean Hotels has announced that by late  1994 it plans to complete remodeling the Riviera Hotel in Havana  in the hopes of making it a fine five-star hotel. Regarding the  Caguama-Punta Blanca hotel, the group has announced that the  remodeling work has begun. Ricardo Roquero, president of Caguama  Caribbean Hotels, has confirmed that they chose the Caribbean,  and Cuba in particular, because of the great potential and  opportunities for investment.    Radio Reloj at 2052 GMT on 5 January reports that the Jose  Gregorio Martinez factory in Cienfuegos repaired approximately  400 hydraulic pumps used in the KTP sugar combines in 1993. The  factory workers have said that they can repair 150 pumps a  month. Last year workers were not able to produce the number of  cylinders, hoses, and shock absorbers needed for agricultural  equipment because they did not have the necessary raw materials.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 7 January quotes a GRANMA  article today reporting that a total of 777 Basic Cooperative  Production Units [UBPC's] were created nationwide in noncane  agriculture in 1993. GRANMA notes that to-date, there are 62,215  caballerias under UBPC jurisdiction and that slightly over  78,000 workers have joined these units. According to data  provided by the Agriculture Ministry, 407 of the 777 UBPC's tend  cattle; 226, miscellaneous crops; 65, tobacco; 29, citrus  plantations; 23, fish farms; 14, rice; 12, coffee; and one is a  forestry unit.    Radio Reloj at 2049 GMT on 7 January reports that  Tourhoteles  Enterprise surpassed its foreign exchange income goal by 7  percent in 1993. During the year, this enterprise was host to  270,000 tourists from Mexico, Germany, Argentina, Italy,  Guatemala, and Brazil.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 7 January reported that  in  1993, Havana City reached an infant mortality rate of 8.9 per  1,000 live births, which is the lowest in its history. Villa  Clara achieved the lowest rate in the country, 6.6.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 January reports that the  Solidarity Cuba-France flight has donated $100,000 for GRANMA  newspaper and other supplies. The French Communist Party senator  stresses growth of the solidarity movement.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 January reports that the  first line of tubes [tubos] earmarked for the manufacture of  Cuban bicycles has begun continuous production in areas of the  (Indalecio Montejo) factory in south Ciego de Avila City.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 January reports that the  factory in Santa Cruz del Norte municipality, Havana Province,  which makes cardboard of various weights -- the only such plant  in Cuba -- will resume operations this month after an extensive  period of inactivity due to the current economic limitations.  The plant will process over 3,000 tons of cardboard of various  weights with support from a Swedish-Venezuelan company, and will  earmark this first shipment for the promotion of its products on  the international market. ""The Santa Cruz del Norte cardboard  plant will use raw material acquired through foreign financing,  which will allow us to make this plant part of the national  strategy to bring in foreign currency.""    Cuba Vision at 2330 GMT on 11 January reports that the first  phase of the Palo Alto bulk sugar terminal in Ciego de Avila  Province is near completion. The project, estimated at over 75  million pesos, will increase efficiency in marketing the sugar  produced by 17 nearby mills, as well as reduce transportation  costs. The facility is designed to handle 750 tons of sugar per  hour. Minaz and Micons workers affirm the first phase will be  completed within the next few weeks.    Cuba Vision adds that the San Jose White china factory in  Havana is operating in the black a few months after its  inauguration. Ninety percent of the raw materials used by the  factory are obtained in Cuba. The factory has already  contributed $500,000 to the national economy. It has 140 workers  and operates 24 hours a day.    Cuba Vision also reports that the workers of Varadero's  Tuspan Hotel accrued $10 million in 1993, thereby fulfilling  their pledge to Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered among the  best in Cuba due to the quality of its service and its economic  efficiency. The 230- room two-year-old hotel is a joint  investment of Cubanacan and the Mexican group DSC, and is  managed and marketed by the German enterprise LTI. The money  earned is a significant contribution toward purchase of food and  medicine for the people.     "

It should be clearly asserted that this is not the case.  The United States has placed Cuba under a trade boycott, thus  severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the eyes  of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to be  simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the  United States.""    This remark is really surprising, particularly considering  that in 1992 and again in 1993 the UN General Assembly approved  important resolutions on the ""need to end the economic,  commercial, and financial blockade imposed by the United States  against Cuba,"" by an overwhelming majority that included  Uruguay's vote.    The blockade also has been condemned by the Nonaligned  Countries Movement, the Ibero-American summit meeting in Bahia,  UNESCO, and many other international organizations and events.    Cuba has submitted numerous proofs of the extraterritorial  nature of the blockade, that is, on the obstinate manner in  which the United States violates international law and the  freedom of trade it pretends to impose worldwide.    This evidence shows how successive U.S. administrations  placed obstacles and tried to prevent other countries from  trading or carrying out financial operations with the island.  The United States used pressure and threats--such as the  exclusion of those countries from U.S. trade and financing  programs, the suspension of U.S. credits, the blockade of  assistance by international financial organizations, and the  prohibition to export and import products to and from the United  States, etc.--to hinder trade with Cuba.    Today Cuba is introducing important economic changes and is  opening its doors to foreign investors, but eight of every 10  individuals interested in doing mutually profitable business  with Cuban companies withdraw due to threats and pressures  against them.    There are many other aberrant elements in the blockade, such  as the U.S. prohibition to import goods containing even the most  minimal quantity of Cuban components or raw materials, or the  prohibition affecting companies of any country from exporting  goods to Cuba containing U.S. components or raw materials. This  is a particularly sensitive point because it includes medicine  and food.    The United States also prevents the main international  financial institutions--such as the IMF, the World Bank, and the  Inter-American Development Bank--from granting loans and  assistance to Cuba.    If this were not enough, when socialism collapsed in East  Europe Cuba suddenly lost 85 percent of its economic and trade  partners, but the United States strengthened its blockade and  broadened the blockade's international application with the  sadly known Torricelli Law forbidding U.S. subsidiaries around  the world from trading with Cuba. The law also gives powers to  the president to impose sanctions on any country giving  assistance to Cuba and forbidding ships that trade with the  island from entering U.S. ports.    These extraterritorial demands are so grotesque that the EC  and Canada, among other countries, rejected them vigorously.    I did not want to refer to the blockade's effect on my  people. It has caused us damage estimated at more than $40  billion and provoked great scarcities and suffering, thus  revealing its criminal, cruel, and inhuman nature. But what  offends Cubans most is that it is unfair, illegal, immoral, and  unjustifiable because it pursues the objective of isolating  Cuba, obtaining its surrender by hunger, and imposing on her the  political, social, and economic order that U.S. authorities  consider most adequate and convenient to their interests.

The harvest  workers have put a poor start behind them and, dismissing  difficulties, are fulfilling the trust placed in them. This is  the reason Camaguey was selected the winner in the eighth  regional emulation period with results surpassing those of Las  Tunas and Holguin Provinces. In sugar produced, they are second,  nationwide; in sugarcane grinding, yield, transportation,  planting, soil preparation, and power provided to the national  electric system, the region is the vanguard. This is very  encouraging and, in the opinion of specialists, denotes  efficiency and stability, even though there is still much to do.    The emulation assessment was chaired by Jose A. Naranjo,  chief of the commander in chief's coordination and support  staff, and Politburo members Nelson Torres, Sugar Minister, and  Julian Rizo Alvarez, first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba in Camaguey Province, in addition to the first secretaries  of Las Tunas and Holguin Provinces.    It became evident in the analysis that an extraordinary  effort is required in the next 40 days in order to meet the  unalterable commitment of the three provinces decisive to Cuba's  sugar program. It was stressed that the doctrine of fulfilling  daily tasks is not only beautiful but essential, now more than  ever.     "

This time the speaker of the chamber, Ivan Rybkin, could  become the victim of a showdown among deputies. The opposition  seems to have begun seriously to consider putting into effect  the threat voiced at the last plenary session by Deputy S.  Baburin to examine the State Duma chairman's personal file if he  went ahead and signed the Treaty on Social Accord. Ivan Rybkin,  as people will know, ignored the threats and signed the treaty,  and it is to be supposed that the revenge of the former comrades  in arms of the Russian Unity bloc will not be long in coming,  particularly as the speaker has long caused acute irritation to  the majority of left-wing factions by his desire to cooperate  with the executive branch and his firm refusal to play a  Khasbulatov role in the Duma.    If the ""Rybkin personal file"" is put on the agenda, the Duma  chairman could be placed in a pretty difficult position. Deputy  Baburin's initiative will not, of course, be supported by the  right-wing factions -- Russia's Choice, Yabloko [the Yavlinskiy  bloc], the 12 December group, or the majority of centrists --  the members of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord [PRES],  Women of Russia, and New Regional Policy factions.    There is no reason to expect unity in the left-wing section  in the Duma hall of sessions either. The Agrarians, who will be  asked to oppose their own nominee, will find themselves in a  difficult position. And the already small Democratic Party of  Russia [DPR] faction has been split since its leader, N.  Travkin, joined the government. So only the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation [CPRF] faction and the small Russian Path  group of deputies are consistent and firm opponents of Rybkin.    Much could be resolved here by the stance of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR]. From a superficial  standpoint it would be illogical for Zhirinovskiy to oppose a  fellow signatory of the treaty. However, it cannot be ruled out  that the Liberal Democrat faction will form a bloc with the  Communists on this occasion. Admittedly, this will only happen  in the event of a guarantee that the vacated speaker's chair  goes, for example, to A. Vengerovskiy, first deputy chairman of  the LDPR and deputy chairman of the Duma. However, it is  difficult to imagine the Communists and the members of Russian  Path agreeing to pay such a price for Rybkin's resignation.    A far greater threat to the State Duma chairman is posed not  by the configuration of forces in this chamber of parliament but  by the theoretical possibility of a revision of the results of  the election for speaker. As you will recall, Rybkin scraped a  majority. Moreover, dubious ballot slips, which were deemed  invalid, were discovered when the ballot boxes were opened.  Many contentious issues also remain over the determination of  the quorum for voting. All this gives grounds for questioning  the legitimacy of Rybkin's election. And here the opposition  could gain allies in the shape of a number of radical deputies  from right-wing factions.    All this clamor raised over the figure of Ivan Rybkin --  the first person in the history of contemporary Russian  parliamentarianism to have tried to turn parliament from a  political club into a genuine legislative body -- shows very  graphically that periods of political stability in Russia's life  remain of short duration, lasting as a rule less than a month.  The pattern here is obvious. And there is scarcely any point  in seeking the cause of the latest potential minicrisis solely  in the spoiling tactics of Deputy Baburin and like-minded  individuals from the Accord for Russia movement. It is  difficult to expect political stability in a country with an  unstable economy.    This latest, expected spiral in political tension coincides  to perfection with the advent of a new stage of economic crisis  in Russia. Our home-produced consumer goods have begun to lose  out in price to imported goods. In the opinion of leading  economists in the country, the domestic economy is already in a  crisis of overproduction. The first reaction to this was the  demands at the start of the year to increase import duties.    The political forces existing in Russia today propose two  ways out of this situation: either a drive to solve the  nonpayments crisis by the classic method -- through the  bankruptcy of enterprises -- or reversion to a closed economy.  This, of course, is to protect home producers. The first path  is long and hard. To start moving along it you need at least  six months in order to prepare the legislative base -- to  change, in particular, the Law on Enterprises, to introduce laws  on bills of exchange and bankruptcy, to seek a solution to the  problem of the depressed regions, and to do much, much more  besides. On the other hand, if Russia does manage to complete  this path, real grounds will emerge for discussing the  possibility of genuine stability not just in the economy but in  politics too.    Recent actions by the president indicate that he has decided  to go in precisely this direction and has opted to pursue this  path toward an open economy for at least two years.    At the same time there is a real prospect that uncompetitive  economic structures will unite, their main demand being a  restoration of the closed economy. The military-industrial  complex is seen as the undisputed leader here. Its financial  potential and links with the power structures and the special  services could turn such an amalgamation into a powerful force  -- and not just a political force. And the longer Russia takes  to overcome the crisis, the greater this force's chances of  winning victory, even by unconstitutional means, will be. The  strengthening of imperialist and nationalist motifs in the  policy of various parties reflects this trend.    Ultimately the question comes down to whether the president  and government will manage to extricate the country from crisis  by the next presidential election.    There are grounds for thinking that at the current stage of  development of the political situation in Russia the president  sees his main task as inducing the opposition to operate solely  within the constitutional framework and thereby avoiding another  threat of a putsch or coup, because since 12 December the  opposition, contesting the president on the constitutional  field, has been unable to pose any special danger to him. The  campaign launched to collect signatures in favor of the Treaty  on Civil Accord, which is designed to consolidate the  president's constitutional role, is, I think, primarily linked  to this.    Both in August '91 and last October Boris Yeltsin was  victorious, not because he relied on the law (regrettably we  cannot talk about respect for the law and legal standards in  Russia today), but solely thanks to the support of the people.  However, as the results of the elections to local organs of  power show, this support does not appear unconditional today.  The people are withdrawing from politics. The president is  forced to rely more and more on the political and state  nonmenklatura.    The diplomatic domestic political activity demonstrated by  Boris Yeltsin in recent days -- the unpublicized renewal of  contacts with Yu. Skokov, leader of the military-industrial  complex, and the appointment of N. Travkin to the government --  stems, it may be supposed, from awareness of this fact.

The minister explained that the overall perception of the  Cuban community abroad has changed. He stressed that current  migration laws respond to the need to protect Cuba, thus the  political rights of Cubans living in Cuba cannot be the same as  those who live abroad.    Conference spokesman Miguel Alfonso told the press that  talks  between the official Cuban representatives and the 215 guests  are proceeding in an atmosphere of respect and are characterized  by an absence of confrontation.    Cuban visitors, most of whom are U.S. residents, requested  certain changes to the visa system, the creation of an official  organization to handle their affairs, and the opening of several  consulates in the United States. They also asked that their  children be allowed to study in Cuba.    The Nation and the Emigrants Conference was convened by the  Cuban Government and is being held at the Havana Convention  Center with the participation of Cubans who reside in 27  different countries.

In a speech delivered in the western province of Matanzas,  some 100 km east of the capital, Alarcon pointed out that this  fact is increasing the anger of the enemies of the revolution  that first arose in 1959.    The legislative leader said that in spite of the tightening  of the blockade imposed on the island by the United States over  three decades ago, a growing number of foreign investors are  interested in establishing joint enterprises with Cuba.    According to a report by the National Information Agency  (AIN), every day more businessmen become interested in investing  in our country, despite the blockade and U.S. hostility, Alarcon  emphasized.    Alarcon also mentioned the Canadian Government's  announcement  this week that it would resume official assistance to the  country.    Cuba has been experiencing an adverse economic situation  since the disappearance of the European socialist bloc led by  the former USSR, with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its  trade.     "

The talks were scheduled to review progress of an immigration accord signed on September 9 that will sharply increase the number of Cubans allowed to migrate legally to the US each year. The September agreement halted an exodus by sea of thousands of Cubans trying to reach the US without entry visas. Both sides have have expressed a willingness to make the immigration deal work, but Washington has resisted Cuban pressure for full-scale negotiations on bigger issues such as the US trade and financial embargo against the island. Cuba's foreign minister Roberto Robaina admitted to a parliamentary foreign affairs committee on Saturday there were 'no new elements' to suggest the mere continuation of the immigration talks would lead to immediate significant improvements in relations. The US even appeared to have downgraded the importance of its delegation to the Havana talks. Instead of Mr Michael Skol, deputy assistant secretary of state, who took part in the September negotiations, the US team in Havana was led by a lower-ranking official, the head of the State Department's Cuba desk. Cuba is keeping its same chief negotiator, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and a member of the Communist party politburo. While the latest talks have no fixed agenda, Cuba was was thought likely to press for a quick start to the expanded US visa programme. The increased visa processing has been delayed because additional consular staff had to be sent to the US Interests Section in Havana to help cope with the extra work. US officials say between 26,000 and 27,000 Cubans are expected to be granted visas to migrate legally over the next year, through accelerated processing procedures, expanded criteria for refugee status and an immigration lottery to start on November 1.

This qualitative change in the popular debate has occurred  because it has become apparent that it is the shortage of  supply, not an exaggerated increase in income, that has  essentially created the phenomenon of excess liquidity, which is  having serious economic and social repercussions.    People are becoming more and more aware that, although the  abrupt decrease in supply is associated with external factors  (the disruption of Cuba's economic and commercial ties with the  former socialist world and the reinforcement of the blockade),  the recovery of supply now depends above all on our ability to  develop internal capacities for revitalization and economic  growth.    And it is becoming clear that completely overcoming the  shortage is not something that can be accomplished merely by  manipulating certain variables that might reduce solvent demand,  such as prices, taxes, and other monetary factors. Rather, it  has to be accomplished by making positive changes in the most  concrete factor in the economy, the place where the production  of value is verified.    We must recall, to avoid harboring unfounded hopes, that any  financial measures that may be taken will not have an immediate  or absolute effect of boosting production or increasing supply,  because their function is to serve as a bridge to provide access  to revitalization.    And it should also be emphasized that it is unreasonable to  expect the elimination of the shortage to occur uniformly, all  at once, and equally for all citizens.    To understand this assertion, it is not enough to say that  egalitarianism is a tendency that we must banish; we have to  start from the notion that Cuba does not now have any external  financing that would enable it to put to work a broad range of  idle productive capacities in the short term, or to increase  supply and stimulate work through consumption, as was done in  the 1970's when external financing made it possible to create  the parallel market.    And that is the vicious circle that workers see when they  realize that the internal financial imbalance and low  consumption, equitably distributed, erode the motivating force  of wages, which is a factor that tends to weaken productive  efficiency.    To break this vicious circle, it is imperative that we  continue the policy of distributing available resources  appropriately to certain sectors of the economy where spending  will have the maximum multiplier effect. These sectors must be  given not only the necessary supplies for production, but also a  complement of consumer goods so that the workers can spend their  income and thus counter the pernicious effect of shortages.    We are talking, then, about a crucial measure that is in the  process of being implemented and should figure more prominently  in the deliberations of the Workplace Parliaments, even though  it is not on the agenda for the next session of the National  Assembly and is not strictly a financial matter.    But this is an economic policy that also requires a broad  consensus, given that our limited resources must be channeled  preferentially toward activities such as sugar, mining, tobacco,  coffee, oil drilling, biotechnology, the manufacture of medical  and pharmaceutical products, tourism, agricultural food  production, and others that directly generate foreign exchange  income or are essential for the country's economic functioning  and social life, such as public health and education.    Applying this policy in a consistent manner would promote  the  stabilization of those sectors, and would gradually create the  surpluses needed for the recovery of other sectors, which would  contribute to broader reproduction until the recovery of the  national economy and the normal development of society became a  reality.    In these priority sectors, which can play the role of  ""engines"" of the economy, in addition to greater stimulation of  work, the improvement of business practices must be established  as an extensible premise. These sectors must have enough  decisionmaking power and autonomy to ensure, without excuses,  reasonable levels and increases in economic efficiency.    But it is our contention that this viable solution requires  a  consensus, because the allocation of resources to these  multiplier activities is limited by the austere sacrifice  required of other sectors, which, for a time, cannot aspire to  the same levels of consumption.    This limitation, which is qualified by the national  commitment not to leave any sector of the Cuban population out  in the cold, makes it necessary to consider the decisive role  that moral, ideological, and political factors must continue to  play in the revitalization of the country's economy.    For that very reason, it is of vital importance that all  workers be able to understand thoroughly the complexity of our  situation, the viability of possible solutions, and the  orientation toward changes that will help us win, little by  little, the battle for efficiency and economic recovery.

In May 1993 the president and the government did finally  issue a decree on priority measures in small business  development. It contained the main point: the decision to  allocate money for their development and instructions to the new  Fund for Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of  Competition to distribute it. According to economists'  calculations, however, 100 billion rubles [R] is needed to  revive the small business sphere rather than the R25 billion  that has been allocated--and even that only on paper. By the end  of the year only R5 billion was left at the fund's disposal.  Members of our union (who presented relevant programs) also  counted on some share of that money. Unfortunately, the  procedure for distributing the money turned out to be very  complex, and the fund has never really managed to get a grip on  it. For more than half a year it was busy setting itself up and  developing a concept of monetary distribution, while the money  melted away under the onslaught of inflation.    With this arrangement, small business will not see  fundamental changes in the foreseeable future. According to  preliminary data, in the future the Fund for Support of  Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition intends to use  the long-awaited money as credit that will be provided to small  businesses on the same terms as the Central Bank's prime  rate--210 percent annually. In order to utilize such credit  successfully, the amount has to be turned over four times a  year. This means that it can be used only for trading, not  production. Entrepreneurship in the production sphere, the one  capable of saturating the market with goods and services, needs  preferential credit support and taxation regime, exemption of  reinvested profit from taxation, and a tax break of two to four  years depending on the nature of the production.    Alas, Russia has practically already chosen a very  unfavorable road for the development of entrepreneurship. Its  fate was determined by the government, which made changes to tax  legislation that left entrepreneurs in a state of shock. Tax  rates and indirect taxes were increased, new taxes and duties  introduced. As a result, an entrepreneur will have to give up  for public needs 35-43 percent of profits, and the combined tax  on payroll reaches almost 40 percent. The only real benefit  small businesses got is exemption from paying estimated tax on  profit. It is also very good that profit reinvested in capital  assets and put into RD and design work (NIOKR) will not be  taxable. However, in the current conditions few small  enterprises can afford such expenditures without additional  credits.    Security--in 149th Place    In this situation small business could get help from foreign  investment, but the terms of obtaining it and the insignificant  volume do not meet the current needs and cannot satisfy Russian  entrepreneurs. The main reason, in the opinion of international  financial organizations, is that the investment climate in  Russia over the past five to six years has changed for the  worse. For instance, the financial magazine YEVROPEYSKIYE DENGI  (""European Money"") in March 1993 placed Russia in 149th place  (among 169 countries) in terms of investment security. In  addition to difficulties built into the code of law, foreign  investors also encounter many organizational and informational  problems. This precipitates their reluctance to increase  investment in Russia.    Privatization with the participation of foreign investment  can and should play an important role in the development of  small and medium-size business. It opens the opportunity for the  free import into Russia of managerial experience and know-how.  Another advantage of such privatization is that enterprises  undergoing privatization will be appraised at their real value.  A private investor will invest his money only if he is certain  that the enterprise he is acquiring will flourish and bring in  profit. So far he is encountering only difficulties, the main  among which remains the haphazardness of economic legislation.  For instance, certain types of activities are permitted only by  license; quite often far from the best facilities--take it or  leave it--are offered for privatization; there are numerous  restrictions regarding auctions and competitive bids, while  almost all such deals must be licensed. For the foreign business  world the Law on Foreign Investment in Russia, which contains  the most general provisions with a considerable set of  restrictive conditions, so far has not become a document for  practical action. Serious modifications to it are urgently  needed, as well as developing as soon as possible a set of  accompanying documents that will specify in concrete terms the  norms of participation and preferences for foreign investors.    Until recently, however, Russian state bodies did not treat  seriously the problem of attracting foreign investment. The  Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees petitioned the former  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet on these issues many times but  never received a reply. However, the issues raised a year ago  have not lost their urgency. The main among them, in the union's  opinion, is the question of ownership rights. It still has not  been defined clearly who and at what level makes the decisions  on granting which kind of ownership. From the standpoint of  international standards, we have not defined ownership rights at  all, and therefore a foreign investor does not know what he can  count on when he acquires a Russian enterprise. In order to  create a favorable investment climate it is also necessary not  only to make corrections to the legislation but also to  guarantee observance of already existing statutes.    Structures qualified to work competently with foreign  investors of capital in Russia so far are not sufficiently  developed. Potential foreign investors are reluctant to come  into the Russian market among other reasons because they do not  find local structures professionally trained to interact with  them.    International Investment Center Will Select a Company    Against the background of such unfavorable trends, the  Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, in partnership with  the international consortium Newform International (Paris), in  August 1993 created the International Investment Center, whose  task is to facilitate attracting foreign investment into the  Russian economy.    The center was founded in order to bring together and  utilize  the experience of specialized consulting and engineering firms,  whose sphere of activities encompasses the main spheres of  applied knowledge. All projects are carried out by independent  international experts. The center will transfer to the customer  the technologies and ensure the participation of local partners  in the project.    Through its international contacts, the center will select  for each project a company responsible for its implementation,  based on its experience and reputation, as well as the knowledge  of local conditions. The company to which the project  implementation will be commissioned uses as needed the  capabilities of all members of the Newform International  consortium. Well-integrated into the world economy with  international contacts, the center's flexible structure and its  multiprofile orientation allow it to develop and realize  technically and economically most complex projects and pick the  management for them.    The International Investment Center has already begun to  implement a number of projects. Among them, first and foremost  we should mention the project to develop a timber raw material  base in one of the rayons in Tomsk Oblast utilizing waste-free  wood processing technology and the development of a social  infrastructure, and the project on the construction of an  international airport in Ufa.    In addition, the International Investment Center has begun  to  actively promote abroad the products of members of the Russian  Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees, using advertising and  promotional materials supplied by customers, and assist in  signing the contracts. On the other hand, it is using the  capabilities of Newform International to identify potential  buyers for their products.    The Russian Union of Entrepreneurs and Lessees has  established working contacts with Russian ministries and  agencies dealing with investment programs in order to identify  Russian projects financed by foreign and Russian state  institutions and funds, and determine how the International  Investment Center may join in their implementation.    The regional unions of the Russian Union of Entrepreneurs  and  Lessees were advised to cooperate more closely with local  administrations in developing and implementing investment  projects and programs, and select concrete projects and designs  for which the International Investment Center could provide, on  a commercial and contract basis, international evaluation and  find foreign investor companies.    The center closely cooperates with such recognized  international specialized companies [as published] as the World  Bank (Washington), the African Development Bank (Abidjan), the  UN Development Program (New York), the UN Food and Agriculture  Organization (Rome), the Asian Development Bank (Manila), and  the Inter-American Development Bank (Washington).    Policy Must Be Registration-Based    How do we stimulate and boost investment? I think that in  order to achieve this it is necessary, in legislative order, to  completely exempt from taxation domestic and foreign investment  in the Russian economy (first and foremost in the development of  small and medium-size business in priority sectors), as well as  give up for a certain period of time taxing profits received.  Incentives must be provided for capital to flow into those  sectors and spheres of activities of small and medium-size  business where the problems of life support and structural  restructuring of the economy are concentrated: food production  and processing, basic necessity goods production, etc. For this,  however, our investment policy regarding potential investors  must finally become based simply on registration. This may be  perhaps one of the most cardinal problems of reforming the  Russian economy today and in the future.    Implementation of the set of priority tasks in the area of  developing small and medium-size business in Russia must not  only ensure the achievement of goals associated with economic  stabilization but also form a positive attitude toward  entrepreneurial activities and the emerging entrepreneurial  class.

The institute  said Cuba was the country with the greatest increase in exports  to Colombia between January and April, as compared to the same  period last year. Cuba is followed by the Cayman Islands (800  percent), Poland (351 percent), and Sweden (210 percent).    Colombia and Cuba resumed their trade relations in 1990 and  their diplomatic ties last October following 12 years of broken  relations, which began in 1981 when President Julio Cesar Turbay  accused the Cuban Government of Fidel Castro of supporting  guerrilla groups. The Cuban Embassy in Colombia told EFE that  Colombia imports steel, salt for industrial use, generic  medicines, vaccines, and biotechnological products, from the  Caribbean island while Colombia sells Cuba textiles, electricity  cables, machinery, and coke, among other products. Colombia's  greatest increase in imports, by groups of countries or economic  blocs, came from the Andean Group countries (Bolivia, Peru,  Ecuador, and Venezuela) where Colombian purchases increased  20.82 percent followed by the European Union (EU) with 13.11  percent. Colombian imports during the first four months of the  year totalled $1.321 billion and its principal markets are the  United States and Venezuela, in that order.     "

In expressing an opinion with respect to the extent of a  measure, which, according to THE MIAMI HERALD newspaper has been  approved by the U.S. Department of State and is currently being  evaluated by President Bill Clinton, Graciella Chailloux from  the U.S. Studies Center told PRENSA LATINA that Washington's  blockade against Cuba will never change.    For the past 35 years, she recalled, the White House has  attempted to economically suffocate Cuba, and what the newspaper  reported in no way provides solutions leading in that direction.    Lifting some travel restrictions to Cuba and easing the way  to information exchange is merely part of a plan they intend to  implement in order to influence Cuban civilian society and  encourage real political intervention which the Americans, she  indicated, would consider given the excellent results in Eastern  Europe.    The real intention, according to the researcher's personal  opinion, is to encourage implementation of the Torricelli Bill,  as this instrument relates to interfering in Cuba's internal  issues.    Likewise, Nicanor Leon Cotayo, Cuban journalist, writer, and  researcher, believes that lifting restrictions to Americans  traveling to Havana will only be a minor alleviation to the  official violation of U.S. citizens' constitutional rights.    Leon emphasized the highly selective nature of the  authorizations granted -- mostly to U.S. officials. In this  respect, he pointed out that more than an opening headed toward  encouraging an improvement in bilateral relations, there would  seem to be a more general intent aimed at less contructive  objectives.    In this respect, he added, it is important to point out that  those persons who would be allowed to travel to Cuba do not  include individuals who would cooperate with the country's  economic or scientific development.    Leon, author of several books on the blockade against Cuba,  emphasizes that the eventual U.S. Government measures constitute  a small favorable step within the context of American-Cuban  relations.

Saturday's edition of the official paper of the Communist  Party of Cuba mentions the use of several Spanish-language radio  stations to broadcast lies and insults against the population  and members of the Cuban community abroad who do not support  their campaign, and instead respect the accomplishments of the  country's social system.    As an example, GRANMA cites the radio commentaries of  journalist Agustin Camargo who recently asked for ""a three-day  license to kill in Cuba when the Revolution falls.""    Commenting on what it calls savagery, the GRANMA article  signed by Juan Marrero, compares that segment of immigrants to  the most well-known fascists in the world.    ""Neither hatred nor thirst for vengeance against Cuba have  been laid to rest by these people,"" the article states, while it  describes as just the Cuban Government's decision to exclude  elements with these characteristics from the upcoming meeting of  the emigre community.    Regarding this, GRANMA emphasizes that on the eve of ""The  Nation and the Emigre Community"" conference to be held next week  in Havana, ""messages of deep-rooted hatred toward the  revolution"" have intensified in Miami.    In this sense, the article mentions the threats issued by  the  Alpha 66 terrorist group, which has declared among its ""military  objectives"" all persons who visit Cuba, speak with its  authorities, or give the country direct or indirect support,  regardless of their nationality or the kind of support, warning  that they ""will suffer the consequences, inside or outside of  Cuba.""    In conclusion, GRANMA condemns those groups who ""only want  to  maintain the privileges they obtained at the expense of U.S.  Government funds, or to increase those privileges if they can  convert Cuba into a territory free for looting and pillaging.""    Other sources also have indicated that these rightist groups  are making threats against members of the Cuban community abroad  who have been invited to speak with the Cuban authorities.     "

Moscow urged  compromise in the crucial area of trade in nuclear materials and  announced it would send one of the Government's heaviest-hitters  to Brussels on 27 April with the aim of bringing the talks to an  end.    Alexandr Shokin, the minister responsible for the economy  and  foreign trade, wrote to the EU foreign affairs ministers,  meeting in Council in Luxembourg on 18 April, calling for their  ""cooperation"" in bringing the talks to ""an early and successful  conclusion."" Although there are officially three issues standing  in the way of the Treaty -- nuclear materials, rights for EU  ships flying non-EU flags, and the establishment of foreign  banks in Russia -- the stakes have now in reality boiled down to  the issue of cheap uranium imports into the Union. In his  letter, Mr. Shokin referred to the nuclear fuel trade problem as  the ""principal outstanding obstacle"" in the way of an Agreement  that would regularise EU-Russian political and economic  relations and get Russia on the same footing as Ukraine, which  penned a similar Partnership Agreement with the EU in March.    Russia wants trade in nuclear materials to be incorporated  into the Agreement along with other related issues such as  investment, nuclear nonproliferation, conversion of defence  industries, nuclear safeguards and environmental policy. The  EU's official stance has been until now that a separate  Agreement is needed to regulate Russian uranium exports to the  EU while France has taken a harder line in seeking a quota. The  Eurodif plant in Tricastin, France, produces 40 percent of  world's requirements of enriched uranium, and the Paris  Government is concerned this industry would be threatened by  Russia's enormous capacity to make the same product at much  lower prices.    Mr. Shokin acknowledged this fear in his letter, and said  Russia is ""prepared to provide assurances that its exports of  natural and enriched uranium to the Community will be  nondisruptive, avoiding sudden surges."" However, in return,  Russia would want assurances that the EU would avoid unilateral  measures ""disrupting mutual trade"" and would consult with  Russian Government if problems arose over time. Mr. Shokin  enclosed a draft exchange of letters between Russia and the EU,  including all his proposals.    In a statement at the end of the Council meeting, the  foreign  ministers said the Russian proposals ""merit careful study,"" and  called on the Commission to look into them with the intention of  seeking a joint response from the Council. Ministers confirmed  the ""great importance"" they attached to completing the  Partnership Agreement negotiations.     "

Mr. Minister, how do you reconcile your youth  with your ministry post?    [Robaina] First of all, I would like to say that a person  with certain responsibilities right now cannot be missing this  Sunday; what is important to me is the young people on whom Cuba  relies. I believe that today, and every Sunday, the young people  are present through their effort, work, and participation. I  believe that to reconcile this is not so hard, for several  reasons.    First, I am not as young as many think. Second, I believe  that Cuba's foreign policy is made by the people; in this, that  youth have a real and specific participation. On the other hand,  I do not think my youth is at the helm of the Ministry. The  Ministry and Cuba's foreign policy are made up of an  accumulation of youth who lead and conduct our foreign policies.  Therefore, I do not think my mission is the hardest.    [Rodriguez] You have just returned from a tour of eight  Asian  nations. What is your opinion of the trip?    [Robaina] I believe it was highly positive, particularly  since it was a remarkably open forum to tell the truth about our  project and to explain to the world that Cuba is not only  seeking the solutions it needs but has many highly positive and  successful things to offer, things needed by many worldwide,  particularly in that region. I believe that it is important for  us to thoroughly study that region which has so many economic  accomplishments in order to find out how many can be adapted to  our character, our ways, and the pressures we are subject to and  under which we are building our project.    [Cabada] You will be departing to Latin America shortly. I  would like to confirm the countries you will be visiting and  what your expectations are.    [Robaina] This is simply a follow-up to the effort being  made  in South America; this is one aspect of that effort. This trip  is in response to invitations from countries such as Argentina,  Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay. We seek the same thing  that Cuba has sought throughout the years with its foreign  policy: a forum to explain what we are doing, with all our  virtues and defects, and also a forum from which to learn.    When we speak of this, Latin America has a special place. I  believe that doing this as the Latin American summit nears gives  us an opportunity to turn that forum into what the Latin  American peoples hope it will become.     "

A spokesman for the [word indistinct]  ministry said no concessions will be made.

That  nation, which has not been further identified, would resell the  sugar on the international market. With the proceeds from the  sale, this nation would then pay Colombia for the oil sold to  Cuba.    An official spokesman said: We prefer a letter of credit. As  long as there are no payment guarantees, there will be no  negotiations. He explained that until now President Castro's  government has not made another proposal. The failure of the  negotiations, which are now practically suspended, would not be  due to international pressures exerted after the negotiations  were announced but because Ecopetrol's conditions for  negotiations of this type have not been met, the government said.

We are presenting a  radio interview with the chairman of the Georgian parliament and  head of state, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Batono Eduard, the  Abkhazian side again violated an agreement, the Geneva  Memorandum last week. In addition, the work of the commission  for drawing up the statute of Abkhazia, held in Moscow under UN  auspices and with the participation of the CSCE, was virtually  fruitless. Jointly with Yeltsin you have addressed Butrus  Ghali, emphasizing that all chances of a peaceful settlement  should be tried.    [Words indistinct] said on TV that any political decision is  better than war. And if this does not produce a result, if the  killing of the civilian population continues, what way will  remain?    [Shevardnadze] Good morning. I would not say that the Moscow  talks on a statute for Abkhazia were a complete failure.  Generally, talks about the statute will be complex and [words  indistinct]. The next stage should be in Geneva on the 22d and I  think the issue will be clearer then.    As for the principal problem of the issue, I mean an overall  settlement of the conflict, I believe there should be no doubt  that we were right to have chosen a peaceful way toward a  settlement from the very beginning in spite of the fact that it  appeared to be ineffective. A peaceful way is the best and most  reassuring way to settle conflicts in our time. Those who can  analyze all that has been happening on our planet for the last  20, 30, or 40 years will be convinced that a peaceful settlement  is the most reliable way.    Both the Russian president and I were guided by this as we  appealed to the UN Secretary General to have international  peacekeeping forces in their classical form deployed or, if that  were impossible, a Russian contingent would be a major force  there.    Every opportunity should be used. I realize that many  people feel upset when I keep speaking of a peaceful settlement  to the conflict. I am not really surprised that this can upset  someone whose house has been burned down and who does not know  when he will be able to return home. He will naturally be  looking for an extreme decision, which in his opinion could  represent an earlier return home and the beginning of a normal  life. But this is a superficial impression which is created by  emotions and it cannot be fruitful. I would like to say the  following. If we fail to bring in peacekeeping forces -- and  this is the only way out and the shortest way to peace -- if we  fail to bring in peacekeeping forces, (although I believe that  this can be done as a result of consultations in New York and  other capitals), if this fails and proves useless, everyone  should remember that if this proves to be ineffectual, the worst  thing will happen, there will be bloodshed.    I see this as a dreadful prospect. This will happen  spontaneously irrespective of the will of the Georgian  authorities or bodies of other countries. Processes will become  uncontrollable and the conflict will spread over large areas,  however grave it might be to think of this. Everyone should  understand this. As I say this I mean our listeners, the  listeners of our country, I mean the Abkhazian leaders who are  in Gudauta and Sukhumi, and of course members of the UN Security  Council and Russia in the first instance, because Russia has  understood the reality of this danger of the spread of the  conflict over large areas. Regardless of what we want,  additional forces will be dragged into the conflict and this  would be a disaster not only for Georgia but for this big region  as a whole.    [Oniani] You say that Russia understood it partially and  this was felt when several members of the Russian State Duma  made a statement on television last night. Almost the same  ideas were expressed. However, a politician differs from an  ordinary mortal by the need to take unpopular decisions without  being guided by emotions. At a parliament sitting you said that  the Abkhazian issue could not be settled without Russia's  participation. Your and Yeltsin's appeal says that if UN forces  cannot be deployed in the conflict zone, Russia is ready for  this. We are said to be asking Russia to do what Russia itself  has taken an interest in.    [Shevardnadze] I would like to make the official Russian  stance clear. Either international forces in their classical  form arrive, and Russia agrees to the participation of the  international forces and it will cooperate with the forces even  by being a part of those, or it will make a commitment to bring  in its contingent on a peace mission. There is no other way.  If we speak of a peace settlement, there should be either  international forces or a Russian contingent.    There is a third way, I mean another decision can be taken  within the CIS but this will apparently be a repetition of a  Tajik model. And this is obviously not quite desirable. It is  difficult to argue against the righteousness of this stance. I  mean the Russian statement that supports the introduction of  international forces but, if that is not possible, Russia will  undertake to bring in its contingent. It is really difficult to  argue against this. We ourselves are primarily interested in  what we are asking Russia to do. The idea that we are asking  Russia to do what Russia is interested in can be reversed like  this: We are asking Russia to do what we ourselves are  interested in. No other way out can be seen.    [Oniani] One deputy has suggested that Russia close off the  border and we shall fix Abkhazia.    [Shevardnadze] There is that idea. But this request is  rather naive and I think the main point is what I have just said.    [Oniani] I would like to remind you of your words said at  the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers. The whole country  should turn toward the economy. A morbid politization of our  community is a deviation from the proper coursel.    An anticrisis government program was made public last week.  How effective do you think this program will be and how likely  do you think the government crisis or even resignation is in the  near future in the light of numerous complaints against the  government and an idea that our government is not a unified  team?    [Shevardnadze] The presented program is a maximum of current  abilities. All existing forces participated in the work; I mean  ministries, agencies, institutes, individual experts, and so on.  The work took months. I also joined at the final stage and I  was also involved, in a way. The principal thing is that the  country should really turn toward the economy and everyone  should care about the economy and think and care about escaping  from the crisis.    The presented program is realistic. I said in a speech that  an optimistic scenario was mentioned as well as a pessimistic  scenario. I can say that the maximal version is a realistic  one. But it can be realistic only if we are able to find  additional resources to overcome the energy crisis.    Armenia receives several-fold less power and fuel and they  run 70 percent of their industry. The population experiences  extreme hardships there but they all realize that if the economy  stopped the country would lose all prospects for the future.    I do not mean that we can still take something away from the  population but we obviously have to look for additional  resources, additional sources of fuel and power. This could be  received either through foreign credits or other ways, such as  through relations with Russia or with Iran and a lot of other  ways.    As for an idea that there is not a unified team, I am not  aware of anyone in Georgia who is capable of summoning his  people and creating a united team. I think these ideas create a  very primitive image of a team. A team cannot be created just  like that. In order to create a team, like-minded people,  people who understand each other easily are needed and, in  addition, a very high professional level should be guaranteed  and this takes years. It needs years of experience and  sometimes decades.    Thus, we cannot demand that the present authorities do  something that is very difficult and almost impossible to do.  We have not got an ideal and strong team like this at the  moment but, anyway, the present Cabinet of Ministers is the most  we could afford in a difficult situation like this.    As for a government crisis, there will probably be certain  complications during the endorsement of the members of the  government by the parliament. I would like to ask everyone to  refrain from extreme demands. A government crisis will make the  desperate situation in the economy even more complicated and  difficult. Those who put forward revolutionary slogans  demanding, in particular, that the Cabinet of Ministers be  replaced, certain statesmen resign and so on are driving the  country to a deeper crisis. It is impossible that a person  learn how to be a minister in just three or four months. This  should be realized.    When we were changing the previous Cabinet, I was against it  because one needs at least one or two years to have an idea  about one's department. That is why we have to take care of the  people and we have to be more kind to individual statesmen and  even to the Cabinet. Today, we have to be guided by a common  responsibility rather than by a desire to amuse ourselves.  Unfortunately, the latter is often observed in one part of the  community and especially in the parliament.    [Oniani] I would like to recall yet another point from your  speech at the Cabinet of Ministers. You said: We have to  introduce private ownership as soon as possible. There are  people in the government, including the staff of the head of  state, who hamper the activities of entrepreneurs.    Incidentally, the mafia is not happy because of the  development of entrepreneurship in Georgia, either. They have a  significant network and not only in our republic, unfortunately.    [Shevardnadze] Speaking of the country's development in the  long run, of course proprietors, businessmen, industrialists  should be considered as major components of the society required  for the expansion of the economy. We have to do our best to  switch to the market economy as soon as possible. I agree with  you that this idea scares certain structures and it scares the  mafia, too, because a proprietor has a well-developed sense of  responsibility and aspiration to protect his own property, which  is the basis of his personal happiness.    Despite the opposition, this process must be sped up and it  will be sped up. Apart from that, our population has to realize  that something should be done so that a proprietor, an  entrepreneur will not become a leech. An antagonistic attitude  to leeches can be observed in people at the initial stage. We  have to support and help the establishment of serious business  and the preparation of a whole school of businessmen, the  businessmen who will come forward thanks to their intelligence,  cleverness, and hard work rather than dishonest ways. The  earlier we manage to establish businesslike ties and have such  proprietors on the scene, the sooner the country will find a way  to improve the situation.    [Oniani] You accepted the defense minister's resignation  last week and temporarily assumed the duties of minister. I  would like to recall your words at the meeting with the army  high command. I have been quoting you very often today but this  is due to necessity. The state has to provide for the army. The  army cannot exist on charity or depend on someone's mood. The  army cannot be built on sand. You also spoke about building a  modern Georgian Army. On what is your optimism based? Is there  a basis in Georgia to allow the building of a new army?    [Shevardnadze] When I speak about a new army I do not mean  that those who are in the armed forces now have to quit and new  people have to come in. When speaking with a certain optimism  that we will soon have a truly modern national army, I mean the  cadres who comprise the basis of our army now and who already  have combat experience. Many of those are model heroes and  brave fighters fully devoted to the interests of the country.  We were defeated but this loss is also a certain experience  which this generation has acquired. This is obviously one of  the bases for my optimism. The main thing is that we have  cadres.    Second, there are people, I mean in our community, who  realize the importance of the army and its purpose for the  building of an independent state. I believe that youth will say  a decisive word in the building of the army. I will do my best  to make military service the highest duty, an honorable mission,  and even a kind of privilege for the best of our youths.    My direct and active involvement in this process is due to  my  desire to use all my power and rights and have the army built on  a legal basis and financed through legal sources. And this  should improve two- and three-fold the conditions of the  servicemen rather than aggravate them. I did not use the word  privilege accidentally. Speaking of the army I also mean border  guards, interior troops, and all [word indistinct].    [Oniani] And a final question. An Armenian delegation led  by President Levon Ter-Petrosyan is arriving in Georgia today.  What is the chief purpose of this visit and is it not linked  with an idea you expressed during President Yeltsin's visit to  Tbilisi, namely, that it is necessary that leaders of the three  large Transcaucasian states meet regularly to handle conflicts  in the area. Plus Russia.    [Shevardnadze] We agreed to meet before. The Armenian  president was in London and he asked me to arrange this meeting  as soon as he returned. I spoke to Mr. Aliyev as well as Mr.  Ter-Petrosyan about the necessity of such meetings. All three  of us share a view that the meetings; regular, systematic  meetings are essential. These may start on a bilateral basis  and then later all three of us will probably meet. Then Russia  as well as other countries will be able to join us.    Obviously, a major topic will be a Caucasian dialogue and  how  promising, how reassuring, and realistic the beginning of a  Caucasian dialogue will be. Speaking of dialogue, I do not mean  an ordinary conversation. I mean a certain (?quorum) which will  be regulated chronologically; in other words we will meet two or  three times a year and discuss problems.    In addition, bilateral relations could predominate today,  problems that concern the two countries. We will have a serious  conversation. We have many interests in Armenia, and the  Armenians strongly depend on how well the Georgian  communications network works.    I would like to add that Mr. Aliyev will not be involved in  our present dialogue personally but I have had preliminary talks  with him and after my meeting with the Armenian president has  ended, my meeting with the Azernaijani president will take  place. I think we are approaching the phase when our contacts  are to become more vigorous and we have to do our best so that  the Caucasian factor will play its decisive role in fighting for  peace and stability in the region.

A very good afternoon to you, Alarcon.    [Alarcon] Good afternoon, Comrade.    [Alonso] We have been following your meetings very  attentively, in both Belgium and Germany -- with  parliamentarians, government representatives, and businessmen's  groups. Let us talk a little about the talks you have had in  France, please.    [Alarcon] In France we have talked with Deputy Andre  Santini,  who is the chairman of the production and exchange committee of  the [National] Assembly -- who, as a matter of fact, will be  arriving in Havana next Sunday [13 February] at the head of a  delegation from the French National Assembly. He is also the  president of the French National Assembly's Friendship With Cuba  group and a leader of one of the parties in the current French  Government.    In fact, we have just come from a very important meeting  with  comrade (Robert Hughes), who is the new national secretary of  the French Communist Party [PCF]. We met with him and a group of  comrades from that party. It was truly a very friendly meeting  -- there was a lot of camaraderie -- at which the PCF's very  clear policy of solidarity with Cuba was reiterated.    As you know, the PCF has been at the center of a growing  movement of solidarity with Cuba that has been expressed through  the ship of solidarity, and recently the plane that [word  indistinct] Cuba, with its group of persons of all leanings from  France, carrying, in addition, important material aid. And there  is much contact with friendship associations and with the entire  movement of solidarity with Cuba in this country, in which the  PCF has been (?at the very center).    Comrade (Hughes) reaffirmed to us very clearly the  continuity  of that policy on the part of the PCF, following the congress  during which he was elected national secretary. We brought him a  message from Comrade Fidel. It was truly a very gratifying, very  friendly conversation.    Tomorrow, we will meet with the president of the French  National Assembly and with the president of the Senate, and we  also have another meeting with French parliamentarians.    [Alonso] We understand that you and the delegation that you  are heading will be ending your tour of Europe next Friday [11  February].    [Alarcon] (?Yes) [Words indistinct] we will be back in Cuba.    [Alonso] If you were to make an overall assessment, how  would  you describe the talks and meetings in these three countries?    [Alarcon] I would say that, in the first place, there is a  great and growing interest in Cuba's situation. People want to  know about our problems, about our prospects, from a point of  view that I would describe as very open, very objective. We  really have talked to people of every inclination, every  ideological position, every point of view, and every profession  -- including important businessmen, especially in Germany. And  Cuba has encountered that open attitude toward what Cuba means  today, in the world, and also a growing empathy. I mean, I think  the stage of astonishment over how Cuba was able to survive the  tremendous blow of the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the  socialist bloc, etc., is over; now people are beginning, rather,  to study our experience.    Moreover, to many people in Europe, Cuba means the very  singular case of a country where material and economic  difficulties are being confronted while there is, at the same  time, an attempt to preserve such fundamental human values as  solidarity, respect for people's rights, etc.    Europe leaves one with a very interesting impression: One  walks the streets here and finds, all over the place, street  musicians, acrobats, people out there inventing things, to see  how they can survive -- in one of the planet's most developed  places but a place where the main theme is unemployment, is what  they call marginalized people, those on the margins of society.    (?I was just) seeing, over French television here, how the  level of unemployment in the western part of Germany already  exceeds 4 million. In the former GDR, the figures are even more  impressive. It goes as high as 20 percent of the work force in  parts of that country.    That is to say, there are very serious problems there. Many  people have no place to live. They found themselves in the  streets; and, in the streets, they sing, recite poetry, do  acrobatics, seek ways to get help from others in order to  survive. And they see the case of Cuba -- a poor, underdeveloped  country, but one where, collectively, making use of the wisdom  of all, we try to find ways to solve our problems while  preserving the kind of society that many truly find  inspirational, [repeats] many, going beyond affinities and....  [leaves sentence unfinished]    [Alonso] Of course. By contrast I wanted Alarcon -- because  it happens that a delegation of French businessmen is in our  country from the National Council of French Employers [Consejo  Nacional del Patronato Frances], a private organization that is  here to assess possibilities for doing business. I tell you this  because, I repeat: You are over there, and we have this other  delegation over here.    [Alarcon] [Words indistinct] has talked to me about that  visit, a very important visit. They are not simply a group of  businessmen. They represent the employers of France, the owners  of French businesses. There are some very important firms  represented there, heavy-weight firms. And, as I was saying to  you, to this is added the parliamentary delegation that arrives  Sunday, and a third group of French friends, promoters of Havana  cigars, which are very popular here. They, too, are going to be  in Havana these days. So there will soon be representatives of  the cream of French society over there.    As for this businessmen's delegation that is over there now:  Here in Paris, the people we have spoken with look upon it with  great interest, and also as evidence of an interest in studying  the Cuban market and establishing increasingly solid ties.    [Alonso] Thank you very much, Alarcon, for your words for  the  ""Doing Radio"" program. Have a good return trip.    [Alarcon] Thank you.     "

He said, just as he did during his previous  travels to other regions, he has encountered understanding and  respect throughout this trip, which is what Cuba expected.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Robaina said the  objective of his trek is to communicate with the Latin American  community, of which Cuba is a member despite those who have  tried to tear her away from it.    After describing some of his previous tours to Africa, Asia,  and the Caribbean, he said Cuba, by no means, is dragging its  woes around the world, as some have said; on the contrary, Cuba  has many things to offer, as a result of her progress in the  fields of science, technology, education, tourism, and others.  There are many other nations interested in these achievements,  which pave the way for integration and trade.    Regarding Cuba's efforts to resolve its current problems,  Robaina spotlighted the opening of new areas to foreign  investment, in which Cuba has the raw materials but lacks the  capital, the technology, and the markets.    When asked about the importance of the scheduled ""The Nation  and the Emigre Community"" conference, to be held in Havana, he  said this is just another event that has no bearing on the  country's survival, because that is related more to the people's  efforts to resist and to their unyielding determination.    The meeting is directed more at promoting relations with the  emigre community, he said. He refused to comment on the  hysteria the meeting has triggered among extreme right-wing  sectors, as this hostile activity only confirms how appropriate  the meeting is.    Regarding the minuscule groups promoting such activity, he  said simply one can only tell the truth about Cuba through the  difficulties and needs, and those who have profited from these  needs do not even deserve acknowledgement.    His first event in Peru, where he arrived after visiting  Uruguay and after a short stop in Buenos Aires, was a meeting  with almost 100 Cuban physicians, sugar industry technicians,  and sports trainers working in Peru. He updated them on the  current situation in Cuba, the efforts to overcome the problems,  and the need to represent and defend the nation with strong and  credible arguments.    He told PRENSA LATINA that while he was in Argentina he  stressed the fact that each Cuban represents the island. He  took advantage of the stopover in Buenos Aires to meet Cuban  troubadour Silvio Rodriguez, who is touring the Argentine  capital. Robaina said singing to the Argentines is another form  of foreign policy, because Rodriguez is telling everyone about  the Cuban situation through his songs.    The Peruvian newspaper LA REPUBLICA, in an interview with  Cuban physician Dr. Milvio Ramirez, highlighted the importance  of Cuba's activities of cooperation. Ramirez is a heart surgeon  who has performed more than 100 operations in the northern city  of Chiclayo, 780 km from Lima.     "

US secretary of state Warren Christopher said the administration was not seeking President Castro's removal, even though it blamed him for the flood of refugees leaving Cuba this month. 'If he moves toward democracy in a tangible, significant way, we'll respond in a carefully calibrated way,' he told the CBS television programme, Face the Nation. He said the US sought peaceful, democratic change in Cuba. Meanwhile, President Castro made a concession to the US over the refugees by ordering police and coastguards to stop unsafe boats and rafts carrying children from leaving the country, according to a Cuban Sunday newspaper. A meeting between the US and Cuba to discuss the refugee problem is scheduled to take place in New York on Wednesday or Thursday. The number of refugees has fallen recently because stormy weather has deterred many from attempting the crossing. US officials said Cubans also now understood that they would not get into the country if they fled by boat. Report, Page 3   Countries:-  USZ  United States of America.     CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.

The businessmen  had been meeting in Havana since Monday. PECA's final  communique stressed the need for the U.S. Government to lift the  blockade against Cuba.    In a communique released to the press at the end of the  meeting and read by PECA Coordinator Roberto Solis, it was  reported that during the past three days the entrepreneurs  continued to explore investment possibilities in Cuba that will  be possible when the blockade comes to an end. The document  added that the conference scheduled by the Cuban Government for  April must contribute to normalizing relations between the  country and Cuban emigrees, which for more than three decades  have been negligible and intermittent.    The Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs praised  the fraternal and respectful atmosphere that prevailed during  all of their discussions -- discussions in which specific  proposals were made.    Upon closing the seminar, Sergio Corrieri, the president of  ICAP -- the Cuban Friendship with the Peoples Institute --  stressed that although there were differences of opinion, all  statements by the Cuban-American professionals and entrepreneurs  will be analyzed because they were made within a framework of  understanding that must exist between Cubans here and those  Cubans in the United States who have adopted a constructive  attitude toward the Cuban revolutionary process.

The  establishment of an embassy for the Eastern Caribbean in  Barbados, the normalization of diplomatic relations with  Grenada, and the establishment of ties with Antigua and Barbuda  helped to close Cuba's diplomatic circle with its closest  neighbors.    After years of mutual indifference, Cuba and the Lesser  Antilles began to pay more attention to each other this decade  as a result of the debacle in the socialist camp and the former  Soviet Union and the formation of large trade blocs, two events  that severely affected the foreign trade of many countries.    Deprived of 85 percent of its trade, which consisted of  barter agreements and other beneficial agreements with the USSR  and the rest of the socialist countries of Eastern Europe,  Havana saw the need to promote trade on a lesser scale but with  a greater variety of Latin American and Caribbean countries.    In fact, relations with the Caribbean Common Market  (Caricom)  date back to the late seventies. Through agreements with this  regional integration organization, hundreds of students from the  English-speaking islands studied at Cuban universities.    A particular thread of persuasions make up the web of  relationships between Cuba and the Anglo-Caribbean, a region  that gave ample proof of its independent spirit when four of its  most important members -- Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica,  and Barbados -- established ties with the island in the 1960's  and 1970's, during the full enforcement of the OAS prohibition  -- instigated by the United States -- that mandated the  diplomatic isolation of Cuba in the hemisphere.    In bilateral issues, the Caribbean nations were usually  cautious and exhibited their well-known British phlegmatic  nature -- a product of their colonial heritage -- before  establishing ties beyond formalities, at international forums  the Antillean group always voted with Cuba.    Subjects such as the defense of the Caribbean as a peace  zone, condemnation of the use of force anywhere in the world,  apartheid in South Africa, and [support for] independence  movements, united the Spanish and English-speaking Antilles into  a single bloc.    On a strictly economic plane, it became obvious Cuba needed  to join Caricom, which procrastinated implementing its own  decisions for full integration, something that even today lacks  a solid basis: free trade, a common currency, and the freedom to  travel and to contract labor from among the member states.    Some of the smaller states' prevalent fear of a presumed  overwhelming predominance of Cuba over the members of the  Anglo-Caribbean community gave way to a spirit of cooperation,  once it was proven that one side needed regional integration as  much as the other.    Although Cuba has twice as much territory and people as all  of the Caricom countries combined, it is struggling through an  economic and financial crisis that forces it to expand as soon  as possible into markets by offering its products and services  for which, especially in biotechnology and medicine, there is  still room in the Caribbean.    In addition, an initial obstacle -- how countries which  traditionally depend on tourism as a source of income could deal  with the take-off of the Cuban tourist trade -- was solved by  the admission of Cuba into the Caribbean Tourism Organization  (CTO).    Wisely, the smaller tourist island paradises in the region  --  Jamaica and the Bahamas taking the lead -- decided to share  instead of compete against Cuba, when faced with the  irreversible reality of the future rebirth of the Pearl of the  Caribbean as the area's preferred vacation spot.    Branwell Shepherd, a Jamaican businessman whose  Salasaventura  travel agency has a multi-destination tourism program with the  island, told PRENSA LATINA that ""once the U.S. blockade against  the Cuban Government is lifted, the influx of U.S. tourists will  be unstoppable.""    Under these circumstances, said Shepherd, the rest of the  Caribbean nations must be willing to reach mutually beneficial  agreements with Cuba, instead of lamenting over something that  is inevitable.    Sources at the Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples  (ICAP), which handles most of the donations received by Cuba,  revealed that 50 percent of the donations received in 1993 came  from the Caribbean countries.    ""We have raised our voice many times in defense of the  smaller countries' right to exist, and have expressed our  opinion at international forums. However, we have sometimes  neglected our relationship with the Lesser Antilles, our closest  neighbors, and this is now one of our most important political  priorities,"" Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina told PRENSA LATINA  last November during his tour of seven nations in the area.

In Phnom Penh, Robaina will meet with the president of the  National Assembly and the prime minister of the Kingdom of  Cambodia. This is the first official visit to Cambodia by a  high-level official of the Cuban Government following the return  to peace and stability in that nation.    In an exclusive interview with Radio Rebelde, Robaina spoke  about the first phase of his Asian trip.    [Begin Robaina recording] Nowadays, we cannot speak of a  worldwide diplomatic offensive that excludes such important  regions. When we speak of important regions, we cannot forget  this region, which is immensely wealthy, but which, in addition  to that, has experienced a significant economic boom in recent  years.    I believe that Cuba is in need today of many points of view.  Cuba has many needs and these needs are possibilities for  investment for many people. Undoubtedly, many of our needs  represent opportunities for investment by countries in this  region.    There is an undisputed economic boom in these countries that  we need to analyze. We need to do this to see what works, what  is truly adaptable to our circumstances. This is why I think we  need to talk about this region. I believe that knocking on such  doors as those of Indonesia, Malaysia, and India are venues,  alternatives, and possibilities for work and exchanges under new  game rules -- we are talking mutual exchange.    I do not want anyone to think that Cuba is going around  asking for a handout. Cuba has many needs, but also many things  it can offer the world and this region. I have found here great  interest in possibilities, great willingness to open exchange  possibilities in areas such as health, medicine, biotechnology,  and sports -- as odd as it sounds.    There are many things that have resulted from our social  investments that are of interest here, but have not been  successful here. [end recording]    After Cambodia, Robaina will visit India, Malaysia, and  Vietnam -- the last leg of his seven-country Asian tour.     "

He said the  meetings with the presidents were excellent, and there was great  communication. This visit, he pointed out, provided great  possibilities for explaining the island's current situation, the  measures which are being adopted, and the importance of the  struggle against the U.S. blockade in our conditions.    Lage added that he also met with other leaders, officials,  and businessmen of those nations and he noticed there is a very  positive atmosphere for strengthening the political, economic,  and social relations. With regard to the most outstanding points  of these meetings, the Cuban vice president said:    [Begin Lage recording] I think the most outstanding aspects  were respect for the Cuban Revolution, interest in our country's  situation, the growing awareness of the need to fight the U.S.  blockade, an understanding of the measures the country is  adopting to adapt to the circumstances we are living under, and  the possibilities these measures will provide for an economic  integration with Latin America.    I believe the results have stimulated the participation  process with investments in the Cuban economy, strengthened  economic and commercial relations, and opened (?possibilities)  of exporting Cuban products to those countries in the region.

Prieto  adds that over 450,000 tourists were served in 1993. Ninety-five  flights a week by 29 foreign airlines arrive in Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 13 January reports that over  800,000 crates of fresh grapefruit have been exported during the  current grapefruit harvest on the Isle of Youth.    Radio Reloj at 1505 GMT on 13 January notes that Varadero's  tourist organizations took in $188 million in 1993, a figure  much higher than 1992, but $12 million less than called for  under the 1993 plan.    Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 13 January reports that  ""the ecumenical council today presented the official certificate  of a donation of two biological laboratories to the Roberto  Fernandez and Sexto Congreso agricultural-livestock production  cooperatives in Matanzas Province. The agricultural laboratories  cost over 200,000 pesos.""    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 14 January carries the following  reports:    Light Industry Establishment No. 122 in Pinar del Rio plans  to deliver 1 million meters of fabric covers to the province's  tobacco plantations on 20 January. Other Pinar del Rio  textile-industry centers have guaranteed three fourths of the 3  million meters the province needs. This work began on 8  December. Over 400,000 meters of textile have already been  produced, with 40,000 meters being produced daily. Establishment  No. 122 usually makes military cloaks, backpacks, and other such  articles.    The Third International Caribbean Fair will be held on 28  June in Santiago de Cuba during the Second Businessmen's  Meeting, which is part of the effort to incorporate Cuba into  the world market. This meeting will also encourage business and  economic partnerships. Installing the organizing committee,  Cuban Chamber of Commerce President Carlos Martinez Salsamendi  stressed that the goal is to strengthen trade ties with other  countries.    A third of the near 4,000 tons of metallic and aluminum  structures produced last year by the Paco Cabrera Enterprise in  Las Tunas Province have been sold for hard currency under the  system for self-financing established by that enterprise. The  products were earmarked mainly for nickel installations in Moa  and projects of the Cubanacan and (Simex) corporations, as well  as other organizations and agencies that operate in hard  currency.    A group of businessmen from the Canary Islands is on a work  visit to Sancti Spiritus Province. The visitors made a donation  of assorted articles to Cabaiguan Municipality.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 14 January reports that Albert  Fleming, governor of St. Martin, met with children from the  Presencia de Lenin school for children without parents, to whom  he made a donation of clothing and school supplies.

Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 15 January reports that the (Sagnav  I)  Enterprise in Santa Clara manufactured over 3.04 million bags in  1993. The bags were earmarked for the sugar industry and for use  in rice production.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Holguin's basic  electric power organization repaired ""close to 400"" transformers  in 1993, thereby reducing the need for imports and saving the  nation over $120,000.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 15 January reports the following:    ""While in 1989, the excess currency in circulation in Cuba  was 4.163 billion pesos, there is today over 10 billion pesos of  excess currency circulating, and it is believed that figure is  going to continue to increase.""    (Luo Hung), a PRC Embassy officer in Cuba, in a message of  greeting over local radio on the Isle of Pines, highlighted the  ties of friendship that unite the Chinese and Cuban people, and  donated books and pamphlets the municipal library.    ""The National Water Resources Institute considers the  preservation of the patrimony accumulated by the Revolution,  enterprises, and the irrigation system a priority task for  1994."" In 1958, the nation's reservoirs could hold only 46  million cubic meters; they can today hold 9 billion cubic  meters. Cuba today has 218 dams, thousands of km of canals, and  a great number of costly pieces of equipment. It is also  building several aqueducts, one of which -- the Santiago de Cuba  aqueduct, currently under construction -- will have cost, when  completed, $40 million pesos.    Radio Havana Cuba at 0000 GMT on 15 January reports the  following:    Enrique Correa, minister secretary general of the Chilean  Government, announced that the State Bank of Chile has granted  its Cuban counterpart a special loan of almost $10 million for  the purchase of foodstuffs. The minister said that the loan was  approved by Chilean President Patricio Aylwin and is part of the  economic opening policy between Cuba and Chile. According to  Correa, this will allow other banks to follow Chilean investors  and businesses which already have serious trade ties with Cuba.     "

Mr. Robaina, who is leading an eight-member government  delegation, told newsmen that the international community is  ignorant about the difficulties the United States blockade of  Cuba has imposed on the people during the past 35 years. That  is why the government has launched a worldwide diplomatic  offensive to let the world know the truth about the embargo. He  said the blockade has denied Cuba her rightful place on the  international market because it has virtually been impossible to  open the country up for foreign investment.    Mr. Robaina said in the face of all these atrocities, Cubans  believe that they have been able to survive the worst of tests.  He said no other form of pressure, apart from respect for the  dignity of Cubans can resolve the island's impasse with the  United States.    The foreign minister repeated that Cuba is ready for  dialogue. However, she will negotiate under one condition only,  and that is mutual respect for each other's dignity and  sovereignty.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:                In the Matter of: IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. Application for authority to lease and operate facilities for the provision of direct telex service between the United States and Cuba.           File No. ITC94211        Order and Authorization            Adopted:     April 14, 1994        Released:     April 22, 1994           By the Chief, International Facilities Division:    1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned application filed by the IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. (IDB) requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision of direct telex service. The application was placed on the Commission's public notice and no comments were received.    2. IDB proposes to provide international telex service between the U.S. and Cuba via the INTELSAT satellite located at 325.5   E.L. using appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities owned or leased by it or its affiliates. Specifically, IDB requests authority to lease from Comsat and operate one 9.6 kbps analog SCPC circuit to be used together with matching facilities provided by INTERTEL S.A. (INTERTEL) of Cuba to derive up to 46 telex circuits with the use of TDM equipment. IDB states that it has already entered into an operating agreement with INTERTEL for the establishment of direct telex service between the U.S. and Cuba. Under the terms of its agreement with INTERTEL, there will be a 50/50 split of the prevailing $3.00 per minute accounting rate for telex services. 1  IDB states that it will initiate service within one year.          1     IDB notes that the prevailing accounting rate for telex services is $3.00 per minute which is typical for most Caribbean, Central American and Latin American countries. In comparison, the prevailing accounting rate for switched voice services between the U.S. and Cuba is $1.20 per minute. IDB explains that it is common for the telex accounting rate between two countries to be much higher than the switched voice accounting rate.          3. IDB states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application since it will result in the rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. IDB notes that it is virtually impossible to make a telephone call from the U.S. to Cuba. Because of the continuing dispute over the appropriate switched voice accounting rate and the disposition of blocked funds, U.S. carriers have been unable to expand direct telephone service between the U.S. and Cuba. IDB proposes to offer direct telex service as a means to satisfy a small portion of the enormous demand for telecommunications between the U.S. and Cuba.    4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.'' 2  Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) The proposals must have the potential to be operational within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4) proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary of the notification by the FCC in the Federal Register.          2     Letter dated July 22, 1993, from Richard C. Beaird, Acting U.S. Coordinator and Director, Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy, U.S. Department of State to FCC Chairman James H. Quello.         5. Upon consideration of IDB's application, we find that a grant of its application will serve the public interest subject to the conditions set forth below. IDB's application is consistent with the Executive Branch's general guidelines set forth in the Department of State's letter. IDB states that it will initiate service within one year, and expects to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. IDB's proposed use of INTELSAT facilities and appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities satisfies the requirements that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba. With respect to IDB's proposed 50/50 split of a $3.00 per minute accounting rate, the Department of State in a follow-up letter dated March 14, 1994 found a $3.00 per minute accounting rate for telex service to be consistent with the guidelines contained in its July 22, 1993 letter. Furthermore, the Department of State states that it has no objection to our approval of the application. 3           3     Letter dated March 14, 1994, from Richard C.

Under the terms of its agreement with INTERTEL, there will be a 50/50 split of the prevailing $3.00 per minute accounting rate for telex services. 1  IDB states that it will initiate service within one year.          1     IDB notes that the prevailing accounting rate for telex services is $3.00 per minute which is typical for most Caribbean, Central American and Latin American countries. In comparison, the prevailing accounting rate for switched voice services between the U.S. and Cuba is $1.20 per minute. IDB explains that it is common for the telex accounting rate between two countries to be much higher than the switched voice accounting rate.          3. IDB states that the public interest would be served by a grant of its application since it will result in the rapid introduction of new lines of telecommunications between the United States and Cuba. IDB notes that it is virtually impossible to make a telephone call from the U.S. to Cuba. Because of the continuing dispute over the appropriate switched voice accounting rate and the disposition of blocked funds, U.S. carriers have been unable to expand direct telephone service between the U.S. and Cuba. IDB proposes to offer direct telex service as a means to satisfy a small portion of the enormous demand for telecommunications between the U.S. and Cuba.    4. In a letter dated July 22, 1993, the U.S. Department of State informed the Commission of the Executive Branch's general policy guidelines for implementation of the telecommunications provisions of the Cuban Democracy Act, which provides that ``telecommunication services between the United States and Cuba shall be permitted.'' 2  Among the policy guidelines are the following requirements: (1) The proposals must have the potential to be operational within a year; (2) settlements must not be more favorable to Cuba than the current 50/50 split of the $1.20 per minute accounting rate; (3) proposals must be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba; (4) proposals must utilize modes of communications already in place between the U.S. and Cuba; and (5) carriers shall report the number of circuits activated by facility on June 30 and December 31 of each year and on the one-year anniversary of the notification by the FCC in the Federal Register.          2     Letter dated July 22, 1993, from Richard C. Beaird, Acting U.S. Coordinator and Director, Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy, U.S. Department of State to FCC Chairman James H. Quello.         5. Upon consideration of IDB's application, we find that a grant of its application will serve the public interest subject to the conditions set forth below. IDB's application is consistent with the Executive Branch's general guidelines set forth in the Department of State's letter. IDB states that it will initiate service within one year, and expects to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. IDB's proposed use of INTELSAT facilities and appropriately licensed existing earth station facilities satisfies the requirements that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba. With respect to IDB's proposed 50/50 split of a $3.00 per minute accounting rate, the Department of State in a follow-up letter dated March 14, 1994 found a $3.00 per minute accounting rate for telex service to be consistent with the guidelines contained in its July 22, 1993 letter. Furthermore, the Department of State states that it has no objection to our approval of the application. 3           3     Letter dated March 14, 1994, from Richard C. Beaird, Acting U.S. Coordinator and Director, Bureau of International Communications and Information Policy, U.S. Department of State, to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt.          "

Radio Reloj at 1933 GMT on 23 May reports that the Antonio  Maceo power plant in Santiago de Cuba is resuming operations  after being off-line for two days because of weather conditions.    Radio Reloj at 1942 GMT on 23 May reports that the Mercado  S.A. tourism group, which promotes scientific tourism in Cuba,  brought more than 7,000 tourists to Cuba and grossed $2 million  during 1993.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 24 May  report that after successfully completing their six-month goal,  Ciego de Avila oil workers are determined to recover first place  in the Black Gold program. Oil workers have extracted 34,000  tons from the province's four oil deposits.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0000 GMT on 25 May  report that members of the German Communist Party presented a  donation of $14,000 to a medical center in Cerro Municipality,  Havana City Province.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 25 May reports that the 1993-94  tobacco harvest has virtually concluded in Pinar del Rio  Province following the harvesting of 24.2 million poles of  tobacco -- 450,000 more than in the previous harvest although  121 fewer caballerias had been planted. The harvest should  result in 300,000 quintals of tobacco -- 39,000 more than last  year. The tobacco crop accrues $100 million annually for the  Cuban economy. Pinar del Rio Province is the source of 70  percent of the national tobacco crop.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 26 May reports that a Ciego de  Avila work group is close to reaching its goal in the recovery  of spare parts used in the national energy program. Each piece  of equipment that is rebuilt constitutes a savings of  approximately $1,000. This 10-man work group is also outstanding  for its efficient use of electromagnets, nuts and bolts, and  resistors and for recycling lubricants for electric devices.    The radio also reports that innovators from the Ministry of  Construction's Enterprise No. 1 in Pinar del Rio Province have  developed a cement-hardener made from molasses and other  materials available locally. This guarantees a 10 percent  savings in cement and makes the cement much easier to use. This  saves Cuba from having to buy a chemical substance on the  international market to use for that purpose.

Have you been able to learn what  is being done? What aid has the country received from the  international community?    [Castro] Not much here in Santiago de Cuba. The country  provided the money needed, especially to rebuild homes, repair  mattresses, to give the people back what they lost, to purchase  cement. Almost all has been done with money provided by the  country. Much has been done in Guantanamo, the most affected  province, Sagua, and Santiago. Guantanamo was strongly affected  by the rains. Just imagine what it was like to have 700  millimeters of rain fall on the area in 36 hours. This happened  in one municipality. It was tremendous. If affected the  coffee, tuber, and orchard crops. However, the storm of the  century caused more damage than these rains. The storm of the  century affected many provinces. However, this recent storm  caused much damage in Guantanamo. It destroyed thousands of  homes.    [Reporter] Years ago you made a speech at Cespedes Park. You  said that there was much for the Revolution to do in the future.  At that time, you said that the people had all their hopes set  on the rebel army and on you. However, you told them you did  not want to be a demagogue and admitted that difficult times lay  ahead. A few minutes ago you repeated those words.    [Castro] When I entered Havana on 8 January, I stressed that  even more. I warned the people that even more difficult times  lay ahead. I told the people that.    [Reporter] And you have repeated those same words today.    [Castro] I did. Being a demagogue would be lying to the  people. It would be a lie to tell the people that the problems  are small and that the path ahead is an easy one to travel.    [Reporter] Comparing....    [Castro, interrupts] We are enduring a test no other country  has ever endured. We are the only country to endure it; it is a  tremendous test.    [Reporter] In your opinion, [words indistinct] the  Revolution?    [Castro] As if we were starting all over again. The  struggle is much harder, but we have more people who are more  revolutionary, more aware, better prepared. This revolutionary  contingent must win this battle. It is better prepared and more  aware. No other country in the world has waged a battle as  difficult as the one Cuba has waged. We have been resisting the  empire for the past 35 years. That is an unheard of prowess. We  do not really realize what this has meant, what victoriously  resisting the United States for the past 35 years has meant.  The United States is trying to take advantage,  opportunistically take advantage of the fact that the socialist  bloc has disappeared. The most extraordinary thing is that  despite the disappearance of the socialist bloc, we continue to  challenge the United States and continue to wage our battle.  This is a first in the history of Cuba. I have no doubts that  this generation is waging the most difficult and most heroic  battle in Cuba's history. You, all of you, are waging this  battle.    [Reporter] Tell us how you spent the last day of the year.    [Castro] I spent the last day of the year meditating a bit  about today's event. I rested. I rested on the last day of the  year. It was a hectic and tiring month; I was tired. I knew  that I had to be here today, that I had to come here today. I  spent almost the whole day reading, but I was reading about  other things. I read about economics and international matters.  I also read a bit of fiction. What I did was rest. At  midnight I went to visit some friends.     "

Following speeches in which Melendez and Ruiz voiced great  satisfaction about the results of the negotiations, the Spanish  secretary of state told the press that Spain maintains a line of  credit granted to Cuba in the amount of $40 million.    Apolonio Ruiz said he trusts that trade with Cuba will  increase as a result of the agreements that have been signed and  the Cuban Government's measures that promote an increase in  internal demands through tourism and the people having an access  to convertible currency. He added that trade between the two  countries will also increase in the long run through an increase  in Cuban domestic production.

Robaina said: ""If it is an `America's Summit,' Cuba  has earned a place there because, regardless of any different  economic models, the summit will lack political plurality if we  are excluded.""    Robaina also discussed the upcoming Ibero-American Summit,  scheduled for June in Cartagena de Indias (Colombia). He said  Cuba hopes that ""we, the American countries, will be able to  meet without receiving orders from the United States."" Robaina  added: ""Cuba hopes the Cartagena Summit will issue resolutions  and not merely express intentions as in the past three summits.""    The upcoming Ibero-American Summit is one of the goals of  the  Cuban Foreign Minister's three-day official visit to Uruguay and  will be a goal of the visits he will subsequently make to Peru,  Argentina, and Paraguay within a ""political-economical  offensive"" as he described it himself.    The Cuban Government hopes to receive more concrete support  from the Ibero-American Summit against the U.S. trade ""blockade""  on Cuba. The foreign minister added: ""It is not necessary to ask  for (Latin American) political support against the blockade  because we already have it. Now this support must be translated  into investments.""    Nevertheless, the quest for these investments during  Robaina's current tour is of ""a preparatory nature,"" without  hopes for concrete results. ""Until we honor our debts to these  countries there will be an atmosphere that does not contribute  to striking more significant relations,"" Robaina said.    Cuba owes about $1.2 billion to Argentina and $33 million to  Uruguay. The foreign minister said the Cuban Government intends  to reduce these debts by delivering goods (specially medicines)  and, above all, by getting the creditors to invest in Cuba.    Concerning his subsequent stops, Robaina noted he already  has  a confirmed meeting with Argentine President Carlos Menem, a  Latin American leader who has been very critical of the  government system in Cuba. A meeting with Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori has still not been confirmed. A meeting with  Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy is much more complex  because there are no diplomatic relations between Paraguay and  Cuba and, therefore, Robaina's visit to this country is  unofficial.    Robaina emphasized: ""During this tour, my task involves  explaining to the respective presidents the current Cuban  situation, which is extremely complex. At this moment, our top  priority involves finding an economic model that will allow us  to integrate ourselves into today's world without giving up our  political system's sacred achievements.""    In Montevideo, the Cuban foreign minister met President Luis  Alberto Lacalle and Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu. Although his  official visit ended on 6 April, Robaina will stay in  Montevideo, on a private visit, until 8 April.    The Uruguayan politicians did not make any remarks on the  meetings, even though both of them openly expressed their  government's position, favoring a democratic opening of the  Cuban system that will allow its integration into Latin America  by reconciling its government system with those prevailing in  the rest of the continent.

0,FT934-6462 ,"FT934-6462 _AN-DKYDLAACFT 931125   FT  25 NOV 93 / Manley leads Cuba talks for CW: Castro regime relaxing stance on investments      By CANUTE JAMES and ANDREW ADONIS      KINGSTON, LONDON   Mr Michael Manley, the former Jamaican prime minister, has been recruited by Cable  Wireless, the UK telecommunications group, to lead negotiations with the Cuban government about possible CW involvement in modernising Cuba's telephone network. The talks signal a further relaxation by the Castro regime in its attitude to foreign investment. Earlier this year it went some way towards legalising use of the dollar in Cuba, and has promised further currency liberalisation. The Cuban government is believed to be talking to at least two other telecommunications operators besides CW, including Telefonica, the Spanish state operator which has significant interests in Latin America. No US telecoms company appears to be involved. CW, whose interests centre on the UK and past and present UK dependencies, operates in 18 territories across the Caribbean region. It owns 80 per cent of Telecommunications of Jamaica, and has significant operations in Barbados, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago. Mr Manley, who resigned his premiership in March 1992, said he had already visited Cuba on CW's behalf and had met President Fidel Castro and other leading government officials. He said he told them that CW had invested heavily in Jamaica to improve the island's telecommunications, concentrating on building networks in rural areas. Mr John Carrington, CW's Caribbean director, said talks were at a 'very preliminary' stage, but the company was 'very keen' to operate in Cuba if it could be arranged without offending US sensibilities. Cuba's state telecommunications company already has a joint venture with a private Mexican company to operate a cellular mobile network. However, the antiquated fixed-line network is a state monopoly, offering lines to only a tiny fraction of the 11m population. In July the US State Department relaxed restrictions on telecommunications companies seeking to provide phone links to Cuba, letting Cuba receive half of future telephone revenues for international calls.

For those  companies, organizations, or institutions that are interested in  promoting changes, in transforming the management of their  scientific activities in the quest for more efficient service,  the first technological promotion center was dedicated in  Camaguey.    This scientific and technical institution is headed by  experts, who since 1987 have been working in the management and  organization of the territory. They offer qualified and reliable  services. This is a center which groups a small team of  researchers and consultants, who must systematically work in the  companies promoting technological development and new  experience. It is a center that must fight to establish a style  of work which is totally new, a dynamic and agile style to solve  problems which are closely related to the companies' main  activities.    This center is based on a continuous exchange of  technologies  and experience with similar organizations, both in Cuba and  abroad. It has modern equipment for processing, storing, and  transmitting information. It will also work as a consulting firm  and a supplier of technological and commercial information, and  in personnel training programs.    In a first test program, it has offered services to several  companies, such as a cement factory, the Camaguey tourism  company, and the production scientific institute.

0,FT932-12494 ,"FT932-12494 _AN-DD1B4ADWFT 930428   FT  28 APR 93 / Leading Article: Now for the hard part   WESTERN GOVERNMENTS have reacted with palpable, and understandable, relief to the vote of confidence which Russian voters registered in their president on Sunday. Having invested so much political capital in supporting Boris Yeltsin and his economic policies over the preceding month, they could not fail to be gratified that those long-suffering citizens who voted saw fit to approve of both by a convincing margin. But it is far too early for anyone to breathe easily about the future of Russian reform. On the contrary, the most painful and urgently needed decisions are yet to come. It is far from clear how or when President Yeltsin will take them, and whether his government is either inclined or equipped to make them stick. But without decisive action now to curb inflation and stabilise the economy, backed with western aid as promised by foreign and finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrial nations in Tokyo two weeks ago, the danger of a hyperinflationary collapse is bound to grow stronger by the week. Mr Yeltsin's essential problem is the struggle with his opponents in the Congress of People's Deputies, which the referendum result has done little to resolve. However strong his popular mandate, the president still has scant prospect of persuading deputies to accept a new constitution that will do them out of a job. If he fails, he may himself set a date for new parliamentary elections. Either way, Russia seems set for several more months of political uncertainty, heightened in the autumn by another election campaign. It is scarcely a climate in which to expect rational economic policy-making. More likely, on the evidence of pledges to increase wages, pensions and credit to industry made by both president and parliament during the weeks before the referendum, it is a period of pork-barrel promises and intensifying inflationary pressures, something that the Russian economy will be unable to stand for very much longer. The immediate task is complicated by increasingly obvious divisions on the economy within the government itself. While ministers are unanimous about the need to control inflation, they have been all too ready to sanction the granting of new credits to bankrupt state enterprises. Ostensibly united in their commitment to the market, the president and government have failed to articulate a plausible strategy for getting there or to give the populace a coherent explanation of the choices they face. If anything, the result of Sunday's referendum has thrown those choices into even starker relief. It showed that President Yeltsin remains the best hope for Russian reform, and that if he chooses to push ahead with policies which will make economic and political change irreversible, he should be able to carry the majority with him. As important, the campaign exposed the intellectual bankruptcy among Mr Yeltsin's most vocal opponents. They know what they do not like, yet have nothing coherent to put in its place. But the campaign also demonstrated the emergence of a new political class arguing persuasively that talk of a so-called 'third way', in which change would somehow be made less painful, is an illusion. In practice, this alternative route will either lead back towards a command economy, or to chaos, or possibly to both at once. Although the president's instincts tell him to seek compromise, he should follow the suggestions of those who understand the choices Russia actually faces. This is the message western governments should waste no opportunity to convey to Russia's leaders over the next few weeks as they prepare to back their support for Mr Yeltsin with a fresh injection of money. The so-called 'systemic transformation facility' which the IMF plans to start disbursing in June, without applying strict conditions, is a clear if risky acknowledgement that a politically stable and reforming Russia is a prize well worth striving for. If it works, it will help keep the economy ticking over and contain inflation through what promises to be a turbulent summer. Mr Yeltsin cannot afford to relax.

The vehicles belong to the U.S. organization Pastors for  Peace, which advocates the lifting of the blockade imposed by  the United States on Cuba 33 years ago.    Israel Garza Salinas, a spokesman for customs in Nuevo  Laredo, which is located in Mexico's northeastern Tamaulipas  State, said the pickups were detained because they lacked and  their owners have already initiated the process for their  recovery. [sentence as received]    The pickups are loaded with $2,000 worth of books,  typewriters, computers, medicine, and a parabolic antenna. They  will be shipped to Cuba from the port of Tampico, Tamaulipas.    The cargo is part of the humanitarian aid which, earlier  this  month, the U.S. authorities prevented the pastors from sending  to Mexico for later shipment to Cuba.    Garza said the U.S. authorities allege that the cargo of  both  vehicles was taken to Mexico secretly in violation of a U.S. law  banning the shipment of strategic material to Cuba.    He said the Mexican authorities granted facilities so  Pastors  for Peace could bring the two pickups into Mexico on condition  that they would request permits to do so and would pay a  symbolic tariff.    On 9 March the Pastors for Peace caravan crossed into Mexico  with 68 vehicles and 140 tons of humanitarian aid for Cuba.     "

From a  hotel in Miami I have Mr. Charles Rangel on the line, who will  give an international news conference. Ana Margarita Gill will  serve as interpreter for us and for Mr. Rangel. From Havana,  good morning.    [Gill] ""Good morning, Mr. Rangel. We are calling you from  Havana Cuba, and we would like to ask you about details  concerning your projects to ease or establish free commerce  between Cuba and the United States.    [Rangel] ""Well, as you know, the U.S. has always felt that  Cuba with association with the Soviet Union represented a threat  to our national security and as a result of that it established  the embargo some 34 years ago. It is my opinion and that of many  members of the Congress that that threat no longer exists if it  existed at all and that the embargo should be removed. I had  hearings on this bill, and we have had many people in the  Congress to agree. And I think that with all the witnesses,  there is an overwhelming belief that the purposes that existed  for the embargo before do not exist now and that it should be  removed.    ""The problems that we do have is that there are many people  in the United States who believe that the rights of Cuban people  to speak their minds and the terms of the type of government  that they would have are held in jeopardy if they speak out  against the Cuban Government. The Cuban Government, of course,  says that this is not so, that people do have the opportunity to  say anything that they want, and so, therefore, I think that now  that we have established an area of differences that we also can  establish an area of debate and that is exactly where we are at  this moment.    [Gill] ""Thank you so much I will translate for a few  seconds."" He states that the embargo, or the blockade, is  established due to relations between Cuba and the United States.  At the present moment this situation has changed completely, and  if there is an area of differences there should also be an area  of dialogue and mutual exchange.    [Cavada] The listeners would like to know about the future  of  your bill. What other steps would be followed because the Cuba  people are interested in learning of this future.    [Gill] ""Mr. Rangel, which will be the next steps in Congress  concerning the project?    [Rangel] ""Well, since there is an overwhelming feeling that  the embargo has nothing to do with the security of the United  States and since many of the business people believe that indeed  the United States is losing as a result of not participating in  trade with Cuba, as we have established with the North America  Free Trade Agreement, then what remains is some concern about  the type of government and the type of conditions that exist as  relates to the human rights of the Cubans. Of course some of us  believe, that support the bill, that the embargo has caused an  undo hardship in terms of lack of food and medicine, in terms of  the pain and suffering of the people in Cuba. So, when people  have said that many Cubans have been arrested and placed in jail  because their only crime was to speak out in support of  democracy, other people have said that that is not so.    ""In my opinion, if that is not so and that is the only  reason  why we are not establishing trade and a normal relationship with  Cuba so that we can enjoy each other's culture and education and  advancements in medicine and of course in commerce, then it  would seem that perhaps our government should start talking and  remove what appears to be the only obstacle as relates [words  indistinct].    [Gill] ""Thank you so much Mr. Rangel.""    [Rangel] Good morning. [in Spanish]    [Gill] Good morning. Let us summarize what he said. He said  that, currently, there is an overwhelming feeling about the fact  that U.S. security has nothing to do with Cuba and that much is  being said about the alleged violation of human rights in Cuba.  He says that there is no greater violation than the pain and  suffering that the embargo or blockade is causing to our people.  That the time has come for the United States and Cuba to enjoy  each other's culture and education and that they should sit down  to talk. In short, that is the message of Mr. Charles Rangel.     "

Although it preserved more than four-fifths of  the territory of the USSR, even so it has slightly more than  half the population of the former USSR and controls no more than  half the gross national product of the USSR in 1990. If we are  speaking of society as a whole, Russia has certainly not  achieved political accord yet and its strategic economic future  is not clear yet either. The important conclusion follows from  this that at least for a time, in terms of most parameters  (other than the size of territory and military potential),  Russia has moved to the category of medium-sized (regional)  powers.    China is undergoing fundamental changes too. The phenomenal  rate of development achieved in recent years is making this  state one of the leaders in terms of overall might and prospects  for development no longer only among the ""third world""  countries. However, China, which is now second in the world  after the United States in terms of total production of goods  and services (gross domestic product), continues to enjoy all  the advantages of a ""developing country."" Remember that Russia  is in 10th place for this indicator, behind not only the United  States and China but even Japan, Germany, India, France, Italy,  Great Britain, and Brazil. Today China is third in the world in  terms of industrial production, behind only the United States  and Japan, while Russia is in fifth place. It is no secret that  today people in the PRC [People's Republic of China] are  extremely disturbed by the changes in the geopolitical situation  along the perimeter of China's borders and the especially  destabilizing influence on Chinese society of sociopolitical  processes in the CIS republics, which theoretically might bring  to China processes similar to those which caused the dissolution  of the USSR, given the separatist trends in Tibet, Xinjiang, and  Guangdong. Despite the obvious success of the reforms, there  are difficulties of a political and economic nature in China  just as in Russia, and the future appearance of this country is  not perfectly clear, which obviously worries not only its  closest neighbors.    Russia is a Eurasian power, and its interests in connection  with this are objectively grouped in both the West and the East.  Russia's role in Asia is gradually beginning to change. The  country's national interests were wrongly assessed by USSR  foreign policy strategists. The struggle against imperialism and  then against the PRC for a long time had a prominent place in  our country's foreign policy course in Asia, while other  countries for the most part concentrated on maintaining or  achieving the needed growth in labor productivity per capita,  which should finally be regarded of paramount importance in  Russia's strategy. But at the same time Russia must now also  decide which components of its national interests are to be  realized and in what direction. And the approach to this  question should be as pragmatic as possible. That does not mean  Russia's assuming a one-sided orientation to the West or to the  East, which still occurs depending on the domestic policy  situation in the country, but rather it means achieving a  consensus among the political elite in terms of what direction  the ""strategic partnership"" needed for peaceful existence and to  attract new technologies and investments to modernize the  economy should take; and where we can find mutually advantageous  cooperation in relations and the balance of economic interests  needed for Russia's geopolitical stability.    It is perfectly clear that today large-scale investments and  new technologies can only come to Russia from the West; that is  the objective reality. Regardless of our likes and dislikes, the  United States' role here is a crucial one in all senses. That is  why access to U.S. markets is so important to Russia. True,  behind the talk of a ""strategic partnership"" of democratic  Russia with the United States, we somehow do not hear of  successes of Russian diplomacy in achieving most-favored nation  status in trade with this country, while communist China easily  extends this status from year to year. At the same time,  however, China is not only our largest Asian neighbor with a  dynamic rate of development (the ratio of the yearly volume of  production of GNP between Russia and China dropped from 2:1 in  1990 to 1.25:1 in 1992 and may change to 0.75:1 by the year  2000) and a population of almost 1.5 billion people opposite the  sparsely populated territories of Siberia and the Far East. It  is now the second most important trade partner with the Russian  Federation after the FRG. The PRC is apparently the only country  upon which Russia can realistically depend in strengthening its  positions in northern Asia, this most dynamically developing  region of the world. The extraordinary importance of a Chinese  orientation for Russian foreign policy stems from that. Indeed,  neither the United States nor especially Japan is inclined to  automatically help raise Russia's role in the Asian-Pacific  Ocean region, since this would objectively result in their  narrowed influence in the system of foreign policy and economic  ties which have already become established. For this reason, the  hopes of certain analysts that the resolution of the territorial  question with Japan will open an era of large-scale cooperation  with this country are very problematical. But for China  cooperation with Russia may to a significant degree act as a  factor for maintaining the balance of forces in northern Asia in  counterbalance to the one-sided rise in influence of the United  States and Japan, which is not to China's advantage. And  although on the strategic level China may consider Russia a  source of instability, at the same time there is no doubt that a  threat to China from the north disappeared along with the  disintegration of the USSR.    Russia's entry into the Asian economic space is  predetermined  by the fact that the USSR, whose successor Russia is, in the  past built up only its military-political presence and in  practice did not participate in the process of forming the  structure of regional economic cooperation. After the USSR's  disappearance from the international arena and in light of the  economic difficulties, Russia's future presence in the region  depends only on its ability to incorporate itself into the  process of economic integration. In present conditions Russia  will not be able to decide any issue by military means. It is  obvious that the situation that has now taken shape is  characterized by Russia's low level of realization of its  interests in Asia, which is linked above all to the lack of a  clearcut strategic course of development of the country.    At the same time, however, Russia's transfer of focus from  the military-political sphere to the area of economic contacts,  that is to say the change in status from a military superpower  to the status of an economic partner, is undoubtedly in China's  interests. China is interested in multipolarization of the  economic structure in the region to counterbalance the one-sided  rise in Japan's role in order to prevent China from experiencing  a growing relative economic lag. Fairly strong economic ties of  the northern and northwestern provinces of the PRC with the  Russian Far East and its Central Asian part would also be in the  PRC's interests in order to prevent the growing imbalance in the  economic development of the country's north and south, which is  fraught with the potential danger of increased separatist  tendencies within the Chinese state.    For Russia friendly relations with China guarantee a  reliable  rear area for relations with the West, no matter what these  relations are in the future, in exactly the same way that Russia  provides this rear area for China. As its positions in the world  are reinforced, the new Russia could help raise China's role on  the world level just as China could provide support to Russia on  the regional level, and accordingly both countries could  continue to progress along the path of reform and structural  reorganization of their economies.    However, we must not shut our eyes to the fact that a  breeding ground for rivalry between Russia and China within the  framework of the international system of relations continues to  exist. Today it is defined not only by traditional geopolitical  considerations as in the past, but also by the following two  features. First, both Russia and China now occupy a similar  position in the world system of relations, that is to say, in  the eyes of the world they are major regional powers which are  either on the threshold or in the process of transforming their  political systems and reforming their economies, that is to say,  essentially they are developing countries called upon in  principle to play a world role based on their objective  conditions. Moreover, the medium for rivalry is determined by  the differences in the initial parameters, general strategy, and  context of socioeconomic transformations in these countries.  Without dwelling on comparing the Chinese and Russian reforms,  one can assert that in terms of such criteria as the state's  economic role and the correlation of forms of ownership, the  interdependence of transformations in economics and politics,  and others, they are developing in different ways. Thus, the  degree of Russia and China's compatibility with international  economic structures and the degree to which the countries fit  into the world economy differ. On the other hand, the Russian  domestic policy situation determines the complexities of  economic interaction at the given stage, in particular the  clearly unequal character of trade between our countries.    The similarity of the tasks which our countries are  performing and at the same time the differences in the nature of  the reforms and their rates allow Russia and China in the very  near future and with definite focused efforts to occupy  different niches in the world division of labor and in  attracting international investments; that is to say to avoid a  direct collision of interests, which when the complementary  nature of the economies is taken into account may ensure  perfectly harmonious development of both interstate relations  and economic ties. The main components of the national interests  of Russia and China are by no means mutually exclusive in  principle. Although periods of acute confrontation between our  countries were observed more than once throughout the 400 years  of history of interrelations, this was above all the result of  major foreign policy miscalculations or considerations of an  ideological nature. So the difficulties which exist in relations  are certainly surmountable today, and both countries may at  least in the short-term utilize one another's potential to  modernize and reform their own economies.

Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I  would like to congratulate you on assuming the post, your  election as chairman of the State Duma Ecology Committee. Even  though it seems to many people today that ecological problems  are not the most important thing in our present life and that  there are certainly things which are more important. Do you  agree with this assertion?    Lemeshev: I am deeply certain that the rebirth of  Russia and the Russian people, which everyone under the sun is  talking about now, is impossible without solving ecological  problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the  ecological situation in the country is simply disastrous;  everyone understands that, there is no need to explain. In fact  today we are talking about survival. Take the demographic  aspect. It is an altogether depressing situation; essentially  the indigenous peoples of Russia are dying out. The scientific  research of prestigious scientists, in particular American and  Japanese scientists, shows that 40 percent of the children born  in recent times are already ill. What will happen to them later,  in their adult lives? Generally two-thirds of all diseases today  are linked to the bad state of the environment. This is more  urgent for Russia than for the West.    Above all it is environmental pollution in cities with a  population of more than a million inhabitants which causes  alarm. Here, as a rule, there is very bad water (and generally  it is bad everywhere in our country) and food products contain  pesticides, nitrates, and various biological additives. And what  is interesting is that this applies less to domestically made  products than to imported products. Propaganda, advertising, and  pretty packaging do their work here; we are still susceptible to  all this. The developed countries often sell us what there is no  demand for in their countries. Incidentally, there are fairly  strict nature protection laws in many countries of the Western  world.    In my opinion, that is where we must focus our activity, on  improving the health of our people. That is the primary task.  Yes, biological diversity and problems of protected territories  are important, and that is good, but the most important thing is  people's health.    Mikhaylov: But to do all this capital is needed,  and I would assume a considerable amount of it. Where is it  supposed to come from, at the expense of what and at whose  expense? After all, the only thing anyone talks about is the  meager state treasury and the incredible state budget deficit.  As a member of the State Duma, you are obliged to take into  account the conditions of our reality. Are all these things you  are so persuasively discussing realistic from a financial  standpoint?    Lemeshev: As an economist, I am simply depressed  by the very widespread opinion that once the economy is in  crisis, it is then impossible to work on economic problems. It  is just when such a crisis arises that we supposedly take up  ecology in earnest. And the saddest thing is that, in my  opinion, this is simply a bad idea -- it finds a response in  people's souls. That is certainly understandable: people are on  the edge of survival and this is the point where it is every man  for himself, as they say. And that is radically wrong. Without  solving ecological problems, we will never raise the economy  either, I am absolutely convinced of that.    Here is a clear example. With environmental pollution,  people  get sick more often and more seriously and hence do not  participate in production so actively. Does that have an effect  on the state's economy or not? In order to treat people, buy  medicine, and build hospitals, an enormous amount of capital is  needed. Does that really not put a burden on the economy? Only  altogether short-sighted people are unable to see that.    All right, let us take production of fabrics. For the fabric  to be good quality, we need not simply water, but clean water.  Isn't it easier and cheaper not to pollute the water from the  start rather than spend enormous amounts of money to  decontaminate it? Remember that it is impossible to separate the  economy and ecology -- it is a single metasystem. And I would  like to say one more thing: There are no ecological problems of  one state or another; ecological problems cannot be solved  within the boundaries of one state. Say the Scandinavian  countries have been very successful in solving ecological  problems, but 90 percent of the pollution of the natural  environment comes to them from other countries.    Mikhaylov: But that is putting the question in  general terms, so to speak; now what practical steps should the  committee begin with, in your opinion? What draft laws do you  consider paramount in the sphere of environmental protection?    Lemeshev: I would not want to complain right off  of lack of organization, but as of now for 15 deputies and just  as many apparat employees we have two small rooms, no  typewriters, no computers, and no organizational equipment. I do  not know how we are going to work.    As for the committee's legislative work, I believe preparing  a draft law on ecological disaster zones is most important.  True, all Russia can now be called an ecological disaster zone,  but there are the worst ones, say the Chernobyl disaster zone,  rayons where chemical and petrochemical production are  concentrated, and production sites of hydrocarbon raw materials  in northern Russia where a terrible blow is being inflicted on  the habitat of the small peoples. We are in dire need of a law  on the ecological expert study, not a departmental one, as is  customary now, but a federal state expert study with broad  public participation. Only in that way will we be able to put up  a barrier on the path of projects that destroy both nature and  humans themselves.    And isn't legislation on drinking water important? Must we  not make additions to the Criminal Code related to  accountability for ecological crimes? So there is a vast field  of work.    Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking over the  list of members of your committee, the fair degree of diversity  caught my attention: there are deputies from ""Russia's Choice,""  and communists, and members of the Democratic Party of Russia,  and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] faction. Doesn't it seem to you that this lack of  political uniformity will hinder the committee's normal  lawmaking work? Moreover, you must build constructive relations  with the Russian Federation Ministry of Protection of the  Environment and Natural Resources.    Lemeshev: As for the latter, I feel optimistic  because of the fact that the minister himself, Viktor Ivanovich  Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee, and at least for  now, we have a mutual understanding on all issues. Although I  have heard plenty of the unbiased polemics between  Danilov-Danilyan and the chairman of the RF Interdepartmental  Commission on Ecological Safety, Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov,  which unfolded on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, personally I  do not quite like it when such disagreements arise between such  respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian  intelligentsia and we must discard departmental, political, and  professional ambitions when it is a matter of the common cause.  We must change our psychology. But I look at the work of our  committee with hope because I am certain that the task of  preserving the environment can unite people of the most diverse  political views.

The state-owned National Radio Newscast (NNR) revealed that the  island plans to extract 1.2 million tons of crude oil this year,  100,000 tons more than the record amount extracted in 1993.    Local oil production, known for its high density and sulfur  content, represents approximately 16 percent of the oil Cuba  might have available this year to keep its cement, nickel, and  glass industries operating.    According to NNR, daily hydrocarbon production represents  approximately 15 percent of the country's fuel needs at this  stage, which is characterized as the worst economic crisis since  1959. However, the newscast explained that Cuban crude oil used  to generate electricity represents 30 percent of the total fuel  used for that purpose.    The drastic decline in deliveries by the former Soviet Union  to Cuba (from 13 million tons a year until 1989 to less than 6  million last year) caused a partial paralysis in island  transportation and continuous and prolonged power outages that  have angered citizens. Until shortly before its formal  disintegration in December 1991, the former USSR gave its  Caribbean ally approximately $120 million a year in credit for  oil exploration.    To balance the enormous fuel deficit, which paralyzed  hundreds of factories, Cuban authorities encouraged the  extraction of national crude oil and opened up the sector to  foreign oil companies for prospecting operations.

Havana Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 18 January reports that in  what police are calling the ""Caramel Case,"" two managers at  Coppelia Ice Cream Palace forced workers to reduce the amount of  the servings and were pilfering one of every two or three vats  of ice cream, which they sold on the black market for 300 pesos.  Workers who protested were fired. This pilfering resulted in the  center having to close early and serving only half its usual  12,000 customers a day. Steps have been taken to remedy the  situation, the result of highly deficient organization.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at 0100 GMT  on 22 January report that the National Revolutionary Police have  arrested seven people in Marianao, Havana, for illegal  acquisition of imported goods, i.e., 60,000 bars of soap  obtained through impersonation of representatives of two bogus  foreign enterprises. The soap was sold on the black market but  an official who refused a 100,000-peso bribe alerted  authorities. Marianao's Unified Vigilance and Protection System  also deserves praise for its role in the arrests. Reporter Jorge  Roco stresses that personal irresponsibility and faulty sale  procedures caused Cuba to lose money instead of profiting,  besides exacerbating the excess currency situation.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 24 January reports that nine  100- pound barrels of margarine oil were stolen from the Siboney  candy store in Playa Municipality by former worker Jose Miguel  Herrera Jimenez and Ricardo Manuel Ruiz Silva, a worker at the  National Geology Institute. During the course of the robbery,  Herrera murdered a night shift worker. An additional 17 people  have been arrested for aiding and abetting the crime. The oil,  officially worth a total of 300 pesos, was sold for 3,000 pesos  a barrel.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 25 January reports that a  Havana  court has tried two men for embezzlement at Bacuranao  Pasteurizing Plant, which lost over 20,000 pesos. The accused,  who have a prior criminal record, worked as port and  distribution chiefs. The investigation revealed that one man  received over 9,000 liters of milk to be sold in the black  market. A police investigator stressed that it is very difficult  to fight crime when those in charge of the people's resources  have criminal records and work in distribution.     "
0,FT922-11013 ,"FT922-11013 _AN-CD1A7AEGFT 920428   FT  28 APR 92 / Strict terms for Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise rouble      By PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM   THE industrialised nations yesterday approved in principle the setting up of a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) stabilisation fund for the rouble. The Group of 10 nations - comprising the G7 countries plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - said they were willing to activate the General Arrangements to Borrow which would provide the International Monetary Fund with the financial support needed to establish the stabilisation fund. However, successive ministers, assembled in Washington for the spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank, made clear that the fund and other financial support for Russia and other former Soviet republics would depend on them meeting strict economic criteria. The need for a comprehensive stabilisation programme was also underlined in the statement issued after Sunday's G7 meeting. The reform programme provides for: Reduction of the budget deficit to stabilise the economy and reduce the role of government. Curbing monetary growth to bring inflation under control and stop the extension of credit to unviable enterprises. The establishment of the legal framework and contractual rights necessary to permit a market economy to be developed. Reform of the agriculture and energy sectors. A foreign exchange mobilisation system that enables the independent states of the former Soviet Union to meet their international payments. A unified and market-determined exchange rate set at a realistic level. Meanwhile, in his address to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, yesterday suggested that the stabilisation fund should boost confidence in the rouble once a sufficiently tight monetary stance in the rouble-zone countries had been established. However, he said it would be difficult to find a correct parity for the rouble. Decisions also had to be taken as to whether it should float, move in a 'crawling peg' of adjustable parities or be fixed. He suggested that the rouble should be pegged to the Ecu as part of the stabilisation programme for the currency - a proposal supported by France. However Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said later that he wanted to peg the rouble to the dollar and allow it to fluctuate within a 7 1/2 per cent margin either side of its exchange rate. He admitted that fixing an exchange rate would be difficult, partly because Russia would have higher inflation than the west, but his government intended to adopt a single rate from July 1. Mr Lamont said Russia needed a macro-economic stabilisation programme to gain control of its inflation, monetary growth and budget deficits. George Graham adds: Mr Gaidar warned US businessmen in Washington yesterday that his country was obliged to tax imports and foreign residents' incomes. He said Russia had lifted import duties temporarily during the period of price liberalisation, in order to impose the discipline of import competition on domestic producers who might otherwise have been tempted to raise their prices too much. It was now necessary, he told a meeting at the US Chamber of Commerce, to reimpose a flat import duty. 'We are not using this import tariff to protect our domestic producers, we just want to raise tax revenue,' Mr Gaidar said. Russia's new income tax, meanwhile, has worried some foreign businessmen who say they will be unable to move employees to Russia because the new top rate of 60 per cent would be so severe a cost. Mr Gaidar said the income tax was 'a sad story', but necessary to comply with IMF requirements. 'The problem is we have a strongly undervalued rouble, so when we apply our income tax to foreigners they have very high incomes in roubles.' Mr Gaidar said he hoped to introduce special exemptions or privileges for foreigners.  The Financial Times   London Page 6  "

Robaina also stressed the  importance of the summit and contacts with other Ibero-American  delegations:    [Robaina] We have highly diverse views, as President Fidel  clearly explained last night. We have no problem with  discussing democracy and human rights. Cuba has much to say  about democracy and human rights. There are many points of  view. If this is discussed at a closed door meeting, we will  make our point at a closed door meeting no matter the subject.  Cuba has its own opinions and views.    [Correspondent] Yet, that discussion has wasted time that  could have been spent on the summit's main issues.    [Robaina] It is not a matter of wasting time that could have  been spent on other issues. Actually, an overloaded agenda  could be wasting the time that could be spent on other issues.  In that sense, the summit has a broader agenda.    No other summit matches this one. Just as we make an effort  to [word indistinct] Fidel's contacts with different presidents  -- such as the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras, Mexico,  Spain, Colombia, and Bolivia -- as well as the other presidents  who are also in the process of bilateral discussions. The  foreign ministries' technical teams, as well as the foreign  ministers, are working hard.    The first two sections of the final draft of the final  document were completed recently. This request, which it now  seems will not be necessary to include, is currently the only  component of this draft. The document is expected to be  approved this afternoon.    When so many presidents gather for such an important  meeting,  it is often the case that we do not have enough time to get to  everything.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, do you think the paragraph on  the U.S. blockade against Cuba that was included in the final  document will be altered during the afternoon session?    [Robaina] I do not want to get ahead of myself. That  paragraph has already gone through many processes. I can say  that it is one paragraph that was approved with the least  resistance. That paragraph already exceeds what was  accomplished in Cartagena...[pauses] in Salvador-Bahia.    Participants were asked if they objected to any of the  document's points before it was presented to the Colombian  Foreign Ministry for completion. Not one country objected to  that particular paragraph. That paragraph...[pauses] The  meeting, regardless of yesterday's [words indistinct], is to  improve. Some may even be astonished that we approved the  paragraph and that [word indistinct] the word blockade does not  appear because there seemed to be a problem with its definition.    Some of the people who spoke yesterday have as strong an  opinion on this matter as we do. The great majority of those  present voted in favor of Cuba at the UN General Assembly on  something that is much more significant than this paragraph.  Therefore, I do not think this will mean anything to us. The  rest of the proposals are all included in the document.    The most important thing was for us to have the opportunity  to express our views during the time allotted to us and to have  opinions and points of view on issues that would make way for a  debate and take advantage of the Colombian Government's proposal  of turning this meeting into a real debate rather than the  reading of speeches brought from outside.    [Correspondent] We have heard many opinions by foreign  ministers on yesterday's [word indistinct] by the commander.    [Robaina] Yes, and I believe that you were more surprised  than we were. There are many opinions. Undoubtedly, when one  explains positions...[pauses] For example, I have found many  people who say that issues were brought to the table once and  for all, as they should be. I believe there are those who do  not share his views because they may not feel at liberty,  perhaps, to express the things that our president has expressed.  Undoubtedly, they might be concerned.    Nevertheless, Cuba did not come for the other 22  participants  to share its views unanimously. Cuba has come so that its point  of view is included in the analysis. We have all the authority,  morale, history -- especially our president -- to express our  points of view clearly and plainly. That is very important to  me.    Many people congratulated the Cuban delegation and Fidel  last night for having brought the issues to the table. We will  have to get used to the fact that some will like what we say  while others will not.    We do not say things just to get others to agree. We express  our positions and principles. That is why they have been  expressed with strength. Several people have approached Fidel  to congratulate him on his actions and to say...[pauses] The  best indicator was the room filling up so quickly, unlike  anything else that had happened during the day. There was a  special silence when our president expressed his views.    It is important that you realize that harsh, strong, and  firm  statements such as those will not have unanimous backing from  those who do not want to commit to what we are discussing. We  should not doubt this because the absence of opinions does not  necessarily mean that they disagree. It could also mean that  they prefer not to be publicly sympathetic in light of other  types of pressure. Many public statements have been made on  Cuba's participation in the summit despite all of this.    [Correspondent] Does the final document include the economic  and trade agreements reached at the summit?    [Robaina] The final document includes an important part of  our recommendations. It still does not constitute a true  platform for the integration that should follow. It is  unrealistic to think that the potential for economic integration  that we see in America can be met during just one summit.  Today, the Cuban delegation will be able to present its views  on Cuban reality, how investments are progressing, and how we  are less united and less integrated than ever today. That is  the phenomenon that we face. We will not achieve this kind of  integration with one strong document. We can achieve a stronger  integration if all the presidents and delegations leave here  willing to put these things into action.    [Correspondent] Speaking of these small meetings, perhaps  Cuba can enter the Group of Three easier than any of the other  groups?    [Robaina] Cuba did not come -- people have constantly been  asking me this in the halls -- to seek membership in the OAS or  any other specific regional or subregional group. The fact that  we did not come for that purpose, however, does not mean that we  are excluded. We have not closed the door on any possibility.  Because we do not talk as much about [words indistinct]. We  wish Latin America had a true [word indistinct]. That is what  we want to accomplish. Cuba has not closed the door on any type  of bilateral review with any country, even though at this moment  and in midst of such a complex program you can understand that  we have other priorities.    Economic advancement will allow us to enter into any group  based on the principles that we respect, love, and defend. Cuba  wanted...[pauses] That's why we were dissatisfied last night.  How is it possible for such a meeting to be called and for  Latin America not to have a common position with or without  Cuba? Once again, this demonstrates how, before this meeting,  which we salute and respect, we put aside our participation and  our particular interests as a country.    Many have called to express their satisfaction with Fidel  saying that he salutes the summit with very good intentions and  that he respects the rights of others to have their own  opinions, as some do. This is all that is needed to discuss  true dialogue, unlike what the press, which has been following  us around the hallways, has said, namely that we come here to  express our views and do not accept contradicting views. That  is not true. We accept and listen to anything they want to say.  They, however, must listen to us as well. That is the  phenomenon. Some began talking and thought that no one would  refute those views. Of course not. We spoke yesterday, and we  may have to speak today.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, I just want to point out that  everyone praised Fidel at yesterday's news conference. My  question is: Has anyone said anything about the U.S. observers  at the summit?    [Robaina] The matter has not been discussed. We should not  have to address [deshacer] an issue that torments us. U.S.  observers have been mentioned basically because they are  preparing the famous summit. The observers will take with them  what we think of the summit. In other words, why make an issue  of this? In this way, no one has to bring them Cuba's message  on this summit being unnecessary. Cuba is not afraid. They are  here primarily to learn about how to organize a summit. It  seems that this is motivating their presence. I am sure they  have a positive impression of what has taken place here.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, the media has been making a  great deal about the commander's attire.    [Robaina] He was asked about this in public yesterday. I do  not believe...[pauses] This generates all the speculation on  whether it is a new style or if it is the beginning of something  new. Let there be no doubt: He will continue wearing his olive  green attire. The fact of the matter is that we are honoring  the summit organizers' request despite response to the uniform  being positive everywhere, including Cuba. We received a  written request for the presidents to dress informally, in a  guayavera or shirt. Our president honored the request, proving  even more that he is not an obstinate man when it comes to  history, a promise, or the olive green uniform. The host  country requested informal dress, and Fidel came informal.    It was big news. Rest assured that he did not do it to make  news and that [words indistinct] in olive green. Although this  left a magnificent impression on Havana, let us not get carried  away. Some have said that it marks the beginning of the end.  If changing Cuba were as easy as changing into a guayavera, we  would have sewn many guayaveras a long time ago.    [Correspondent] The guayavera is a symbol of Cubanism.    [Robaina] Yes, but it is superficial. To those who say that  Fidel is incapable of this or that, there you have it. This  also demonstrates Fidel's ability to adapt to the place, the  moment, and the conditions. Some said this was impossible. The  people in Havana with whom I was talking say they are  traumatized by the guayavera. They cannot wait to see if he  will wear the guayavera in Havana. That is a phenomenon. He is  wearing a guayavera and blue slacks today. Let us not start  describing his socks, etc...[laughs]    [Correspondent] How did Cuba receive Bolivia's statements  following the commander's address?    [Robaina] Many expressed satisfaction with Fidel's address.  Brazilian President Itamar Franco and many others expressed  satisfaction. Fidel's statements were obviously not in  agreement with some of the addresses presented there. If you  review past summits, you can see that many others begin to  publicly express themselves in favor of Cuba, in addition to  those who are concerned and sympathetic toward Cuba. Even  though we are not where we would like to be at the moment, the  number of people who dare speak out is much higher than in past  years.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct].    [Robaina] Regarding diplomatic relations with Honduras, I  must point out that we do not have diplomatic relations with  three or four of the countries that are present. Nevertheless,  the absence of formal diplomatic relations does not keep us from  having contacts that allow us to talk about our relations even  if they are not diplomatic.    I wish to stress that Cuba is neither preoccupied nor  obsessed nor [words indistinct] steps that have been taken. We  express this to everyone. President Castro himself expressed  that to President Reina today. We do not want the Honduran  people to feel any pressure from Cuba to establish diplomatic  relations because we already communicate with them. Honduras  must determine when conditions are appropriate because on our  side there are no conditions.     "

In their article, entitled ""Russia and Belarus:  There  are no Losers,"" they provided a number of statistics to prove that  negative influences on either state's economy would be negligible.

0,FT943-15688 ,"FT943-15688 _AN-EGHDJAAMFT 940708   FT  08 JUL 94 / Russians 'now proto-member of a new G8'      By ANTHONY ROBINSON   The Naples summit this weekend could mark a sea-change in western views about Russia's ability to re-emerge as a stable society with a dynamic economy, according to the authors of a projection of Russian trends to the year 2010. 'Russia will be participating in the Naples summit both as an object of the G7's concern and as a proto-member of the new G8,' Mr Daniel Yergin told bankers and oil industry executives at Lehman Brothers in London this week. 'The most important outcome is likely to be a shift in focus from the provision of aid to the encouragement of trade and investment in Russia.' According to this view Russia was 'no longer perceived as the Evil Empire but the newest of the emerging markets,' he added. Mr Thane Gustafson, co-author with Mr Yergin of Russia 2010, added that after months travelling the country he concluded that 'big private money in Russia is acquiring new political power, and this is the underlying factor behind the political calm which has appeared in recent months.' One under-appreciated factor working in Russia's favour was the way faxes and other modern communications technology could facilitate integration into the global economy. Other positive factors included Russia's well educated population, vast natural resources and the force of 75 years of pent-up demand. But one of the most important issues still facing Russia was how to attract back the Dollars 40bn to Dollars 50bn of flight capital which Mr Gustafson called 'hover-capital' - poised to return, provided the Russian government allowed a form of amnesty as advocated by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Russian central bank. 'Recent years have seen a vast transfer of wealth from the state to private hands. Russia now has several dollar billionaires, hundreds of millionaires and increasingly powerful banks. Most of these fabulous fortunes were accumulated when the rouble was heavily undervalued two years ago and assets flooded out of the country. Now the new capitalists are powerful and are starting to look for investment opportunities in Russia. They reflect the irreversibility of economic reform in Russia where the command economy simply no longer exists,' Mr Gustafson said. While capital flowed out of Russia in vast amounts, factory managers were becoming the new owners of Russian physical assets through the mass privatisation process. 'This means that the new owners of property, mainly factory managers, have property but no capital. What is needed is a marriage between the new proprietors and those who own capital now held overseas.' Mr Gustafson said the case for an amnesty was stronger because a nearly bankrupt government was unable to balance the budget or invest because it was only able to levy taxes on the captive state sector and was incapable of raising taxes from the vibrant private sector. 'The solution has to be found through private domestic and foreign investment not the state investment which played the key role in Soviet and Czarist times.' Until now, however, Russia had received less than Dollars 2bn in equity investment from the west, compared with more than Dollars 100bn that has flowed into China. Increasing this flow would require action and new thinking by both the government and investors, said Mr Gustafson. As G7 leaders in Naples prepared to discuss ways of making investment and trade more attractive, Mr Gustafson suggested to potential investors that the way to make profits was through 'hands-on management' by executives based in Russia and an awareness 'that the best protection is not a good lawyer but a good partner'.

Russia is the only Commonwealth state that has not ratified  the document. The hearings confirmed that the document  corresponds to the Russian interests and aims to form common  economic space in the Commonwealth to be based on market economy  principles.    The Russian government is offered to work for the creation  of  a free trade zone, customs and payment unions proceeding from  the need to settle credit, monetary, currency and financial  relations with the Commonwealth republics.    Russian vice-premier Aleksandr Shokhin told correspondents  that hundreds of Commonwealth agreements are inefficient. A new  working body of the economic union should help to elaborate and  implement cooperation documents, he said.

More than  80,000 meetings turned thousands of workplaces into  miniparliaments, with the workers discussing matters that have  been discussed in the past, and are to be discussed again, by  the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. But  this was not a useless process. It has served essentially to  give Cubans an awareness of the nature of national problems and  of the alternatives for solving them gradually.    In a society ruled by overwhelming consensus, it is  impossible to adopt measures that could in one way or another  affect the economy without first consulting public opinion.    To save time, some might have recommended the use of the  government's prerogatives. In other countries in the world,  levying a tax or raising a price is not discussed with anyone.  It is a quick and unexpected blow. In Cuba, however, the  strength of the Revolution and of its regime lies in the  principle that force must not be used against the people. The  Revolution's strength comes from the people.    And never before has the Revolution so greatly needed the  support of the people and the workers. Because of this  unquestionable fact, everything discussed during the so-called  parliaments in the workplace has to be turned into a platform  for behavior, a guide for action in each workplace throughout  the country.    Work is the lever that will boost our depressed economy. It  is true that work requires material resources; that work  requires a reduction in the flow of currency; and that the  budget deficit must be reduced. These are unavoidable measures.  Above all, however, work demands the conscientious participation  of all workers.    A society that belongs to all of us and is governed by all  of  us requires that we join in the work effort despite the lack of  resources, notwithstanding the lack of incentives and despite  the lack of basic goods. Work is the guarantee that will ensure  that what is lacking today will not be lacking tomorrow. A work  ethic is essential. We are living through difficult times, and  these difficult times demand a work ethic even more urgently.    Until the ANPP decides on the appropriate fiscal measures,  each work center must be a parliament, and the workers must  continue working like members of a parliament, fighting the  bureaucratic mentality that impairs initiatives and gives rise  to passivity, fighting everything that prevents the country from  readjusting its economy through an entrepreneurial system that  promotes efficiency. All this must be done today, and right now.  (endall) 221800 fc/liautaud/lauck/en 22/2251     "

The  Kremlin head sent his election manager Nikolai Ryabov to Bonn on  a special mission: To explain the Russian December election.    The messenger from the Moskva River brought attenuating  news.  Russia intends to ""end for good the legend of the evil bear,""  Ryabov stressed at the Rhine last week, adding that there would  be no return to violent, imperial policy.    It is true that several ministers in the Cabinet in Moscow  would be exchanged, and that ""a change of course"" in economic  policy ""was on the agenda."" However, Ryabov ruled out the  failure of the entire reform process: ""We cannot go back any  more.""    Such soothing words are necessary. There are mounting fears  among Germans regarding the future of Russia.    The success of the nationalists and old communists in the  December election had worried the Germans. The anti-Western  tirades of hatred of nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy nourished  old fears that Russia might return to the imperialist foreign  policy of Czarist and communist origin.    Last week even those on whom the West had pinned all its  hopes seemed to have opted for reorientation. First, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, who has so far been appreciated  as a fierce advocate of a foreign policy guided by Western  principles, caused some irritation by uttering old national  tones. The foreign minister was understood as saying that,  after all, Russia was not intending to release the Baltic  Republics from its sphere of influence, and might even send in  troops, if in doubt.    After that, the West's friend, Yeltsin, failed to oppose a  Cabinet that was deprived of almost all its radical reformers.  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris  Fedorov also stayed out.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, of the Free Democratic  Party of Germany [FDP], only shortly before stressed that it was  a signal for the future of reform policy and the West's Russia  policy if the two men remained in the Cabinet. They stand for  reform based on the market economy and close ties with the West,  Kinkel said. If both were to go, it would result in a  ""considerable loss of confidence for Moscow.""    And now it has happened. One high-ranking Foreign Ministry  official stated that the government reshuffle has had ""a very,  very great sobering effect"" on Foreign Ministry officials.    Now that the opponents to rapid privatization are gaining  the  upper hand in Moscow, the major German enterprises are also  ""worried,"" Karl-Hermann Fink, of the German Economy's East  Committee said. Last year German companies sold to and bought  from Russia goods worth some 22 billion German marks [DM].    Yet, according to the result of a survey carried out among  business people by the East Committee, the shortage in foreign  currency of the Russian trading partners, legal uncertainty,  unclear responsibilities and property conditions, and ""the  general political and economic instability"" are making business  ""more and more difficult.""    Hardly any German enterprise dares to invest in Russia,  anyway. If anything, they accept barter deals -- goods in  exchange for goods.    Among Russian experts of the German business community there  is an intensifying debate on how much longer Yeltsin would be  able to resist the pressure -- physically and politically. The  crisis scenario of the managers: If Yeltsin were to step down,  fascist Zhirinovskiy would seize power, push the armament  industry, and sell the nuclear bomb to the Third World.    The confusion in Moscow has aroused the conservatives.  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] Secretary General Peter Hintze  is already speculating to score for Helmut Kohl in the 1994  election campaigns with the ""massive insecurity emanating from  Russia.""    ""The situation is still too confusing"" for a profound  judgment, Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/Christian  Social Union [CSU] Bundestag group, said. Yet, circumspect  foreign-policy experts of the CDU/CSU, such as Karl-Heinz  Hornhues, have unemotionally emphasized that the changes are  ""not as dramatic as some like to present them.""    And the chancellor is trying to signal optimism, even in  Moscow: ""Boris, go ahead with your reform course,"" Kohl  encouraged his friend on the telephone last Friday [21 January].  ""The entire world is looking at you."" Yeltsin stressed that he  would be able to cope with the new government.    Kohl's Russia experts regard Yeltsin's optimism as  well-founded. Even after the departure of Gaydar and Fedorov,  the president would be able to implement his reform course --  albeit at a lower pace. Moreover, abandoning the radical  market-economy course might even help to settle things there and  stabilize Yeltsin.    In Western government headquarters, the professional  observers had noted with concern for some time that, with his  capitalist recipes, Gaydar was producing great social tension in  Russia -- which he himself denies.    ""The pace was too stiff,"" as one leading official in Bonn  argued, and it is obviously a ""false belief that the market is  regulating everything in the finest way."" New U.S. Deputy  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott has also recommended ""less  shock, more therapy."" One can only hope that the change in the  government improves the disastrous mood in the country and thus,  takes the ""wind out of the sails"" of Zhirinovskiy (Hornhues).    Just prevent things from hardening -- that is the motto of  Bonn's Russia policy. Carefully, but consistently Russia should  be guided into the market economy with Western aid.    At the same time, this dual strategy says, the security  needs  of the countries between the NATO area and Russia should be  contented and their move toward European integration be speeded  up. A tricky balancing act.    Any shift of interest in favor of Moscow upsets Germany's  neighbors in the immediate East. The Central European countries  -- from Latvia to the Czech Republic and Croatia -- feel left in  the lurch by the entire West, anyway.    Their drive to get under NATO's military protective umbrella  quickly is being slowed down by the Western powers. The Eastern  countries have the impression that the World Bank and the IMF  are applying double standards: While Warsaw and Prague have to  fulfill strict conditions, the Russians get what they want.    Disappointment about Bonn is greatest among the Poles and  the  Balts. Politicians and publishers in Warsaw already see the  effects of an ""appeasement ideology,"" which might lead to new  brotherhood between Germans and Russians.    Diplomats from Warsaw have noticed with great attention that  Klaus Kinkel did not contradict his Russian counterpart,  Kozyrev, who, in late December, enthusiastically spoke of the  ""German-Russian axis."" They were also shocked when Kinkel spoke  out against a Kohl visit to Poland at the moment on the grounds  that Russia was more important.    After the Balts also stepped up their criticism of Bonn's  allegedly over-friendly attitude toward Moscow, Foreign Minister  Kinkel invited his counterparts from Latvia, Lithuania, and  Estonia to Bonn for ""consultations.""    According to staffers of Kohl, the chancellor is ""still  optimistic."" Based on the trust in his sauna-companion Yeltsin,  Kohl ordered in the Cabinet last week that the defense budget be  cut from the planned DM48.6 billion to DM47.3 billion in ""a  haggle as in an Oriental bazaar"" (Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe). Helmut Kohl stressed in public: ""I want Boris Yeltsin  to succeed.""    Yet, the Federal Government is pursuing an austerity course  in foreign policy, too. It no longer wants to issue blank  checks for huge programs. Bonn's purse ""is empty,"" as Kinkel  put it: ""Now it is the others' turn.""     "
0,FT943-11937 ,"FT943-11937 _AN-EG1C5AGVFT 940727   FT  27 JUL 94 / Russia agrees troops pullout from Estonia      By JOHN LLOYD      MOSCOW   The presidents of Russia and Estonia yesterday signed an agreement under which the remaining 2,000 Russian troops in Estonia will leave by August 31  -marking the last and hardest won of such agreements between Russia and the three former Soviet republics in the Baltics. If adhered to, it will mean that by the end of the summer all Russian divisions will have been pulled back from the three countries which they have occupied, in Soviet or Russian form, for 50 years. They have already left Lithuania and are leaving Latvia - though the Baltfax news agency reported yesterday that Mr Sergey Zotov, the Russian negotiator, had expressed 'serious concern' that the Latvian parliament had not ratified the pullout agreement. The negotiation process - especially in the case of Estonia, the smallest of the three republics - has been protracted, bad-tempered and mutually recriminatory, with the main western states all putting pressure on Russia to observe the August 31 date. Moscow had put this in doubt because of fears that the rights of the Russian speakers in the Baltic states were being violated. A brief statement to the official news agency Tass said that 'the presidents of Russia and Estonia signed an agreement today that the rights of the Russian military pensioners would be respected equally to the rights of Estonian citizens. They also signed an agreement in accordance with which Russian troops are withdrawn from Estonia before August 31'. Russia's president Boris Yeltsin, emerging after six hours of talks with his counterpart, President Lennart Meri - with whom he has never found any rapport - commented that the negotiations were 'pretty hard'. The formula appears to mean that the Estonian side will pay pensions and offer the rights of citizenship to those among 10,000 Russian officers who have reached retirement age - but not to those among them in their thirties and forties whom the Estonians believe are present or former secret policemen who have been actively engaged in espionage and other anti-state activities. The agreement puts to one side two other Estonian demands - for a return of two slices of Russian territory which had been part of the pre-war Estonian Republic, and for a statement of regret on the Russian side for the Soviet occupation of Estonia and the repression of the population after the war. Neither of these - especially, as Estonian officials admit privately, the first - are likely to be conceded and may be shelved quietly if relations settle down. Some 500,000 Russian speakers still live in Estonia; 40,000 have applied to leave, 60,000 have applied for Estonian citizenship and the majority are undecided. Estonia's economy is in by far the healthiest shape of any of the 15 former Soviet states and this is likely to persuade many of the Russian speakers to learn enough Estonian to pass the language test necessary to apply to transfer their allegiance from Russia to Estonia.

It became immediately obvious after the plebiscite  that the people had cast their votes for independence without  being in the least guided by the national idea, but by a hope  for a better economic situation, in comparison with Russia, and  a quick reformation of the economy of Ukraine, whose  possibilities were being touted by prominent politicians and  economists. The lack of economic reforms led with catastrophic  speed to a drop in the standard of living and placed the economy  of Ukraine on the brink of a crash.    The Crimean parties and movements that came out for the  independence of Crimea or annexation to Russia acquired a  political weight in direct proportional dependence on a  worsening of the economic situation. The most active was the  Republican Movement of Crimea (later organized into the  Republican Party of Crimea), headed by Yuriy Meshkov.    Yuriy Meshkov, who won convincingly in the presidential  elections, gained this victory most of all owing to economic  promises: The inclusion of Crimea in the ruble zone and the  establishment of close economic ties with Russia. One of  Meshkov's main promises before the first round of voting was the  conduct of a referendum on the status of Crimea; however, after  the adoption by the Ukrainian parliament of amendments to the  Constitution that allowed the president of Ukraine to revoke the  decisions of the Crimean authorities that do not conform to  Ukrainian legislation, Meshkov softened his position  significantly regarding relations with Ukraine just before the  second round, and he even began to say that there is no question  of secession from Ukraine. Meshkov did not set forth a distinct  economic program describing the mechanism of proposed  reorganizations, either during the preelection campaign or after  his victory. A reputation for an unpredictable policy, which was  reinforced among many observers, was confirmed by Meshkov during  the course of his visit to Moscow, already as president. The  sensation of this visit was the offer to Russian economist  Yevgeniy Saburov of the post of prime minister of the Republic  of Crimea after a two-day acquaintanceship.    A successful and quick reformation of the Crimean economy,  which the newly elected president promises, is extremely  problematic. There is no strong authority in Crimea now that is  capable of implementing its decisions; there are no borders,  customs, or an currency emissions bank. In fact, the Crimean  economy cannot be fully fledged while being in strict dependence  on the economy and monetary systems of Ukraine and Russia.    Local observers note the rather tense mutual relations of  the  president and the old managerial apparatus. The Supreme Soviet  of Crimea and the ""party in power"" that was formed, relying on  Nikolay Bagrov, the speaker of parliament, a rival of Meshkov in  the presidential elections, is in no hurry to support the  radical steps of the newly elected president that are capable of  leading to a confrontation with Ukrainian authorities. Moreover,  the invitation to Yevgeniy Saburov to work in the Crimea aroused  displeasure both among a significant part of the local political  elite and in government circles.    The first economic projects that could be heard from the  lips  of Yuriy Meshkov (the introduction of the ruble together with  the Ukrainian coupon into monetary circulation, the use of  Crimea as a landing site for ""Shuttles"" and ""Burans"") and  Yevgeniy Saburov, who has assumed the duties of deputy prime  minister (the establishment of a multiple currency regime, in  which not only rubles and coupons will be in circulation  simultaneously, but also dollars, marks, and others, and the  speedy transformation of the Crimea into an international  tourist health resort center) are unrealistic.    Crimea's economy is rigidly tied to the Ukrainian economy.  It  is sufficient to mention two factors that are essential to the  vital activity of the peninsula: The drinking water and electric  power come from Ukraine. A change in the status of the Crimea  will at least lead to a switch to world prices for water and  electric power, which the Crimean economy cannot endure.    On 24 February, the Supreme Council of Ukraine passed the  decree ""On the Status of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea in  Accordance with the Constitution and Legislation of Ukraine.""  The decree instructed the Supreme Council of Crimea in a month's  time to bring the laws and Constitution of Crimea into  conformity with Ukrainian legislation, and the president of  Ukraine--to ensure the implementation of the law on the  representation of the president of Ukraine in Crimea and  together with the procurator general of Ukraine to react in a  timely way to violations of the legislation of Ukraine by  Crimean authorities. This document was Kiev's first reaction to  the development of the Crimean situation after the election of  the president, and it became a warning on the readiness of  Ukrainian authorities to take harsh measures in the event of  attempts to change the status of Crimea.    The position of official Kiev is supported by the majlis of  the Crimean Tatar people. It declared its nonrecognition of the  institution of president, which is recorded in the Crimean  Constitution, inasmuch as it was adopted without the  participation of representatives of the indigenous people, and  also nonrecognition of the presidential powers of persons whose  policy will be directed at ignoring the right of the Crimean  Tatars to self-determination. Thus, the Crimean Tatars reserve  for themselves the right of acts of civil disobedience and even  more resolute measures.    It can be claimed that stability in the Republic of Crimea  will depend to a significant degree on the position of Russia,  which has not been clearly stated at an official level to this  day. The attempts to strengthen Russian influence in Crimea on a  state level will lead to serious complications in  Russian-Ukrainian relations and will most likely arouse a  negative reaction on the part of the world community. This  variant is entirely possible: Ukraine will reject the removal of  nuclear weapons from its territory in the event of unilateral  actions by Russia with respect to Crimea, inasmuch as this will  be a violation of the guarantees of security given by Russia in  the signing of pertinent documents. Thus, Crimea becomes one of  the important factors of the stability of the European part of  the former USSR.     "

The plenum stressed the economic results of the first part  of  1994, a period during which the province registered modest  increases in mercantile production. This reflects the beginning  of the recovery process and how much still needs to be done to  meet the population's needs. The sugarcane harvest's goal was a  50-percent increase in 1994, and although more sugar was  produced than in the previous harvest, and several mills are  still grinding, this goal will not be reached. Slight increases  were registered in potato, tomato, and egg production, as well  as in the harvests of tobacco, pine resin, and self-sufficiency  crops.    The plenum called for increased efforts to quickly reach the  production level of previous years and insisted on the need for  more efficiency in collection, especially in the farming sector.  The fight against crime, and defense issues were also discussed.    Fidel Ramos Pereda, member of the Central Committee and  first  secretary of the PCC in Pinar del Rio Province, praised the  frankness with which the issues were discussed, acknowledging  the modest progress made and the awareness that it is not  enough, and that the results rest on the efforts of every  revolutionary.

0,FT923-1460 ,"FT923-1460 _AN-CIWCOAAOFT 920923   FT  23 SEP 92 / Washington group backs relaxation of Cuba embargo      By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor   THE US should exempt tourism and communications from its embargo on Cuba to improve the flow of information and ideas to the country, an influential foreign policy group has recommended. The Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue's task-force on Cuba concluded that such a selective relaxation of the embargo 'is the best way to foster political opening' in Cuba and more likely than isolation to bring change. This would mean expanding modest steps already taken by the Bush administration, and would include allowing an upgrading of the telephone service between the US and Cuba; permitting all US citizens, including tourists, to visit Cuba; allowing scheduled air flights; establishing direct mail links; and encouraging scientific, academic and other exchanges. However, the group - comprising prominent personalities from North and Latin America and led by Mr Elliot Richardson, former US attorney-general - suggested that further relaxation of the embargo should only follow positive steps by the Cuban government towards democracy and respect for human rights. The task-force, whose report was published last week, said the Cuban government - which has suffered a devastating economic blow from the collapse of communist regimes in east Europe and the Soviet Union - has recently 'sharply stepped up its repression against all dissident groups'. But it found no evidence that tightening the embargo and further isolating Cuba would provoke positive change there. Such a policy would be 'short-sighted, costly for the people of Cuba and probably counterproductive'. It also rejected the opposite view that the embargo should be lifted entirely: this would give away bargaining chips in negotiations to encourage a change of policy in Cuba. The task-force said that Radio Marti, the propaganda station relayed to Cuba, should become a source of objective news while TV Marti, whose operation violates international conventions, should be closed. The US should also attempt to reduce Cuba's fear of military attack and start to negotiate concrete accords with Havana over, for example, migration agreements and weather and environmental matters. US policy towards other countries should not be influenced by their relations with Cuba. The group said it opposed legislation, such as that now being proposed in the US Congress, designed to prohibit all trade with Cuba by subsidiaries of US companies in other countries. The report's likely influence on US policy is still unclear. In obvious efforts to attract exiled Cuban voters in Florida, both main candidates in this year's US presidential election have promised a hard-line stance against the regime of President Fidel Castro.

Has this policy not failed?    [Kinkel] Certainly not. There is no alternative to this  policy. To support the reform forces is not only Germany's  policy but all significant countries pursue the same course.  What we must achieve in Russia is that the developments toward  law-governed and market-economy structures become irreversible,  and that the revolutionary process comes to a standstill -- or,  at least, to a consolidation so that this huge, important  country can embark on quieter tracks.    [Guensche] The figureheads among the reformers have  abandoned ship....    [Kinkel] That is not quite true either. You are obviously  alluding to Gaydar and Federov. It is true that the resignation  of the two men was not a good signal because both had a good  reputation in the West, for example at the IMF, the World Bank,  among economic experts, and because one thought that they would  be capable of implementing the necessary economic reforms that  are so decisive for the political success of the Russian  reforms. Yet, the real figurehead for the Russian reforms is  President Yeltsin.    [Guensche] Prime Minister Chernomyrdin has spoken of the end  of the market romanticism....    [Kinkel] Some of Mr. Chernomyrdin's recent remarks, if he  really made them in the way they were received outside, were  indeed somewhat irritating. Still, I think that he supports  Yeltsin's policy.    [Guensche] Mr. Illrionov, Chernomyrdin's economic adviser,  has given up this week. Are all these events not serious  warning signals?    [Kinkel] Yes, they are warning signals. However, could  anybody really expect the enormously difficult Russian  transformation process from dictatorship to democracy, from  total controlled economy to the market economy to have taken  place rapidly and without any problems? My answer is: no.  Problems, adjustments, setbacks were bound to occur. Still,  this must not influence our policy of support for the reform  forces. I repeat that I do not see any alternative to this  policy.    [Guensche] Is it not also a warning sign when President  Yeltsin announces that he would defend more strongly the  interests of the 25 million Russians living in the ""immediate  neighborhood,"" that is to say in the former Soviet republics?    [Kinkel] Yeltsin is under pressure from the conservatives  and extremists. He must take certain things into consideration.  What you are referring to is not nice and must neither be  belittled nor dramatized.    [Guensche] Your counterpart, Kozyrev, claims a protective  function for Russia in the Baltics, and has spoken of Russia's  ""special role"" on the territory of the old Soviet Union. Does  this not point to a U-turn in the former position?    [Kinkel] Russia's relations with the Baltic countries are  particularly sensitive as a result of the minority problems, the  issue of the withdrawal of Russian forces, and the somewhat  unfortunate legal regulations for Russians living in the Baltic  countries. Still, we must not accept Russia's claims of  hegemony.    [Guensche] Is this not exactly what we did in the case of  the NATO decision?    [Kinkel] No, we have always said -- and I am doing it again  -- that Russia cannot claim a veto right regarding the getting  closer to NATO or membership of Central and East European  reformist countries. Nevertheless, it is also in the interest  of those countries that, by creating a new European security  architecture, we avoid opening up new gulfs between Russia, the  CIS countries, and the Central and East European countries.    [Guensche] Do you not sometimes get the feeling that Russia  is trying to resuscitate the old Soviet Union in a new form?    [Kinkel] I am building on the success of the reform forces,  who do not want that. Once again: One cannot be happy about  some tendencies that began to emerge recently. The success of  the extremists in the election is not something, either, that  would strengthen confidence in this large and important country.  Still, we must not lose patience and not expect too much too  rapidly.    [Guensche] How reliable is Yeltsin for you as a partner?    [Kinkel] Yeltsin personifies and articulates the reform  forces. We are banking on him and we hope that Yeltsin will  hold his own, which is why we support him.    [Guensche] Even people close to Yeltsin admit that the  president is ill. Do you have any information on how ill he is?    [Kinkel] No.    [Guensche] What is your very personal prediction for the  developments in Russia?    [Kinkel] I am hopeful that things will turn out well. We  want to contribute everything we can to it.     "

Following the forced  entry into the Belgian Embassy, other groups of Cubans  separately entered into the German Embassy and the Chilean  Consulate, but in none of these cases have Cuban authorities  allowed the perpetrators of these illegal acts to leave the  country.    A recent statement issued by the Cuban Foreign Ministry was  explicit enough to make potential violators give up their goal  of violating the norms that regulate diplomatic sites worldwide.    This is not the first time groups have tried to use  embassies  or ambassador's residences as springboards for their immediate  exit from Cuba because they believe that the fanfare of the act  itself and the political character they want to give it will  ease the way.    The Cuban authorities' position has always been to firmly  deny such demands. In these new cases, as on previous occasions,  the Cuban authorities have insisted that people who commit such  crimes may return to their homes without facing charges,  although the perpetrators will not be exempt from punishment for  previous crimes or for crimes committed during the forced entry  into a diplomatic site.    The previously mentioned Cuban Foreign Ministry statement  was  even more dynamic in confirming that anyone who enters a  diplomatic site by force will never be authorized to leave the  country, even if they later abandon the site. By stating  clearly that people involved in such acts permanently lose the  right to leave the country, the Cuban Government has taken the  necessary steps to better protect embassies which, it seems,  have become the target of individuals who would like to leave  the island through this ill-suited path without being  politically persecuted.    As Belgian, German, and Chilean diplomats have seen, the  people they are harboring are not the object of political  persecution. Moreover, it is very clear that these individuals  are additions to a long list of Cubans who want to emigrate to  the United States, but the U.S. Interests Section in Havana  continues to grant visas with an eyedropper, denying visas to  most of applicants.    With the Foreign Ministry's recent statement, Cuba has  stressed its traditional policy of not giving in to pressure  exerted by people who purport to emigrate by illegal and even  violent means.

More than 60 percent of the visa applications rejected by  the  U.S. Interests Section in Havana are submitted by youths, who  also make up the majority of illegal departures from Cuba, the  newspaper states.    Because of this, the newspaper adds, the only option left is  to risk their lives crossing the sea in fragile crafts to reach  the United States and then be accepted without hesitation, as  opposed to the treatment Haitians, Mexicans, or Chinese receive.    Under the title ""U.S. Visa: Preferably Dead,"" the newspaper  makes an analysis of Cuban migration to the United States from  the last century to the present and highlights some of the main  causes, such as economic crises, wars, and the resulting family  reunifications.    According to Rafael Hernandez, a political analyst and  university professor, quoted by JUVENTUD REBELDE, ""the largest  migratory wave -- more than 250,000 people -- left Cuba between  1965-1973, during the years with the greatest economic  difficulty and their main motivation was generalized shortages.""    Something similar, the newspaper adds, is happening lately,  although Cuban immigrants find themselves forced to state that  they ""go in search of liberty"" or are ""fleeing a totalitarian  regime.""    As far as Cuban diplomat Ariel Ricardo is concerned, the  situation of his fellow citizens has an ideological connotation  that makes them different from Haitians, Mexicans, or other  Latin immigrants and added that the idea is to try to show that  they ""are fleeing from the Castro-communist dictatorship,"" which  is not true in most cases.    Ricardo stated that one example is trumpet player Arturo  Sandoval, who when replying to the question whether he would  return to Cuba if communism was overthrown, said: ""You are  silly. Do you think I want to live in a Third World country?""    JUVENTUD REBELDE disclosed that the U.S. intention of giving  a political tint to all immigration from Cuba was recently  questioned by Manolo Salgado, a reporter for the U.S. newspaper  EL NUEVO HERALD.    ""Our Cuban brothers do not expect or demand that we take  from  here the redeeming torch of liberty. They are satisfied with  food, medicines, clothing, shoes, and what is most important at  this moment: dollars,"" Salgado stated, according to JUVENTUD  REBELDE.     "

We are presenting a recording of the interview again.  The interviewer is Nato Oniani, a journalist.    [Oniani] Batono [Georgian polite address] Eduard, a decision  on Georgia joining the CIS caused rather a strong reaction among  our deputies. A view was expressed that Georgia did not have to  look at Russia as a protector and savior, that this was a loss  of the sovereignty achieved in years, that Russia still  continued to try to accomplish its own aims, that is, the  restoration of the Russian Empire and that help had to be sought  elsewhere, because it will be impossible to speak about  friendship with a country that itself prompts the issues to talk  about.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. I would like the TV viewers to  pardon me for repeating some parts from my speech at the  parliament sitting, because I have had to return to the debates  three times today. I regard this as a landmark in Georgian  history. Those who are more or less familiar with our past and  watch current affairs closely, will agree with me that all these  centuries have been searching times. Friends, allies, and even  protectors have been looked for. This is the fate of a small  country and especially a country occupying a geopolitical  situation like ours. The search is still going on and my  personal decision that Georgia has had to unite -- joining the  CIS is a continuation of this course, of this road, and of this  history.    I am sure that future generations will analyze all this and  will realize that this has been a necessary step to be taken, a  word to be uttered.    What response should be given to those who say that this  will  not solve any problem, or that we have to look for a way for  survival elsewhere, or this is a loss of sovereignty? I have  already given a comprehensive answer to that but I will  reiterate in general terms.    First of all, this is an opportunity to settle fundamental  problems -- how efficiently this opportunity will be used  depends on us as well as on our CIS partners. In the first  instance I mean the economy. The economy will never revive, we  will not reach our desired goals quickly without the CIS. The  documents we have already signed and still have to sign create  beneficial conditions for speeding up economic integration or  rather for the restoration of what had already existed, what we  should not have lost and what we should not have destroyed. But  we destroyed it with our own hands and that is why our economy  is frozen and on a very low level.    Apart from the economy, there are principles and guarantees  for collective security, which will come to effect if not today,  then tomorrow. This is very essential.    In my opinion, it is not serious to speak of the loss of  sovereignty just because a part of the sovereignty is delegated  to the Commonwealth. Georgia is not the only country in this  situation. There are 12 countries in the European Union and  they delegate even more rights to the union. Take the ASEAN, a  brilliant union in the Pacific and Asia, which created a basis  for the revival and prosperity of the once poor countries. A  lot of rights are delegated there also. I can also bring  examples of other regional unions.    There may be discussions, but you have to reckon with common  ground rather than only your personal view, while aspiring to  believe not to share grounds, and just stick stubbornly to what  you consider the absolute truth. I would like to add that when  a politician, and a serious politician at that, takes a  decision, he is obliged to take into consideration current  interests and we have to take into consideration interests of  saving the country.    Today, we are facing the issue of the country's existence or  non- existence and therefore you have to take a decision that  provides the chance of survival. At the same time, a politician  has to think of what will be essential tomorrow, what effects  this present decision will have in five years' time, in 10  years' time, in 20 years' time.    I would say that if the Commonwealth develops in the way all  other regional and continental unions of the world have  developed, I think our step can be justified from the future's  point of view. If it does not develop in this way and it  disintegrates, Georgia eventually will not lose anything. This  is the case when we can gain a lot if the Commonwealth proves to  be a real force and we can lose a lot and even everything if we  do not join.    I would like to tell those who prompt us that Russia and the  CIS are not a salvation and we have to look for other ways: Did  we not look for other ways? Now, finally, my visit to the  United States. Before that, there were my contacts with western,  southern, eastern, northern countries. All ways have been  tried. Some make our situation easier, some actively help us,  but a principal way of survival and salvation has not yet been  found. That is why, being guided by the existing situation, I  have considered it essential to take a decision like this. I do  not think I have made a mistake.    There are talks that Russia cannot be the survival [for  Georgia]. Some say another way. We apparently had to sign an  agreement with Russia but did not have to join the CIS. I do  not think there is any logic in this.    First of all, it is absurd to ignore Russia, whatever  forces come to power there. I believe that whoever argues over  the issue on whether it is necessary to have relations with  Russia, he is very far from reality and very far from politics.    If we agree that Russia is essential [for us], we would  rather have relations with the Russia that is in the  Commonwealth. For instance, do we prefer to be left  face-to-face with a huge state like Russia or is it better to  have a variant when we are in the CIS, and Russia is in the CIS,  too? This means that bilateral relations are arranged and  guaranteed and, at the same time, there are certain guarantees  of security, collective security. I think this is also a more  or less good reason. That is why I could not agree with  arguments in parliament. Although, I have to say that there  were sound ideas in certain speeches and I welcome them.  [transmission then lost]     "

Cuba had feared that the US might object to the recent expansion in trade and economic relations between its two partners in the North American Free Trade Agreement, and Cuba. However, Cuba had been told that trade with Canada and Mexico would continue, and that both countries would support an end to the embargo, said Mr Bolanos. 'This is the assurance we sought and which we have finally received. Both Canada and Mexico have argued publicly against the continuation of the economic embargo,' he said. 'There is now no chance that either the Canadian or Mexican governments will concern themselves with what the US has to say about commercial links with Cuba.' In diplomatic discussions with Canada and Mexico, Cuba was told that it had no reason to be concerned for the effects of the implementation of Nafta on Cuban trade and economic relations. However, Cuban officials continued to hint at the possibility of 'subtle pressure' by the US on the other Nafta members to reduce economic links with Cuba or to eliminate them altogether. 'Cuba has now been comforted by both the Canadian and Mexican governments through visits to the island and statements by officials of both governments,' Mr Bolanos said. President Carlos Salinas of Mexico had recently indicated his government's desire to enhance trade with Cuba, and there had been similar assurances on her visit to Havana from Ms Christine Stewart, Canada's parliamentary secretary for foreign affairs.

In an annual report on worldwide drug production and  trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban  authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug  policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the  Unites States in this area in 1993.    According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the  world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug  Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle  against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages  and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity  to combat drugs.    Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and  has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region  to fight the scourge of drug trafficking.    Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an  agreement of this type with the United States, an offer which up  until now has been ignored by Washington.    Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception  of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters as  well as supplying information to U.S. services in charge of  confronting this problem.    The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and  the report admits that although cocaine continues to be the main  threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroine is  growing at an alarming rate.

Mr Pedro Nunez Mosquera, director of multilateral affairs at the Cuban foreign ministry, told the news agency Prensa Latina: 'We are ready to sign for the sake of Latin American unity.' He said Cuba had remained outside the 1967 Tlatelolco Treaty as it did not want to renounce the right to possess arms needed for its defence. This position was justified because of a policy of hostility by the US against the island and the continuing presence of a US military base in eastern Cuba at Guantanamo Bay.

This included a Dollars 1bn contract with China and deals for Dollars 650m and Dollars 600m with India and Iran. He also mentioned 'major contracts with Syria and other countries'. Mr Gaidar revealed this in the course of a powerful defence of his market reforms to the Congress of People's Deputies. Russia would continue to export weapons, he said, but he promised to avoid conflict zones. 'We are not going to stoke conflicts by supplying arms to hot spots, but there are no reasons to abandon this important market,' he said. The acting premier, who is fighting for his political life against increasingly powerful opposition to his policies, told the country's full parliament that Russia had a choice between radical reforms and joining the ranks of third world dictatorships. He dismissed claims by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's chairman, that he was depriving the country of kinder Scandinavian market economics in favour of a harsh US model. 'A criminal slowing of restructuring an economy (dominated by the defence industry) will drag us further into underdevelopment. . . If we work really well and privatise half the economy, free the country from the reign of bureaucracy, then we will be able to discuss what kind of society we want,' he said. While admitting to a series of mistakes by his economic reform team over the past year, he said there was little room for manoeuvre on basic issues such as financial stabilisation to fend off hyperinflation, and an industrial policy which made selective use of scarce resources. But he also promised practical steps which the country needed to better implement reforms. From January 1, Russia would operate proper borders with neighbouring republics so it could get a better grip on hard currency revenues lost through illegal exports of oil and other resources. He claimed Russia would also enforce a new regime preventing other republics which used 'the Russian rouble' to interfere with monetary policy. Whether he continues as prime minister, which he sees as essential for pursuing 'responsible reform', is yet unclear. His speech drew polite applause, but appears to have swayed few of the deputies intent on his removal. 'It was beautiful but my pockets are still empty,' said Mr Yuri Gekht, leader of a conservative industrialist faction.  The Financial Times   London Page 3  "

Even the boldest classifications of world markets  by Western institutional investors did not view Russia as a  high-risk but potentially high-return financial market,  preferring to just pass it over in silence. However, it appears  that the incredible has happened: A large American finance  company, Pioneer Group, Inc., yesterday announced its intention  to invest on a large scale in the stock of enterprises from  Russia and the CIS; the volume of such investment at the first  stage will come to $3 million, and is expected to grow by  another $100 million. This is the first case in which  specifically institutional foreign investment in Russia has been  organized.    Pioneer Group is one of the large American finance  companies,  which manages a family of ""mutual"" funds in the United States,  Poland, India, and a number of other countries. The decision of  the Pioneer Group to establish a mutual fund solely to invest in  the Russian market represents the first case of an institutional  approach to organizing capital investment in the Russian  economy. It was no accident that the announcement of the Pioneer  Group concerning the creation of the ""Russian"" mutual fund was  timed to coincide with Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. The  important political aspect of the institutionalization of  American investment was stressed in this manner.    In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, two considerations at  once compel a serious attitude towards the intention of the  Pioneer Group to be the first American mutual fund to make money  on the Russian stock exchange. First, the Pioneer Group has  succeeded in winning considerable support from two influential  Russian organizations--the Institute of Economics of the  Transitional Period and the Association of Privatized and  Private Enterprises. Both organizations have acted as founders  of a Russian finance company established with the majority  participation of the Pioneer Group. This company will manage  financial resources raised by Pioneer in the United States and  earmarked for investment in the Russian market.    Second, the Pioneer Group has the currently unique favorable  experience of effectively managing financial resources in East  European finance markets. Three years ago, this company  established the first mutual fund in Poland, which within a very  short period of time became the main institutional player in the  financial market of that country, and introduced quite a number  of financial techniques in the Polish market that were new to  Poland (in particular, standards of professional investment  analysis). In Poland, Pioneer also started out with $3 million;  as of today, the amount of assets of the Polish fund exceeds  $400 million.    The well-known international company Ernst and Young has  been  selected to be the main financial consultant and manager of the  Pioneer project in Russia. According to an official Pioneer  press release, this company was selected because its specialists  have considerable experience and knowledge of the Russian  market. In addition, Ernst and Young has an extensive  international network.    KOMMERSANT experts note that the fact that mutual funds are  organizing investment in the Russian economy may, in and of  itself, serve as a reliable external indicator of a change in  the quality of the Russian financial market. As the president of  the Pioneer Group, John Cogan (John Cogan [name rendered in  English in parentheses]), stated in yesterday's official press  release, his experts have been following the evolution of the  financial market of Russia for a long time. In Mr. Cogan's  opinion, the current stage of development of privatization and  structural changes in Russia's economy provide unique investment  opportunities ""for experienced investors"" in the coming decade.    KOMMERSANT experts believe that the appearance of a  professional American mutual fund in the Russian market will put  Russian check funds into a serious competitive situation,  especially with regard to a dialogue with privatized enterprises  and organization of their effective transition to market  conditions for economic operations. Besides, participation of a  sizable amount of capital from Pioneer in operations on the  stock and state securities market may influence the liquidity of  these markets very beneficially.    [Boxed item]    Pioneer Group--the First Foreign Mutual Fund in Poland    Based on 1993 performance, operations of the Pioneer Polish  fund turned out to be the third most profitable within the  general structure of operations of the Pioneer family of mutual  funds. Polish observers maintain that the presence of a powerful  foreign institutional player became one of the reasons for the  creation of a liquid market on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. It is  essential that the Pioneer Polish fund uses for its operations  not only American investment but also contributions from Polish  citizens by extensively distributing its stock in Poland. [End  boxed item]    [Boxed item]    Investment Preferences of the Pioneer Group    In the United States alone, Pioneer manages an entire  ""family"" of mutual funds, of which Pioneer Bond, Pioneer Capital  Growth, Pioneer Equity-Income, and Pioneer 1, 2, and 3 are the  largest. Pioneer also manages funds in Poland, India, Taiwan,  and a number of other countries. In its press release, Pioneer  announced its intention to concentrate on the stock of  privatized Russian enterprises. However, the investment strategy  of Pioneer will be defined more clearly at the official  presentation of the fund on 19 January.    [End boxed item]     "

This was the conclusion of discussion on 'local power and economic change in Russia' conducted by Professor Philip Hanson of Birmingham University at the Royal Institute of International Affairs yesterday. 'The size of the country, the lack of a consensus on reform, the lack of a functioning legal system or the means of coercion means that local power is crucial to the outcome of economic reforms,' he said. His views on the importance of the local factor, in a country which has disintegrated into 82 administrative regional units ranging from big cities like Moscow and St Petersburg to obscure ethnic and geographical outposts, were reinforced by Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, architect of the still-born '500-day reform programme' rejected by former President Mikhail Gorbachev. To prevent the 'chaotic, individualistic disintegration of Russia accompanied by frustration and violence' Moscow should concentrate on re-establishing monetary discipline and control of banking, credit and monetary policy accompanied by maximum devolution of other powers. 'Devolution is preferable to disintegration. It recognises the reality that, for the first time in its history, Russia has to keep itself together without force applied through a centralised bureaucracy,' he told a meeting at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Mr Yavlinsky is currently working with the EBRD and the International Finance Corporation on fostering privatisation in Nizhny Novgorod, one of the reformist areas receptive to market reforms which, if successful, could serve as models for wider emulation. 'Micro-projects of the Nizhny Novgorod type provide an example of civilised decentralisation and the basis of new types of linkages to replace the authoritarian, top-down structures under which Russia has been ruled since Peter the Great,' he argued. But with the disintegrating Russian economy now on the brink of hyper-inflation the monetary authorities must raise real interest rates to positive levels to encourage higher savings and more rational investment. Russia must also push ahead with privatisation of key sectors like land, energy, gold and diamonds in order to raise the efficiency of key productive sectors and ensure the irreversibility of reform. 'At the moment everything is still nominally state-owned, so those who oppose reform only have to take over the state to get all their power back again,' Mr Yavlinsky warned. The Soviet coup leaders are to be freed from jail but prevented from leaving the country pending a trial set yesterday for April 14, Leyla Boulton writes from Moscow. Of the 12, seven have already been released from custody, and the remaining five were allowed to go home yesterday on the grounds of illness. An incompetent prosecution of the case, plus growing popular sympathy for the former Soviet leaders, suggests that the trial may not even go ahead in the end.

Although official reports on  these changes have not yet been issued, it has been learned that  in 1994 the tourism industry will have a ministry that will  group through a central directorate the Cubanacan Corporation,  the Gaviota Group, and several hotel chains operating National  Tourism Institute installations.    Statistics show that 600,000 tourists visited the island in  1993, most of them from Canada, Germany, Spain, Mexico, and  Italy. Gross revenue figures total over $530 million, which  represents an almost $200-million increase over the 1992 figure.    Given the tourism industry's pivotal role in the Cuban  economy, the topic was dealt with extensively in debates held by  the party's provincial assembly in Havana City. The assembly  agreed that Cuba ranks high among the most popular tourist  locations in the world. During the debates the assembly also  discussed shortcomings of the hotel industry such as the lack of  an established authority and adequate Cuban economic mechanisms  to manage the tourism sector. Changes were proposed for 1994  with a view to improving conditions in the tourism industry.    Discussing the tourism development program in Cuba from  another angle, it is worth mentioning that in the past year,  despite harsh economic conditions and the U.S. blockade, the  plan to increase our lodging capability continued. For  instance, not only was the number of airports in various  locations around the country increased to six, but the  facilities were adapted to receive international flights. New  communications systems were either added to or improved upon to  meet tourist demands. In addition, several hotels opened in  1993, including the five-star hotel Guitart-Cayo Coco [words  indistinct] Ciego de Avila, which was inaugurated by President  Fidel Castro. This hotel is considered one of the most  beautiful in Cuba and shows the respect that Cuba has for the  environment in its tourism projects. In addition, it is a clear  example of the harmonious way in which man can coexist with  untouched nature. Other newly opened hotels include the  four-star Barlovento Hotel at the famous Varadero seaside  resort, the Cuatro Vientos Hotel in Camaguey Province, and the  Tierramar Hotel in Santiago de Cuba.    All of this is evidence of the development program that  Cuban  authorities are implementing throughout the entire country. In  1993, 3,000 new rooms were incorporated into the tourism  industry. The plan to rescue old installations was clearly  evinced with the major repairs performed on the Sevilla Hotel in  Havana, where similar works began this year on the Havana Libre  and Havana Riviera Hotels under the auspices of such Spanish  companies as Guitart and the Caguama Caribbean Hotel. The year  1993 saw the reaffirmation of the presence of hotel chains from  various countries in Cuba, which is considered by the Cuban  Government as a necessary and unavoidable step toward achieving  the rapid growth Cuba is seeking.    This foreign participation in the tourism industry has  yielded very positive results. The administration and marketing  of Cuban units by foreign chains has led to a higher level of  occupation of the installations, where the process of perfecting  the quality of service is noticeable along with the improved  efficiency of Cuban personnel, who are gaining greater  experience in an industry that is just beginning in Cuba.    Tourism entities from 11 countries -- including Spain,  Germany, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Jamaica, Chile, and Holland --  are present here. Additionally, businessmen from various  regions have joined the national tourism industry with contracts  for joint projects such as the Guitart Group with Cubanacan for  a new hotel in Cayo Coco.    New routes of air transportation between cities of this  Caribbean island and other countries have opened up through  various companies. Cubana de Aviacion, Cuba's official tourism  airline, has increased its world's destinations to 30 cities.  Regular and chartered flights will begin this year to Santa Fe  de Bogota, Colombia; Paris, France; and Munich, Germany.    Cuban cities were added to the itineraries of European air  companies such as (Stainal), which links Madrid and Santiago de  Cuba and Varadero, and (Eaurope), which joins Barcelona with  Victoria, capital of the Basque country, and the famous resort  of Varadero. In addition, the Italian city of Milan and Cayo  Largo and Ciego de Avila have been linked. Chilena del Cobre  Airline, Ladeco, also began flights to this Caribbean island.  Costa Rica's LACSA and Antillana de Aviacion are now joining  Holland, Curacao, and Cuba. All these openings promote a broader  tourism movement to Cuba.    Cruises also began this year operated by a mixed foreign  company. This undertaking will bring large profits to the  country as vacationers will be able to take a large number of  tours from Cuban ports. This will allow us to gain experience  with a view to a possible increase in this activity, which for  the first time will originate from Cuba.    The year 1993 has been, in sum, a year of evolution,  advancement, and notable perspectives for the tourism industry  in Cuba, which has as its main resources the natural beauty,  hospitality, and friendliness of its people, security for  visitors, culture, history, and a social system that is becoming  more exclusive in the world. Most tourists list those reasons  for traveling to this Caribbean island, where they also find  comfortable accommodations that include in their decor  representative samples of the works of Cuban artists. They and  other professionals contribute to perfecting the tourism  experience. The tourism sector has become a large employer,  hiring over 60,000 workers directly and promoting the  development of other areas of the country.    Given that tourism will go from third to first place in  resource generation in the world, Cuba, which needs a notable  advancement in its economy, has reaffirmed this year its  willingness to use every resource at hand to develop this  industry. As Fidel Castro said when inaugurating the Guitart  Cayo Coco Hotel, tourism revenues can compensate for the losses  resulting from the disappearance of the Soviet Union and the  socialist bloc.

The current financial imbalances must be solved by acting on  the offer-demand principle, states an editorial in the weekly  paper which also points out the need for eliminating its causes.    The Cuban economy is burdened by an excess of circulating  currency of approximately 10 billion pesos (the same amount of  dollars as per the official exchange rate) and annual subsidies  in excess of 4 billion pesos to profitless enterprises,  according to official data.    Since a few weeks ago, and after the last convocation of the  National Assembly of the People's Government (parliament), the  CTC called on its affiliates to analyze the internal causes of  the economic crisis in the country and propose measures to  reverse it.    The editorial points out that at the first such meetings  there has been a tendency in some work centers to ""think little  about the problems, weaknesses, and errors that undermine their  own daily work.""    In this regard it proposes that the administrations present  to those assemblies an economic analysis of their management and  proposals for improving them, drafted by the main administrative  official of each unit and in understandable terms.    After admitting that there are production plans which are  ""tainted by paternalism"" which include ""large components of the  inefficiency (...) we mean to fight,"" the editorial expresses  the need to reduce the costs of production and create, in places  where it does not yet exist, an instrument for determining them.

The 25-page report that the National Assembly intends to  distribute widely at international levels adds that its powerful  northern neighbor's hostility is not limited to the economic,  trade, and financial blockade. It is also manifested in many  other issues that endanger the nation's peace and security.    In this regard, it accuses U.S. leaders of encouraging the  departure of illegal aliens and of encouraging desertion, within  the framework of its hostile policy toward the Caribbean island.    The core of the immigration matters between both nations lie  in the fact that the United States has permanently used them in  the past three decades to discredit Cuba, upholds the statement  prepared by the parliament's Foreign Relations Commission.    During the last fiscal year, 973,977 immigrants arrived to  the United States; 132,173 were admitted as refugees. Of this  total, 0.25 percent were legal immigrants from this nation,  while 2.04 were refugees or illegal immigrants.    According to the Assembly, such small percentages do not  justify the ""out of proportion propaganda"" surrounding the  issue, while it accuses Washington of offering privileged  treatment with clear political nuances to Cubans who arrive  illegally on their territory.    In addition to financial support, after one year they  automatically have a right to residency. ""No other foreign  immigrant is worthy of so many opportunities to reside, work,  and live in the United States,"" the statement indicates.    During the past years, the Havana authorities have tried to  normalize bilateral immigration relations so that these take  place within the law and in an orderly fashion, the statement  underlines.    Nevertheless, the United States continues making political  use of the immigration relations and obstructs our nation's  decisions, it notes.    Evidence of this, it adds, is how many of the so-called raft  people, kidnappers, air pirates, and deserters are received as  heroes in the United States although a visa had been denied to  many of them by the U.S. Interests Office in this capital.    According to the document, in the past border guards have  prevented some of these departures; most of the detainees are  just returned to their homes as they are considered victims of  the propaganda aired by anti-Cuban stations installed in the  United States.    Cuba is most convinced of the need to end to these  irregularities and their negative consequences. This is so not  only for Cuba but also for the United States that with its  actions encourages the crime of aircraft and boat piracy and  kidnapping in violation of bilateral and international rules,  concludes the parliamentary analysis.    The paradox of the immigration phenomena in its propaganda  projection from the United States is that the Cuban policy on  this matter never appears correct, the study concludes.    If Cuba facilitates administrative procedures and speeds up  the endeavors of any citizens to obtain an exit permit,  permanent or temporary, the U.S. Administration delays and  complicates the procedures for the trip to its territory.    If, on the contrary, it prevents the departure of illegal  aliens, Cuba is presented as a virtual jail by propaganda  machinery, and what is even worse, ""if such immigration was  allowed freely it would also be attacked, but with the threat of  military action,"" the document alerts.

It is being further squeezed by a recent tightening of the US economic embargo. In talks with the Clinton administration last week about stemming the flow of illegal immigrants to the US from Cuba's shores, the Cubans sought a commitment from Washington to discuss the 32-year-old embargo. But most independent observers believe that domestic economic reform is what is needed to solve Cuba's economic problems. The Cuban government has moved slowly on reform, despite calls for more haste from outsiders such as Mr Carlos Solchaga, the former Spanish finance minister. Cuba has begun to welcome foreign investors in some sectors, and last year it made the US dollar legal tender. But there have been few indications of what the next step might be. Some are satisfied with the modest changes made so far. 'The good thing is that you can use your imagination to make things,' says 30-year-old Pedro Raurell, who sells mugs, pots, ladles and plates made from old soft-drink cans and aluminium sheeting. On a good day, Mr Raurell says, he can make 300 pesos. Not bad for a country where the average wage for a state worker is between 100 and 200 pesos a month. But, while legalising some self-employment has helped a number of Cubans, it has by no means solved the severe economic squeeze faced by the majority. Resolver - a popular word in the Cuban vocabulary, which means obtaining things or just 'getting by' in general - remains the order of the day. Most Cubans say the subsidised food and consumer goods provided by the state rationing system each month do not even come close to feeding an average family. The black market, a mainstay of daily existence since Soviet trade and aid dried up, is booming despite a recent government crackdown, while the lifting of the ban on dollars seems to have encouraged it. Only the dollar has real buying power. The black market rate for the dollar hovers between 80 and 100 pesos. Holders of dollars, obtained legally or illegally, can buy almost anything - either on the black market or in the dozens of new dollar stores for Cubans opened by the government over the past year. These sell food, clothes and prized consumer items, such as televisions and domestic appliances. Those with dollars can also eat and drink at state-owned restaurants and snack-bars, now open to Cubans as well as foreigners - and at illegal eating houses that have sprung up all over Havana. Getting by without dollars and on a small monthly salary of Cuban pesos is much harder, and for some impossible. And a striking novelty in today's Cuba is that people are no longer afraid - as they were even a few months ago - to speak their minds about the country's state of decay. After a restless, sweltering August which saw serious street disturbances in Havana and an exodus by sea of several thousand refugees, public discontent has become a tangible force in homes and on the streets. Old-style revolutionary fervour, still trumpeted by bright propaganda billboards, has been eroded by the economic crisis, the influence of a tourist industry serving mostly western visitors and by the government's own signals that it is moving slowly towards a limited market economy. Instead of extolling the virtues of the revolution and Cuba's one-party political system, Cubans are more likely to complain about food shortages, electricity blackouts, the collapse of public transport and other daily economic hardships. Behind the Cubans' natural cheerfulness and sardonic sense of humour, there is a sense of brooding frustration. The more than 30,000 balseros, or rafters, who have left Cuba since early August in flimsy, home-made boats bound for the US, symbolise this disenchantment. Until the Cuban authorities reimposed a ban on illegal departures under a new immigration accord agreed with the US on September 9, the young, mostly male rafters were outspoken critics of Cuba's current plight. In response to any inquiry, they directed a stream of rage and frustration against the economy, the political system and the figure of Cuba's 68-year-old president, Mr Fidel Castro. 'People are leaving because of a lack of freedom. Lack of freedom to do things, grow things, create things, invent things,' said 32-year-old Hector from the Havana suburb of San Miguel de Padron, as he helped friends prepare a raft at Brisas del Mar, some 18 miles east of Havana. Mr Castro publicly admits a segment of the population is disenchanted with socialism, but insists the vast majority of Cubans still remains loyal. It is even possible that he allowed the rafters to leave in an effort to defuse the discontent whose reality he acknowledges. It is also possible that the exodus was aimed at putting pressure on the US to lift its embargo, rather than at cooling domestic tensions. Either way, things have quietened down following the departure of so many. And for the more than 10m Cubans who did not leave after August 5, there is an air of expectancy: the future will somehow - must somehow - be better than the present. Even Cuba's tightly controlled state media, whose output normally ranges from euphoric praise for the Revolution to staid ideological conformity, acknowledges the moment is one of change. 'Things which didn't work in the past, even when we had resources, can't be expected to work now. The country is changing rapidly,' the trade union weekly, Trabajadores, said this month. The question for the Castro government is whether it will be able to influence this change, or merely be carried along - or perhaps swept away - by the tide of events.

Heavy rains have been  disrupting the progress of the harvest in this part of the  nation and were the main reason for the poor results achieved in  the last 10 days.    [Torres] ""The order is clear: We are to continue fighting  and  have to grind the very last cane to extract the maximum sugar.""    In Guantanamo, Torres chaired the 10-day progress meeting in  the southeastern region, where the host province surpassed the  neighboring provinces of Santiago de Cuba and Granma.    Torres acknowledged that the sugar harvest is the most  difficult task within the sugarcane production program. Cuba's  goal is to exceed by several hundred tons last year's harvest,  which failed to produce approximately $450 million of income to  Cuba. The persistent rains have now added to the known  difficulties in the southeastern region.    [Torres] ""We can no longer ask for the same results as those  that were expected in other times; but we can look for the  maximum, the variants, to grind with the most efficiency  possible.""    In this 10-day harvest progress meeting, Havana Province  cane  harvesters were praised for reaching their sugar production  goal. Also stressed at the meeting was the necessity to maintain  an elevated planting rate to ensure increased production in the  next harvest. Guantanamo Province announced that, by the end of  May, it will be the first to reach its spring planting program  of 180 caballerias.     "

There were no other candidates, so there could have been no  other choice.    But at that moment Havana became more than just another host of the  oft-troubled quadrennial games. For the now-shrinking Communist world, the  Games became a symbol. For Castro and his people, the Games became a cause. And  for the U.S. government, they became a problem.    In a year and a half, on Aug. 3, 1991, the Pan Am Games will begin. But as  things stand now -- due to the long-standing U.S. trade embargo of Cuba -- the  Games will go on without the sport of bowling, without U.S. spectators, U.S.  cash and, most important, possibly without live U.S. television. There also are  concerns about how drug-testing equipment will get to Cuba and how technicians  will be trained.    What's more, there may be long-term negative repercussions involving the United  States in international Olympic circles if some of these problems don't get  solved.    ""Some nations in Latin America that have been opposed to the United States or  U.S. policy will use this unfairly to argue that the U.S. government is against  sport,"" said U.S. Olympic Committee President Robert Helmick. ""The problem is a  lot of sports leaders around the world will buy it. So if indeed there are a  series of problems that are not resolved, there could be repercussions and they  could reflect upon the Olympic bids of our cities.""    One of those cities is Atlanta, which is locked in a multi-million dollar  battle with five other cities for the 1996 Summer Olympics. The International  Olympic Committee will choose the winner this September.    ""Generally, this is not helpful,"" said Doug Gatlin, executive director of the  Atlanta Organizing Committee. ""We would like the embargo to be lifted for  international sport. The bad news is (the Pan Am Games situation) might reflect  badly on us even though we are opposed to the embargo.""    Once again, sports and politics have collided in the international arena, this  time the competition among the 38 nations of North, South and Central America  in the year preceding the Olympics. With Cuba hosting its first major  international sporting event since Castro took over in 1959, policies that have  been in place for decades for U.S. business are coming into play for U.S.  sport.    A State Department official who wished to remain anonymous said, ""We support  U.S. participation in a sporting event, but we are not going to turn our  foreign policy upside down for it.""    The problems are multiple; potential solutions confounding.    U.S. companies are not allowed by law to trade with Cambodia, Vietnam, North  Korea or Cuba without a license. The Treasury Department is responsible for  enforcing the embargo and granting those licenses. The embargo was designed to  keep U.S. currency and-or goods that can be traded for U.S. currency out of  Cuba.    Now, these goods include bowling alleys and drug-testing equipment. And it's  ABC Sports that wants to pay Cuba a reported $9 million in cash.    Bowling is trying to gain any recognition it can in the Olympic arena, so when  it became a Pan Am Games medal sport in 1986 and the Cubans said they didn't  have bowling facilities, officials thought they could help Cuba learn about the  game and construct bowling lanes at the same time. The Brunswick Corporation  offered to donate several used lanes and related equipment to a bowling  facility to be built for the Games, according to Jerry Koenig, executive  director of the U.S. Tenpin Bowling Federation.    But the Treasury Department turned down Brunswick's request for a license.    ""We couldn't send the stuff to Cuba unless we brought it back, and it wasn't  worth it to the company to do that,"" Koenig said. ""Plus, if we took it out the  Cubans would be left with an empty building. Those weren't the conditions that  the Cubans agreed on going in.""    So bowling officials are scrambling to find a third country willing to provide  the equipment and send it to Cuba. Bowling officials in Japan and Canada have  declined, and Koenig said the latest hope is Singapore.    ""I'd say our sport is in a state of limbo now, and it's unfortunate, because  this would have been a great opportunity for us,"" Koenig said.    Hewlett-Packard has provided the drug-testing equipment for almost every  international sporting event in the last decade: the Olympics, the Pan Am  Games, the World Cup of soccer. It usually sells the equipment to the  organizing committee of the event, and the lab stays in operation after the  event is over.    Not this time, though.    ""It's a bit of a road block right now, although I do think we'll get a  temporary export license to get the equipment in there for the Games and then  take it out again,"" said Bud Bromley, major accounts manager for the analytical  products group of Hewlett-Packard. ""It's a political problem, and we understand  it. The U.S. government is justified in dealing with Fidel Castro this way.""    It's possible the company will lease the equipment, valued at more than  $500,000, to the Pan American Sports Organization, based in Mexico, Bromley  said. There are other options as well.    While he believes the lab will be in place in Havana in time for the Games, he  is not as certain who will be administering and analyzing the tests.    ""We usually train local people to run the lab,"" Bromley said. ""But this delay  may mean we won't have time to do that and someone from the International  Olympic Committee will have to run the lab.""    The most lucrative venture currently in jeopardy is ABC's contract to provide  live TV coverage of the Games. In December, Capital Cities-ABC Inc. filed suit  in the Southern District of New York against the Treasury Department seeking a  reversal of a decision banning the network from paying about $9 million for the  rights to the Games.    The Treasury Department said it would not allow the payment because it ""would  transfer very substantial sums to Cuba,"" wrote R. Richard Newcomb, director of  Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. He said the department considers  the live telecast ""an activity related to entertainment,"" not news reporting or  news gathering. The stationing of production personnel in Cuba also concerns  the department.    Stephen Solomon, senior vice president for ABC Sports, said the network doesn't  understand the ""inconsistency inherent in the ... decision to allow the U.S.  team to compete in Cuba but to deny U.S. citizens their First Amendment right  to view U.S. athletes in competition."" Solomon also said ABC objected to being  allowed to pay for videotaping the Games, but not for a live broadcast.    ""This artificial distinction just does not make sense to us,"" Solomon said.    Solomon said a hearing on the suit is tentatively set for March 9. He said he  hopes for a decision on the matter a week or so after that.    ""It's not too late, but it will be a struggle (to put on a telecast) starting  in mid-March,"" Solomon said. ""We could probably even do it in early to  mid-June, but that's about it.""    The USOC wants to see the Games on TV. ""It's very important to the American  public and to the loved ones of the athletes to see the events on TV,  particularly since they can't go and watch,"" Helmick said. ""We just hope it can  be worked out between ABC and the Treasury Department.""    There will be restrictions on U.S. Olympic officials and athletes in Havana.  They will have to report how much money they take into Cuba -- and how much  they take out two or three weeks later. No credit cards will be allowed. And,  unless restrictions ease, only the official U.S. delegation -- no families, no  friends -- will be allowed in, Helmick said.    Meanwhile, the USOC, fearful of problems with communications and equipment, is  considering anchoring a ship off the coast of Havana to house some of its  personnel (non-athletes) and avoid irritations.    The issue is emotional. Elliot Abrams, former State Department assistant  secretary for Inter-American affairs and now a Washington attorney, said the  Games should never have been granted to Havana.    ""It's very striking, in this moment of mass democratization in Latin America  and around the world, that the Games will be held in one of the very few  dictatorships in the hemisphere,"" Abrams said. ""It's disgraceful to hold the  Games in Cuba.""    Castro has angered the Olympic community by boycotting the last two Olympic  Games. Cuba joined the Soviet boycott of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and  skipped the 1988 Games for political reasons. Some thought Cuba might lose the  Pan Am Games for being a no-show in Seoul, but no movement to take away the  event materialized.

Differences and  contradictions are currently beginning to appear between large  and small states, those which have the potential for raw  materials and those who depend on shipments of the latter [words  indistinct]. In light of this, the nature of Belarusian  conditions for reforming the economy is quite specific; it  cannot be understood without taking into account the role of the  Belarusian economy in the single economic complex of the former  USSR. Under the conditions of a centrally administered planned  economy, huge enterprises were concentrated on Belarusian soil,  engaged in the processing of raw materials and semifinished  products, as well as the manufacturing of end products. Those  enterprises used to be linked with suppliers in all regions of  the USSR within the framework of a single national system.    Then the collapse occurred and brought about a dramatic  disruption in existing economic relations. As a result of this,  the Belarusian economy found itself overnight in dire straits.  Administrative levers have been, for the most part, lost, while  the structure of market motivation has not yet been created.  Unfortunately, economic reform, a need for which has matured in  our society, actually turned into a curse word for many people,  just as with the word perestroyka. Our numerous compatriots  cannot psychologically accept reform, because who needs reform  when it encroaches on the vital interests of the people? It is  a well-known fact that territorial-ethnic conflicts on the  territory of the former USSR, and not just conflicts but wars  too, were primarily caused by the dramatic plunge in people's  living standards. With regard to this, I would like to point  out that certain politicians in our country, driven by unknown  motives, are trying to transform economic reform into interstate  conflicts and prevent natural civilized rapprochement between  Belarus and Russia. As you know, ideological cliches -- which  are absolutely alien to Belarusians -- are being used to block  this process: Russia is depicted as an imperial state that is  heading in a different direction. I want to state this with  full responsibility: We have been carefully examining all new  trends in the theory and practice of contemporary interstate  economic relations. Yes, we, earlier than anybody else,  assessed the so-called economic theories of our local opponents,  who envision reorienting the Belarusian economy from the  traditional union with Russia along the East-West axis, toward  the allegedly new North-South axis, also called the Baltic-Black  Sea belt. I would put it this way: The obsoleteness of this  theory becomes evident given that as long ago as the turn of the  20th century the geopolitical senselessness of such views and  their economic and political deficiency were proven, as well as  the impossibility to implement this idea in light of the  existing balance of forces in the world arena. Our economy's  current problems and hardships were not caused by its internal  incongruities, but rather by dependence on external factors.  [passage omitted]    We were finally demonstrated who feeds whom. We once used to  holler that all the republics feed Russia. We were shown the  contrary quite fast. We were trying to (?discuss) the Orsha  defeat [reference to victory of Lithuanian-Belarusian troops  over Russia in the mid-16th century]; meanwhile, our gas and oil  supplies were cut off. It was not in 1500 or so that we lost or  won that battle; we lost the battle now, following the economic  sanctions that had been used against us. Let us not forget  this. [passage omitted]    Let us look at Europe, which has came close to creating the  European Union in the form of a single state structure built on  the basis of federalism. What do we see? We see the evident  striving by European states to secure free movement of people,  products, services, and capital. They have decided to adopt a  common monetary unit, introduce single European citizenship, and  (?form) the European Parliament. Thus, Europe, having lived  through two world wars, has chosen a new path of development --  one of economic and political integration. We are actually  dealing with the formation of a powerful integrated structure of  a single European state. Nobody says that the expansion of  supranational powers among the European structures will in some  way limit state sovereignty. I am quite positive that in the  near future we will also come to realize the prospects and  actual advantages of the integration of the newly independent  states, and find ways to achieve closer rapprochement.  Otherwise, we will not survive. We will collapse. That is why  I clearly state that as long as I am the head of the Belarusian  Government, the latter will not change the course of integration  with Russia, Ukraine, and other independent states. Yes, we  support the economic union and the single ruble zone. The  creation of supranational structures similar to the European  Parliament may become a natural continuation of this process.  At the same time, dear colleagues, I am not speaking about  surrendering our Republic's sovereignty and independence.  Simplicity and primitivism of such views on state construction,  as represented by People's Deputy Lukashenka, are alien to me.  The wheel of history can only roll forward and cannot be  reversed. I will never, nor under any circumstances agree to  surrender sovereignty and give up the state independence of  Belarus. Never.    I am sure, however, that the union will be revived in a new  form and Belarus will enter it as an independent, sovereign  state. Speaking of preserving our sovereignty -- for there is  much criticism on this issue -- I want to point out that it is  easy and simple to declare sovereignty. State sovereignty,  however, must be protected. Without protection there can be no  sovereignty. I am more than positive that if today we are left  without Russia, no matter who is at the helm, we will be thrown  10 to 15 years back into the past, or even face economic  collapse. Believe me, we calculated these things both on  computers and by other means -- various options. Go to Europe?  Who is admitted into Europe? Great Russia is not admitted into  Europe! There are just promises and nothing but promises. All  markets were divided long ago. Both oil and gas used in Europe  come from Russia, and not from any other state. Shall we go to  the West to buy Russian oil from middlemen at a higher price?  No! We would rather look to the East. All products and raw  materials will be supplied to Belarus duty-free. This will lower  prices by 35 to 40 percent, lower productions costs, and retail  prices, which swelled solely due to customs duties and not due  to our inability to work. [passage omitted]    Russia's economy is sick, but it is not dead and buried.  Many times in its history Russia has surprised the world with  the power of its spirit, with its might, and always risen up  from the ashes. This time, these processes are also beginning in  Russia. We are facing difficulties, but let us not dash aside;  history, future generations, our conscience, and dignity would  never forgive us this. [passage omitted]    The Constitution adopted in March by our legislature  preserved the vertical system of soviets. History has proven  that this system corresponds to the national and political  traditions of our people better than other variants. The  history of the last two years has taught us what may come of  neglecting those traditions. Workers and farmers have  practically been pushed out of the soviets. Their voices cannot  be heard there. They were replaced by photographers,  archaeologists [reference to Popular Front Chairman Zyanon  Paznyak], and Leopold cats with doctorate degrees [reference to  former Supreme Soviet Chairman Shushkevich, who, like the  cartoon character, often appealed for accord]. Whose interests  these people represent, I do not have to explain to you.  [passage omitted]    Why do Paznyak and Shushkevich so furiously attack our union  with Russia, accusing me of everything short of national  treason? Despite their mediocre organizing skills and total lack  of economic and technological experience, they understand all  too well that there will be no place for them on the political  field of the Belarusian-Russian union. However the provincial  [word indistinct] of one of them and the taste for cushy  executive jobs of the other, urge them to engage in adventurist  irrational activities. That is not a big deal. We, the people  who grew up in plants and factories, have strong nerves. We  will withstand both ridiculous political aspirations and  primitive slanders. [passage omitted]     "

The agreements coincided with a decision by the heads of government of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) to establish a joint commission with Cuba to improve trade and other relations with the island, following statements by some Caribbean leaders that it was time the US ended its 30-year trade embargo on Cuba. The Brazilian businessmen ended five days of talks in Havana with agreements in principle on 10 ventures which will be further studied by both parties. The island's struggling nickel industry, troubled by inefficient plants and insufficient fuel, is of particular interest to the Brazilians, who want to buy the product from Cuba. The agreements also cover Brazilian-funded citrus plants in Cuba, production of sugar cane harvesters in Brazil, and the creation of a shipping line to operate between the two countries. The decision of the Caricom heads of government to establish the joint commission with Cuba follows the island's application for the status of an observer to the 13-nation community. Several of Cuba's Caribbean neighbours have been upset by the implementation of legislation six months ago by the US to prevent foreign subsidiaries of US companies from trading with Cuba and penalising shipping companies calling at Cuban ports. Dame Eugenia Charles, the prime minister of Dominica, and traditionally among the more conservative of the region's leaders, has argued in favour of an end to the trade embargo. Privately-owned Dominica Coconut Products has become a leading exporter to Cuba, and is planning the construction of a processing plant in Cuba. Cuba's attempts to develop economic ties with its neighbours have also benefited from the island's admission to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation after three years of trying. There is, however, likely to be US objection to Cuba's growing trade links with Brazil and those it is developing with its neighbours in the Caribbean archipelago. The island gained entry to the regional tourism body over the objections of two members, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands, both US possessions. Caricom countries have been warned against closer ties with Cuba by Ms Sally Cowal, US ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.     DMZ  Dominica, Caribbean.

0,FT942-863 ,"FT942-863 _AN-EF0DGAE7FT 940627   FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (2): From revolution to evolution - The economy is already restructuring      By LEYLA BOULTON   Two-and-a-half years after President Boris Yeltsin launched radical market reforms, the Russian economy may finally be settling from revolution to evolution. 'The most important role of reformers now is to prevent silly things from happening,' explains Mr Sergei Vasiliev, deputy economics minister and one of the few radical reformers still in government. Six months after the election of a parliament dominated by ultra-nationalists and Communists, and the departure of senior reformers such as deputy prime ministers Mr Boris Fyodorov and Mr Yegor Gaidar, this may sound a bleak assessment. But Mr Vasiliev believes that in order to continue its tortuous march towards a market economy, Russia 'doesn't even need very active reformist policies at the moment. The necessary measures are of a long-term nature and require day-to-day efforts.' Professor Yevgeny Yasin, chief economic analyst for President Yeltsin, takes this argument one step further, claiming that Russia has already completed 'the main reforms' needed by its economy. 'Now we need painstaking polishing work,' he says, citing for example, the need for a more efficient banking and judicial system, and for a crackdown on organised crime. At the alarmist end of the spectrum, Mr Sergei Glaziev, head of parliament's economic reform committee, warns that an expected 25 per cent drop in industrial production this year will mean the 'liquidation' of entire sectors of Russian industry. But dramatic Russian statistics tell only half the story of an economy that is already restructuring in what an IMF economist described as 'a completely chaotic, unplanned way'. With services exceeding 50 per cent of gross domestic product for the first time in Russian history, industrial output, considered the most sacrosanct economic indicator under Communism, now only accounts for 30-35 per cent of GDP. A booming private economy in services and trade is under-reported and virtually untaxed. As a result, up to 40 per cent of the economy may not be taxed at all, and GDP may be undercounted by as much as 15 per cent. In the pursuit of attempts to drive down inflation and set the foundations for economic growth, 1994 has marked the onslaught of the tightest monetary and credit policy since Russia's botched attempt at Polish-style shock therapy in January 1992. The paradox is that the squeeze is being operated by Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister who six months ago floated the idea of fighting inflation by 'non-monetary means', and by Mr Victor Gerashchenko, once dubbed the 'worst central banker in the world'. The belated reformism has also been accompanied by some clumsy attempts to return to greater state control over the economy in order to 'restore order' to it. For example, one of Mr Yeltsin's least enforceable decrees issued this month, designed to crack down on tax evasion, require companies to report any banking transactions greater than Dollars 10,000 to the tax authorities. But reformers who feared the worst can pride themselves on the fact that reforms have not been rolled back - not least because a middle-of-the-road government which proposed to change tack turned out to be ideologically bankrupt. Mainly because the departure of the radicals left Mr Chernomyrdin and Mr Gerashchenko carrying full responsibility for any resurgence in inflation, it has remained under 10 per cent a month since February, its lowest level since August 1992. An end to subsidised credits to all enterprises except for agriculture, coalmining, and the biggest factories means that companies face a real prospect of closure unless they restructure and as long as the government maintains its tight policies. Related attempts are being made to force companies to repay the Rbs22,000bn in debts they have accumulated with each other in an attempt to cushion themselves against the shock of government policies. 'How can you have a market economy where people don't pay their debts? We have to teach people to give back money they owe,' says Prof. Yasin. At the same time, a mass privatisation programme, putting 70 per cent of industry into private hands by July 1, has been allowed to draw to a successful conclusion. Foreign trade liberalisation has continued, with the lifting of quotas from next month on most exports including the oil and gas which are Russia's main source of hard currency. If carried through, these will effectively remove the last controls on domestic energy prices, as well as abolish an important source of corruption. President Yeltsin, who returned to the economic stage with a host of decrees this month, also ordered the scrapping of exemptions from export and import duties which have cost the country dear. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, deputy finance minister, estimates that these and other tax breaks may represent as much as 7-10 per cent of GDP. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister responsible for the economy, says the authorities' decision to stick to financial orthodoxy reflects a 'realisation that there are no extravagant means for stimulating economic growth'. Mr Dmitry Tulin, deputy governor of the central bank, claims the new stance is due to a 'general change in the mentality of monetary authorities. . . who, by their own experience, not through textbooks, realised there is a very simple correlation between money supply growth and the growth of prices.' Mr Chernomyrdin can also cite as his personal achievement the relative political stability which has followed the election of the new parliament and the adoption of a new constitution setting out a clear division of powers. Confounding predictions of further conflict between the executive and the legislative authorities, he recently cajoled powerful conservative forces in the new State Duma into accepting an anti-inflationary budget for 1994. Particularly revealing of the political elite's new understanding of economic realities was a refusal by the energy and agricultural lobbies  - strongly represented in the Duma - to support Rbs15,000bn in additional spending demanded by the military. This would not only have wrecked a budget already under threat from falling tax revenues at a time when the government says it has collected only 36 per cent of tax receipts due in the first quarter of this year. It would have meant undermining their own energy and farming subsidies through a sharp increase in inflation because Russia finances its budget deficit, which will be at least 10 per cent of GDP this year, mainly by printing money. Lying not far beneath the surface of reformers' relief over the avoidance of 'silly' decisions, is concern that more is not being done by the government to push through structural reforms. Mr Alexashenko, the reformist deputy finance minister responsible for the budget, says 'the most dangerous problem is that we have no strategic thinking in the government'. 'To the extent that the government is not meeting all the needs of declining industry, there is shock therapy going on but it is a passive policy,' agrees an IMF economist. 'However, there are many sectors which require a pro-active policy and in which the government has to play an organising role.' An industrial policy, providing selective government support for sectors and companies most likely to achieve growth, is described by the government as urgently-needed but has yet to materialise. This year, for example, Russia is to spend Rbs10,000bn on coal subsidies, representing almost a tenth of budget revenues projected at Rbs124,000bn. But none of this money will be used for the longer-term restructuring which is the only way to secure the Russian coal industry's future and stop a debilitating drain on the country's finances. 'There has been a chance for two years to close down at least one mine,' says Prof Yasin. 'Maybe there is not enough political will now; maybe different people are needed in office.' The government is also failing to build up an adequate social safety net to cope with future unemployment and prevent poverty. Earlier this month, President Yeltsin forecast that the fight against inflation would lead to 'regional' unemployment in specific parts of the country, such as Ivanovo province where textile plants have been on the verge of closure for months. Mr Vasiliev argues that even if bankruptcies become more prevalent in Russia, the present financial policies 'mean that enterprises will be dying very slowly in Russia, which is not a bad thing. We can always consider the possibility of a social outburst but I don't think there will be something sudden in this sphere.' But nobody knows exactly what the effects of these financial policies will be on overall employment, not least because of uncertainty over whether the government will keep to them. Unemployment, measured in terms of job-seekers, is still remarkably low at 1.8 per cent. But it is already far greater if one counts the number of people who are being kept on by enterprises but are not being paid. The main question over the next six months is whether the government will adhere to its financial policies when enterprises start closing down. Although the central bank has yet to phase out so-called 'directed credits' to the economy, they carry real interest rates for the first time. Although subsidies are still being found for the biggest enterprises - 'those with good connections to the president and prime minister' according to Mr Alexashenko - most companies now face hard budget constraints. The central bank says it is following to the letter monetary growth targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund. A memorandum of understanding between the Fund and Russia - setting a monthly inflation target of 7 per cent by the end of the year - may be unambitious. But because the government is so much stronger than its predecessors, it may also be the first IMF agreement to be carried out to the letter. 'We haven't set very ambitious goals,' says Mr Tulin. 'But we are realists. The present state of affairs in the economy does not allow us to be more restrictive.' Displaying continuing central bank concern about areas which should be the responsibility of the government, he argues that more ambitious targets for inflation would trigger 'very high unemployment'. But one veiled signal that the government may already be unable to stick to the 1994 budget and monetary growth ceilings came when the central bank earlier this month lowered its official lending rate from 200 per cent to only 185 per cent. This was well above a 140-150 per cent average interest rate calculated by the International Monetary Fund as the benchmark which the central bank agreed to shadow in the memorandum of understanding. Explaining the caution, Mr Tulin says that 'the monetary factors of inflation are under the control of the central bank except for one: the size of the budget deficit.' He says the restrictive policies must also be accompanied by an industrial policy. However, because of the government's likely failure to implement an industrial policy to minimise the damage to Russian industry, foreign investment appears to be Russia's best hope for restarting growth in its manufacturing sector. Mr Chernomyrdin is due to meet international business leaders today to discuss obstacles facing foreign investors in Russia. Prof. Yasin says the government must take the lead in insuring foreign and domestic investors in order to get growth going. When Mr Chernomyrdin travels to Naples to attend the G7 summit with President Yeltsin next month, he will be renewing pleas for foreign investment. He will also be pressing for early negotiations for an IMF standby credit of Dollars 3bn and a long-term rescheduling of Russia's Dollars 80bn of foreign debt. Although the west has been sidelined in its importance to domestic reforms since the radicals tried and failed to carry out shock therapy with western support, the good will of the western financial community remains crucial to Russia's balance of payments. The IMF has calculated that Russia, which has overestimated its trade surplus for this year, faces an external financing gap of Dollars 25bn in 1994, compared to Dollars 15bn last year. Because of the way in which the foreign debt was contracted, with bunched-up maturities, an inordinately heavy burden of debt payments - Dollars 14.5bn of principal and Dollars 6bn in interest - falls due this year. Part of that burden has already been alleviated by an agreement this month rescheduling Dollars 7bn in debt owed to the Paris Club of creditor governments in 1994. So far, however, Russia has been unable to come to any arrangements over the Dollars 26bn it owes commercial banks because of its refusal to accept that banks should be able to seize state-owned assets if it defaults on payments. Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister, hopes nonetheless that Russia will be able to reschedule 'all our debts on a long-term basis' this autumn. For all the present government's shortcomings, Prof. Yasin may be right in arguing that political realities mean there is no realistic alternative to the present team in Moscow. He says that because Russia is not a dictatorship, but a democracy, albeit an imperfect one, 'people find reforms difficult to put up with. They expressed themselves in the December 12 elections.' But here lies the main weakness of a government which has been better able than its radical predecessors to promote political stability in the short term. The danger, ahead of elections scheduled for 1996, is that it lacks the vision and expertise to promote the wider-ranging reforms required for longer-term stability.

Cuba  terms as satisfactory the fact that the Cairo Declaration issues  an appeal to end the U.S. economic blockade against the island,  guarantees the Movement's continuity, and demands the  establishment of equitable relations between developed and  underdeveloped nations to achieve justice and equality.    The 109 countries represented at the ministerial conference  urged the U.S. Government to abstain from carrying out actions  against Cuba if these contradict the good-neighbor policy. They  also requested the return of Guantanamo Naval Base and the  effective and immediate implementation of the UN resolutions on  the blockade. It may be recalled that the UN General Assembly  issued statements in 1992 and 1993 advocating suspension of the  economic blockade against Cuba, but the United States has yet to  comply with the letter and spirit of the appeal.    During his so-called message to Cubans on 20 May, President  William Clinton not only manipulated Cuban history with evil  intentions but also reasserted that he will maintain the  economic boycott against the island. The Cairo Declaration  signed at the NAM's 11th ministerial conference also said the  adjustment programs and the foreign debt should not affect human  development programs, a concept that coincides with Cuba's  views. Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina had emphasized before  the plenary session that the NAM's number one priority is to  sponsor Third World nations' economic and social development.  Robaina said in Cairo that the best guarantee for a permanent  and durable peace is to end hunger. He said: If we do nothing,  we will be condemned to disappear, meaning two-thirds of mankind  would disappear.    The conference in Egypt also discussed a reorganization of  the United Nations so that it fulfills the wishes and goals of  the poorest countries, which represents one of the basic points  in Cuba's foreign policy. The decision adopted by those  gathered in Cairo to grant the Colombian city of Cartagena de  Indias the right to host the 11th summit of NAM leaders and  heads of state also represents encouraging news, given the need  to review specific problems in the region. Most of those  problems are similar to the ones which prevail in Cuba, except  the old Cuban-U.S. dispute.    The NAM's ministerial conference, which just ended, proved  Cuba's active role in the Movement and the endorsement that its  proposals, views, and demands for support receive in that forum.     "

Malaysia's booming economy and rapid growth are  factors that attract bilateral trade to grow at a steady rate  with several countries: north, south, east, and west.    The latest big deal to be struck was a $600 million contract  signed between Malaysia and Russia this week in Kuala Lumpur for  18 MiG-29 Fulcrum air superiority fighter jets. Of this, $450  million is to be paid in cash and the remainder will be supplied  of Malaysian products; namely, palm oil to be delivered to  Russia over the next five years.    Apart from that, Russia has also agreed to supply at no cost  two MiG-29's to Malaysia's military and commercial aircraft  servicing and overhaul center, the Aerod Company. This will  help the latter's engineers to acquire the skills required in  maintaining the frontline Russian fighter aircraft.    The deal took two years to become reality. The delay was  because of the haggling over the price and the terms of the  contract [words indistinct]. However, the vote for the contract  to come [words indistinct].    The deal marks the beginning of a new era in bilateral  relations which was thought inconceivable a few years ago.  Russia is now showing a deep interest and forging closer  bilateral ties and economic cooperation with Malaysia. It wants  to extend its expertise in the industrial, infrastructural,  telecommunications, and energy sectors. Russia also fully  supports Malaysia's need for training, research and development,  and for technology transfer. Malaysia will study the possible  areas of cooperation it wishes to venture into with the Russians.    The purchase of the Russian MiG's will no doubt prove to be  immensely beneficial to Malaysia. It must be understood that  Malaysia does not confine itself to any particular country when  awarding contracts and it is driven by the benefits that the  country can derive through such efforts.    A [word indistinct] factor in the Russian contract is the  proposed establishment of a regional Technical Service Center,  TSC, for the MiG's as part of the deal which can assist the  country's aerospace industry. The center, a joint venture  between the Malaysian Government and three Russian bodies, will  service the MiG-29 aircraft operated not only by the Royal  Malaysian Air Force but also the other air forces in the region.  The TSC is an example of how bilateral economic and trade  relations between Malaysia and Russia can be strengthened  further.    There is vast potential for the two countries to jointly  explore new areas of trade. [Word indistinct] the MiG deals are  concerned, it marks the entry of Russian fighter aircraft into  the Southeast Asia market. And Malaysia welcomes the transfer  of knowhow by the Russian defense industries in Malaysia's  avionics and aircraft component manufacturing.    The visit of the Russian team to Malaysia to sign the  contract will pave the way for the [words indistinct] between  the two countries in the future.     "

Rather, all the contrary.

It is estimated that there are  approximately 3 million kerosene stoves in [word indistinct]. In  1993 the consumption plan was for 464,000 tons of kerosene which  amounts to $90 million on the world market, where this fuel is  no longer sold.    Cuba cannot produce this fuel, so how do we solve this  dilemma? The Ministry of the Revolutionary Armed Forces's center  for fuel development and research determined that a  kerosene-diesel mixture was an answer for domestic kitchens.  This became one of the outstanding projects of the Eighth Forum  of Science and Technology.    After several trials, researchers concluded that the most  feasible solution was (Jet A-1 turbo) fuel, a refined kerosene  used in aviation. The average cost of (Jet A-1) fuel is $205 per  ton, which exceeds that of standard kerosene. To overcome this  problem the refined kerosene is mixed with diesel fuel, which is  much cheaper. The researchers took steps so that the mixture  would not damage the stoves [words indistinct] and would have  acceptable thermal safety and efficiency. They decided on a  ratio of 30 percent diesel and 70 percent of kerosene, which  will allow an annual savings of $3 million, equivalent to 20,000  tons more fuel for domestic use -- the amount that the  population of Havana City consumes in three months.    The first tests of this research were carried out in 50  homes  with a 90-percent acceptance rate. According to Lieutenant  Colonel Eduardo Perez Pena, more tests are taking place in a  municipality of Havana City. The fuel should be available  throughout the country by May.     "

(F.M. Burlatskiy, A.A. Galkin. ""The Modern  Leviathan."" Moscow: MYSL, 1985, p. 317). An accurate assessment  of the correlation of forces, the ability to determine a precise  position under adverse conditions, the ability to select proper  allies and partners--may compensate to a certain degree for  diminished economic potential and retarded dynamics of  development. This is especially urgent for the Russia of today,  which for certain reasons is undergoing one of the most critical  periods of its history. In order to avoid failure and subjective  defeats under such conditions, the foreign policy of the state  must be equal to the situation being endured. This can be done,  in our view, only if policy is based on fully realistic and  rational foundations which conform first and foremost to the  interests of Russia itself, and not on mythical or abstract  concepts oriented on theoretical considerations removed from  real life.    We are talking about bringing the foreign policy of the  Russian Federation into conformance with the principles  comprising the basis of foreign policy activity of the developed  democracies that constitute reference points for Russia. In  effecting the transition to a market economy, we must not forget  that ""capitalism brought along with it the ethics of pragmatism,  the ethics of common sense. A lofty idealism resided in its  slogans of freedom, equality, and brotherhood, but it was an  idealism based on a sensible, utilitarian accounting of  realities."" (A.N. Yakovlev. ""Prelude. Cataclysm. Epilogue.""  Moscow: NOVOSTI, 1992, p. 276). It is pragmatism and common  sense, in our view, that would advisably be put at the  foundation of the foreign policy strategy of the Russian state  under today's conditions. From this point of view the question  of selection of priority partners may be examined--with respect  to both the ""near"" and ""far"" abroad.    Relations with its great neighbor of the Far  East--China--will be of primary and vital significance to the  Russian Federation. These affect not just the interests of  Russia in Asia, but the entirety of Russia's international  policy. As it develops in dynamic fashion, China is today  playing an ever more prominent role in the Asia-Pacific region.  ""No single Asian power in the Asia-Pacific region has at its  disposal the universal and powerful influence that belongs to  the People's Republic of China."" (S.V. Solodovnik. ""Stability in  Asia--Russia's Priority."" MEZHDUNARODNAYA ZHIZN, 1992, No. 2, p.  88). Expert analyses predict that in the future, China will be  quite capable of assuming a leading position in world politics  (a number of analysts even predict that the People's Republic of  China will turn into a superpower in the 21st century). An  expansion of mutually advantageous cooperation with the PRC will  conform to Russia's interests in developing its economic  infrastructure in the Maritime Kray region, Siberia, Sakhalin,  and Kamchatka. In the long term, should events develop  favorably, it is felt that the Chinese ""springboard"" could  facilitate to a certain degree the emergence of Russian capital  in the markets of Southeast Asia, where Chinese business ""is a  permanent element of the socioeconomic structure of countries of  the region."" (S. Goncharenko. ""Partners or Competitors--How  Regional Chinese Capital Operates in the Countries of Southeast  Asia."" VOPROSY EKONOMIKI, 1992, No. 3, p. 113).    The experience of the PRC's transition to a market economy  is  interesting in many respects and may prove quite useful to the  Russian Federation (especially since when one takes a sober look  at things, it is impossible not to see that during a  historically short period of time the PRC has been able to  approach the real market far more closely than the Russian  Federation, where a greater role has been devoted to talk).    In laying the foundation of Russian-Chinese relations today,  we are obliged to proceed from the long-term perspective, first  and foremost from a clear realization of the immutable fact that  China and Russia are fated to be neighbors forever, regardless  of whether one is pleased at this or not.    Of great significance to the security of Russia's interests  in the South and Central Asian regions is the preservation of  continuity in the development of relations with India.  Settlement of the problem of India's payment to Russia of its  long-term state credit debt opens up broad opportunities for the  development of mutually beneficial cooperation in the sphere of  trade, shipping, space research, modern technology exchange, and  exchanges in the military-technical sphere. India's  implementation of a large-scale program of economic reforms,  during which it ""opens up new spheres for the application of  capital"" (FINANSOVYYE IZVESTIYA, 18-24 February 1993) will  create favorable conditions for Russian investors,  joint-stockholders, and private entrepreneurial structures.  Since time immemorial the peoples of India and Russia have come  to share deep-rooted traditions of humanitarian and cultural  cooperation. In addition, expansion of the Russia-India  political partnership contributes towards the consolidation of  stability in Hindustan and throughout Central Asia as well. This  is of major significance to Russia.    Prospects for developing and intensifying ties with Russia's  Eurasian ""twin""--Turkey--appear to be promising and advantageous  for Russia. Quite a number of historic parallels can be seen in  the development of the two countries. Over the course of  centuries, Turkey, like Russia, has played the part of a unique  ""bridge"" between East and West, not belonging to one or the  other. Like its northern neighbor, Turkey has had to endure the  agonizing process of surmounting the empire syndrome and  effecting transition to a modern (secular) model of state  structure. Today Turkey, just like Russia, is resolving complex  problems of economic modernization. The history of Russo-Turkish  relations records a great many pages of drama and even tragedy.  At the same time, the past also contains a positive experience  of cooperation between the Russian Federation and Republic of  Turkey of the days of Kemal Ataturk. The similarity of  historical experience and economic systems of the two countries  presupposes their compatibility and complementary nature. This  experience is also valuable because today in Russia and other  CIS states, ""with the conduct of liberalization of the economy,  a number of trends are being observed that operated in Turkey  during the 1980's. They deal with the fate of state enterprises,  pace and forms of privatization, and development of the  financial market."" (S. Avdashev. ""Turkey--A National Model of  Liberalization of the Economy."" 1992, No. 11, p. 101). Nor would  it be in Russia's interests to ignore the strong influence  Turkey has in the Caucasus, the Balkans, Central Asia, and the  Black Sea region.    Capability for a constructive and highly effective  relationship is seen in the prospects for partnership between a  renewed Russia and Israel, where a tremendous Russian-speaking  community has formed that exerts significant influence on the  political, economic, and cultural life of the state. ""One-fourth  are our former people""--as the words of the famous poet express  it. This is not only a natural and vital element linking the two  countries, but a powerful factor of rapprochement between Russia  and Israel as well. Repatriates from Russia have significant  capacities at their disposal for rendering intermediary services  in trade between the West and Russia, in investing capital in  the Russian Federation economy on a long-term basis, and in  implementing joint projects in both countries. Prospects appear  good for cooperation in the development of tourism, trade in  subtropical crops, processing and sale of diamonds, and in the  sphere of scientific research. The development of relations  between Russia and Israel would provide a weighty contribution  to stabilization of the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean,  facilitating settlement of one of the most deep-rooted and  complex problems of modern times--the problem of the Near East.  It is important to emphasize in this regard that the deepening  of Russian-Israeli relations cannot and must not be effected at  the expense or to the detriment of Russia's traditional ties  with the Arab world (in particular, with Egypt, Palestine,  Syria, and Kuwait). On the whole, orientation on the Near East  should, in our view, constitute one of the priority directions  in foreign policy strategy of the Russian Federation in Asia.    In the ""near"" abroad, of exceptionally great long-term  relevance to the national security and interests of our state is  Kazakhstan, covering the ""soft underbelly"" of Russia and linking  it with the countries of Central Asia at the same time. The  geographic position of Kazakhstan, its virgin lands, natural and  raw-material resources, developed industrial infrastructure, and  the largest Russian-speaking diaspora outside the borders of the  Russian Federation make it objectively urgently necessary to  effect the very closest coordination and integration (a  ""strategic alliance,"" if you will) in all spheres of activity  between Russia and Kazakhstan.    The traditional gravitation of Armenia towards Russia is to  a  great extent the result of the particular features of its  historical development and geopolitical situation. Occupying a  central position in the Transcaucasus and essentially  constituting the ""key"" to all of Asia Minor, Armenia is located  at a unique juncture of two worlds--the Christian and Islamic  worlds. Such a position has its obvious pluses as well as  minuses. Armenia's advantageous geographic position, its solid  intellectual potential, and the presence of a large and  diversified diaspora in many countries of the world, including  in Russia itself, make prospects for the development of stable  and all-encompassing cooperation between Russia and Armenia  quite promising.    Rich mineral and energy resources, developed  livestock-breeding, climatological and balneological factors,  and the presence of suitable economic ""recesses,"" have created  favorable preconditions for cooperation between Russia and  Kyrgyzstan. Not of minor significance to the Russian Federation  is the presence in Kyrgyzstan of a large Russian-speaking  community that plays an important role in the socioeconomic and  scientific life of the state.    The high-priority nature of relations between Russia and  Uzbekistan has been determined by an aggregate of factors in the  geostrategic, economic, and cultural spheres, as well as by  historical tradition. The heart of the ""mid-territory"" of the  Central Asian region, Uzbekistan ""is not only a buffer zone, the  boundary between the former USSR and the Islamic countries, but  is the place where new ideas and the reality of a new world  structure intersect."" (M. Timonina. ""They Are Aided By the Black  Rock, We--By the Golden Crucifix"" SOTSIUM, 1992, No. 6, p. 41).  The interdependence of the economies of the two states, trade  ties that have become a permanent fixture, and civilized and  humanitarian traditions going back centuries upon centuries  constitute a solid foundation for profitable cooperation on a  broad scale.    In this manner, with all the dissimilarity, diversity, and  nonuniformity with respect to the above-enumerated countries,  there exist certain substantive aspects and features that are  intrinsic to a greater or lesser degree to practically all of  them. It is these most typical features which, in our view,  could be laid within the foundation of a system of criteria for  selecting priority partners in both the ""near"" and ""far"" abroad.  Their universal nature makes it possible, in our view, to  utilize this system beyond the boundaries of the Asian continent  as well.    Thus, in selecting priority partners for the Russian  Federation abroad, the main focus of attention must be  concentrated on the following fundamental parameters:    --mutual compatibility of economies, approximate  comparability of economic development;    --""key"" nature of the geopolitical position of partners;    --internal stability;    --the secular principle in organization of state power.    We know that the main foreign policy task of any state is to  ensure its internal development. As it applies to Russia's  present conditions, this means primarily the preservation of the  country's economic potential and the safeguarding of political  stability, and not simply physical survival within the existing  state borders. Proceeding from this, the economy must be set as  the cornerstone, while the foreign policy itself of the Russian  Federation is subordinated to economic interests. Such  pragmatism in policy does not constitute anything  extraordinary--quite a number of countries in the world espouse  such an approach to their benefit. Nor does this run contrary to  the interests of the world community. Cooperation between the  Russian Federation and the above-mentioned partners will enable  it to actively participate in collective efforts to resolve  regional conflicts in the Near East, the Transcaucasus, and  Central Asia, thus contributing significantly to the  consolidation of international stability.    Rivalry in the international arena remains with us and will  continue in the post-confrontational world. Under these  conditions, only sober calculations, realism, and pragmatism can  guarantee the success of foreign policy efforts. Russian  philosopher Nikolay Berdyayev heaped severe criticism upon  abstract doctrinaires in politics who proclaimed general  principles without regard to relevant vital tasks and the given  moment in history. ""The oversimplified abnegation of problems  and the specifics of the history in which any politics is formed  is an indicator of mediocrity or superficiality in this area,""  he emphasized, ""or a lack of interest in this sphere of  existence, an absence of calling to it."" (A.N. Berdyayev. ""The  Fate of Russia."" Moscow: 1990, p. 215). These words are  exceedingly relevant today. It is entirely apparent that even  today the adjective ""free"" as it pertains to Russia ""is still  very difficult for our top brass to utter..."" (Yu. Boldyrev.  ""The Russian Era."" IZVESTIYA, 6 February 1993). It is therefore  entirely logical to assume that without freedom of thought,  freedom to choose our own path of development, freedom to  determine our own Russian interests and priorities, the danger  of dogmatism in the foreign policy sphere will continue to exist.

Santamaria granted an interview to PRENSA LATINA, during  which he noted that important events had taken place in the past  few hours regarding relations between the two Latin American  countries.    Camilo Penaloza, Colombian deputy economic development  minister, ended a visit to Cuba yesterday. He was leading a  delegation of businessmen interested in investing in the island.  The Colombian Navy training vessel Arc Gloria docked in Havana  Port, bringing a message of friendship to the Cuban people.    Moreover, the civil aeronautics directors of Colombia and  Cuba signed an agreement that will soon lead to the  establishment of regular flights by their airlines to link the  capitals and other cities of both countries.    As for the visit paid by the businessmen, Santamaria  explained it represents a specific step forward in the area of  possible joint business ventures by means of direct meetings  with the people who are able to invest in Cuba.    He also said the business delegation identified specific  points of cooperation and a new meeting was scheduled with  high-ranking Colombian and Cuban officials with the goal of  signing specific agreements. The meeting will soon be held in  Santa Fe de Bogota as bilateral talks move into their next round.    The visitors, he said, held meetings in which they were  informed of the Cuban economic outlook and the country's future,  as well as being informed of new types of foreign investments  approved by the Cuban state.    The diplomat said there is going to be continuity in these  types of visits, which are aimed at providing Colombian  companies with direct knowledge of existing opportunities in  Cuba for the establishment of enterprises that benefit both  sides.    Santamaria talked with great enthusiasm about the  aeronautics  agreement that has just been signed. He described the agreement  as the primary goal of the diplomatic mission in view of its  economic importance.    The agreement was based on the existence of actual market  needs because clear possibilities already exist for having  several weekly flights between the capitals and cities of Cuba  and Colombia, as is shown by the increase in the number of  tourist flights during the current year, he said.    The ambassador said the increase in the number of flights  between the two countries, not only for tourists but also for  businessmen and government officials, contributes to the  dynamics of bilateral relations.    It is an important agreement that was signed thanks to the  constructive position of Cuba, which can expect from us all the  loyalty one can expect from a brother country, he said.    In addition, Santamaria talked about the status of the  negotiations for expanding the partial agreement, which will  also allow, in the area of trade, a significant increase in  bilateral relations.    To this effect, the Colombian Government is currently  conducting consultations with the private sector regarding  tariffs that will affect more than 800 products included in the  expansion, which were the object of previous agreements in the  last meeting held in Havana.    We hope that in June or July of this year, the Colombian and  Cuban foreign trade ministers will sign the corresponding  document based on the work already done and the technical  meetings that have already been held, the ambassador said.

According to (Andres Rosenthal), Mexican deputy  secretary of foreign relations, yesterday's meeting, held by a  subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which was  summoned by Robert Torricelli, is anti-Mexican and seeks to  interfere with the domestic affairs of his country. (Rosenthal)  said that according to the Mexican people, it is unacceptable  for the U.S. to try to judge or tarnish the reputation of his  country because of some people's resentment that Mexico enjoys  normal diplomatic relations with the Cuban Government.  Furthermore, (Rosenthal) added, Torricelli is one of those who  is offended at having lost the battle against the free trade  agreement, which was recently established among Mexico, the  United States, and Canada.

This special ""Straight Talk"" program will center its debate on  these issues, the experience of the ANPP in 1993, and its goals  for 1994 with the participation of Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,  member of the Politburo and president of the ANPP.    We will begin with Luis Sexto. Luis, how do you think we  should begin this analysis?    [Sexto] Perhaps the listeners are waiting for me to ask Dr.  Ricardo Alarcon the first question on what today is the center  or the focus of the national debate: the measures that are being  studied and drafted to achieve a financial balance in our  country. Violating a journalistic rule, I want to leave the most  interesting topic for last. On this occasion, I will take that  liberty. I want to ask Dr. Ricardo Alarcon about democracy.  History shows that generally times of crisis are not appropriate  for the exercise of democracy. Nevertheless, in our country,  despite our problems, there is a will and a commitment to  perfect democracy. As a matter of fact, in the last two years  our country has made a qualitative leap. I ask you: Is this a  fact that has ended or is it a process, and if this is a process  as I believe it is, what is you point of view and what will the  future bring?    [Alarcon] Well, Luis, I believe you are absolutely right.  For  some time now, we have been advancing in perfecting the  country's governmental system, or the system of the People's  Government which consists in just that: the perfecting and  strengthening of our democracy. Traditionally, the classic trend  in the world is that when there is a difficult situation, a  crisis, or a special situation, democracy is restricted as a  natural thing. All countries in their constitutions have  chapters on states of emergency. It even includes the  suppression of certain rights, etc. Some even include the right  to hold elections and the parliamentary function. The  parliaments of this world, many of them, went into recess when  the country had some difficulties, which, if we compare them  with the problems of Cuba, were truly minor problems.    We are doing the exact opposite. In this and in many other  things we could say that we follow a nontraditional path.  However, I believe it does correspond with our characteristics  and needs. In other words, despite the greater difficulties and  challenges of the country, we must continue advancing in the  people's participation in the government system. To continue  perfecting this system means to rely more on the people, summon  the people, use their effective, real and systematic  participation on what is...[30 second break in reception]  ...what their government should be.    This seems like a paradox. Nevertheless, because of its  principles, a socialist government or society by definition is  the fullness of democracy: a true democracy, a democracy of the  people according to the Greek language, where the word came  from. This implies the people truly participate in the  government. This only happens in socialism, in a society based  on equality, fairness, and human solidarity which truly  advocates the people's participation in the government as equals  and collectively. This is the aspect of principles.    However, there is also a strategic aspect. How can we  successfully confront the enormous challenges Cuba faces if we  do not do so with the conscientious, true, voluntary, and  energetic participation of the entire people. This is something  we see in our daily lives: the efforts, the sacrifices of our  people, the burden they must shoulder. Only by relying on the  people, in my opinion, will we be able to become successful in  confronting today's difficulties. All this relates to the issue  you left for the end. We try to make the people participate, to  make them feel more and more they are participants -- as the  subject of the society rather than a passive object -- in issues  such as the financial situation and many others. This is the  essence of democracy. This can only be attained through  socialism.    [Santana] I believe that the subject of perfecting of  democracy has been thoroughly covered. We can move on to another  subject. Renato?    [Recio] Evidently, we need to now touch on the cardinal  issue  on the streets. I believe that at the last session of the ANPP  something unusual happened when contrary to expectations,  particularly those abroad regarding the impending approval of an  entire package of measures, the ANPP decided to simply discuss,  report, increase awareness, and enlighten public opinion rather  than make decisions. Evidently, this is not usual. Something  else that is unusual in other societies is happening now, a  so-called parliament of the workers has been summoned, and those  issues which the ANPP discussed regarding the financial  reorganization are becoming issues of public discussion, of  discussion by the masses, of discussion by millions.    I will like Alarcon to give us his opinion and comments on  this process. What does it mean for him? What can be expected  from it?    [Alarcon] This is a very important issue because it relates  to the expectation you mentioned that existed before the ANPP  meeting. There was much talk of measures, packages of measures,  etc.    We have to clarify several things. We have been implementing  measures such as the creation of the Basic Cooperative  Production Units [UBPC], a concrete measure which is already  helping to heal the national finances in two sectors where a  good part of state subsidies are concentrated: sugarcane and  nonsugarcane agriculture. Above all, this should result in an  increase in production in both sectors which is the essence, the  ultimate goal to heal the finances and improve the economy,  rescue the value of the peso, stimulate work, etc. Why? To be  able to produce more goods and services, to produce more and  better to benefit our economy. Certain comrades have the  simpleminded hope that certain measures could be implemented on  the assumption that certain measures can solve the problem, as  if someone were stupid enough to have the answer to make our  lives better in his pocket and not use it. Unfortunately, that  is not the case. There are certain things that can and have been  done, such as the example I just gave about the UBPC.    We cannot forget, particularly you who work in journalism,  that there are foreign ideas, things they try to impose on us  such as the expression ""package of measures"". This is a concept  that any listener immediately associates with many packages of  measures that have been implemented in the world apparently in  order to solve financial problems. I would like to ask if anyone  could name a single Third World country that has solved its  economic problems, been able to mend its finances, and above all  reactivate development and improve the living conditions of its  people's with any of those packages of measures. Every example  points to the contrary: People are rising up in the provinces in  Latin America and even attacking the governor's palace.    Why? Either because a package of measures was not  implemented  or because it was? A package of measures is associated in the  world with capitalism, with neoliberal formulas, with the IMF,  with things that are already classics: a budget deficit? Then  expenses have to be reduced. How do you reduce expenses in the  capitalist world? By cutting social programs, privatizing, and  decreasing the role of the state in society.    We have to study measures to reduce the size of the state,  reduce the bureaucracy, the burden bureaucracy represents to the  state, etcetera. However, this is quite different from  diminishing the responsibility of the state -- in other words,  of society in relation to the people.    We face a great challenge. How to fix the finances, how to  implement our measures, those which we have taken and will take  in the future. However, we cannot use any of the tools out  there. That would be very easy. There would be no need to  discuss or invent anything. The IMF measures are repeated  everywhere. It is not possible to invent different ones, at  least coming from that perspective. However, measures with a  socialist perspective, for socialism, have to be created in a  socialist manner.    There are general measures which as a matter of fact we have  been implementing in the economy, and there have been  discussions with the workers in every factory and service  center, etcetera. We are doing this not only to collect the  comrades' opinions on these problems but also to relate the  solutions to each place's specific condition. It is possible to  improve efficiency by reducing costs, waste, improving  organization, increasing discipline, etcetera, with the concrete  action of the workers in each workplace, rather than with a  parliamentary address or a decision of a general nature.    Therefore, as part of the process of preparing for the  special ANPP meeting, we are now beginning with a process of  discussion by the workers. We hope this discussion is well  structured and organized. In other words, the first step must be  adequate information from the leadership, the basic data on the  specific work center, production costs, resources, etcetera, in  other words, all the objective material elements of that  workplace. It has to be a collective discussion among all  workers to see what can be done there and now, rather than  waiting for a grandiloquent quote legislative unquote decision.  The idea is take steps here and now to help mend the national  finances.    [Recio] Some people are claiming that this might be a  government strategy to free itself of responsibility in the end  when the measures are taken and they affect a sector of the  population which has already debated the measures and approved  them.    [Alarcon] This brings to mind a friend, an Italian  legislator  who visited us in October. We went together to see the  functioning of the people's government. We attended a progress  report meeting in the outskirts of Havana where very complex  problems were discussed. The Italian told me: ""The president of  our parliament has never, never attended a meeting with the  people, even less, of course, in a shanty like this. I, a  leftist deputy, had never done it either. I have seen here in  action what a truly democratic society is.""    The people debated intensely, without rhetoric or  formalisms.  They said what was on their minds about their problems from  deeply revolutionary and patriotic perspectives. He added: ""This  cannot be done in my country because it would end in a great  fracas between the people and their deputy, even more with the  president of the parliament.""    In reality, to discuss the kind of issues with the  people....[changes thought] It is still to be seen the first  case of a country where the famous packages of measures are  implemented and someone has the brilliant idea of discussing it  with the workers.    [Santana] I have never seen the IMF or [World] Bank  suggesting such a thing.    [Alarcon] Even less, asking the worker's opinions before  adopting measures. This also helps to create a mind set. The  people get to express themselves and might become convinced of  one possibility or another which might not be the most  appropriate at a certain moment. First of all, the ANPP -- and  this has been acknowledged in dispatches by several foreign news  agencies which I have read -- discussed information on the Cuban  economy that is usually handled with more discretion, and this  was broadcast from coast to coast to the entire population.  Information such as the size of the deficit, the subsidies,  etcetera, and unpaid accounts was discussed openly.    This is the opposite of the practice of famous parliaments  which perhaps meet for three months with an overabundance of  speeches but where the information is not handled as openly. To  me, this is very important. I said this in the ANPP meeting, and  other comrades also said that other parliaments do not openly  discuss packages of measures, but they do so with the  millionaires; they do so with the great powers of the economy of  those countries. It might be that the unions will not even find  out until they read the papers. It might be that certain  legislators are in the dark about the packages of measures that  are going to be promulgated. However, those who truly control  the economy in those countries are made aware and agreements are  reached with them. In our case, we would have to do it backwards  -- our millionaires are the workers, the people -- also, even in  order to discuss, and this can be done, possible measures which  perhaps are not pleasant or well seen by a sector of the  population. [as heard]    [Santana] Alarcon, I find it interesting that this process  of  consultation involves only the workers. However, there are  sectors of the population such as housewives, retirees, and  students who also have their opinions on probable measures to  mend the economy. What is the ANPP planning to do to include  these opinions?    [Alarcon] We also have to think about the other sectors of  the population. However, there are several basic reasons why  this process began with the labor movement. First of all,  because it relates directly to production and services. This is  the core of the economic problems. Second, because the union  movement in our society has to play its proper role.    The union movement is the vanguard of society. It is the  class that has to exert its hegemony, its leadership. Because of  the concrete experiences of the meetings which I have attended  and the ones I have been told about by other comrades, I know  they are yielding specific results that can begin to have an  effect right now to improve the national financal picture. Of  course, when we speak of workplaces, this also includes  educational centers. We have included the youth, students,  teachers of that sector.    I believe that in a later phase we have to see how to attain  through the People's Council the participation of other sectors  of the population not organized in unions.    [Bel] Deputies who belong to a workplace also are found in  People's Councils and can be of aid in the discussions at that  level.    [Recio] I believe all Cubans must be quite clear on this, we  must reach a consensus on that no measure can -- as you  mentioned earlier -- solve the national problems right away. In  other words, they are not a magic wand or a magician's hat: A  measure is implemented and the problem is solved.    In other words, these are measures we have to necessarily  adopt to solve part of the problems. Certain measures have  already been taken. You mentioned an essential one.    Now, regarding the financial unbalance: There is an opinion  out there. I have had to discuss it. However, I would like you  to speak about it. Some say that if these measures have to be  taken we are already late. They argue that this process of  collective discussion is a delay that unnecessarily protracts  the implementation of measures which will help solve our  problems. I would like you to explain why this is not a waste of  time.    [Alarcon] I believe it is necessary. For example, the budget  deficit: If an organization or enterprise is inefficient, in  other words, it costs more money to the people than what it  contributes, [words indistinct] this is very simple: Close it  down. However, if in the budget of an organization expenses  surpass income they have to reduce expenses to match income.  Under capitalism this is solved quite simply: How many surplus  workers are there? How many enterprises are you going to close  down? Etcetera.    Is it not a measure discussing the situation of the  enterprise, factory, or institution with its workers so that  among them, with the data at hand, with the same openness with  which the information on the national economy was disclosed,  they can discuss and understand what needs to be done in case  there is no other alternative but to take certain measures that  affect them? What measures can they, the workers, the owners of  the society adopt to mend their finances, to reduce costs and  make their work more rational? This is why I say that this  discussion process is an extremely important measure, or a total  of very important measures we hope will be adopted throughout  Cuba.    On the other hand, I believe that it is somewhat  simpleminded  if you were to say that by implementing this measure from the  top, beginning tomorrow, the situation will begin to change. We  are not sitting on our hands, thinking about measures. On the  contrary, they are being adopted. For example, we mentioned the  UBPC, but there is self-employment, and even the famous  decriminalization of foreign currency. These are measures that  also effect the national finances but which by definition did  not require a process of consultation, of increasing the  awareness of the people. As soon as we understood how to  implement them, we did it even before the ANPP met.    There are cooperatives that are costing less than a [state]  farm in certain places, that have attracted workers -- in other  words, there are healthy signs -- and have reduced costs. There  are concrete results you can see. Nobody has refrained from  implementing measures that are clearly defined, measures that  have clear and immediate implications. What is important here is  to elevate the morale of the workers. Fidel pointed out that  work is attained through pride, honor. Well, we have to appeal  to that pride and honor and consolidate them in specific  measures to be taken at each place. This is one of the most  important things that can be done. This would not be based on  that famous package of measures, but would be based on something  we can do here and cannot be done elsewhere: to appeal to the  workers and frankly discussing with them all these problems  specifically, calling them by their right name and not using  general terms.    [Recio] I would like to ask Alarcon about an issue based on  the experiences other countries have had when they mix these two  concepts: democracy and the economy. It is known that in most of  the countries implementing neoliberal formulas of economic  reorganization and readjustment, democracy, the functioning of  democracy is hampered in many cases and there are sad, regretful  events. However, based on Alarcon's words on the previous  program, democracy in Cuba, the development of our democracy  could be a force to possiblyt help the economy recover. I would  like Alarcon to tell us about this issue.    [Alarcon] This has to be developed to its fullest extent. I  have seen in some assemblies....[changes thought] For example,  in terms of the two issues of the greatest importance in this  society: the surplus administrative personnel -- of workers not  directly linked to production, and the problems of lack of  controls which result in lost resources, crime, etcetera. We can  find places, such as I have seen in some of these meetings,  where the workers are of the opinion that there is surplus  administrative personnel. Sometimes this is the result of our  methods, mechanisms still in effect which I believe we have to  eliminate or change. At times, we demand much unnecessary  information or work which implies repetition of work mechanisms  at the base level. This generates bureaucratic positions. In a  factory there might be need of productive work, a space for  those adminsitrative workers. It is not a matter of throwing  anyone on the streets. I am thinking about the specific case of  La Corona factory where we discussed these issues with the  workers on 12 January.    On the other hand, although at times we have an excess of  administrative mechanisms which are there to exert control, it  is evident that control is not one the best functioning things  in our society. There are way too many problems in this area. In  that meeting the workers stated that the union and workers  should and ought to play a much more important, active role. If  the organized workers discuss things collectively and  democratically, and establish specific principles and work  standards, they can replace a bureaucratic mechanism. Not only  that. They can implement a much more effective mechanism in  terms of real control and committed discipline and more definite  order.    Now, I believe that besides all of this, our country has  confronted a difficult situation, a situation of blockade, of  confronting the abrupt changes in our foreign trade relations --  the things we know shaped the special period. Likewise, the  country attempts to resist these setbacks and to develop, while  preserving that which I believe reflects the broadest national  consensus. I do not think anyone here is crazy enough to wish  for a return to private medicine. No one here is crazy enough to  hope for Cuba to have the situation of the richest capitalism  country -- the United States, where today they are debating if  40 million Americans are finally going to have some degree of  paid medical coverage; paid, because not even in their dreams  can American conceive of free medical care. If socialism did not  exist, Could any Cuban conceive of the barestl possibility of  upholding such a vital accomplishment, which is reflected in the  low infant and maternal mortality rate, and a number of things  which are truly dear to most people? Could anyone be  simpleminded enough to imagine this would exist in Cuba if our  socialism did not exist? Evidently, not.    The same can be said of education, elder care, and our  entire  social security system. To preserve all that, to save all this  requires the effort and sacrifice of all. We have to turn this  hope into a daily thing. The struggle for these hopes has to  become a real, daily, permanent thing. This can only be done  with the support of the people. This is not going to be the  result of decisions or conclusions reached by a sharp,  well-intended, etcetera, group of people. This requires the  understanding and support of the entire population of workers of  Cuba. This is why I believe they are inseparable. However, given  our type of democracy and the conditions Cuba faces, it is not  only a matter of principles but a philosophical reason which  should be our political hope: to perfect our political system.  This is the only possible strategy to really maintain the  mobilization and struggle of a people who have resisted  heroically and have amply proven that they will be able to  confront and overcome this entire challenge.    [Cavada] A question in connection with this idea and even  that of the Parliament in the Work Place: At the beginning many  perhaps might have thought that a tobacco worker -- such as you  mentioned from La Corona, or perhaps a metallurgy industry  worker -- could not give his opinions and decide or propose  things for the economy or the future economy of Cuba. However, I  believe that in the practice it has been different. This is  proven by another of our accomplishments in the last 35 years:  the educational level of the people. I also was at the tobacco  factory on 12 January, and it was truly impressive to hear a  tobacco worker -- in charge of the tobacco refrigeration unit --  speak of the law of value, analyzed scientifically what it  entailed to increase production, what products to increase,  which to decrease, and even cited how harmful elements in other  countries collect the excess currency.    This is why I think it is a very healthy and logical  practice, on the part of the CTC and the ANPP, to summon an  extensive debate. What limits or points might it reach? How much  longer might this involvement of the people last after the  special session of the ANPP?    [Alarcon] I believe we must continue it. I believe that  presently it is directly tied to these issues, but it is also  part of the process of perfecting our system of government. I  believe that the CTC has to play a key role. It should be  maintained as a practice, system, and as a method of management,  organization, and control. The effective, real participation of  the workers in the economy is consubstantial with a socialist  democracy. I do not believe that in this or in the case of the  People's Councils we have reached perfection or anything like  it. This is why we speak of perfecting. This is a continuous  process of seeking how to do things better.    You gave a great example, that of the comrade in charge of  the tobacco refrigeration unit. Unfortunately, it would have  been surprising to find such an example in Cuba several  generations ago. However, this is now common everywhere. We have  a people much more highly educated, a cultured people, a people  ready to exert further their rights and social function, their  active role in society.    [Sexto] I want to change the focus from perfecting the  system. These measures being discussed nationally are to solve  immediate problems such as the excess currency, financial  unbalance, etcetera. Are these measures not also part of a  necessary effort to correct our economy? Can we speak of  political correction without speaking of economic correction?    [Alarcon] I believe that -- we have said it several times --  they are deeply interrelated. I believe that, first of all, we  cannot separate the economy from politics. We have a socialist  perspective. The struggle, particularly in a blockaded country,  a country with our difficulties, or even without those  difficulties, to build a socialist society -- a society based on  equality, justice, and fraternity -- also has a material,  economic dimension. This means a need to produce more goods and  to provide a higher quality of life to the people, but above all  to fulfill a group of ideals, ethical aspirations which have to  do with the conscience -- the conscience we effect politically.    I believe that although we are highly involved in the  reorganization of our finances, the economic struggle in  general, and in confronting the special period, these  mechanisms, these methods are not designed for this struggle  alone. Their effect and lifespan should not be limited to this  period. I am convinced we are going to surpass the special  period. I am convinced that we are going to put our finances in  order, that we are going to successfully resist this phase and  make progress. We will also continue making progress in the  perfecting of our political system which is also essential in  order to continue the economic development and the development  of a socialist economy and society.    [Sexto] On what do you base the hope that we are going to  surpass the special period, that we are going to overcome this  entire situation?    [Alarcon] I do not want to sound overconfident or anything  like that. However, without stressing the essential need to  continue struggling hard....[changes thought] I said this to the  deputies when I wished them a happy new year. This relates to  Marx's famous quote: Happiness is the struggle. I told the  deputies: I wish for all of us to continue struggling united and  hard.    I believe it is not a waste of time to value the feat of  our people. For four years we have been living in a world where  all its experts vainly predicted our death. These also have been  very difficult years where we have had to rethink a number of  things, seek new markets, and abruptly reorganize our economy on  completely different bases. I believe as hard as the problems  are there is something we cannot forget: These four years have  demonstrated our people's capability to resist. We cannot deny  that there are people who may have weakened. That is what the  entire criminal policies of the Yankees, the whole blockade  seeks. They seek to attract peoples, tear away certain sectors  of the population from the patriotic and united attitude the  immense majority of the people upholds. I believe that our  people's unique show of resistance is truly significant. In the  last four years, several governments have collapsed under less  dramatic conditions that those faced by the Cuban Government.  They have fallen like a house of cards. There have been many  changes in the world, even people with frustrations and lost  illusions who now wish for the socialism of certain European  societies.    There have been great changes in the world. And this small  country, located in the worst of places, is the only socialist  country that is far away from the former socialist bloc and too  close to the empire. Yet, here we are, and it is even possible  to discern signs of progress amidst this crisis. Tourism is  growing. In Cuba, tourism is growing at one of the highest rates  in the world, if not the highest. The accomplishments we have  attained in certain fields amidst such an adverse situation  cannot be ignored. I believe that in the measure that that  spirit, that will is channeled, organized, and boosted we have  the possibility of showing modest, limited signs of the  beginning of a recovery in 1994.    One example is the sugarcane harvest. There is the real  possibility that this year's harvest will be more efficient than  last year's and a little higher in terms of volume of  production. The sugarcane harvest categorically proves wrong  those who believed, imagined -- and much was said abroad -- that  Cuba was inexorably going downwards. For us it is an essential,  highly significant thing to take this step with the limited  resources Cuba will receive, but also because it confirms the  righteousness of the effort we all are conducting. Many other  examples could be given: the entire science sector, scientific  research, biotechnology, the pharmaceutical industry, etcetera.  Step by step, despite all the obstacles and the immense  competition with the transnationals in this sector, some of our  products are making headway because they are unique, and also  because they are useful and effective and our production  capacity has grown. And all this takes place amidst a truly  difficult situation. These are the elements for a justified  optimism.    [Sexto] One quick question. I can see that your cautious  optimism is based on the capability for resistance and work of  the people, but I also believe that you trust the strategy that  Cuba is following to overcome this, in the success of this  strategy.    [Alarcon] Of course. I am cautious in terms of the concrete  results we might see. I am totally and completely confident in  the correctness of our strategy and the capability for  resistance and work of our people.    [Bel] In all these ongoing debates and in the people's  mouths  there are highly generalized terms such as subsidies, taxes,  confiscations, etcetera. You spoke of the need to work on the  conscience of the citizens, of acting politically. Are there  plans to provide new programs to contribute to organizing the  thinking of the masses in this regard?    [Alarcon] I believe that in this we all have to contribute  with our grain of sand. I believe that what the unions do, what  we are trying to do in the people's government, what you do in  the press is using every mean to reach many people, and serving  as tools for reflection and analysis by the comrades. I believe  that we have to see these things as issues on which we all have  to become educated collectively by confronting opinions, views,  in the search for elements, etcetera. These are issues that in  another country would be the exclusive realm of the  intellectuals, the experts, or the powerful. In our case, the  same thing happens: The owners have to decide on the issues, but  here all of us are the owners. We have to assume this role  fully. I believe this is not easy.    This is not a simple issue. This is why I answered  positively when I was asked earlier about the relationship  between the economy and politics after the special period and  the present financial situation.    I believe that in a society such as this every worker should  aspire to become a connoisseur of details, of costs, of  efficiency, and of all the economic fields which are not the  responsibility alone of the manager hired by an owner. Those  people managed very well to keep their enterprises running  efficiently because they sought something called profits. We do  not have this now. There is no one profiting from our sweat.  Therefore, we have to be more creative on how we assume the role  of owner -- of owners in a more noble sense, more open, and  including the entire people.    This is very complex. It is not a matter of becoming  specialists in a limited fiield of action. I believe that it is  also very important to develop a collective awareness in society.    [Recio] It is going to be one year since the elections of  1993, a highly significant moment in the history of democracy in  Cuba and Cuban history itself. Alarcon is perhaps the best  person to answer the following question: A year has gone by. Is  that overwhelmingly majoritarian support of socialism, the  revolution, and the fatherland still there? A year later, what  changes have taken place in the awareness of the people who did  not understand well enough the essence of those elections and  its results?    [Alarcon] I deeply believe so. I believe that in the measure  that times goes by, this cultivated, educated people understand  even more that what is at stake is the defense of socialism,  which is everything for us. Even our national identity, the  possibility of the existence of this land as a sovereign and  independent nation is inseparable from the project of social  justice which the Cuban people have undertaken. I believe this  is the explanation of what we commented on earlier: Why our  people have resisted so hard for four years of the special  period while others have not.    Regarding the second question: We will, of course, always  have detractors and this honors us. The day those who live in a  pseudodemocracy, in a society that uses terms as noble as this  one to disguise the opposite, to hide the lack of equality and  therefore the lack of the real authority of the people over its  government, see our system as praiseworthy would be reason  enough for us to conduct a self-examination to find out what are  we doing wrong.    I believe that in the political aspect, in general, the  defense of Cuba's revolutionary project is growing each day  throughout the world because it is precisely an alternative. As  long as there is a country which, confronted with immense  challenges, maintains alive ideals which for many people are but  dreams of a more noble world, a world based on equity, justice,  fraternity rather than profit, exploitation, and individual  selfishness which is capitalism, as long as this exists, there  is a threat to people who exploit and discriminate in this  world, as all this keeps the people's dream alive. In the  political sense, this should be reflected more each day in a  system of government that is genuinely, truly, and authentically  of the people, one that is really participatory. I believe that  despite the enemy campaigns, this is a concept that continues to  become more deeply rooted, continues to progress.    I mentioned the other day an Italian friend who saw  something  he cannot do in his country. Here it can be done and will be  done more and better each day precisely because we have a just  society and a people aware and capable of sustaining and  preserving that society, a people who have a great revolution  made by the people and worthy of the people.    [Recio] There is one more question: A special session of the  ANPP has been announced. What is expected of this special  session? When will it be held?    [Alarcon] It will be held at the appropriate time -- here I  am returning to the diplomatic language of my previous job  [laughter]. I believe that it will happen early in the year. The  session should reflect what was decided in December -- the  continuation of that discussion which I am sure will be held  under better conditions, with more preparation, more in-depth  analysis, accompanied much more by the people as a result of  this process in which the people are participating. I believe it  will be held at a time when we are more on the offensive. The  people are not only talking about finances, but they are acting  on them everywhere across the land. At the time the ANPP meeting  is held, I am sure that this process by the unions and ANPP  deputies and delegates will have attained much more dynamism and  strength, and this will be reflected in the ANPP meeting.

On the eve of his departure, he  visited the journal's editorial office and answered the  questions of editor in chief Vladimir Krestyaninov.    [Krestyaninov] You, Nikolay Grigoryevich, are a doctor of  sciences and an economist who has worked in the Academy of  Sciences system and is suddenly leaving for the foreign trade  sphere. What is the reason?    [Zaytsev] Mr. editor in chief, there is no secret here and  it  can seem strange only superficially. Now is generally a time of  surprise appointments, but as for me, up to now I have  considered myself a cadre foreign trade employee: my first job  was the Ministry of Foreign Trade. Specifically I was involved  in the problems of Cuba and Latin America. My work in  Switzerland was also connected to foreign trade. I do not think  that I am leaving academic activity, and academic regalia will  not be an obstacle. I am simply returning to what I began with,  and I am traveling to work in Mexico with a good, business-like  attitude.    [Krestyaninov] In your opinion, what is the level of  Russia's  trade-economic ties with Mexico as of today?    [Zaytsev] I cannot answer that question unequivocally.  Traditionally the flow of goods in the two directions was  relatively small. The situation has been the same in recent  years. The volumes of trade are no more than 40-50 million  dollars, which is not much for countries like Mexico and Russia.  But it is noteworthy that in recent years very interesting  contracts have been signed to supply sets of equipment from the  former Soviet Union, from Russia now, and from a number of other  CIS republics, above all Ukraine. These deliveries are  concentrated in the power engineering sphere. Russian companies  are exporting equipment for large GES's [hydroelectric power  station] which are being built in Mexico. There are also  deliveries for other energy installations. We have good  prospects for the incursion of other types of equipment; among  others Khimmasheksport [Chemical Machine Export] is actively  working on this market. A contract for exporting equipment to  produce prussic acid has been signed and is being realized. A  contract for assembling tractors produced at the Lipetsk and  Vladimir plants continues to be realized, though not at as rapid  a rate as before. These machines are the same ones which were in  demand in Mexico back in the 1970s, although the market, I  repeat, is complex and practically no operations to ship  components to assemble them have been carried out this year.  There is also some progress in such directions as deliveries of  aviation equipment--above all helicopters--and Ural trucks,  which may also arouse the interest of Mexican buyers. Although  it must be admitted that this was done in previous years.    As for imports, instead of a number of the traditional  Mexican goods, we continue to buy large batches of pipe. The  import of particular types of consumer goods like coffee, above  all instant, cigarettes, and certain other goods is being  expanded. And characteristically, this is being done to a  significant degree by independent commercial structures.    [Krestyaninov] Will the signing of NAFTA in some way help  or,  on the contrary, hinder the development of our ties?    [Zaytsev] That is a very interesting question. You know, I  think that 17 November, that is, the day when American  legislators in fact responded positively to the North American  Free Trade Agreement, will determine the development of  economics and politics in the northern part of America for the  long-term perspective. And, of course, NAFTA will both directly  and indirectly affect Russia's interests, and I may be wrong,  but it is more likely to be negatively. Serious additional  competition may appear for us in the United States and Canada  for a number of those goods which we can still move and are  moving onto those markets. In the medium term, as our economy is  normalized and becomes more competitive in terms of realizing  international deals, I think that NAFTA must be treated as a  kind of given. Undoubtedly this bloc is not closed but half  open, and I assume that in the future one could in fact conceive  of categories for setting up particular competitive production  facilities, say, on Mexico's territory, like the ""maquiladoras,""  in order later to move this output onto the markets of the  United States and Canada. And there are already some concrete  proposals in this direction. Among others, those small  production facilities which we have, in Canada for example, I  think could in time be more profitable in Mexico and could  support commercial interests in the entire subregion. I repeat  that this question has not yet been raised on the practical  level. So one of the first tasks for me right away will be to  figure out seriously and in detail what this means for Russia's  foreign economic interests.    [Krestyaninov] But in addition to that, what in your opinion  hinders the more serious development of our trade-economic ties  today?    [Zaytsev] I think there are traditional obstacles of an  objective nature and some new difficulties. As for the  traditional factors, I think that all the same I must  unequivocally say that Mexico and the Soviet Union and Mexico  and Russia have essentially never opened their doors to one  another and have not even tried to. Mexico is traditionally  oriented to the northern market, that is understandable. But its  policy of diversification of foreign-economic ties is notable,  even with the signing of NAFTA, and I think that even Russia  will sooner or later but inevitably be included in it. And on  our part, the new entrepreneurial circles have not yet marked  the position which Mexico will take in their export and import  strategy or in the movement and attraction of foreign  investments. In my understanding, this country is no longer a  traditional developing state. In the past 5-6 years, in  conditions of very great economic difficulties, Mexico was able  to realize an exceptionally powerful set of structural  transformations. Today Mexico has a modern infrastructure and  competitive industry and has every possibility of another leap  into the future. I do not think that a Latin American ""tiger""  such as Mexico should escape our attention.    Among the difficulties of a traditional nature I would add  distance, since what can be saved or lost on freight is quite  important. I will also mention the circumstance that by no means  do we always have adequate potential to finance export-import  transactions.    As for difficulties related directly to the present stage,  the instability of our economic situation must be singled out of  course. I mean those problems which we still have and sometimes  are even accelerating on the level of realizing foreign economic  operations, including a weak legislative base and the  inexperience of some new commercial organizations, which for now  are not always qualified to work on the new markets. But I  believe it is unproductive to speak only of difficulties. I  would raise the question above all of the possibility of and  need to assist Russian and Mexican entrepreneurs find one  another, since up to now a certain number of trade operations  have not been conducted directly but through third countries.    [Krestyaninov] But apparently our legislation does not allow  us to establish serious cooperation either?    [Zaytsev] Absolutely, although we are more viable and our  foreign trade organizations now are in the process of preparing  to work in the new conditions. I have had meetings and contacts  with 35-40 Russian foreign trade associations and banks, not to  mention talks in the Ministry itself. And it seems to me that  foreign economic enthusiasm is fairly strong among  entrepreneurs. If domestic matters are arranged, I think the  Russian mind will lay and already is laying a unique path.    [Krestyaninov] Our entrepreneurs have very little  information  on what Mexico is like and what Mexican goods are like.    [Zaytsev] I agree with that absolutely.    [Krestyaninov] That obviously applies to conditions for  importing them too.    [Zaytsev] And both the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations  and the trade representation are to blame for that, I believe.  Tuning up information channels should be one of the most  important tasks. But on the other hand, it seems to me that for  now Russia's entrepreneurial circles are still unaware of the  unique possibilities for realizing their own interests they can  obtain by cooperating closely with the trade representatives'  apparat. To be honest, that disturbs me, since very often they  go right out and find unreliable firms and frequently get  ""burned,"" while the trade representations were in fact created  for that very reason, to find reliable partners and provide  information on markets. Trade representatives send an enormous  flow of information to Russia but, unfortunately, it by no means  always finds the consumer.     "

However, this is not only a  consequence of market reforms, but also a condition for success  of these reforms. After all, scientific-technical potential is  practically the only strategic resource that Russia can rely on  to extricate herself from economic crisis. We decided to turn  the podium over to specialists who have long and persistently  tried to call the attention of the authorities and the public to  this issue. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA was visited by Yuriy Naydo,  director of the Center of Structural Studies and Industrial  Policy of IMEPI RAN, and Stanislav Simanovskiy, director of the  sector of innovative policy of the same institute.    Yuriy Naydo: Unfortunately, failure of the state  to take action is leading to Russia's de facto loss of  ``technological sovereignty'': scientific-technical potential is  rapidly being destroyed, erosion of key personnel is glaringly  evident, the material-technical and informational base of  science is deteriorating, and scientific-technical projects lie  dormant.    A situation where science is being transformed to nothing  but  expense is one of the terrible signs of loss of technological  security of the nation. This is inevitably followed by a  widening lag behind the world community and lopsided  technological dependence on developed Western nations that will  be very difficult to overcome.    As a result, our nation will be unable to make a claim to  participation in the international division of labor as a  partner on equal footing, and will be condemned to continually  pumping a considerable fraction of its national income over to  the use of states on a higher stage of scientific-technical  development.    Stanislav Simanovskiy: As we change over to the  market, to an open economy, there is a sharp increase in the  role of international cooperation. Without it, Russian science  will be hard put to survive, since there is almost no internal  demand on the transitional stage for domestic scientific and  engineering advances. And this means that without international  cooperation we cannot avoid the collapse of the  scientific-technical potential of Russia. But this is only one  obvious aspect of the problem. Another aspect is not so obvious  at first glance. The fact is that international cooperation,  allowed to find its own level, objectively carries the threat of  a decline in national technological security. This is confirmed  if only by the example of today's assistance given by the world  community to Russian science. Today the volume of such  assistance (both actually provided and pledged) is about $600  million. More than ten different funds have been established in  the West to support science in Russia. Among others, there are  the well known Soros Fund that allocates 100 million dollars to  CIS nations for 1993-1994, the U.S. National Science Fund ($25  million), the Mitterrand Fund, General European Fund (4 million)  and so on.    In my opinion, Russia ought to accept such help with  gratitude. But in doing so, she is obliged to take care that  this assistance does nothing to harm the technological security  of the nation.    For instance just take the system of gathering information  about research and development, scientific institutions and key  researchers when submitting requests for grants and other aid.  It gives the West an exhaustive picture of Russian scientific-  technical potential. And it does this in detail that at times is  not accessible to Russian governmental agencies responsible for  the development of science and engineering. The most promising  research and the most productive scientists can be freely used  in the interests of Western science, engineering, and economy as  a whole. In particular, by offering stipends to the most capable  students, contracts for internship and work abroad to the most  promising young scientists and specialists. By financing  individual scientists and teams, providing research equipment,  the West is actually setting up in Russia its own kind of  industry to serve its own economy. In truth, whoever pays can  call the tune. There is also the potential possibility of saving  individual areas of Russian science and engineering, and even  shutting them off from considerations of the competitive  struggle. In their attempts to earn some cash, our scientists  are ready to take next to nothing for transfer abroad of  research results, many of which surpass the world level and are  the genuine national property of Russia. And in essence, all of  this is nothing more than flow to the West of Russian national  wealth without equivalent reimbursement.    Naydo: Under conditions of a totalitarian regime,  autarkic economy (i.e. closed, self-sufficient), technological  security was looked at primarily in the context of  military-political rivalry, the arms race. With the transition  to an open market economy, its content shifts toward the  economic sphere. Today, technological security should primarily  ensure success of the nation in the hard competitive struggle  for the world market. And there is feedback between  technological security and competition: the stronger the  competitive positions of a nation on the world market, the  stronger will be its technological security.    Simanovskiy: Active political and diplomatic  measures will be needed to stop the discriminatory practice of  the West that was introduced during the years of the Cold War  and that makes it difficult for our nation to have access to  world advances in science and engineering. Now it looks like the  process is slowly moving in the reverse direction. Nevertheless,  there are still no guarantees that limitations of this kind will  be reinstated in full measure if political development in Russia  should be interpreted as unfavorable for the West.    Naydo: An effective solution to the problem is not  to return to yesterday's autarky, but rather the reverse, to  reinforce and develop the closest and strongest contacts with  the world community. Most optimum are cooperative ties  distinguished by forming equal technological  interdependence of partners. This safeguards uniform  technological dependence of participants in international  cooperation. It means equality of economic conditions of  international exchange, precluding redistribution of the  national income of the less developed partner to the advantage  of the more developed partner. It also means equality of  potential loss in the case of breaking of technological ties.    The tasks of retaining the scientific-technical potential of  Russia and preventing lopsided technological dependence on the  West are intimately intertwined. However, they need to be  handled by different approaches. Financial support of science is  needed to retain our scientific-technical potential. In addition  to that, prevention of lopsided technological dependence  requires that the state and the private sector keep a watch on  utilization of our stock of inventions, developments and  technologies. A watch that on the one hand encourages  international competition, and on the other hand sets up a  barrier to squandering of national scientific-technical  achievements of strategic significance. Such supervision, based  mainly on economic methods, should be an integral part of a  unified state scientific-technical policy.    Simanovskiy: Problems of technological security  should be permanently on the agenda, and the topic of at least a  yearly report by the President and the government. Such an  approach would force the leadership of the nation to look at the  literally perishing scientific-technical potential, academic,  industrial and institutional science, the enormous defense  conversion sector of the economy, and the military-industrial  complex, at coming up with a scientifically sound governmental  scientific-technical policy.    Legislative support is needed as well: a codex of laws about  the scientific-technical policy of the state, the academic  scientific establishment, the status of the scientist,  protection of intellectual property, transfer of technologies  from defense to civilian sectors, governmental classified and  confidential items, and also a block of laws and normatives  regulating the process of the brain drain both out of Russia to  other nations, and out of nations of the former USSR into Russia.    Naydo: Federal agencies of authority ought to have  a clear idea about what the nation still has at its disposal in  the technological sense. This would be aided by an inventory of  scientific and engineering attainments of the nation, an  assessment of the prospects for commercial sales on foreign  markets, ascertainment of areas where we lead and lag with  respect to the world level, and accordingly determination of  priority areas of technological export and import.    Simanovskiy: Apparently, we also need an agency on  acquiring and utilizing international material and technological  assistance for Russian science. Such assistance requires  coordination on a multilateral level; among other things,  setting up an information system, a unified financial fund or  bank, an insurance company, and the like. The main thing is  maximum simplification of access to outside sources of funding  for all deserving claimants.    The problem of technological security of the nation will not  be solved in one day. It is going to take constant and  persistent attention. But the steps that we have proposed are  only a part of what is needing to be handled without delay.  Tomorrow it will be too late. For now there is still a chance of  rectifying the situation.     "

""The two presidents discussed various topics of common  interest and addressed broader aspects of international affairs.  In addition to the talks, the visit achieved concrete results,""  the diplomat added. Tello said Mexico and Cuba achieved  progress in the project for joint investments and joint  enterprises (such as the agreement on telecommunications),  adding ""all of this always helps to strengthen bilateral ties.""    Despite the brevity of the visit, Salinas carried out the  scheduled agenda, which included an official lunch with Castro,  talks between the two statesmen, a news conference, and a  reception at the Mexican Embassy in Havana. Most of his visit  centered on talks with President Castro, with whom he discussed  the broad range of bilateral relations in the political,  economic, trade, cultural, and scientific-technical cooperation  fields.

The official said  Ecopetrol ""asks everyone who is interested in buying oil to  guarantee their purchase with a letter of credit. We do that  with all our customers."" That ""is what we have asked Cuba to do,  and it has proposed an alternate payment method that is still  unsatisfactory. Therefore, as long as they do not offer a letter  of credit, there will be no deal,"" Rendon emphasized.    Colombian Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule Amin  announced  in early February the sale of approximately 20,000 barrels of  crude oil per day starting in June or July. According to the  Colombian minister, the sale would provide one-third of the  island's crude oil needs.    The general manager of Ecopetrol also explained that Cuba  ""is  offering its main export product, sugar, as its guarantee  through a three-party transaction with the company that buys  from them. It offers to pay for the Colombian oil once it has  sold the sugar."" Obviously, Rendon emphasized, ""what we want is  a letter of credit and as of this moment we have not reached an  agreement.""    The announcement about the sale of crude oil to Fidel  Castro's island caused Cuban exiles to protest in front of the  Colombian consulate in Miami as well as announcing that  Colombian products would be subject to sabotage and boycott.  Moreover, the Ecopetrol manager ruled out the possibility that  Colombia would refine crude oil in Cuba because, he said, the  refineries on the island are too old.     "

What  balance should be established between material and moral  incentives? Does a material incentive inevitably create  uncontrollable trends toward mercantilism and individualism?    This may be the best possible moment to answer these key  questions that we Cuban workers have asked ourselves repeatedly  throughout our revolutionary history.    Now is the best moment, and, as never before, it is  essential  to establish the greatest rational and realistic cooperation  among the economy, politics, and ideology. This does not mean  embracing a vulgar practice that rejects essential features of  revolutionary humanism or leads us to confuse what is necessary  with what is desirable. It is the best moment because the  present situation strengthens our will to correct errors we had  found earlier in the organization of labor and salaries and in  our interpretation of the conditions influencing labor behavior.    It seems that if one current economic issue needs special  analysis because of its enormous, direct, and daily influence on  the workers' standard of living and social education, it is the  organization of labor and salaries.    So it is not surprising that Cuban society is now focusing  on  this crucial issue.    It is clearly a vital goal, and not just economic, but  ideological as well, to develop formulas and practices seeking  the best combination between material and moral incentives.    The unions, representing the workers' vital interests, are  absolutely committed to seeking and expanding formulas that by  promoting the nation's economic reorganization, will safeguard  the ideal of a collectivist and just society with solidarity.    We support without reservation the view that a well-founded  material incentive, which is actually a fair share for the  performance of a social duty, is in fact a moral incentive of  the greatest importance.    The social evaluation shown by providing a material  incentive  to the individual corresponding to his contribution does not in  any way create contradictions detrimental to the worker's  morale, just as it cannot be alleged that an exclusively moral  incentive can satisfy needs and aspirations of other sorts.  There has always been talk of a combination of both types of  incentives. Now is the time to interpret fully the meaning of  the word ""combination"" that, in chemistry, for example, means an  ""intimate union of the molecules of two substances."" Just as  water is a combination of hydrogen and oxygen, for us the  motivation for labor indissolubly combines both material and  moral factors. As we have already said, we Cuban workers must  promote a process of revitalization of the role of salaries and  other forms of material incentives so that we can differentiate  to a greater degree the levels of individual consumption in  relation to each person's contribution.    It is important to understand the evolving, gradual, and  very  complex character of this process, so that we do not create  false expectations or unjustified demands, and so this will not  be identified with former experiments that were rightly  criticized. The dynamics of this process will be shaped by the  restoration of internal financial order and equilibrium and by  the economic recovery steps that Cuba takes in its strategy of  reentering the world economy.    Moreover, the policy of renewed emphasis on material  incentives would be inappropriate if it were initially extended  without discrimination, with the same weight given both to  productive sectors and to those that do not directly create  material value.    Among productive activities we need to distinguish those  which are capable of definitely generating high foreign currency  earnings, decreasing convertible currency costs, or which have a  special significance in the current strategy of resistance and  development. These activities, called multipliers because of  their ability to help revitalize the economy in general, are the  first to which the motivating force of greater material  incentives should come, with the necessary criterion of maximum  efficiency and stringent discipline.    It is no waste of time to reiterate that the unions have the  duty to demand that in any case, material incentives must also  be contingent upon a substantial increase in labor productivity.  All that is done to boost productivity and efficiency in these  vanguard activities, along with steps for financial improvement,  will have repercussions on the dissemination of these incentives  toward more and more sectors of the economy and toward  nonproductive services.    What is done to revitalize the national economy will in one  way or another reach the entire working population, starting by  increasing the purchasing power of present salaries.    It can be seen with enormous optimism that wherever the  experiment of stimulating more vigorously effort and excellence  in work has been tried, the immediate results have more than  compensated the investment made.    Still, increases in material incentives should not be  conceived solely in terms of raising salaries and giving workers  in these centers special access to the consumption of specific  goods and services. This simplistic view would lead to failure.    Wherever unquestionable economic gains promoted in large  part  by greater incentives exist, there are also present satisfaction  in work well done, pride in doing one's duty, conscious  acceptance of discipline that is desirable and appropriate for  each member of the work unit, a precise definition of every  person's objectives, functions, and tasks, understanding of the  social usefulness of the work done, and the enjoyment of better  environmental and working conditions. These experiences show  that when the workers are fully and effectively motivated, it  contributes to their ideological formation that, as we know, is  expressed in the execution of their responsibilities, in their  actions.    Beyond words, the essential and most direct way for the  worker to take part in the construction of socialist society is  by doing his job. Everything done to promote the value of labor  forms a part of the sacred struggle for human dignity.    It may be worthwhile to say that, though we are speaking of  the role of material incentives, we do not underestimate the  importance of moral incentives. Doing that would once again  polarize the focus on this issue, by denying that both form an  inseparable whole.    What we want to do is call attention to the necessary view  that a material incentive linked organically to decisive  political, ideological, and moral aspects, and associated more  and more with collective effort, with the cooperation and  socialization of labor, far from damaging revolutionary  awareness, must and can help to strengthen it.    This is the deeply held conviction of the Cuban union  movement.     "

The recently concluded special session  of the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]  outlined the policy to be followed by the executive branch in  overcoming the serious budget deficit, which amounts to 4.2  billion pesos, and the excessive money supply, which is on the  order of 11.6 billion pesos. Among the suggestions made by the  Cuban deputies are: selective raising of tariffs on nonessential  products, elimination of certain [word indistinct],  establishment of a tax system, reduction of subsidies for  certain products, granting of subsidies to low income earners,  and reduction in state allocations for unprofitable businesses,  a measure already being implemented.    Cuba has been able to face the consequences of previous  stages of the current crisis because even though the U.S.  economic blockade existed, its effects were attenuated by the  advantageous relations with Europe's former socialist countries.  For many years, Cubans enjoyed the benefits of a just and equal  distribution of health care, medical attention, and social  security. Also, there has been equal distribution and subsidy  of rationed products offered at extremely low prices. Access to  some public services has continued to be free. With the  disappearance of the former socialist bloc, the entire weight of  the U.S. economic blockade has been felt. If we add to this the  fact that credit is nonexistent and that this is an  underdeveloped nation, we must conclude that Cuba now finds  itself in a very adverse position which does not permit  resorting to yesterday's solutions.    The Parliament recommended to the government fundamental  guidelines for adopting in coming weeks and months a series of  realistic measures consonant with the current situation.  Perhaps after a reasonable period, preliminary reports will  show positive results. Cubans understand the need for adopting  this strategy, although not all of them are capable of  specifically adapting to the stringency of some of the measures  -- hence the importance of a process of popular discussions in  the country that will seek consensus. Only at the end of the  discussions, sponsored by the unions, did Parliament reach  conclusions on recommendations to the government.    It was seen that premeditated solutions are difficult and do  not have unanimous support. But solutions will never be  proposed behind the people's back. Cubans with low incomes will  not be neglected. At the same time, the 11 million inhabitants  of the island will continue to enjoy the principal social  achievements, such as education, health, and social security  [words indistinct].     "

Theoretically speaking, from a clearly abstract position  that  is perhaps based on the rigidity of a manual, the state-owned  agricultural enterprise, with its vast areas that stretch  forever and its totalizing mechanization, is apparently a more  advanced economic concept than a workers' cooperative.    The launching and completion of the agrarian reform was  apparently marked by a rather covert conflict between the two  concepts: Article 43 of the law promulgated in La Plata in 1959  informed the INRA (National Institute for Agrarian Reform) of  the suitability of organizing cooperatives on nationalized land  to the extent possible. A few were in fact set up. Later on,  thinking turned more to the formation of state-owned entities.  At the time, the Cuban economy was able to rely increasingly on  the advantages of the socialist foreign market, resulting in an  exponential increase in the amount of machinery and consumable  expenditures available for use on vast government-owned  properties, initially known as farms and later as enterprises.  That agricultural organization created citrus fruit plantations,  rice paddies, and scientifically designed banana plantations,  and also created poultry and dairy farms turning out enormous  amounts of production. It erred in other ways, however. There  was no direct, organic connection between the worker and the  land. Excessively low wages could not keep man tied to farm  production. Incentives such as housing and a reliable supply of  consumer goods for workers were lacking despite the fact that  communities were built and that the state market delivered eggs,  milk, and fish to the far corners of the country.    The result was that the farm worker and his family headed  for  urban areas in search of more attractive options. Today, only 20  percent of our population resides in rural areas.    Cooperativization tends to reverse this trend.    A debate over whether the enterprise is more socialistic  than  the cooperative would be futile now and serve only to heighten  erudite pretensions. The fact is that Cuba no longer has the  external advantages that enjoyed the benefits of specific laws,  certain plans, and a number of social goals. Agriculture will  have to make up for some of the machinery, fertilizer, and  insecticides by means of innovations and solutions from man  because what we need is a stimulating structure that will touch  the individual and force him to reveal his true capabilities.    According to the cooperative concept, which is a bold,  realistic, and flexible political measure, the worker is the  direct owner of production. While the land remains under the  state or the nation, a closer, more deeply felt, decisive link  is forged between man and the land. Results and work are truly  bound together, inserted into the framework of an independent  community whose interests cannot, at the risk of inefficiency,  allow paternalism. For their own sake, these same interests will  encourage the worker to build his house and nourish himself from  his own land without being forced to wait for his commercial  ration.    It remains for the Basic Cooperative Production Units (UBPC)  to accept the challenge of practice. In terms of hope, they  promise to be efficient agricultural cells, now and forever. In  a sense, practice has already handed down its verdict: A wage  disconnected from productivity and production cannot create the  feeling of social property in the worker's conscience. The  profitable and recommendable experience of the farm cooperatives  votes in favor of the UBPC. In them, the producer has  efficiently combined two relations that once seemed  unreconcilable: what is mine and what is ours.     "

Of the 129 ""economic  partnerships,"" 32 are tourism-oriented, said the Cuban official,  whose remarks were published on Monday by the business weekly  OPCIONES.    The weekly, which was first published in January by JUVENTUD  REBELDE, the official mouthpiece of the Union of Young  Communists (UJC), is aimed at foreign businessmen interested in  investing in the island.    Melendez, director of foreign investment in Cuba, also  disclosed that his ministry has received 149 more applications  to form joint ventures, the first of which appeared three years  ago.    ""We form partnerships with foreign businessmen who provide  financing, capital for new facilities, and modern technology  that allows us to produce on a competitive level,"" he pointed  out. Melendez explained that most foreign investment in Cuba  comes from Spain, followed by France, Great Britain, the  Netherlands, Italy, and Sweden, which are also primary sources.  He added that Europe has invested more capital than America,  including Canada, Mexico, Chile, and the Caribbean nations, and  the duration of partnerships fall within a 10-25 year range.    Melendez explained that coinvestments range from the  exploration and exploitation of oil to industrial production and  tourism administration. Nevertheless, he rejected the  possibility of ""speculative or questionable operations"" in the  future.    Melendez said that multinational conferences on investment  will be held this year in Cuba and will be similar to those  sponsored by the British editorial group Euromoney in 1993 in  London, Cancun, Mexico City, and Havana.    A constitutional reform in 1992 permitted joint ownership of  capital goods in Cuba, an unprecedented shift in the country's  former state monopoly-type economic structure.     "

French Ambassador Jean-Raphael Dufour  confirmed the report for PRENSA LATINA today, saying that this  credit stands at $120 million and that he is satisfied with the  positive evolution of relations between the two countries.    During an interview with PRENSA LATINA, the ambassador said  the first part of the 30-million-franc donation (in excess of $6  million) to Cuba for use in basic industries is practically  complete.    Dufour mentioned a French corporation's drilling for oil in  Cuban offshore waters, particularly the first well drilled in  Cardenas Bay, as one interesting aspect in the field of  bilateral cooperation.    He said that French businessmen constantly travel to Cuba,  and some of them are interested in the banking and sugar sectors.    A new working session of French businessmen and Cuban  authorities will be held in the next few months as a  continuation of the general negotiations held at the beginning  of the year, when a large group of French businessmen came to  Havana.    The ambassador described as very important a July meeting in  Cuba of more than 600 French language professors from Latin  America, Europe, and Africa to discuss the teaching of this  language in Spanish-speaking countries.    He added that this event is endorsed by Cuban authorities  and  the University of Havana and that several Latin American  countries will be well represented.

The economic and sociopsychological situation in Ukraine is  indeed largely reminiscent of wartime.    The rate of inflation in the country has reached 70 percent  per month, which comes close to the ""world record"" held by  Serbia, which is at war. The average wage of about $10 is the  equivalent of monthly earnings in the besieged Sarajevo. The  20-30 percent a year fall in production is greater than in  Azerbaijan. The vocabulary of many Ukrainian politicians and the  mass media is close to that of the military.    Any war raises two main issues: ""Who is the main culprit?""  and ""Who will win?"" It is hard to answer these questions  unequivocally. However, much can be understood and foreseen by  comparing the complaints and mutual accusations of the parties  to the conflict.    [Boxed item]    Ukraine's Key Economic Complaints About Russia:    --it sells fuel and raw materials to Ukraine at prices that  are destroying the Ukrainian economy,    --it has taken over the lion's share of the all-Union wealth  (gold and diamond reserves, property abroad, and so on),    --it steals away the best skilled personnel--research,  engineering, and technical--from key production sectors: the  nuclear power industry, transportation, and so on,    --it buys up property on the territory of Ukraine in order  to  make the latter first economically and then politically  dependent,    --it is neither punctual nor honest as far as payments for  Ukrainian deliveries are concerned, and is indebted to Ukrainian  enterprises. [End boxed item]    [Boxed item]    Russia's Key Economic Complaints About Ukraine:    --it resells inexpensive Russian resources to other  countries,    --it fails to coordinate its export policy with Russia and  drives down prices for important Russian goods (metals, weapons,  chemical products),    --it pursues an isolationist policy and hampers the natural  processes of reintegration and the establishment of joint  ventures, companies, and financial-industrial groups,    --it is neither punctual nor honest as far as payments and  deliveries are concerned; its debt to Russian enterprises is  immense. [End boxed item]    It cannot be determined who is right and who is wrong: The  pitch of mutual reproaches is too high, the politicians and  experts of the two sides too prejudiced and incompetent. Most  probably, both parties are guilty to some degree. The  politicians of Kiev are guilty of attempting to foist on Moscow  a naively sly, unacceptable model of relations: Ukraine is  completely independent of Russia politically, but receives raw  materials and resources from the latter at domestic Russian  prices. Russian politicians are guilty of failing to perceive  Ukrainian independence for a long time and trying to foist on it  the ""suzerain-vassal"" model of relations. However, practice has  indicated that there is a natural limit to the deterioration of  economic relations between the two countries. It turned out that  neither country is capable of dealing to the economy of its  neighbor a blow of such a force as to make the ""cold economic  war"" grow into ""hot"" economic skirmishes. Apparently,  politicians on both sides were mistaken in evaluating their  forces.    The Mistakes of Ukrainian Policy    In their calculations and plans, Ukrainian politicians have  overstated the opportunity to strike retaliatory blows at the  Russian economy. In the corridors of power and public opinion it  was believed for a long time that Kiev is capable of coming up  with a powerful ""mirror-image"" response to each of the punitive  economic actions of Russia, in particular by waging a ""guerrilla  war"" against enemy communications. It was expected that the  threat of shutting off energy and transportation systems that  pass through the territory of Ukraine and connect Russia to  Europe would prompt Moscow to be more tractable.    This was a very dangerous concept from the outset. It posed  the threat of an unavoidable escalation of economic, political,  and military confrontation. First, the ambitious Russian  leadership and public opinion, which were accustomed to the  superpower position, are poorly equipped for a quiet search for  a compromise. Second, Russian politics is markedly extrovert in  nature and responds very sensitively to any attempt to isolate  the country. The Russian establishment is prepared to pay any  price and make any sacrifices in order to punish those who  encroach on Russia's connections to the outside world.    The Russian bear would rather die than allow itself to be  locked up in the Asian lair. However, fortunately for Ukraine  and the entire world, Russia quickly found a way out. Kiev did  not succeed in creating a Baltic Sea-Black Sea ""buffer"" or  ""exclusionary"" zone: The Belarusian corridor was found in this  space. Russia will attempt to shift its trans-European  communications there, taking advantage of the pro-Russian  sentiment that exists there, reinforcing it, and connecting the  Belarusian economy to its own more closely. This is precisely  why Russia is proceeding to create a unified ruble zone which is  economically disadvantageous for it. Besides, Russian  specialists quickly groped around for a new model of  transactions with European partners. Now it is these countries  rather than Russia that have conflicts with Kiev over blocking  Russian-European communications.    As a result, by 1994 Moscow ceased to fear the threat of  direct isolation from Europe, and therefore threats by certain  Ukrainian politicians are hardly able to provoke the Moscow  authorities to commit acts that are dangerous to the world  anymore.    The Mistakes of Russian Policy    Russia has overestimated its potential for economic pressure  on Ukraine. First, Russian officials have already lost the  monopoly on resource deliveries. The former state sector has  rapidly converted to the commercial mode; for this reason, an  ever increasing volume of refinery products is delivered through  private channels which the government controls with difficulty.  The government cannot manipulate prices, either: Despite the  threats, many types of raw materials, including refinery  products, are delivered de facto to Ukraine at prices below  world market. It has turned out that Russia is incapable of  quickly switching to other markets. The prediction that an  abrupt deterioration of the economic situation in Ukraine would  bring about a social explosion and a sharply stronger sentiment  for reintegration did not come true, either.    The economic situation is truly as bad as it gets, but  neither a powerful social explosion nor a tumultuous renaissance  of the processes of integration has occurred. Why? Western  Ukraine, for which the independence and sovereignty of the  country have self-contained if not semi-religious significance,  is prepared for any hardship. In turn, Eastern Ukraine lacks the  full-fledged institutions of a civic society (with the exception  of strike committees) due to which dissatisfaction with the  economic decay is reflected in political demands only very  slowly. No matter how bad the situation becomes, the likelihood  of this resulting in a universal striving to reintegrate is low.  Most likely, Ukrainian society will become differentiated into  confrontational social strata and regions. Some will see  excessively close economic links to Russia and its perfidy as  the root of all evil, others, on the contrary, will see the  severance of these relations as being just that.    The economic situation will continue to deteriorate, and  differentiation in society will deepen along with this. However,  as time goes by, the heat of accusations leveled against Russia  by Ukrainian public opinion and political consciousness will  diminish. Even extreme Russophobes are beginning to understand  this: The main reason for the economic troubles is found in the  sluggish leadership of the country lacking the determination to  proceed with radical and rapid reforms.    Incidentally, paradoxical as it might be, I believe that had  Russia switched to world market prices in mutual settlements  with Ukraine right away, there would have been less Russophobic  sentiment in Ukraine for a long time now, and the reforms would  have also proceeded faster. This would have made the  relationship pragmatic, reduced the field of mutual suspicions,  and prompted Ukrainian leaders to look for effective economic  solutions. This state of affairs would have removed suspicions  concerning Russia's desire of to interfere in Ukraine's internal  affairs.    Russian politics is extroverted, whereas Ukrainian politics  is utterly introverted. The Ukrainian fox will not allow anyone  to steal into his burrow. However, even Russian expansionists  have almost grasped by now that the harshest economic pressure  bears little fruit in the contemporary world. It may win a  victory in a totalitarian political space. However, even the  smallest liberalization immediately reduces the potential for  economic blackmail. The time of the economic cold war is most  likely coming to an end because its effect boomerangs.    [Boxed item]    How Will Changes in the Economic Situation in Ukraine and  Russia Influence Their Mutual Relations?    Scenario 1. The economic crisis in Ukraine worsens  catastrophically, whereas Russia succeeds in overcoming it.  Under such conditions the eastern and southern regions would  gravitate toward Russia still more strongly--up to the demand to  join it. This course of events would almost unavoidably bring  about a civil war, because western regions would not proceed to  unify with the neighbor to the north under any conditions. The  aggravation of the situation poses the threat of many millions  emigrating, which may bring about the onset of chaos in the  Russian economy.    Scenario 2. Ukraine finds a way to overcome difficulties,  whereas the reforms in Russia end in failure. The harshest  possible economic and political isolation of Ukraine from Russia  would cause an expansion of emigrants from the north (there are  about 7 million Ukrainians in Russia), which would crush the  Ukrainian economy.    Scenario 3. Equalization of the progress of reforms brings  about a normalization of political relations. Representatives of  private capital from the two sides would act as lobbyists for  this scenario. A great number of joint companies, corporations,  and financial groups would appear.    Contrary to the opinion of various political forces, neither  Ukraine nor Russia are objectively interested in the destruction  of each other's economies. However, even with the most favorable  outcome (Scenario 3) the countries will keenly compete against  each other in raw materials, sales, and labor markets and fight  for the favor of foreign partners.

Reporting on the conversation held behind closed doors Valeriy  Grishin, first deputy leader of the Russian Federation  Government's Press Service, said that the statement by the head  of the cabinet was met with understanding and support by the  U.S. parliamentarians.    V. Chernomyrdin also stressed that the Russian Government  has  not counted on foreign credits, and is not doing so. In this  context he noted that the question of the allocation to Russia  by the IMF of the second part of the system credits, worth $1.5  billion, ""largely bears a political character."" The head of the  cabinet remarked that there are forces in the United States  which are attempting to restrict the Russian Federation's access  to, and undermine its role in, world markets. The premier said  that Russia is not interested in privileges, but in equal  partnership opportunities in trade.    In V. Grishin's words, the U.S. congressmen expressed  support  for the course of reforms being carried out by V. Chernomyrdin's  government.    The statement by Russian Federation Government Chairman  Viktor Chernomyrdin that Russia is ready to submit its  application for membership of the European Union [EU] provoked  animated discussions at EU headquarters in Brussels. This  statement from the Russian premier at a press conference on the  results of his visit to Budapest was interpreted here as  sensational.    A press relations aide to European Commission Member Hans  van  den Broek noted in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent  that right now the union has no answers to a whole range of  questions linked to EU expansion. This is attested by the  difficulties over the accession of Austria, Finland, Sweden, and  Norway. He recalled that Cyprus, Turkey, and Malta have long  been waiting in line for EU membership. Talks on the further  expansion of the EU will hardly begin before 1996, when a  conference on bringing the union's institutions into line with  realities arising subsequent to the Maastricht agreements is  scheduled.    As for Russia, the EU representative stressed, it has  completely different dimensions to any other European country.  An agreement on EU cooperation with Russia should undoubtedly  be concluded. But the accession to the union of such a big  country with a mighty and extremely specific economy is hard to  envisage even in the long term. Even if the EU does somehow  manage to ""swallow"" Hungary and Poland, in the case of Russia  the question arises: ""Who is to join whom?""     "

V. Potyko] You travel abroad often, and I  believe, not as tourist. Did you acquire any experience during  your travels which could be of use for our Republic? What is  your attitude toward IMF activities and its proposals regarding  the resolution of our financial problems?    [Bahdankevich] I have often been abroad as Belarusian  representative to the IMF and the World Bank for Reconstruction  and Development [as published]. The IMF allots a considerable  degree of technical aid to the Republic. It aids our banking  system, primarily by teaching the basics of market economy to  our personnel. As for the European Bank, our relations are most  productive. This bank has already issued four lines of credit  on very favorable conditions for us. We are conducting  negotiations on some 20 investment projects and we have  principally agreed on opening a credit line for small and  medium-sized businesses.    [Samusev] It seems to me that the independence of the  National Bank cannot be compared to that of any central bank in  Europe. Your bank is forced to execute such measures which lead  to increases in inflation and other negative consequences.  Should you not reconsider the status of our National Bank?    [Bahdankevich] Not only the Belarusian National Bank but  also  other central banks are experiencing certain pressure from both  their governments and national business circles in terms of  issuing loans.    In our state, increases in inflation are primarily explained  not by the issuing of credits but rather by a lack of market  levers regulating the economy under situations whereby the state  has refused to directly manage it. Of course, the independence  of the National Bank should be encouraged. However, the key  point is not in the juridical independence of the bank but in  the stalling of reforms. [passage omitted]    [Zhuk] Kebich blames the nonimplementation of the monetary  union with Russia on Bahdankevich. Who is correct?    [Bahdankevich] The National Bank has never opposed the  preservation and strengthening of economic integration with the  Russian Federation. We favor such a union, which is based on  equal rights and does not destroy our independence. We do not  agree that a foreign state -- even a friendly one -- should  begin to formulate our economic policy. We oppose the transfer  of the National Bank -- with its assets and liabilities -- to  the ownership of another state; the approval of the Belarusian  budget and the amount of its deficit by the Russian Duma; the  recalculation of our banks' and enterprises' funds on the basis  of an unprofitable-for-us exchange rate. [passage omitted]    [Nalivayko] What about the unification of the Belarusian and  Russian monetary systems? Proceeding from the words of our  prime minister, I can understand that if not today, then, at  least, tomorrow, the Russian ruble will become our legal  currency. However, you told NARODNAYA GAZETA that there is  virtually no agreement at all. I trust more in your  professionalism. The second question is whether Russia has set  similar -- with its domestic market -- prices for energy  resources for Belarus?    [Bahdankevich] Many factories and businesses in Belarus can  work normally only when they have foreign markets for raw  materials and can sell their products overseas -- primarily, in  Russia and Ukraine. The preservation and extension of markets  is always a positive rather than a negative factor. We kept  this in mind when we planned to establish an equal banking union  between two sovereign states based on a common currency.  However, I think that the monetary merger -- one based on  conditions which violate our Constitution and contradict our  economic and political interests -- should not be implemented.  Instead of the monetary merger, it is possible to sign an  agreement on bilateral payments with Russia. I would like to  emphasize that in early June, the Russian side sent an official  proposal and a draft agreement -- regarding measures to provide  for the mutual convertibility of our national currencies aimed  at establishing a monetary union based on their national  currencies -- to V. F. Kebich. This testifies to the fact that  the Russian Government also has no illusions as far as the  monetary merger -- based on inadmissible and contradictory  conditions for the Constitution of the Republic of Belarus -- is  concerned.    The Russian side has not even lifted customs duties and  taxes, while we lifted them back in April. All the statements  made by our government do not correspond to reality, to say the  least. The Russian Government has already drawn up a draft  agreement regarding customs duties and taxes. Proceeding from  this document, these duties and taxes will be lifted beginning  on the day it is signed. I believe that this agreement will be  signed in the next few weeks. At the moment, our Republic is  experiencing huge losses.    [Lisitskiy] I think that it is the Cabinet of Ministers,  headed by Kebich, which has ruined our economy. However, Kebich  blames the National Bank for this. What is wrong with your bank?    [Bahdankevich] The National Bank opposes injections of  ""noncovered"" money into our economy. This leads to increases in  inflation and prices, to decreases in the exchange rate of our  ruble. To cover the money, the government should pursue a  rational price policy. Currently, one liter of milk in a shop  costs 180 rubles [R] while it costs R1,860 to produce. This  difference is covered from the state budget. This money is mine  and yours. We believe that the government should issue  subsidies not to producers, but to consumers to enable them to  buy milk or bread. It is the price that makes the economy  function. This is the key contradiction between the National  Bank and the government, which wishes -- how can I put this --  to lay the blame on someone else. [passage omitted]    [Samalyuk] Would the economic situation in Belarus become  stable if a national currency were introduced? Who has a real  chance of becoming president of Belarus?    [Bahdankevich] Currently, I would not make any  recommendations as to changes in the National Bank payment notes  for a national currency. To stabilize the economy, it is  necessary to promptly reconstruct it. This means, first of all,  setting conditions for competition, capital investment, cutting  the budget deficit and number of uncovered loans. In my  opinion, a decrease in the inflation rate and stabilization of  the economy -- merely on the basis of a tough monetary policy  along with the introduction of a national currency -- are  impossible.    I hold out hope that the Belarusian people did not lose  their  common sense. They will elect a president who will attract the  best creative forces to the leadership of the state and will  count not on Western or Eastern tips, but on the diligence and  creative potential of its own people. [passage omitted]    [Petrov] Kebich met with intelligentsia in Nesvizh. He spoke  unfavorably of the ""chief banker."" Why? Is this because  Bahdankevich does not want to issue loans to the agricultural  sector or because he opposes the monetary merger with Russia in  the form the prime minister signed it? Kebich said if the  National Bank does not issue a loan to the government, the  government will then take credits in dollars from abroad and  give them to agricultural workers. Who will pay back those  dollars? Kebich or the people? Why were two people -- one from  the Supreme Soviet and another from the Cabinet of Ministers --  included on the National Bank board? Does this mean that  Bahdankevich has to resign?    [Bahdankevich] Mildly speaking, Mr. Kebich lied in Nesvizh.  This year, the National Bank did not grant credits to businesses  or the government at a 210-percent, or even higher, interest  rate. We earmarked R1 trillion in credits -- with a yearly  interest rate of 6.5 percent -- for the sowing campaign through  the budget. In addition, we extended credits for advance  payments for state procurement of agricultural products with a  yearly interest rate of 20 percent, for investments -- 60  percent; for production requirements -- 100 percent.    As for the refusal to grant regular credits to the  agricultural sector, the truth is that our Republic has created  conditions for setting a constant breakaway gap between  procurement prices for agricultural products and prices on  industrial products for the agricultural sector. The more milk,  grain, or meat a kolkhoz or sovkhoz produces, the more  unprofitable it is. By not restricting prices on industrial  products for the agricultural sector and simultaneously  restricting procurement prices -- given the lack of funds to  cover the breakaway gap in prices -- we push agricultural  producers toward bankruptcy. The government sees salvation if  the National Bank issues free and blank credits. However, this  is the path to nowhere -- to a dead end.    The National Bank has repeatedly recommended that the  government cover the carrying costs by setting prices and  issuing credits to agricultural businesses only for seasonal  work and stock provisions. This year, 97.2 percent of National  Bank assets were injected into the agricultural-industrial  complex [APK]. We expected the government to at least adopt the  necessary measures. However, it has done nothing.    Any nonexperts -- industrial or agricultural sector workers  -- realize that in addition to the APK, industry, transport,  trade, and other sectors of economy also require state credits.  A continuous imbalance in supporting only one sector will only  intensify our problems. Prime Minister Kebich should render  support to the agricultural sector, however, he should not do  this by means of such highly unprofessional moves.    As for the introduction of the Supreme Soviet and the  Cabinet  of Ministers' representatives in our bank, this was done  according to changes introduced to the Law on the National Bank.  I am not going to resign in the immediate future. Not because  I care for the chair and a high salary. Were I a chairman of a  commercial bank, my salary would have been at least twice as  high as my actual salary from the state. [passage omitted]    [Tolkachev] How much time, do you think, will be required to  stabilize the economy once the economic reforms are implemented?  What will cover and support the national currency? Western  credits or land mortgages? Anything else? How do you view  Kebich's desire to join the Russian Federation?    [Bahdankevich] I believe that at least to minimally  stabilize  the economy -- that is, to reduce the inflation rate to a level  of less than 10 percent per month, to stabilize the exchange  rate of the Belarusian ruble -- we require between six and eight  months. After this issue is resolved, we will need between two  and three years to profoundly reconstruct the economy, to stop  the drop in production, and ensure a gradual increase in  economic productivity.    As for the introduction of our national currency, the  national wealth -- at first, Belarus-produced products, goods  and services, given the tough budget and credit policy -- will  guarantee its stability.    [Bahdankevich] I would not comment on Vyachaslaw  Frantsevich's position, however, I do favor the preservation of  Belarus' complete political sovereignty and close economic  integration with the CIS states and our Western neighbors.  [passage omitted].    [Bakun] Why did you, Stanislaw Antonavich, not clarify your  position -- regarding the union with Russia -- earlier? Why  only now? Also, I'd like to know which presidential candidate  you will vote for?    [Bahdankevich] According to our verbal agreement with  Chernomyrdin, it was decided that the final draft of the  agreement could be changed after the consultations. However,  you know that Russia did not accept any changes and even  toughened its position. Therefore, I not only had to publicly  express my opinion but to write a letter -- which contained my  principal disagreement with the merger on such conditions -- to  the Supreme Soviet.... I will vote for Stanislaw Shushkevich.  [passage omitted]    [Kholod] Do you have a program regarding the stabilization  of  our ""hare"" outside of the ruble zone?    [Bahdankevich] Yes. We have recently discussed key trends in  the money and credit policy for 1994. This program has already  been adopted.    [Kholod] However, the government is pushing the Republic  toward the money merger. At the same time, you have adopted a  program of measures aimed at stabilizing the national currency  outside the ruble zone. Why is there no single opinion on the  issue?    [Bahdankevich] Currently, the agreement with Russia is  virtually not effective. The expectation that it would begin  functioning leads to big losses due to chaos in calculations.  The point is that the Russian ruble was balanced and accounted  on par with the Belarusian ruble. We virtually decreased our  assets by 10 times.... [passage omitted]    [Burmako] What do you, an expert, think about the economic  concept of the Belarusian Popular Front? Will you cooperate  with them if they come to power?    [Bahdankevich] I am ready to cooperate with any parties and  movements that will be able to implement a program of market  reforms.     "

To this day, Arkhangelsk Oblast's Mirnyy city, which  has a population of 40,000, does not feature on any maps. There  is an explanation for this. Since 1957 missiles systems have  been tested and satellites have been launched here at the  Plesetsk test range.    Our country had to pay a high price for the acquisition of  its nuclear missile shield during the Cold War years. Accidents  occurred during delivery vehicle launches in 1973 and 1980.  More than 50 people died.

[N. Moroz, identified by caption] When it became known that  the Soviet Union had 12 missiles which could reach the United  States, this had a very sobering influence on politicians.    [Tkachenko over video of computer center] Now the  international climate has changed. Since January 1992 missile  test experts have a new mission -- monitoring Russian and U.S.  implementation of treaty obligations on the exchange of  information about test launches undertaken by the former  potential enemies. This equipment was installed at the secret  Plesetsk computer center by Americans. And Russian specialists  have installed similar equipment in the United States. Thus no  strategic missile test launch in either Russia or across the  ocean is a secret any longer. But equally it is no secret that  both the Russian and the American missile experts are keeping  their powder dry and already thinking about the missiles of the  21st century.

The demonstration, which will include more than 4,000  people,  will be staged on 9 June, Raymundo del Toro, of the  Cuban-American Peace Committee, reported by telephone from New  Jersey.    Del Toro told this agency that they expect the participation  of clergymen, friends of Cuba, and Cubans residing in this  country, who will also send letters to the Capitol and call the  White House to demand an end to the economic measures.    The participants, he added, will pay for their own  transportation to Washington to support Rangel's bill, which has  been debated in several committees of the House of  Representatives since 17 March as a free trade initiative.    The fate of Rangel's initiative, which is supported by more  than 30 congressmen, is expected to be known by 9 June, Del Toro  pointed out.    The demonstration, he said, is promoted by various  organizations such as the Cuban Information Project, the  so-called International Peace for Cuba [Internacional Paz para  Cuba], the Pastors for Peace Motorcade, the House of the  Americas, and the Cuban American Committee of Washington, among  others.    In the United States there are currently more than 62  organizations affiliated with a national network of solidarity  with Cuba, which has organized several actions to oppose the  blockade that has cost the island $40 billion since 1962.

He said  that in the future Cuba will implement a diplomatic offensive  policy because we are tired of being on the stand as a defendant.    Robaina said that in Vietnam he is concluding what has been  announced as a diplomatic offensive through several regions in  the world with the purpose of explaining to several governments  the truth about our country and studying our economic  experiences.    Our tours of the Caribbean, some Latin American nations,  Africa, and now Asia, have conveyed to our interlocutors a broad  vision of the process Cuba is experiencing, within a climate of  respect and understanding, Robaina said.    He added that in these contacts Cuba has found elbow room to  personally explain the current Cuban situation and to say what  the great news media fail to say.    Our country is not the hell it is said to be nor the heaven  we would like it to be, and for this reason it should not be on  the stand as a defendant, Robaina said. From this moment on we  are going to begin a diplomatic offensive in an effort to  consolidate our legitimate aspirations and to expand our  international relations.    During a news conference held in Vietnam, Robaina said that  we are a country open for dialogue, willing to negotiate  everything, except our independence, sovereignty, and  revolutionary achievements.    The Cuban foreign minister said that 1994 will be a year of  intensive work which includes a new tour of some Latin American  nations in the beginning of April.    On concluding his visit to Vietnam, Robaina added that his  project includes a visit to the Middle East in the near future,  but before that his country will host the conference between the  nation and the emigre community, a meeting with the Cuban  community abroad.    Robaina said that the conference will be held in Havana  between 22 and 24 April with the participation of Cuban citizen  who reside in the United States, Spain, Mexico, Venezuela,  Argentina, the Caribbean, and other countries.    Robaina went on to say that the objective of the meeting is  to normalize ties between Cuba and its community abroad as all  nations do. All Cubans of goodwill are invited to participate.  Only the hysterical and agressive ones are not invited, he said.    On analyzing his current tour of Asian countries, the Cuban  foreign minister stressed the importance of exchanging ideas and  analyzing economic experiences. He said that Vietnam was the  most relevant point of his tour due to the traditional bilateral  ties of friendship and cooperation, and he concluded by saying  that he was surprised at the achievements of this Asian country.

0,FT924-11537 ,"FT924-11537 _AN-CJ1BTAGCFT 921026   FT  26 OCT 92 / Cuba defies US move to tighten trade sanctions      By CANUTE JAMES      KINGSTON   THE Cuban Communist party said the latest US economic sanctions against the Caribbean island would not change its commitment to socialism but would reduce the chances of a diplomatic end to the 30 years of hostility between the two countries. The new sanctions imposed at the weekend by President George Bush represented 'a pirate's licence', according to the official media in Havana, the Cuban capital. They are contained in legislation described in Washington as the 'Cuban Democracy Act' (also called the Torricelli Bill), which bans foreign subsidiaries of US companies from doing business with Cuba. Ships which call at Cuban ports will be banned from US ports for six months. The sanctions have already been rejected by several countries which trade with Cuba, including members of the European Community, Canada and Mexico, and have been condemned as an unfair trade practice by the shipping industry in Cuba's Caribbean neighbours. Earlier this month the European Commission lodged a formal protest and the UK government said last week it would invoke an existing law to prohibit UK companies owned by US interests from complying with US legislation. US legislators supporting the measures said they are intended to force the administration of President Fidel Castro towards democracy. The Cuban Communist party said the move indicated unlimited 'visceral hatred' of the Cuban people, and referred to a recent statement by Mr Castro that Cubans were willing to undergo 'death a thousand times' rather than abandon the island's socialist ideology. If the new sanctions are even partially effective they will be a further blow to a Cuban economy reeling from shortages of energy and hard currency following the collapse of the Soviet Union, formerly Cuba's main foreign beneficiary. The new measures are likely to be debated soon at the United Nations when Cuba's efforts to have the 30-year-old US trade embargo on the island ended will be discussed.

The  move could force Cuba to find another sponsor or lose its only official contact  with the United States.

There has been speculation that Iraq might extend a welcome  because the Cuban delegate to the Security Council defended Iraq in the United  Nations.

There  have been long historical relations between Cuba and the  patriotic forces, and the ANC in South Africa. That's why this  victory of the democratic forces in South Africa is of a great  importance for Cuba. We feel very satisfied, we feel a great joy  towards President Mandela and his post.    [Kendall] Are you hoping for close ties with South Africa  following the inauguration of President Mandela?    [Rodriques] Definitely. I mean, it's the express will of our  government to keep very close ties with the new Government of  South Africa, and these ties will go from the political field,  and we are hoping also that we can have very strong ties, from  the technical point of view, from the commercial point of view,  and many other fields.

At a press conference Thursday, Slezevicius said Lithuania's  macroeconomic indexes started to approach Czech, Hungarian,  Slovakian, Polish, Estonian and Latvian ones. The rate of  inflation is the principal index, and ""Lithuania is no longer  considered a country with an average [as received] rate of  inflation,"" he said.    Discussing his meetings in Davos, Slezevicius pointed out  the  meetings with Baltic and Scandinavian leaders. He said Swedish  Prime Minister Carl Bildt invited the Baltic premiers for a  meeting with their Nordic counterparts in early March.    As regards the way Latvian and Estonian premiers assessed  the  Davos meeting, Slezevicius said he is unwilling to make any  critical remarks on any statements by Lithuania's neighbors.  Slezevicius said there were no discussions in Davos ""purely  about Estonia"" or that Lithuania's economy depends on Russia.    But the Lithuanian premier admitted that Estonia does not  depend on Russia as much as Lithuania. In his opinion, this is  so only because Estonia gets around 65 percent of its energy  from local shale, while Lithuania has to buy Russian oil and  nuclear fuel.    Commenting on relations with Russia, which were on of the  key  issues in Davos, Slezevicius said Lithuania is unable to  establish a normal dialog with Russia and to solve a number of  problems. The premier said the Lithuanian government tries to  arrange a meeting with Russian leaders, but all attempts have  failed so far. ""I have asked several times to speak to Mr.  Chernomyrdin, but the instable situation in Russia really stops  us.""    The Lithuanian premier said the dialog with Poland and  Belarus, on such problems as border delimitation, is very  difficult, as well.     "

Penate points  out that in 1993 Cuba invested more than 1.63 billion pesos in  social security. This figure represents 4.3 million pesos  invested in the social sector every 24 hours, which does not  include the cost of assistance in that sector, which in 1993 was  approximately 35.9 million pesos.    In Cuba, the social security system's equation of  equilibrium  is based on the business sector's productivity, and its  development is determined by the global economy, which means  that greater efficiency is required from the business sector.

0,FT941-16965 ,"FT941-16965 _AN-EAGC3AAPFT 940107   FT  07 JAN 94 / IMF-World Bank warning on Russia      By GEORGE GRAHAM      WASHINGTON   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are urging western countries not to abandon the tough economic policy conditions they have placed on financial aid to Russia. Making loans conditional on policy reforms, the two Washington institutions argue in an unusual joint note on their operations in Russia, is the best way of speeding up the process of stabilising the Russian economy and bringing about an early improvement in living standards. Officials from the IMF and the World Bank criticised the Russian government for not following through an attack on inflation and for maintaining inefficient subsidies to vested interests such as state businesses and collective farms, at the expense of vulnerable groups such as pensioners and teachers. 'Despite announced policy intentions, Russia has produced an extremely gradual approach to the reduction of inflation. Experience elsewhere suggests that this is not an effective way of minimising economic hardship or maximising political support,' the joint note says. The IMF and the World Bank, as well as the western donor nations, have been criticised both in Russia and the west for being slow to fulfil their promises of financial aid to Russia. The IMF has so far lent Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) to Russia, some of it under a scheme specially devised to ease the conditions for lending money to the former Soviet states. A disbursement of another Dollars 1.5bn under this scheme, however, has been held up while the IMF waits for evidence of an effort to curb inflation and the budget deficit. After the surprising success in last month's Russian elections of the extreme right-wing followers of Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, some policy makers in the west have questioned whether shock therapy was the right approach to Russia's economic problems. In the US, the vice-president, Mr Al Gore, suggested that the IMF should loosen its conditions for further disbursement, while Mr Strobe Talbott, who has been nominated to become deputy secretary of state, said the Russian people needed 'less shock and more therapy'. But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, appears to have prevailed in a debate within the US administration on policy towards Russia, arguing that there is no alternative for Russia to carrying out the painful measures needed to stabilise its economy. President Bill Clinton this week said that more attention needed to be paid to the construction of a social safety net to mitigate the consequences of reform, but that should not mean any slowing of reform. The joint IMF-World Bank note urges Russia to pursue a macro-economic stabilisation programme built on cutting the growth of central bank credit, limiting the 1994 budget deficit and maintaining a liberal price and exchange system. It goes on to advocate structural reforms, including expanded privatisation, changes to insolvency and ownership laws, and improvement of the banking system.

Robaina is scheduled to meet with heads of governments,  businessmen, associations of friendship with Cuba,  representatives of the press, and his counterparts.     "

Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 27 January reports that Isle of  Youth investors have drafted their main investment goals for  1994. Maintaining the current construction projects and  completing projects under way are among the main objectives.  Food production, tourism, and defense programs are among those  with greater impact on the economic and social development of  the island. Basic services to the people will also be improved.    Radio Reloj at 2054 GMT on 27 Jan reports that approximately  2,600 housing units were completed in Pinar del Rio in 1993. Of  the 14 municipalities, 13 built more housing than in 1992. The  province has a 600-house plan for 1994, and is seeking to build  in materials-efficient ways.    Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 28 January reports that  miners in Moa received a donation from British miners of shoes,  shirts, and gloves valued at $15,000.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 28 January reports that the  Bio-  Alimentos research center in Moron, Ciego de Avila, has  developed a new high protein feed for pigs and chickens;  production will begin soon at the 1 January center in Moron  Municipality.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 January reports that  Valencia  and Havana City have signed an agreement for a supply of Pegasus  buses as a cooperative gesture of solidarity to improve  transport in Havana. Garbage collectors, street cleaners,  containers, spare parts, and specific tools for the repair of  these vehicles will also be provided. Pedro Chavez, president of  the Provincial Assembly of the People's Government, stressed the  importance of the agreement and announced that 30 garbage  collectors, 10 street cleaners, and some 4,000 containers will  begin arriving in February.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 on 29 January adds that the Carisol  and  Los Corales hotels were officially dedicated this morning in  Santiago de Cuba and Varadero. The exploitation of these hotels,  considered symbols of Cuban tourism development, will be shared  by Cubanacan and the German chain LTD.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 31  January report that the Che Guevara Plant in Moa, Holguin  Province, has saved more than 1.7 million pesos since September  by burning oil instead of coal. This was achieved through the  research carried out by Engineer Hector Agotis de Ansana, who  has been conducting oil- burning tests since 1992. Fifteen kg of  oil replaces a ton of coal.    Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 31 January reports that an  experiment in minifarms is being expanded in Cienfuegos Province  because results have been good. There are 180 such farms in  Cienfuegos for tending cattle. Each farm has two workers only --  and sometimes their families -- who are responsible for 30 cows.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January announces that an  eight- week master class in business law and its economic and  international implications began on 31 January in Havana, under  the joint auspices of the Autonomous University of Madrid and  the University of Havana, sponsored by the Guitart hotel chain.  Gabriel Garcia, legal director of the university, explained that  ""the main objective of the course is so Spain and Cuba can  exchange legal experience and cooperate in the process of  legislative change that could eventually take place in Cuba as a  result of an increase in certain kinds of businesses, such as  the tourist business."" The course targets lawyers responsible  for negotiating foreign investments in Cuba. Garcia explains  that such a course is timely because of the ""large Spanish  investment in Cuba,"" and also because of the many other foreign  investments, since there are ""probably"" ongoing negotiations  with foreign firms that intend to set up branches in Cuba.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 January reports that Las  Tunas is attempting to increase the 300 mini-dairy farms in the  province to 1,000 in 1994 to increase milk production. Las Tunas  Province produced approximately 33 million liters of milk in  1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that Pedro  Ross said in a meeting with workers from the 14 de Julio Sugar  Mill in Cienfuegos Province that only 1,000 of the 7,000  caballerias of sugarcane scheduled for planting nationwide  between January and April have been planted to date.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 31 January reports that AIDS  patients at the sanatorium in the city of Cienfuegos will be  trained to make articles of leather and fabric. ""This activity  joins the efforts by the Ministry of Public Health and other  Cienfuegos Province institutions and organizations to  incorporate these patients into a socially useful life and  contribute to their personal fulfilment. The AIDS patients will,  through this work, cooperate in making the sanatorium  self-financing.""    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 1 Februrary reports that  Ernesto  Melendez, minister president of the State Committee for Economic  Cooperation, upon opening the fifth meeting of the regional  committee for the development of subcontracting in Latin  America, said that in the past three years, Cuba's trade with  the region rose from 7 to 30 percent.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 1 February reports the  following:    Dominica Coconut Production has donated five tons of laundry  and toilet soaps to Cuba. The firm's representative called the  donation ""another gesture of solidarity with the Cuban people  and government, which are struggling to get through the complex  moment of the special period and repercussions from the weather.""    A new France-Cuba flight has been inaugurated. The first  joint flight by the companies (OM) and Cubana de Aviacion took  place on 31 January. (Michel Taillant), the French airline's  marketing director, explains that an increase in the number of  flights between France and Cuba over the past few months led the  two companies to schedule joint flights to supplement the  regular flights of each. He adds, ""This is probably a prelude to  additional regular flights....This new airline, with a weekly  Havana-Paris-Havana flight, will develop and expand French-Cuban  tourism relations...."" Flights will leave Havana for Paris on  Sunday and return on Monday.    Pinar del Rio Province expects to harvest over 0.5 million  quintals of tomatoes from the 150 caballerias that have been  planted. Eighty percent of these tomatoes will be earmarked for  consumption in Havana and Pinar del Rio, the rest for industry  and for seeds. Workers from Pinar del Rio and from the  Revolutionary Armed Forces ""35th Anniversary of the Triumph of  the Revolution"" group are responsible for harvesting these  tomatoes.    A report from Camaguey says Cuba has begun producing hog  cholera vaccine with which to vaccinate all the nation's  livestock. Camaguey Province is a priority, under the existing  program.     "
0,FT931-7788 ,"FT931-7788 _AN-DBWBTABGFT 930223   FT  23 FEB 93 / Cuba goes to the polls today      By CANUTE JAMES      KINGSTON   CUBANS will vote tomorrow for national and provincial legislators for the first time since President Fidel Castro took power in 1959. The vote, described by the government as a step towards electoral reform, is unlikely to mollify Mr Castro's critics, who have been advocating multi-party elections. There will be only one candidate, officially approved by the Cuban Communist party, for each of the 589 seats in the National Assembly and 1,190 delegates to the provincial assemblies. The Cuban leader, however, has been using the event to deflect attention from the country's parlous economic condition. In several campaign speeches over the past fortnight he has described the election as an opportunity for Cubans to send a message of defiance to the US - to 'send a firm message to the enemies of the revolution, to the imperialists, that this is a united and strong people'. Although no candidates from dissident groups will be allowed to stand, the government is reported to be concerned at the possibility of a protest vote through a high number of blank ballots. Candidates receiving less than 50 per cent of the votes cast will be eliminated and new elections held for the post. Government officials say the vote is part of a programme of electoral reform which started in December with local government elections. All candidates then were also approved by the Communist party. President Castro has predicted that tomorrow's election will underline 'the triumph of the revolution'. He has said that Cuba's electoral system combines 'all the virtues of democracy without all the vices and corruption'. Cuba's economy has been under pressure since the break-up of the Soviet Union, once the island's main benefactor. A shortage of fuel has affected public transport and power generation, while the country has not been able to import sufficient food, medicines or agricultural chemicals. In recent months Cuban officials have repeatedly blamed the 32-year-old US economic embargo for the island's problems.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.   Industries:-  P9121 Legislative Bodies.

The breach became evident at the start of the year when Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan formed their own economic union and gained momentum this week when Kyrgyzstan joined the breakaway grouping, representing open antagonism from a region which had previously valued close ties with Moscow and even opposed the Soviet break-up. The new distaste for and worry about Moscow follow increasingly vocal demands from Russia for part of the wealth in the resource-rich Caucasus and Central Asia, particularly giant oil and natural gas deals under negotiation in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan. The demands for percentages and equity holdings in exploration and extraction contracts have been echoed by Russian nationalists such as Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky who insist on reclaiming the empire and the spoils that go with it. In loosening ties with Moscow, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan have also moved away from their two Central Asian neighbours, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, both of which have elected to remain as either economic or political satellites. Tajikistan has handed over supervision of both its security and economy to Moscow, while Turkmenistan is pursuing a course of appeasement with Moscow. Kazakhstan, which has the second-largest oil reserves in the former Soviet Union, including two of the world's 10 largest oil fields, has recently altered the tone of its statements on Russia to almost open hostility. Despite Kazakhstan's vulnerability to its northern neighbour, with an ethnic Russian population of 38 per cent, the republic's state secretary, Mr Tulebek Zhukeev, has taken the risky step of publicly denouncing Moscow's 'imperial ambitions'. Mr Zhukeev recently announced his government would charge Russia Dollars 7bn in annual rent for the Baykanur space station and two military test sites. Demonstrating the sentiment behind the pricey demands, Mr Zhukeev declared: 'This will bankrupt Russia.' The Kazakh government has reason to be upset with Russia. While demanding Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 803m) in 1993 debts to Russian state enterprises, Moscow has not paid for huge coal shipments from Kazakhstan's Karagan region. At the same time, raw material shipments from Russia have become unreliable. The Central Asian economic union is meant to co-ordinate economic, monetary and labour policy. It would create a region larger than western Europe, with a combined population of 48m but possessing as much oil and mineral wealth as some leading Gulf states. The grouping will abolish customs procedures and tariffs and co-operate on economic policies. It aims to encourage growth of trade between members. Another motive, however, is to erect a front-line defence against Moscow's growing political demands, including one that ethnic Russian citizens in Central Asia be granted dual nationality, a demand rejected by Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as an unacceptable infringement of their sovereignty. In short, the Kazakh and Uzbek leaderships want Moscow to back off. This may not be accomplished, said a senior diplomat in Tashkent, but at the least 'the union makes it easier to deal with Russia both economically and politically'.

The  first phase of maintenance of the plant in Nuevitas will be  conducted on unit No. 5, mainly in order to increase boiler  efficiency. The workers at the plant, Cuba's second in  generating capacity, plan to complete partial maintenance of the  fifth of its six generating units in less than 25 days. Workers  are preparing with minimum resources to begin an uninterrupted  24-hour schedule in what has already been described as a feat of  labor. Engineer Mario Mederos, director, stressed that this  experience will make it possible later to perform complex  maintenance on unit No. 6, which also produces 125 megawatts per  hour.

The Crimean economy has been drawn into the general economic  crisis that has gripped all the former CIS countries, but this  crisis is particularly dramatic in Russia and Ukraine.  Inflation is galloping ahead in Ukraine; it is a particular  feature of the Ukrainian economy, a particular feature of its  leadership because of specific stances taken by the leaders and  senior officials in the Council of Ministers and the bank, the  people who make these kinds of decisions.    Last year, as you know, the Russian ruble depreciated to  one-tenth of its value and the karbovanets to one-hundredth of  its value. When you have this kind of depreciation of the  currency, you get a very rapid drop in the standard of living  for workers in the public sector, first and foremost, and the  pensioners. Social tension increases sharply. The incomes of  Crimean people have diverged from, and not overtaken, those of  their neighbors across the Kerch strait, from Krasnodar Kray.  All of this has given rise to great discontent with Crimea  being part of Ukraine, to calls for Crimea to join the ruble  zone and so on.    Analysis of the situation of Crimea demonstrates, moreover,  that Crimean industry and agriculture were set up first and  foremost to trade with Russia and Crimean industrial  enterprises. Crimea has a lot of top-class enterprises that  received large sums of capital investment even in the stagnation  years and are now lying idle. These enterprises were oriented  towards trading with Russia and obtaining materials from Russia.  As economics minister, I have already had several trips to Kiev  for consultations with the leadership of Ukraine on the reforms  in Crimea. It is clear to us that any steps we might take can  only be done with the good will of Ukraine. Moreover, certain  steps were very well received by Ukraine, not well in the sense  that somebody approved these steps in themselves, but in the  sense that there was a view that these kinds of things needed to  be done in Ukraine -- in particular, currency regulation. The  fixed rate of the karbovanets is a colossal obstacle to getting  Ukraine out of crisis. And now, as far as I know, Ukraine  itself has made a decision to move to a floating exchange rate.    Crimea is a unique region in terms of its natural resources  and its geographic situation, and we certainly need bolder  economic solutions for Crimea, in my view.    [Gavrilov] That means you're saying there could be a free  economic zone set up here, like many that have been set up. I  believe such proposals have, in outline, been made?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, we have come across such projects. You  couldn't really make the whole of Crimea a free economic zone,  because these zones are set up in areas where there are open  spaces away from the inhabitants. Well, Crimea has developed  industry and developed agriculture cooperatives actively with  Ukraine and we are therefore not looking to set up a free  economic zone. We are talking about the possiblity of  implementing economic reforms more rapidly than Ukraine in the  areas of currency regulation, of having a more active program of  attracting foreign capital into Crimea. Many investors say they  would put money into Crimea, but the stability question wipes  out their intentions.    Crimea and Ukraine have a difficult relationship on the  question of allocating central credit resources to Crimea. One  could generalize and say credit allocation in Ukraine is not  quite normal and is reminiscent of Russia at the start of 1992.  All in all, everything in Ukraine reminds me of our Russian  history of two or three years ago. However, in the area of  finance and credit, Russia has made tangible steps forward in  those years and has to some extent succeeded in setting up and  stabilizing a new finance and credit system. I see that in  Russia now there is no great difference between the Central Bank  of Russia bank rate and that of commercial lending rates. In  Ukraine there is this difference.    [Gavrilov] A lot of people are now talking about the Saburov  team, Saburov's Moscow team, and you're a full member of that  team. Can you tell me, please, what this team is? Is it people  who just happen to be there or are they all people of like mind  who knew each other before?    [Chernyavskiy] This idea arose because President Yuriy  Meshkov invited Saburov in effect to be prime minister of  Crimea, and Saburov then decided to invite in several people  from Moscow to be able to implement a certain agreed policy.    [Gavrilov] Do you notice the effect that people say that  Moscow invaders are coming in to get Crimea's economy to pick  up? One hears rejoinders that ""they"" have lived in Moscow with  their offices of economists and academics.    [Chernyavskiy] Professionally, I don't personally believe  anybody is pushing me in Crimea, and it has always been the case  that there have been a lot of people in the natural sciences  coming here. If you're talking about economic centers, economic  institutions, one's own economic school, there is none of that  in Crimea.    [Gavrilov] Tell me, is it going to be hard for you and your  Moscow friends to come here and work?    [Chernyavskiy] Yes, of course, it has been quite a drastic  step and, of course, it is very difficult work. Moreover, we  have taken a very big drop in income because officials are  poorly paid in Crimea by Russian standards. For the time being  I still see my mission in Crimea as interesting.    [Gavrilov] You won't run away?    [Chernyavskiy] That's a good question. When we came to  Crimea in February, I and probably all members of the team  started to look at Crimean problems from the standpoint of  Crimea and... [broadcast of interview ends]    [Gavrilov] That was Crimean Economics Minister Andrey  Chernyavskiy.     "

These are far from  unambiguous, which is quite natural since socioeconomic  developments always have positives and negatives. The final  balance and evaluation of the consequences of emergent  tendencies are important in this matter.    The process of overcoming the total statization of the  economy and creating diverse forms and types of economic  operation has continued and largely accelerated during the  period in question. The formation of an infrastructure of a  market economy and its characteristic mechanisms has begun; the  mechanism of supply and demand has begun operating, albeit with  disruptions; the first signs of competition have appeared. The  mentality of economic cadres who are adjusting to the conditions  of an emerging market economy is changing. A new generation of  managers--educated, energetic, and free of the baggage of old  dogmas and habits--is assuming management responsibilities at  various levels of economic operations. A stratum of  entrepreneurs has been gradually evolving.    While evaluating favorably the movement toward a market  economy which has gotten underway, we should nonetheless note  the continuously growing and largely excessive ""price"" which our  society has already paid and will be forced to pay for the  selected strategy and tactics of transition to a market economy.    The scale of the current crisis, which has increased as a  result of ""shock therapy"" and its internal structure, is  affecting the accomplishment of social tasks in a particularly  painful manner and is fraught with the irreversible destruction  of the economic and scientific-technical potential of the  country.    In the last two years alone the fall in production on key  macroindicators came to about 30 percent, and compared to the  precrisis level, approximated 40 percent. It is important to  stress that, first, the drop in production is of a universal  rather than structural nature and second, it has affected the  most progressive and high-technology industries and types of  production to the greatest degree.    The ideologists of ""shock treatment"" view the consequences  of  the production slump quite flippantly; they believe it to be  temporary and easy to make up. To make this more convincing,  references are made to historical experience whereby the country  restored its past might within relatively short periods of time  following tremendous destruction and losses (as a result of the  civil war and the Great Patriotic War).    The following must be said in conjunction with this:    First. Under current conditions, declines in the  volume of production mean the loss of markets, and not only the  world market (for example, in the aerospace industry, in the  production of armaments, etc.) but also the domestic market.  There is no such thing as a vacuum in this area. Having once  yielded positions on the market, it is extremely difficult to  regain that niche. In other words, the process may turn out to  be irreversible.    Second. Historical analogies are hardly convincing  in this case. The time when it was possible to restore the  economy with the help of the shovel and the hoe, drawing on mass  enthusiasm or coercion of the population, is gone for good. In  the modern world, this may only be accomplished by drawing on  state-of-the-art equipment, technology, and organization of  production. Having missed this opportunity, the country could  inevitably be doomed to protracted or perhaps eternal  backwardness.    A slump in investment activity is the most profound and  dangerous in terms of its socioeconomic consequences. In the  last two years alone the volume of investment in the Russian  economy fell by a factor of more than two, and now comes to  about 40 percent of the precrisis level.    Not only structural changes but even the elementary growth  of  production is impossible given this volume. However, the problem  is more profound and complex. The amortization of fixed  production assets has already come close to 60 percent, i.e.,  the threshold beyond which the physical destruction of the  production potential of the country begins. Our society has  become a witness to a growing danger of accidents and disasters.    The mounting crisis has affected the scientific sphere  (including basic and sectoral research, design and development  activities, and trial and experimental production). First-rate,  world-level collectives are falling apart before our eyes;  leadership status on a number of avenues for  scientific-technical progress is being lost; physical facilities  are becoming hopelessly obsolete.    The country is losing its intellectual potential, and  together with it--hope for the rebirth and prosperity of Russia.    Inconsistent and on occasion impulsive actions of the  government and the Central Bank of Russia, the absence of a  clear-cut and well-conceived financial strategy, and the  selection of financial stabilization measures which were not in  line with the actually emerging conditions have produced  extremely unfavorable results.    Disorganization of the financial system and loss of control  over monetary circulation is one of the results of the policy of  ""shock therapy"" and the methods of its implementation. In two  years there has been no success in normalizing the budget  system, despite attracting enormous credit from the Central Bank  and artificially withdrawing monies from the Pension Fund to  cover the deficit. The payments crisis which was caused by  ill-conceived actions and the inability to ensure the normal  intake of taxes merely undermined the revenue base of the budget  and caused a chronic budget deficit.    The financial system of the national economy as a whole is  facing the most difficult situation (including the financial  situation of enterprises and regions). Fixed assets are being  systematically ""eaten away."" Amortization has lost the feature  of being one of the most significant and most reliable sources  of investment and is not in a position to ensure even the simple  reproduction of fixed assets. The number of unprofitable  enterprises and those with slim profit margins is growing.    The payments crisis, or the breakdown of payments relations  on an unprecedented scale, began against the background of a  campaign to liberalize prices and tighten budgetary and credit  policies. Initially it was accompanied by reductions in the  volume of production; by the end of 1993 it had acquired new  features and manifested itself as a mass stoppage of enterprises  (including giant enterprises) which was not associated with the  bankruptcy procedure.    The government extensively used emission to carry out its  populist statements and as a drug of sorts for ""emboldening""  production. During the last two years the government has been  the main borrower of funds from the Central Bank. The issuance  of state short-term bonds which got underway covers merely 2  percent of the deficit of the consolidated budget; the bulk of  the deficit is still financed out of Central Bank credit (at the  preferential rate of 10 percent).    The emission of cash increased from 1.5 trillion rubles [R]  in 1992 to R10.1 trillion in 1993, and its proportion in the  total money supply increased from 24 to 37 percent. Virtually  all cash put into circulation last year was retained by the  population or services the nonbank circulation of resources.    The disorganization of the financial system, the ""war of the  budgets"" between the center and many regions, the payments  crisis, and the uncontrolled emission all testify to the loss of  state control over monetary circulation.    The growth of inflation which was triggered by the  liberalization of prices has not stopped in two years. In 1993  the average monthly rate of inflation was even higher than in  the previous year (if we omit the January ""surge"" in 1992). The  failure to combat inflation is explained by a failure to  understand its nature in the economy of Russia (underestimating  its highly monopolized structure, ignoring the factor of cost  inflation, and so on), and correspondingly opting for  inadequate, purely monetarist means to contain it by way of  demand constraints.    All of the above makes it possible to conclude that the hope  for financial stabilization without overcoming the slump in  production is turning out to be illusory and theoretically  unsound.    During the last two years, privatization has been the most  apparent sphere of institutional changes in the Russian economy.  It has been advanced the farthest in the trade sector, public  catering, and the service sector. By the end of 1993, nonstate  trade enterprises accounted for three-quarters of retail sales.  The process of ""large-scale"" privatization in industry has  begun. The reregistration of kolkhozes and sovkhozes has  virtually ended; companies of various types have been formed;  the farmer-owner sector has been emerging, albeit at a  decreasing rate.    The course and consequences of privatization have been far  from unambiguous. Its positives include first of all the  destruction of the total statization of the economy and the  emergence of a growing stratum of quite energetic real owners.  The value system and behavioral motivation of a significant  proportion of the population have been gradually changing with  the appearance of a securities market. At the same time,  privatization has not brought about the inflow of investment,  and has not noticeably influenced improvements in effectiveness.  In a number of cases, technological connections were disrupted  unnecessarily.    The unfavorable consequences were largely due to the failure  to think through privatization itself and haste in carrying it  out. Administrative pressure and the monotony of the forms of  privatization (orientation exclusively toward the creation of  publicly held joint-stock companies) have remained; no reliable  legal foundation has been laid. The issuance of vouchers did not  ensure the popular nature of privatization, as proclaimed by its  ideologists; a drop in the value of vouchers in real terms and  their concentration in a small number of investment funds are  fraught with not only the further stratification of society, but  also the growth of social tension. Warnings and recommendations  found in the previous report of the RAN [Russian Academy of  Sciences] Economics Division and the Reform International  Foundation have not been taken into account.    The concept of the abandonment of regulation of economic and  social processes by the state has led to the universal loss of  manageability. World experience in state regulation, especially  in countries with socially oriented market economies, has been  completely ignored. The special role of the state characteristic  of transitional stages of social development has not been taken  into account.    As a result, a vacuum of state regulation has developed,  which is being filled with increasing vigor through, on one  hand, the growth of narrow-group and regional-separatist  interests and the plain plundering of national wealth, and on  the other hand, the real and equally dangerous restoration of  authoritarianism camouflaged by pseudodemocratic slogans.    The breakdown of existing state government structures which  has far outstripped the creation of new, modern forms of  government and regulation has brought about the disruption of  vertical and horizontal economic relations and technological  interaction. Control has been lost over prices and incomes, and  the distribution and redistribution of material and financial  resources.    The results of the implementation of the monetarist policy  and the withdrawal of the state from regulating economic and  social processes as a component of this policy have indicated  the theoretical and practical unsoundness of the course chosen.    The depletion of social resources for the continuation of  ""shock therapy"" is an alarming outcome of the implementation of  this policy over two years. A drop in the real income of the  population by a factor of more than two accompanied by a sharply  growing differentiation in incomes has aggravated the social  situation in the country. At present, the incomes of 10 percent  of the most affluent citizens exceed the income of the same  proportion of the least affluent citizens by a factor of 10.  One-third of the population have an income below the official  subsistence minimum, and 10 percent of the population, or about  15 million people, are below the threshold of physical survival.  This is a signal that society is entering a social conflict zone.    It should be stressed that this is not just about  quantitative indicators. Profound qualitative changes have  occurred in the last two years; trends have emerged which  indicate a looming threat to the genetic pool of Russian  society. The process of depopulation of the populace has begun,  with the growing death rate due to a considerable degree to  alcoholism, murder, and suicide. The population has been sharply  marginalized; the number of beggars, vagrants, alcoholics, and  drug addicts has been growing. The quality of the ""human  material"" is deteriorating at quite high rates (immunity against  mass diseases has been declining; prostitution, venereal  disease, and births of impaired children are on the rise).    The moral pillars of society, social values and ideals,  personal and family hopes which have always made it possible to  survive what appeared to be temporary adversity, are crumbling.  Crime is growing and becoming more arrogant; mafia groups  proliferate. Bribery, extortion, and embezzlement have become  massive and no longer cause protest or condemnation by the  government.    All the above makes it possible to say that the social price  paid by our society for ""shock therapy"" has exceeded the maximum  permissible limits.    The scale of the economic and social calamities that have  befallen Russia poses a real threat to its national security.  The country has ended up at a dangerous threshold, on crossing  which it may face the risk of forever losing the chance to be  reborn as a superpower.    Such is the outcome of the two years of the ""shock therapy""  policy.    The most radical reformers justify in every way the  destruction and sacrifices as unavoidable costs associated with  fundamental changes in the existing political, social, and  economic system and the ""return"" of Russia to the ranks of  civilized countries. On the contrary, the RAN Economics Division  and the Reform International Foundation are convinced that:    --no objective, up to the promise of a new variant of ""the  bright future,"" can justify the social sacrifices which Russian  society has made and to which it is inevitably doomed in the  event that the chosen course is continued. A different approach  is immoral and inhumane;    --the society that is actually emerging in Russia today is  far removed from the models existing in countries with highly  effective and socially oriented market economies. It amounts, to  a greater degree, to a society based on excessive  property-related stratification, corruption, organized crime,  and external dependency. From the socioeconomic standpoint, this  is not taking a step forward but rather setting the country back  two centuries, to the era of primitive, ""barbaric"" capitalism;    --all programs for the renewal of Russia and its  socioeconomic structure may have a chance at success only if  they take into account, along with worldwide tendencies, the  originality of Russia, the peculiarities of its history and  culture, the spiritual stance of the population, and the  requisite value system. Russia does not need to return to world  civilization--it has always belonged to it, and belongs to it  now as an irreproducible type of a structure of civilization.    * * *    An analysis of the course of the reform and the outcome of  the socioeconomic development of Russia in the last two years  makes it possible to draw a number of conclusions.    First. A deep crisis and social calamities are not  the result of unsolved problems that had piled up in the past,  isolated miscalculations, or the resistance of conservative  forces (although all these have also occurred), but rather an  unavoidable consequence of the chosen course of the reform and  the methods used to carry it out.    Attempts to solve all problems with a ""single leap"" or a  ""cavalry charge"" were not dictated by sober scientific  calculations but rather by impatience and political ambitions.  Contrary to the assertions of its initiators, this course was  and is extremely idealized, and is being implemented by  neo-Bolshevik methods.    Second. Having experienced the failure of the  chosen course of economic policy at the very first steps of its  implementation, the originators of ""shock therapy"" did not learn  a lesson but continued to stubbornly insist on staying the  course. This only further exacerbated the situation and burdened  the population with new hardships.    To cover up their fiasco, the reformers who were in power  went about systematically misinforming the public and distorting  the picture of the genuine situation in the economy and the life  of the people.    Third. From the very beginning, an erroneous  orientation toward the decisive role of foreign aid was adopted,  and internal sources for stimulating business, especially  investment activities, were not put to use. It became clear  quite soon that this was a major miscalculation. Under no  circumstances can the meager amount of this continuously  promised aid seriously influence the results of transformations  in Russia. However, no major adjustments in the area of economic  policy were made after that, either.    Fourth. A claim to infallibility, to knowing the  absolute truth, has been at the root of many mistakes that have  been allowed to occur and the reluctance to change the course of  economic policy even after its complete unsoundness was  revealed. Hence the reluctance to heed criticism and the  aspiration to paint such criticism as allegedly originating from  the ""enemies of reform."" The notion of the absence of  alternatives to the strategy and tactics of reform  implementation chosen by the authors of ""shock therapy,"" rather  than the reform as such, has been persistently foisted on public  opinion.    It appears strange, but it looks as though some political  leaders both in Russia and in the West have seriously come to  believe that any change in the chosen course of economic reform  means a rollback, a return to the administrative-command system.  The belief in one's own infallibility is a nourishing medium for  deliberately refusing to seek national accord.    Fifth. The unprofessionalism of the authors and  champions of the ""shock therapy"" course has now become obvious.  It is manifested in a lack of knowledge of the realities of  Russia and the mentality of the nations populating it, a choice  of reform methods which are not adequate for these conditions,  and egregious miscalculations in projecting the economic and  social consequences of the measures taken.    Society has encountered a new variety of subjective and  willful approaches to the development and implementation of  economic policy, and in the policy itself--clearly expressed  ideological attachments.    During the entire period the government has evaded a  discussion of the fundamental problems of socioeconomic policy  with leading Russian economic scientists and representatives of  progressive parties, movements, and public organizations.    The ""shock therapy"" course has always been criticized in a  sharp and well-argued manner. However, we must honestly admit  that for a long time this course enjoyed quite extensive support  from the population, which attached their hopes and expectations  to it.    However, a qualitative turnaround in public mood occurred at  the end of 1993. In the December elections, people resolutely  came out against experiments associated with ""shock therapy.""  Only 8 percent of the voters came out in favor of the Russia's  Choice bloc, whose leaders personify the ideologists and  champions of this course. To continue this course in the future  means to act against the clearly stated will of the people.    What could such attempts bring about? On one hand, they  could  bring about the further exacerbation of the economic crisis and  the worsening of social tensions in society. On the other hand,  nostalgia for ""the good old times"" and the restorationist mood,  which are quite dangerous for reforms in the Russian economy,  will mount.    The RAN Economics Division and the Reform International  Foundation believe that, in the name of rejuvenating Russia as a  superpower, it is necessary to evaluate the results of the past  two years critically and honestly and to work out a new strategy  for socioeconomic transformations.

The fact that  485,000 grass-roots leaders are the first to receive training to  better organize discussions at work centers reflects the labor  leadership's interest in [words indistinct]. Workers will voice  their opinions on the viability of planned economic measures at  open and democratic assemblies. The implementation of such  measures or others has been postponed until a national consensus  is reached.    In recent years, the population has created an excess cash  flow that amounts to 10 billion pesos because of a smaller  product supply. This resulted in a lack of motivation, work  inefficiency, and a thriving black market.    In addition, the state operated with a budget deficit  estimated at 4.2 billion pesos by late 1993 because expenditures  exceeded treasury revenues. The financing of education, health,  and social security increased the budget deficit because Cuba  did not have access to international loans.    Cuban workers, therefore, will voice their opinions on the  best ways to reorganize national finances, such as the  possibility of establishing a tax system and reducing or  eliminating subsidies for family basket products and channeling  those funds to people who have lower incomes.    At union assemblies supported by their leadership, Cuban  workers will suggest ways to face current irregularities, such  as the fraudulent accumulation of personal wealth. Cuban unions  will also discuss the fact that certain workers are not working  as efficiently as their positions require. Meanwhile, there are  people who reach legal employment age but turn down job offers  because they think such jobs do not match their educational  level.    Cuban unions will also discuss costs, profitability,  efficiency, and productivity at these meetings, which seek to  become another forum for collective reflection, just as the  Cuban parliament already is.

Thousands of persons participated in the ceremony, including  several members of the Cuban leadership, with the obvious  exception of Fidel and his brother, Raul Castro, who is the  first vice president of the Council of Ministers and Minister of  the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (FAR).    Such absences, particularly that of the chief of state,  caused surprise. Especially when some of Fidel Castro's  bodyguards were seen taking up positions in Ciudad Libertad,  formerly Columbia camp, which was the general headquarters of  the troops of Dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was defeated by  the Castroite guerrillas on 1 January 1959.    The media and government have thus far refrained from  explaining the absence. Some observers attributed it to the  fact that Castro delivered a speech last 1 January in Santiago  de Cuba (east) commemorating the revolutionary triumph.    On that occasion Castro reiterated his willingness to keep  Cuba on the socialist path and expressed his confidence for 1994  following the ""most difficult year"" ever experienced by the  regime since its emergence.    The Cuban revolution celebrates 1 January as the day when  Cubans began the year 1959 without Batista, who fled on 31  December for Santo Domingo. The guerrilla columns entered  Havana and Santiago the following day, 2 January, after the last  cells of military resistance surrendered.    Only Juan Contino, first secretary of the Union of Communist  Youths (UJC), spoke at the commemorative ceremony and insisted  on persevering in the socialist path.    Over the past few days Castro's epic event has been widely  commented on by the press, which has insistently cited a phrase  by the Cuban leader that is currently applicable: ""Let's not  fool ourselves into thinking that everything will be easier from  now on. Perhaps everything will be more difficult.""     "

A few days ago, the bodies of six Haitians -- including  those  of two children -- who arrived in Florida on rickety boats were  cast into the sea; meanwhile, a group of Cubans obtained asylum  easily. [sentence as heard]    Is this a typical aspect of U.S. immigration policy? At the  end of the 1960's, the U.S. Congress passed a law providing for  preferential treatment for Cubans. Despite the intensive  pressuring by Cuban-Americans, more than a few in Washington  question that law.    What is happening and what people are not realizing,  however,  is that many of those who have obtained residency under this  law, claiming that they could not return to Cuba for fear of  Fidel Castro, are now visiting Cuba.    There are many examples of this biased immigration policy. A  few months ago television stations throughout the world were  showing images of Haitians and denouncing their deportation from  the naval base at Guantanamo. Meanwhile, Cubans arriving at that  same place by swimming or crossing minefields are automatically  granted asylum.    In the light of these examples, Cuba seems to be more  dangerous to Washington than is Haiti. Are there reasons a Cuban  deserves U.S. residency more than a Haitian? The United States'  refusal to grant a number of visas to Cuban citizens annually is  what encourages the illegal departures from Cuba. So far, the  U.S. Government has maintained that the policy of repatriating  the Haitians is necessary to prevent many of them from dying on  the high seas.    The other side of the coin is quite different, however. As  you can see, internationally, there are attempts to present  Haiti solely as a land of emigrants who flee in rickety boats.  Less publicized are the struggles for economic power. The  wealthy are apparently linked to the military who destroyed  Haiti's institutions; but the truth is that they see their  future as being in jeopardy.    Many businessmen have gone bankrupt because of the  international sanctions, the black market, and drug trafficking,  which is in the hands of the military chiefs, in collusion with  the CIA and the Pentagon.    The rich, made up mainly of mulattos and whites and with a  mentality similar to that of the Afrikaners in South Africa, are  worried about the resurgence of the Tonton Macoutes, a  paramilitary group made up mostly of blacks. However, the  Haitian elite fears a popular uprising more than anything else,  because such an uprising could ruin everything. For this reason,  the members of this elite reject the return to democracy that  would curtail their privileges, and for this reason they close  their eyes to the murder of fellow citizens or to the  progressive disintegration of Haiti.

During the debate on renting and the illegal sale of  vehicles  and homes at the special session of the Cuban parliament, the  chief of state called for corrective economic measures, noting  that they are more effective than prison terms. In addition,  the corrective economic measures increase rather than diminish  state resources.    During a discussion of the issue, it was reported that fraud  and misdemeanors have been committed in contracts to rent  [permutar] and sell homes as well as to transfer automobiles.    In a previous speech, the Cuban maximum leader favored  salary  revaluations for workers and for those who make an honest living.    Fidel Castro said: We are not solving an economic imbalance,  we are considering what to do and when to do it.    He made a call to adopt such measures with political,  technical, and revolutionary sense until the final consequences.  He refused to take half measures.    He also favored gradual implementation of the measures, as  did Jose Luis Rodriguez, finance and prices minister, who said  the measures will go into effect in at least 18 months.    A change of currency is among the measures being studied by  the parliament, and there is a consensus to implement it at such  time as the government deems appropriate.

Camaguey  was able to host this meeting as a result of having obtained,  for seven consecutive years, first place in the emulative  competition of the Eastern Army's naval command and the zone of  operations in question. The exercise showed that the people of  Camaguey are capable of thwarting any enemy action against our  coasts.     "

Commander in Chief Fidel Castro  was honoring an invitation made to him and representatives from  another 188 nations to witness the triumph of the first  multiracial elections, the disappearance of racism, and the  establishment of the first South African Government of national  unity.    Prior to his arrival in South Africa, the Cuban president  and  his delegation made a technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, where  the highest leader of the Cuban Revolution held a friendly  conversation with President Jerry John Rawlings. The two leaders  conversed on many topics, but mostly on the ANC and the triumph  of the electoral process in South Africa.    In Pretoria on the morning of 10 May, mankind witnessed a  political change unprecedented in that nation's history. The  main news agencies of the world broadcast for more than 2  billion television viewers the most relevant historic event for  the public opinion in the course of those 24 hours. Present were  5,000 invited personalities, 140 governmental delegations, 40 of  them represented by heads of state and government. Nelson  Mandela was sworn in for a five-year term. In taking over the  destiny of South Africa, he stated to the world: We are  committed to establishing a true and lasting peace, a society of  which we can feel proud where all South Africans, Blacks and  Whites, can live without fear for each other.    In that context, Fidel Castro dialogued with many heads of  state and distinguished political figures such as Jose Eduardo  dos Santos, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Robert  Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Frederik de Klerk, John Rawlings, Yasir  'Arafat, meeting with a total of 30 personalities.    At the seat of government in Pretoria, on the morning of 11  May, Fidel Castro, the president of Councils of State and of  Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, held official talks with  South African President Nelson Mandela.    [Begin recording] [Mandela, in English with superimposed  translation into Spanish] Thank you very much. (?We need you.)    [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into  English] Please convey my greetings to Mr. De Klerk.    [Mandela, in English with superimposed translation into  Spanish] Thank you very much, I will do that.    [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into  English] We have witnessed the death of apartheid and the birth  of freedom. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the  unity of the South African people from all sectors and all  ethnic backgrounds, and no one can imagine how many were saying  that the process continues to evolve in that direction. [end  recording]    On the morning of 12 May, new South African Foreign Minister  (Alsen Sock) and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  officially established diplomatic relations between the two  countries. Hours later, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made  remarks to the South African Broadcasting Company, one of the  stations with greatest repercussions on the national public  opinion.    [Begin recording] [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed  translation into English] I will say this categorically: These  have been extraordinary impressions. South Africa was for me a  mysterious country and I have found an extraordinary country in  all senses. [end recording]    After concluding his visit to South Africa, Cuban President  Fidel Castro and the delegation that accompanied him made a  brief stop in the Brazilian state of Salvador de Bahia. On his  arrival the commander in chief was met by Bahia Governor Antonio  Inva Say. Fidel also met with former Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes and local authorities.    Prior to his departure, Fidel answered the questions of  Brazilian reporters interested in his visit:    [Begin recording, in Spanish with superimposed translation  into Portuguese] [First unidentified reporter] What is Cuba  doing to break the economic embargo?    [Castro] We are making all kinds of effort. We are working  in  the international sphere, at the United Nations, and in all the  organizations. We promote solidarity. We try whatever is in our  reach. There is a movement against the blockade that is gaining  momentum in the United States. The immense majority of the  countries in the United Nations condemn the blockade. Only two  or three nations support the blockade. Meanwhile, the blockade  has to be fought with deeds. With the efforts for the  development of the country, the financial restructuring, and in  the difficult circumstances, we also had to adapt ourselves to  the collapse of the socialist bloc of the USSR which represented  80 percent of our trade.    The embargo has [words indistinct] our fighting spirit and  resistance. I believe that no other country would have been able  to resist what Cuba has resisted. Cuba resists, and it will  continue to resist. In the long run, we will be worthy of the  victory.    [Second unidentified reporter] In the United States,  presidential candidate Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva called for the  end of the blockade on Cuba. How do you see the position taken  by Lula?    [Castro] I greatly appreciate his position. He has always  held that position, as have many other political leaders.  Generally all the progressive and democratic forces of the world  oppose the blockade and that number continues to grow.    [Second unidentified reporter] What are the expectations for  and what is the new economic plan to be implemented in Cuba?    [Castro] Well, it is not a new economic plan. This new plan  has a series of measures. We are already developing our [words  indistinct] adjusted to the conditions of the world we live in,  which is hegemonized by the United States, without giving up our  ideals, concepts, or the achievements of socialism. We are  trying to adapt our economic work to the reality of the world we  live in. Many are the things that we are doing, without shock  policies and without haste. Just recently, the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP] approved a series of measures  of principles designed to stabilize internal finances, one of  the many problems we are facing.    [Third unidentified reporter] What changes, under these  measures that were approved by the ANPP?    [Castro] Excess currency is reduced. [words indistinct] Cuba  has done many things. I believe that the things Cuba has done  can compete in quality and in democratic spirit with those  things that have been done in many countries around the world.  Because in our country it is not the party that nominates, but  the people. In other words, in our country there are  (?thousands) of parties. Each citizen has the right to nominate  candidates and has the right to elect them. But since we do not  have media multinationals, we cannot make our ideas known.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] What motivated you to make a  second visit to Brazil?    [Castro] Many things. Let us say that it is geography. It is  a big country in the southern hemisphere, at the world  crossroads, a place through which one must pass. That is one  reason. Another reason is that it is a friendly nation. A third  is that it is a hospitable country. Fourth, it is a country we  esteem. Fifth, I feel very happy every time I come here. Sixth,  because relations between Brazil and Cuba improve everyday.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] Why Bahia?    [Castro] Because it is on my way. If I am going to Europe,  for example, I cannot go through the Antarctic. I have to go  direct to Madrid or Paris. It is an ideal stopover from the  geographic point of view. From the friendly point of view, I  know Bahia [words indistinct] We have many friends here who  always receive us with affection.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] Do you have another meeting  when you leave here?    [Castro] Yes, when I leave here I will have a meeting with  Morpheus. [chuckles]    [Fifth unidentified reporter] Will you visit the city?    [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from  Cuba for over a week.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] At what time are you leaving?    [Castro] That is a military secret. [laughs] Probably,  tomorrow morning. We must leave either in the morning or in the  evening, depending on the weather. [end recording]    Yesterday afternoon [12 May], the commander in chief arrived  in Havana after a tour that included Barbados, on the occasion  of the first global conference for the sustainable development  of insular states; a technical stop in Ghana; the presence of  Cuba at Nelson Mandela's inaugural ceremony in South Africa; and  a brief stop in Salvador de Bahia.

On this occasion, the drug destroyed was part of shipments lost  by international drug traffickers in their illegal operations  near the Cuban archipelago. This situation has, on different  occasions, even led to arrests, trials, and sanctions by local  courts.    In fact, the Cuban Government's organization of the fight  against drugs dates back many years and is even coordinated with  international organizations and other countries interested in  the topic.    Not even U.S. administrations, which Cuba has accused of  politicizing the issue and using it as a weapon in its  traditional conflict with the island, have been excluded from  the cooperation Havana has proposed and is implementing to deal  hard blows to drug traffickers.    A glance at the past reveals an interesting and important  balance regarding Cuba's war on drugs.    In 1992, for example, Cubans seized 1,647.91 kg of cocaine  and 2,000 kg of marijuana, captured three boats, and held 12  drug traffickers, who were remanded to the courts.    In June of that same year, a national commission to combat  drugs was created, comprised of representatives from the  Justice, Interior, Foreign Relations, and Public Health  Ministries, the Attorney General's Office, and General Customs.  An earlier UN report cited Cuba among the top 10 countries of  the continent in seizing cocaine and marijuana. An important  thing about Cuba is that it does not produce or consume drugs.    In January 1993, the courts sentenced five U.S. drug  traffickers for possession of drugs and illegal entry in Cuba,  following contacts with U.S. authorities and the exchange of  information on the matter. In May of last year, Cuban ovens  incinerated almost 200 kg of cocaine found in bags that had  drifted onto central Camaguey Province coasts as a result of  illegal operations conducted in nearby waters.    In June 1993, authorities burned another 400 kg of drugs  that  had also drifted here through the northern keys in Camaguey and  Ciego de Avila Provinces. In the same month, 2.5 tons  confiscated from different points in Cuba were incinerated.    Last November, 10 foreigners and Cubans were tried and  sentenced. They had been arrested when a specialized corps  dismantled an entire network of drug traffickers, who used the  island as a transshipment point for drugs sent from Colombia to  Germany.    In a declaration by Gerd Merrem, director of the UN program  for international control on drugs, the United Nations  recognized Cuba's participation in the international effort  against the drug scourge.    Merren praised the efficiency of Cuban authorities in  combating drug trafficking, and he mentioned that the developed  long-standing cooperation has left a deep mark because of the  sincerity and professionalism of experts devoted to this task.

The  newspaper claims it was the victim of a obscure intended set-up,  the mastermind and objective of which still have not been  identified.

Vilma Nunez, president of Codehuca and of the Nicaraguan  Human Rights Center, has traveled to Geneva to participate in UN  Human Rights Commission sessions to expound on the current  situation of those rights in the Central American region.    Nunez discussed this and other related issues with Radio  Havana Cuba.    [Begin Nunez recording] With regard to the human rights  situation, there exists what we might call a news embargo at the  international level. The international media are telling the  world that there is peace in Central America and that human  rights are not being violated, but this is not true. Human  rights violations remain part of the official policy of many  governments. There are other cases. For example, in Nicaragua,  Panama, and Costa Rica, neoliberal policies are pushing our  people into poverty. This is taking place as part of a pattern  of economic repression. The implementation of this policy,  whether speaking in practical terms or in terms of human rights,  comprises a systematic violation of economic and social rights.  Neoliberal policies are pushing most of our people into  poverty. [end recording]    One of Codehuca's strategic objectives is to mobilize its  nongovernment member-organizations in defense of the Cuban  people's self-determination and sovereign rights.    [Begin Nunez recording] We have asked nongovernment  organizations that have the opportunity to speak at  international forums, and particularly at the United Nations, to  try to denounce the blockade as the main source of human rights  violations in Cuba. Cuba is the only Latin American nation that  has been able to produce specific achievements in the field of  economic and social rights. This must be recognized and firmly  pointed out. This is what we are promoting. We are also  looking for ways to promote standard international laws and  human rights in order that third-party countries may be  considered violators of human rights in other nations.    Governments violate the human rights of the people in their  own countries. In terms of the law, it is unimaginable that a  foreign country be allowed to violate the rights of people in  another country, but in this case we find that the Cuban  people's limitations and the deterioration of their health and  educational services are not the product of the will of the  Cuban Government but, rather, the result of an action by an  arrogant government -- namely, the United States. We want to  find legal mechanisms in order that the U.S. Government may be  condemned as a human rights violator. Through its actions, this  government is not only violating Cuba's right to sovereignty and  self-determination, it is acting against 11 million Cubans.  [end recording]    At the end of the interview, Vilma Nunez spoke about what  she  has seen in Cuba.    [Begin Nunez recording] I have been able to see first-hand  that the situation is difficult. I have also seen, however,  that although the people sometimes appear to be tired, the  majority of them are optimistic and dedicated to continuing  their struggle. It is painful to be continually asked to  continue struggling. In Nicaragua, we sometimes go through this  experience. We are always being asked to continue struggling,  but not to be discouraged. This is what we are telling the  Cuban people: Do not be discouraged. Things have to change. We  have to find ways to change things. They must realize that they  have a responsibility, not only to their own future generations,  to their own children, and their own grandchildren, but also  because Cuba remains the only hope for the free people of  America.

However, the  second congress of commodity producers of the country, which was  held in Krasnoyarsk, did more than just confirm it. Read the  article on page 2.    It appeared that it would be difficult for delegates to the  congress to avoid the temptation of getting embroiled in  political battles there. The situation in the country has become  too complicated, too ""hot."" However, the following appeal came  in the very first words spoken by Yu. Skokov, chairman of the  organizational committee for conducting the congress, which was  attended by representatives from 41 regions of Russia and eight  federation-wide delegations: Enough of finding out who is ""Red""  in the audience and in the country, and who is not quite ""Red,""  and of finding out what should be demanded first of all from the  powers that be. Russia has come to the point beyond which there  may only lie a national catastrophe. The domestic production of  commodities is the last stronghold, the last bastion of the  state.    Before the congress, documents were handed out to the  delegates, of which one deserves the closest attention. It is  ""The State of the Economy of Russia (Analysis and Projection)""  prepared by the analysts of the Federation of Public  Associations of Commodity Producers of the country. It differed  greatly from government assessments which have been voiced  recently. For example, the decline in production in the year now  ending has exceeded the planned level by more than a factor of  two, and has been only slightly smaller than that of last year.  Investment in the production assets, which had been weakened to  begin with, continued to decline. Millions of people live below  the poverty line. Specialist-analysts estimate that this year  alone, $12 billion-$15 billion have been taken out of the  country both legally and illegally. A paradoxical situation  occurs: on the one hand, the stabilization of exports has been  registered, with imports falling by a factor of two; the  positive balance of foreign trade may reach $23 billion. On the  other hand, the foreign debt of Russia continues to grow: Russia  is not in a position to discharge even the reduced debt payments  (reduced by agreement with Western creditors).    Yu. Skokov built on this analysis in his report at the  congress: ""Against the background of steady cutbacks in  production in virtually all sectors, zones have emerged in which  the slump has become particularly threatening. For example, the  reduction comes to about 50 percent in electrical engineering,  instrument making, machine-tool production, and light industry.  It is not reforms in the economy that are under way, but rather  the destruction of national commodity production. However, the  state and society must understand that by destroying the  domestic commodity producer, they are destroying themselves.""    Similar assessments, even more sharply worded than Skokov's,  were voiced in presentations ""from the field"" made by the  largest industrialists of the country: managers of the  standard-bearing enterprises of the domestic machine building,  metallurgy, and the mining industry....    ""I have rubbed shoulders with all reformers in Russia, up to  the president of the country. I queried everywhere: Are we  moving on the course that we want? However, all I heard in  response was: There is no alternative to the program of reforms  being implemented. To what program, who has seen it? Chubays  came to us in Omsk, and also said: Is this not  stabilization--credit is not being taken out at banks, there are  no lines in stores, the exchange rate of the dollar is not  changing.... However, the best stabilization is when everything  is at the zero mark--both consumption and production. This only  happens at a cemetery."" (This is from a presentation by a  representative of the Omsk delegation).    This is an excerpt from another presentation, that by a  representative of commodity producers from Yekaterinburg, the  native city of the Russian president: ""We are being deliberately  and very expertly destroyed. I recently met Gaydar in  Cheboksary. He was surprised: How come, are you still in  operation? I thought that you had shut down already.... They,  the present-day reformers, indeed miscalculated: they did not  take into account the survivability of the director community,  its ability to resist the deindustrialization of the country.  Could it be that the time has really come for us to `help' the  government? For example, if the volume of production at an  enterprise falls 50 percent, half the people are thrown out into  the street. Let them appeal to the reformers then rather than to  us, and complain about a drop in the standard of living and  delays in the payment of wages....""    A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, stressed in his presentation to the congress  in particular: ""The fact of fragmentation of the industrialists  of the country, their splintering based on narrow corporate  interests, deserves to be condemned. Here is Gaydar creating his  association of private business which, for example, such  domestic giants as the Uralmash also joined. Why? Who would not  sell out for easy credit, for weighty sops from the boss? There  is the notorious Shumeyko, organizing his so-called  confederation of entrepreneurs of Russia, which nobody in the  Russian `backwaters' has got the foggiest notion about.  Apparently, it was also organized so that the branch of this  confederation in the United States could be headed by people who  are not strangers to Shumeyko--his daughter and son-in-law.  Gentlemen reformers, are you not something else? Meanwhile, here  we are wondering and wracking our brains over this issue: How  come the confused Russian people voted for Zhirinovskiy? As  always, we are looking for `scapegoats'--the press, television,  the absence of funds.... Who were the people to vote for? One  may have his hopes dashed, one may engage in wishful thinking,  finally, one may believe in yet another vain dream. Nobody has  ever succeeded in deceiving 100 million people all at  once--ever!""    I sat in the overcrowded auditorium of the Palace of Culture  of the metallurgical plant, in which the congress was held, and  could not help thinking: Who needed this--the destruction and  the virtual bringing to its knees of the domestic economy? Just  the way it was seven and a half decades ago. At that time,  Russia was also getting on its feet and growing stronger every  year--there were Putilov's enterprises, Morozov's textile mills,  and Tereshchenko's plants.... The Russian people have built all  kinds of things, having received the desired sip of freedom! Was  this not the foundation upon which it was possible to move ahead  quickly, turning the country into a truly prosperous region?    I would be less than truthful if I maintained that the  entire  two days of the proceedings of the congress in Krasnoyarsk were  devoted solely to the assessment and analysis of the situation  that has emerged in domestic commodity production. A proposal  was made in virtually each presentation at the congress: What  should be done in order to save the economy from ultimate  destruction, in order to save Russia?    Speaking at the congress, Arkadiy Volskiy responded to a  question with another question: ""What did Roosevelt begin with  when he came to power? He immediately closed down all banks that  existed in the country. Only one-third of them were reopened as  long as two weeks later after auditing. Incidentally, they  operate in the United States to this day.""    In Volskiy's opinion, the industrialists of the country need  their own political organization; the last election proved this.  Russia should be led by people who have a vested interest in its  prosperity.    However, there were other ""points of view"": For example, in  the opinion of A. Stepanov, chief of the Teplovodokanal  administration of the Vorkutaugol production association, the  creation of such a party is an issue for the remote future.  Right now they should immediately embark on utilizing the  potential of deputies elected to the State Duma. To be sure,  this will not be easy to do.    There were other opinions, which on certain points even  mutually refuted one another. However, the delegates were  unanimous on one point: a force capable of uniting all who are  interested in the genuine rather than illusory rebirth of the  Motherland should finally appear in Russia. The Federation of  Public Associations of Commodity Producers of Russia, which was  finally legally constituted in Krasnoyarsk, should become such a  force. Yu. Skokov was elected its first chairman. Commodity  producers have gotten the long-awaited opportunity, just as in  all states of the world, not just to assess the processes under  way in the country, but to influence the development of an  economic policy and the determination of strategy and tactics of  domestic commodity production. This will be facilitated by the  revised statute of the federation and the Declaration of Rights  of Russia's Commodity Producers, adopted at the congress, as  well as the mood in which the delegates went home. A telegram  addressed to the president and prime minister of the country, in  which the delegates demanded the suspension of the effect of the  Edict on the Taxation of Legal Entities on 1 January, became the  first ""harbinger"" of collective actions. Otherwise, it will only  be possible to refer to industrial production in Russia in the  past tense.    After the congress, I asked the first chairman of the  federation: Is he satisfied with membership in the federation  being for now structured on an utterly voluntary basis? If one  wants to, one belongs to the federation, and if not, there is no  helping it.... For example, in Japan or Germany nobody will  engage in business unless he joins the league of entrepreneurs.  The law would not let them....    Yuriy Vladimirovich responded: ""We are already moving in  this  direction. We have invited the Chamber of Commerce and Industry  of the Russian Federation to become one of the founders. In the  already mentioned Germany, it is precisely a similar chamber  that issues entrepreneur licenses. If we fail to revive the  production of goods in the immediate future, nobody from abroad  will help us. Who needs us over there? In our country people  became rich not at all because they benefited Russia somehow,  but rather as a result of redistributing the national, people's  wealth in their favor. This is a typical Bolshevik technique: To  take everything away and....appropriate it right away. Of  course, it is easier to steal than to do something yourself.  However, can something significant be created if you keep  stealing from someone else shamelessly all the time?""    I agreed--of course, it cannot.

However, the  second congress of commodity producers of the country, which was  held in Krasnoyarsk, did more than just confirm it. Read the  article on page 2.    It appeared that it would be difficult for delegates to the  congress to avoid the temptation of getting embroiled in  political battles there. The situation in the country has become  too complicated, too ""hot."" However, the following appeal came  in the very first words spoken by Yu. Skokov, chairman of the  organizational committee for conducting the congress, which was  attended by representatives from 41 regions of Russia and eight  federation-wide delegations: Enough of finding out who is ""Red""  in the audience and in the country, and who is not quite ""Red,""  and of finding out what should be demanded first of all from the  powers that be. Russia has come to the point beyond which there  may only lie a national catastrophe. The domestic production of  commodities is the last stronghold, the last bastion of the  state.    Before the congress, documents were handed out to the  delegates, of which one deserves the closest attention. It is  ""The State of the Economy of Russia (Analysis and Projection)""  prepared by the analysts of the Federation of Public  Associations of Commodity Producers of the country. It differed  greatly from government assessments which have been voiced  recently. For example, the decline in production in the year now  ending has exceeded the planned level by more than a factor of  two, and has been only slightly smaller than that of last year.  Investment in the production assets, which had been weakened to  begin with, continued to decline. Millions of people live below  the poverty line. Specialist-analysts estimate that this year  alone, $12 billion-$15 billion have been taken out of the  country both legally and illegally. A paradoxical situation  occurs: on the one hand, the stabilization of exports has been  registered, with imports falling by a factor of two; the  positive balance of foreign trade may reach $23 billion. On the  other hand, the foreign debt of Russia continues to grow: Russia  is not in a position to discharge even the reduced debt payments  (reduced by agreement with Western creditors).    Yu. Skokov built on this analysis in his report at the  congress: ""Against the background of steady cutbacks in  production in virtually all sectors, zones have emerged in which  the slump has become particularly threatening. For example, the  reduction comes to about 50 percent in electrical engineering,  instrument making, machine-tool production, and light industry.  It is not reforms in the economy that are under way, but rather  the destruction of national commodity production. However, the  state and society must understand that by destroying the  domestic commodity producer, they are destroying themselves.""    Similar assessments, even more sharply worded than Skokov's,  were voiced in presentations ""from the field"" made by the  largest industrialists of the country: managers of the  standard-bearing enterprises of the domestic machine building,  metallurgy, and the mining industry....    ""I have rubbed shoulders with all reformers in Russia, up to  the president of the country. I queried everywhere: Are we  moving on the course that we want? However, all I heard in  response was: There is no alternative to the program of reforms  being implemented. To what program, who has seen it? Chubays  came to us in Omsk, and also said: Is this not  stabilization--credit is not being taken out at banks, there are  no lines in stores, the exchange rate of the dollar is not  changing.... However, the best stabilization is when everything  is at the zero mark--both consumption and production. This only  happens at a cemetery."" (This is from a presentation by a  representative of the Omsk delegation).    This is an excerpt from another presentation, that by a  representative of commodity producers from Yekaterinburg, the  native city of the Russian president: ""We are being deliberately  and very expertly destroyed. I recently met Gaydar in  Cheboksary. He was surprised: How come, are you still in  operation? I thought that you had shut down already.... They,  the present-day reformers, indeed miscalculated: they did not  take into account the survivability of the director community,  its ability to resist the deindustrialization of the country.  Could it be that the time has really come for us to `help' the  government? For example, if the volume of production at an  enterprise falls 50 percent, half the people are thrown out into  the street. Let them appeal to the reformers then rather than to  us, and complain about a drop in the standard of living and  delays in the payment of wages....""    A. Volskiy, president of the Russian Union of Industrialists  and Entrepreneurs, stressed in his presentation to the congress  in particular: ""The fact of fragmentation of the industrialists  of the country, their splintering based on narrow corporate  interests, deserves to be condemned. Here is Gaydar creating his  association of private business which, for example, such  domestic giants as the Uralmash also joined. Why? Who would not  sell out for easy credit, for weighty sops from the boss? There  is the notorious Shumeyko, organizing his so-called  confederation of entrepreneurs of Russia, which nobody in the  Russian `backwaters' has got the foggiest notion about.  Apparently, it was also organized so that the branch of this  confederation in the United States could be headed by people who  are not strangers to Shumeyko--his daughter and son-in-law.  Gentlemen reformers, are you not something else? Meanwhile, here  we are wondering and wracking our brains over this issue: How  come the confused Russian people voted for Zhirinovskiy? As  always, we are looking for `scapegoats'--the press, television,  the absence of funds.... Who were the people to vote for? One  may have his hopes dashed, one may engage in wishful thinking,  finally, one may believe in yet another vain dream. Nobody has  ever succeeded in deceiving 100 million people all at  once--ever!""    I sat in the overcrowded auditorium of the Palace of Culture  of the metallurgical plant, in which the congress was held, and  could not help thinking: Who needed this--the destruction and  the virtual bringing to its knees of the domestic economy? Just  the way it was seven and a half decades ago. At that time,  Russia was also getting on its feet and growing stronger every  year--there were Putilov's enterprises, Morozov's textile mills,  and Tereshchenko's plants.... The Russian people have built all  kinds of things, having received the desired sip of freedom! Was  this not the foundation upon which it was possible to move ahead  quickly, turning the country into a truly prosperous region?    I would be less than truthful if I maintained that the  entire  two days of the proceedings of the congress in Krasnoyarsk were  devoted solely to the assessment and analysis of the situation  that has emerged in domestic commodity production. A proposal  was made in virtually each presentation at the congress: What  should be done in order to save the economy from ultimate  destruction, in order to save Russia?    Speaking at the congress, Arkadiy Volskiy responded to a  question with another question: ""What did Roosevelt begin with  when he came to power? He immediately closed down all banks that  existed in the country. Only one-third of them were reopened as  long as two weeks later after auditing. Incidentally, they  operate in the United States to this day.""    In Volskiy's opinion, the industrialists of the country need  their own political organization; the last election proved this.  Russia should be led by people who have a vested interest in its  prosperity.    However, there were other ""points of view"": For example, in  the opinion of A. Stepanov, chief of the Teplovodokanal  administration of the Vorkutaugol production association, the  creation of such a party is an issue for the remote future.  Right now they should immediately embark on utilizing the  potential of deputies elected to the State Duma. To be sure,  this will not be easy to do.    There were other opinions, which on certain points even  mutually refuted one another. However, the delegates were  unanimous on one point: a force capable of uniting all who are  interested in the genuine rather than illusory rebirth of the  Motherland should finally appear in Russia. The Federation of  Public Associations of Commodity Producers of Russia, which was  finally legally constituted in Krasnoyarsk, should become such a  force. Yu. Skokov was elected its first chairman. Commodity  producers have gotten the long-awaited opportunity, just as in  all states of the world, not just to assess the processes under  way in the country, but to influence the development of an  economic policy and the determination of strategy and tactics of  domestic commodity production. This will be facilitated by the  revised statute of the federation and the Declaration of Rights  of Russia's Commodity Producers, adopted at the congress, as  well as the mood in which the delegates went home. A telegram  addressed to the president and prime minister of the country, in  which the delegates demanded the suspension of the effect of the  Edict on the Taxation of Legal Entities on 1 January, became the  first ""harbinger"" of collective actions. Otherwise, it will only  be possible to refer to industrial production in Russia in the  past tense.    After the congress, I asked the first chairman of the  federation: Is he satisfied with membership in the federation  being for now structured on an utterly voluntary basis? If one  wants to, one belongs to the federation, and if not, there is no  helping it.... For example, in Japan or Germany nobody will  engage in business unless he joins the league of entrepreneurs.  The law would not let them....    Yuriy Vladimirovich responded: ""We are already moving in  this  direction. We have invited the Chamber of Commerce and Industry  of the Russian Federation to become one of the founders. In the  already mentioned Germany, it is precisely a similar chamber  that issues entrepreneur licenses. If we fail to revive the  production of goods in the immediate future, nobody from abroad  will help us. Who needs us over there? In our country people  became rich not at all because they benefited Russia somehow,  but rather as a result of redistributing the national, people's  wealth in their favor. This is a typical Bolshevik technique: To  take everything away and....appropriate it right away. Of  course, it is easier to steal than to do something yourself.  However, can something significant be created if you keep  stealing from someone else shamelessly all the time?""    I agreed--of course, it cannot. And I thought that Russia  did  not get just the Federation of Public Associations of Commodity  Producers during the two days of the congress in Krasnoyarsk,  but possibly also a new national leader.

Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 30 March reports that  solidarity  groups from Ukraine are shipping 400 tons of milk to Cuba as a  token of appreciation for the treatment provided to the  Ukrainian children affected by the Chernobyl disaster.    Radio Reloj at 1506 GMT on 30 March reports that the vessel  (Wals Wabi) owned by (Grupo Uno) is unloading 15,650 tons of  bulk wheat in the Port of Havana. The ship, which is returning  from a four-month journey, visited ports in Suriname, Brazil,  France, and England where wheat was loaded. The ship has seven  holds for freight.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 30 March reports that in  Matanzas,  milk production has increased, while the death rate for cattle  has dropped considerably, compared to the same quarter of 1993.  This report was released by Jorge Pena, a local Agriculture  Ministry official. Pena said that milk production for the first  quarter of 1994 increased by 1.5 million liters in comparison to  the same period in 1993.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 31 March reports that the  supply  of recycled paper and cardboard to Havana City Province's main  paper and cardboard recycling center has decreased by  approximately 70 percent and that Cuba is buying old paper  abroad in order to produce various types of containers, like egg  cartons and ice cream cups. A recycling official stated the  center is now recycling one ton a month, as opposed to the three  tons per month it formerly recycled.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 31 March reports that six  provinces -- with Havana Province in first place -- had  fulfilled, as of 30 March, the sugarcane planting schedule that  covers the period up to 31 March. Cuba attained 90 percent of  this quarter's goal, planting 2,811 caballerias, a figure that  may increase once the final calculations and adjustments are  made.    Radio Reloj at 2030 GMT on 1 April reports that seven  platoons from the Espana Republicana sugar agroindustrial  complex in the municipality of Perico, Matanzas, have cut 1  million arrobas of sugarcane this harvest. Two of these platoons  have already cut 2 million arrobas and are striving to attain  the third million.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 2 April reports that after 10  years of inactivity, the Patricio Lumumba plant in Minas de  Matahambre, Pinar del Rio Province, has resumed producing  sulfuric acid. The director of the (Sulfo-Metales) enterprise  said resuming production will help save the nation $69 per ton  of sulfuric acid currently being imported. This plant is  expected to produce some 35,000 tons of sulfuric acid yearly, in  addition to byproducts.    Radio Reloj at 1501 GMT on 2 April reports that Jose Luis  Arias Munoz, a Spanish communist residing in Switzerland, has  made a personal donation of medicines worth $4,000 to the Centro  Habana Pediatric and Teaching Hospital. This is Arias' third  trip to Cuba and his second donation.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 2 April reports that a physical  rehabilitation facility at the General Calixto Garcia Teaching  Hospital has undergone a $50,000 renovation and that a new  endoscopic, minimal-trauma surgery unit will be inaugurated soon.    Radio Rebelde Network at 1700 GMT on 4 April reports that  the  Spanish Ibero-Star company, which participates in the joint  administration of the Tripton and Neptuno Hotels in Havana, has  announced that these hotels will be refurbished to enhance  service and attract more tourists, thus obtaining more currency.  The general manager of these hotels said that rooms will be  enlarged and all bathrooms and furniture replaced or renovated.  We have also decided to build a larger kitchen here at the  Neptuno to offer full pension service to clients, he said.  Together with our Cuban partners, we hope to find, either in  Mallorca or in Cuba itself, a discotheque expert because we are  interested in establishing a discotheque in the Tripton Hotel.     "

This year's exports are expected to be around 12,000 tonnes, also about the same as last year's, according to one of the country's official information agencies, with the main market continuing to be Japan. Cuba also sells to Austria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain. The planned expansion of coffee production is part of a programme to broaden the base of Cuban agriculture, following last year's dramatic fall in the production of sugar, the main pillar of the island's economy.

The Canadian  official was accompanied by a large group of businessmen from 17  firms from the important Canadian Atlantic region.    During the visit, which the prime minister termed as ""very  successful,"" several trade agreements were reached and  enterprise projects with Canadian capital were drafted in the  areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, and services.

The  discussions began with the one single issue on the agenda of  this first special session: cleaning up the country's domestic  finances.    Union delegations from several countries that flew to Havana  to participate in the 1 May International Labor Day celebrations  are present. ANPP President Ricardo Alarcon recalled the wide  and intensive discussion on the main problems of the country's  domestic economy. These discussions took place at each of the  approximately 80,000 so called parliaments in the workplace,  with the participation of 3 million workers and almost 58,000  cooperative farmers at 60,000 general assemblies and thousands  of university students.    [Begin Alarcon recording] The extensive consensus that  clearly rises from those meetings is the will of the  overwhelming majority of Cubans to continue resisting, to  continue struggling to save the fatherland and its revolution.  Within this same framework and in this same spirit we, the  members of this national assembly, must now continue that  process of collective debates and take the needed measures  accordingly. [end recording]    Before studying the document that was distributed among the  deputies, Pedro Ross Leal, general secretary of the Cuban  Workers Federation, took the floor. He told the assembly about  the main issues that surfaced during the workers' discussions.  He said this session is the best way to celebrate 1 May in Cuba  at this specific moment.    The main objective of this parliamentary encounter is to  present the government with specific proposals, to suggest  measures it can gradually implement to try and develop a  systematic economic policy that could clean up the domestic  economy. The proposals and measures are based on company  profitability, work incentives, and preservation of the Cuban  revolution's social achievements.     "

The situation at the diplomat's home remained unchanged  during the past few hours in view of the refusal of the  occupants to return home and to initiate the normal paperwork to  travel abroad if they so desire.    The solution, accepted by the Belgian Government, includes  the decision by the Cuban Government to allow the evacuation of  the residence by the people who forced their way into it without  applying legal measures stipulated for this type of action, both  in Cuba as well as in any other country, the source explained.    The source himself confirmed that the Belgian Government  informed the Cuban Embassy in Brussels of its desire to  reinforce, with diplomatic and technical personnel, the small  mission in Havana.    Cuba accepted the request, bearing in the mind the current  situation in the Belgian Embassy and the small number of  officials working and there. However, the official request for  the extra personnel to travel to Havana has not yet been issued  to the Cuban Foreign Ministry.    Political observers said that the prolongation of the  occupants' stay at the Belgian ambassador's residence has  weakened their position in view of the lack of support they have  received. This has occurred basically because the two  governments involved have been in accordance on how to deal with  the situation.    The departure of four of the occupants, a few days ago, who  have not been harassed by authorities, may encourage the  remaining occupants to follow this path as the proper way to  resolve the problem.    At any rate, conversations between Belgian representatives  and Cuban Foreign Ministry officials continue to take place  normally, as PRENSA LATINA has learned. More contacts are  expected in the next few hours.     "

Carlos Lage, a member of  the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC), today said  the current sugar harvest, as well as the upcoming sugar  harvest, will be decisive in attaining that goal.    During a meeting with leaders of the sugar industry in  central Ciego De Avila Province, Lage said the 1994-95 harvest  must be greater than the current one. He stressed that the  recovery of the country's main industry is a precondition to  overcoming the current period of economic crisis.    Cuba is experiencing a period of severe economic difficulty,  following the disbanding of the European socialist bloc, with  which it conducted 85 percent of its foreign trade, and the  increased U.S. trade, financial, and commercial embargo against  the island.    Lage, who is credited with being the strategist of Cuban  economic policy, underscored the importance of the current sugar  harvest, saying that it will provide the resources needed for  next year's harvest, which could mark the beginning of the  country's economic recovery.    According to a report by the National Information Agency,  the  vice president of the Council of Ministers said no one must stop  work now to process a single ton of sugar or sow a single  caballeria (11.42 hectares) of cane sprouts.    Lage pointed out that life has demonstrated that the country  can complete a harvest with less resources than before, during  this special period, as the Cubans call the strategy they have  developed to overcome the economic difficulties.    Nelson Torres, the minister of the sugar industry; Alfredo  Hondal, a member of the Politburo and first secretary of the PCC  in Ciego de Avila; and the directors of the agroindustrial  complexes were present at the meeting, during which they  discussed production strategies for the current sugar harvest.    The participants agreed that maximum use of all available  resources, railroads, and sugar cane for processing are  essential to an efficient campaign.     "

A Ministry of Foreign Investment and Economic Cooperation  (MIECE) source confirmed to PRENSA LATINA that Camilo Penalosa,  Colombian deputy minister of economic development, headed this  delegation.    The Colombian businessmen identified investment  opportunities  in the areas of tourism, the sugar and pharmaceutical  industries, biotechnology, agricultural sector, and basic  industry, among others.    The visitors initially received ample information during a  plenary session, which was offered by MIECE representatives, the  Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Chamber of Commerce of Cuba,  in which they discussed the ideas presented by the delegation on  possible joint ventures.    The delegation also learned about current legislation on  foreign investment in Cuba and about preparations for the future  approval of a law for mutual promotion and protection of this  kind of business resulting from the development of economic  links.    Members of this business group joined the Cuba '94 Tourism  Convention which is currently being held at the well-known  Varadero Beach, about 140 km from the capital, because this is  precisely the area where there already exist more immediate  possibilities for bilateral cooperation.    Among other activities, the delegation visited the Sugar  Industry and Finance Ministries and the facilities of the  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. There, they were  briefed on the country's production efforts and the use of their  installed capacities.    When consulted by PRENSA LATINA, Roberto Rivas, the MIECE  director for America, described the visit as another step in the  process of identifying possibilities for joint work and  expansion of existing links between the two Latin American  countries.    Deputy Minister Penalosa and other businessmen returned to  their country today, but those who are participating in the  tourist convention remain on the island.     "

Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 12 February reports that the  Cienfuegos spring sugarcane plan calls for planting 66  caballerias in February. The radio also says that the weeding of  cane lands needs to be increased at Cienfuegos' 12  agroindustrial complexes, because ""at the end of January, only  48 percent of the planned weeding had been accomplished.""    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 12 February reports that the  order placed with the 20th Anniversary of the Triumph of the  Revolution factory for 75,000 batteries for use during the  current sugar harvest has been met. ""This factory, the only one  of its kind in the nation, is located in Manzanillo.""    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 12 February reports that Cubana  de Aviacion serves Cuba's nine tourist hubs. ""The Cuban Civil  Aeronautics Institute, IACC, is cooperating in the nation's  effort to receive 1 million foreign vacationers in the short  term, and have its aircraft and installations offer these  visitors quality service,"" announced Division General Rogelio  Acevedo, president of the IACC, upon inaugurating the remodeled  Maximo Gomez terminal in Ciego de Avila Province, which was  expanded at a cost of 10 million pesos and services several  international routes by which tourists arrive at hotels and  villas on the cays along Cuba's north coast.    Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 13 February notes that Cuba and  Jamaica have established a maritime link ""for trade and tourist  purposes. The cities of Port Antonio and Santiago de Cuba,  separated by 77 km, are linked by a trip of just seven hours.  This will allow a greater number of vacationers to travel  between the two islands. This link is also aimed at developing  multidestination programs aimed at meeting the needs of the  European, Canadian, and Latin American markets, and making a  reality the Cuban and Jamaican desire to consolidate economic  and tourism relations."" This link was begun with the ferry  Caribbean Queen [Reina del Caribe], operated by the  Inter-Caribbean [Inter-Caribe] company, ""whose basic activity is  related to cruises, in conjunction with hotel enterprises. The  ship carries 128 passengers, and the fact that it is  first-class, economically advantageous, and has reasonable  prices and onboard services satisfies the traveler's  requirements. The tourist package is broader, however. Santiago  de Cuba offers the enchantment of its history, hospitality, sun,  culture, and autocthonous folklore, that mix of ethnicities and  races that have merged into a particular idiosyncrasy. Options  range from hotels, beaches, and nightclubs under the stars to  trips to other Cuban cities. There are also prospects cropping  up for achieving a greater presence of Cuban products in Jamaica  and vice versa, which creates a favorable atmosphere for  developing cooperative investments based on the potential the  industry of the biggest island of the Antilles offers the  market. Geographical proximity, cultural affinity, and good will  nourish the interest in consolidating the tourist industry by  connecting these Caribbean islands.""    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 14  February report that the latex factory in Las Tunas is  manufacturing gloves for use in the sugar harvest. During the  first stage that will end in April, the factory will produce  225,000 pairs of acid-proof gloves. This factory, which belongs  to the Las Tunas Ceramics Enterprise, also produces vaginas for  artificial insemination, and will soon begin manufacturing  protective gloves for work with laboratory animals.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks at 0100 GMT on 14  February add that three new generators were installed at the  Camaguey sugar mill to increase the supply of power to the  country and the production centers.    Radio Reloj at 2045 GMT on 15 February reports that the 26  de  Julio cane cooperative in Havana is stressing cane recovery and  that ""only 20 of the 90 caballerias of cane available will be  cut this year."" Leonardo Gonzalez, the cooperative's president,  said the disease that stunts growth has been reduced to a  minimum in the group's fields through intense fertilization with  ammonia and thorough weeding.

Cuban Foreign Ministry sources confirmed to PRENSA LATINA  yesterday's arrival in Havana of Ambassador Willy Verriest, who  has already met with acting Foreign Minister Isabel Allende.    The Cuban side described this meeting as positive. The  diplomat's presence in the country is considered a demonstration  of Belgium's interest in obtaining a satisfactory solution to  the incident.    Cuba and Belgium agree on the illegal nature of the forced  entry into the building, which has been occupied by a group of  people since Saturday in an attempt to force the foreign mission  to enable them to leave the country without carrying out the  normal procedures established for leaving.    It has been learned that Verriest was ambassador to Cuba  from  November 1986 to February 1990 and now holds a high position in  the Belgian Foreign Ministry.    Parallel to his initial activities in Cuba, it was reported  that Alfredo Morales, Cuban ad interim charge d'affaires in  Brussels, has met with Belgian Foreign Ministry officials,  especially the chief of staff of that Ministry.    The objective of that meeting was also to exchange ideas and  positions on the development of the negotiations begun by the  two parties immediately after the occupation of the Belgian  ambassador's residence in Cuba.    Cuban Foreign Ministry officials consulted by PRENSA LATINA  reaffirmed the normal nature of the negotiations, which are  being conducted in accordance with the international customs and  regulations that exist for these types of cases.    The Cuban position, which is shared by the Belgian mission,  is that of facilitating the departure from the diplomatic  residence of all the people who violated its  extraterritoriality, independent of whether afterwards and in  accordance with pesent legal provisions, they begin the  appropriate steps to leave the country.

0,FT941-6842 ,"FT941-6842 _AN-EB1DPACEFT 940228   FT  28 FEB 94 / Face to face with Ukraine's future: A look at the meeting between Presidents Clinton and Kravchuk      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND and JILL BARSHAY   On the eve of his long-awaited visit to Washington, President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine has caused dismay in the Clinton administration by announcing that he will not be a candidate in June's presidential elections. For the US, this is a troubling development. Mr Kravchuk's skill at convincing the Ukrainian parliament to surrender the country's nuclear missiles transformed him, in the assessment of American diplomats, from 'an ex-communist ideologue' to 'a remarkable statesman'. American officials in Kiev are so worried by Mr Kravchuk's apparent decision to leave the political stage that they are theorising his announcement is merely a tactic designed to test his political strength. But regardless of whether Mr Kravchuk is being coy or in earnest, President Bill Clinton confronts a more basic challenge. With or without Mr Kravchuk at Ukraine's helm, the US and more broadly the Group of Seven leading industrial nations must formulate a coherent strategy for their relations with the second most powerful former Soviet republic. The west's initial attitude to Ukraine, now a country occupying a territory the size of France, was to hope that it would remain part of the Soviet Union. This sentiment was displayed most egregiously in August 1991, by President George Bush, who lectured Ukrainian parliamentarians on the virtues of remaining in the Soviet Union less than two weeks before they decided to go it alone. In spite of US efforts at persuasion, Ukraine chose the path of independence, however tenuous it has proved to be. Even if, bereft of Mr Kravchuk's statesmanship, Kiev follows through on its pledge to relinquish its nuclear weapons, two further problems remain. In three years of independence, the government has pushed the economy into free-fall, setting records for hyperinflation in the post-communist world. The resulting hardship has exacerbated regional tensions in the Russified east and provoked secession in Crimea, which elected a pro-Russian president in January. Neither the nuclear nor the economic issue might be worthy of Mr Clinton's attention were it not for Ukraine's geography. Positioned next to an increasingly expansionist and unstable Russia - many of whose leaders regard Ukraine as a natural part of 'greater Russia' - Ukraine has the potential to become, in the view of some US intelligence experts and UK military analysts, the site of Europe's bloodiest conflict since the second world war. For the west, the question is whether to leave Ukraine to its fate or to take on the job of bolstering the shaky Ukrainian state. In Washington, the most vocal proponent of the latter view is Mr Zbigniew Brzezinski, former National Security adviser in the Carter administration. In a forthcoming article in America's leading foreign policy journal, Foreign Affairs, Mr Brzezinski argues that the only way to ensure that Russia becomes 'a normal state' is to create conditions in which it is impossible for a neo-imperialist Russia to emerge. To do that, he says, the west must put its money on Ukraine. 'It cannot be stressed strongly enough,' Mr Brzezinski writes, 'that without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire; but, with Ukraine suborned and then subordinated, Russia becomes automatically an empire'. He urges the US to promote, then help pay for, economic reforms in Ukraine and to offer public support for the country's independence and political integrity. But other American foreign policy observers, equally convinced that a Ukrainian-Russian confrontation is both dangerous and likely, draw the opposite conclusion. Mr Irving Kristol, a leading rightwing commentator, recently argued that 'a Russian-Ukrainian conflict looms, one that Russia is bound to win'. This view leads Mr Kristol to conclude that Ukraine's fate is to become 'a client state, or semi-protectorate of Russia'. Mr Kristol thinks this is Kiev's problem, not Washington's. How Ukrainians resolve the dilemma of Russia's influence versus independence will furnish the answer to which of these two views prevails. But with less than a month to go before parliamentary elections and a presidential race which, if Mr Kravchuk is serious, could be wide open, Ukraine is ambivalent about its future. One reason is that in order to settle its foreign relations it must first set its own house in order. This means deciding who will lead the country. On March 27 more than 5,000 candidates will be competing for 450 seats in parliament, but the race, which a western observer in Kiev describes as 'a free for all', is generating more heat than light. More than half of the candidates are running as independents and, with about 30 competing political parties, no single democratic, pro-market bloc has been formed. The political debate is shaping up against a background of a deepening economic crisis. With monthly inflation figures approaching 90 per cent and a budget deficit last year which accounted for 29 per cent of gross domestic product, the transition to the market has caused undoubted privation. Yet serious though Ukraine's economic plight may be, it is not shaping up as the main issue in this spring's election campaigns. In part this is because, thanks to Ukraine's fertile agricultural land and the prevalance of an informal barter system, the disintegration is more brutal on paper than in real life. But it is also because the great challenge of nation-building is the dominant preoccupation of the politicians. Forging a country out of 53m people, 11m of whom are ethnic Russians, is proving a Herculean task. Eastern Ukrainians would rather live in a country which has a friendly relationship with Slavic Russia, along the lines of Austria's links with Germany, while nationalistic western Ukrainians would prefer to see their nation solidly anchored in Europe. As Mr Roman Szporluk, a professor at Harvard University, puts it: 'I see quite a big debate, perhaps a political struggle, in which various regions are trying to present their own models, but I think it's a debate about whither Ukraine not whether Ukraine.' The talk on street corners in Kiev, in Lviv in the west and in Donetsk in the east suggests that Mr Szporluk is right. At a recent banquet for a visiting Russian emigre businessman, Ukraine's Jewish prime minister, a native of the eastern Donbass region, made a toast, in Russian, to independent Ukraine. The government officials who flanked him, one from Odessa in the south, one from central Ukraine, rose to join him and, as the evening wore on, and the vodka bottles grew lighter, spoke in increasingly hostile tones about the 'damned Muscovites'. For all their economic ineptitude and internal struggles to forge an identity, the politicians thus appear committed to maintaining Ukraine's independence and unity. Whether Mr Clinton decides to welcome Mr Kravchuk on Thursday with promises of aid or to leave him and his country to their own economic devices, Ukrainian leaders have decided that it is better to rule from an impoverished Kiev than to submit to orders from oil-rich Moscow. In Washington, Mr Kravchuk will ask for financial aid to bolster the parlous economy so that the country is at least able to withstand threats from Russia to cut off Ukraine's energy supplies. Mr Kravchuk will request a Dollars 300m 'bridge loan' from the US; he will also ask Washington to support Kiev's application for a Dollars 700m loan from the International Monetary Fund and a Dollars 400m World Bank loan for sectoral reform. If Mr Clinton decides that Kiev is not worth the investment, Ukrainian politicians will continue the search for ways to consolidate their country's independence. 'The economy is one thing, but the need to defend one's country is a stronger impulse,' said Mr Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the powerful parliamentary commission on foreign affairs. 'Let no one think that Ukraine will peacefully give up and become a province of Russia.'   Countries:-  UAZ  Ukraine, East Europe.     USZ  United States of America.

Its economy might have avoided  becoming one of the poorest and most backward in Latin America,  and its people might have had a higher standard of living.    When lecturers deal with the issue of successful and  unsuccessful countries at foreign universities, they usually  teach that the United States did everything possible (and became  a superpower) with many (resources) at its disposal; Japan did  everything even though it had practically nothing; and Argentina  did nothing despite having everything. But what about Paraguay?  I would suggest that while having many resources it did very  little indeed.    What went wrong? The economic and political systems failed  as  did the governments and the people. We were, and are, swindled.    The result of this is that in the eyes of many people  abroad--even though they do not really know us--we are as poor  as Haiti, as militarized as Cuba (where the government, the  party, and the Army are part of the one and only ""family,"") and  as predetermined as Panama under the wretched General Manuel  Antonio Noriega. We are seen as very backward in economic  reforms when compared to Chile, Mexico, Argentina, and Peru over  achieving a more competitive, modern, and efficient economy.    Today, in mid-1994, the year which was forecast to have  brought an economic ""boom"" [preceding word in English] and a  major step forward in our development, very few can guess or  predict what is in store for Paraguay in the short- and  medium-term. Who can really say what will happen?    Just as there are few who can predict the future, similarly,  those who can forecast--those who can devise measures to face  what will happen--do not abound either.    What a country! Yet, technically speaking, there are  positive  results in the present economic scene even though Paraguayans  are very cautious, have a deep mistrust of what the government  says or does, and have no definite outlook for the future.    At the beginning of the year it was feared that inflation  would run at approximately 30 percent. Yet prices have climbed  much slower and, following the 0.5 percent inflation rate in  May, we could end the year in a much better position than  expected. The rate of exchange between the dollar and the  guarani rose by less than 4 percent in six months.    The Central Bank's international monetary reserves have  increased by 29 percent so far this year and by 40 percent  compared with May 1993. This is a significant financial sign of  our guarantee and credit-worthiness to the rest of the world.    This is especially so if we recall that in February 1989 we  did not have--literally speaking--any reserves at all since the  $233 million then in the Treasury vaults were not enough to  cover the payment arrears that had accumulated with  international creditors, which totalled $303 million. Moreover,  we had to shoulder our $1.885-billion external debt--some 48  percent of our total annual economic production--which had  nearly tripled since 1980 due to [former President Alfredo]  Stroessner's extravagance that has caused us so many headaches.    Our international monetary reserves now stand at $898  million--probably the best level in the last 10 years--with no  significant arrears with our foreign commitments, with a sizable  dollar deposit in our banks ($638 million), and with a ""reduced""  foreign debt amounting to just $1.232 billion (representing 17  percent of the country's production in 1994), the Paraguayan  economy can afford the luxury of laughing at the critical  situation confronting many other Latin American countries that  suffer from their over-indebtedness.    The Central Bank's international reserves have increased by  3,642 percent in real terms since 1988, dollar deposits have  grown by 349 percent (by 475 percent since February 1989), and  the external debt has been reduced by 35 percent in the period  under consideration (by 41 percent since December 1989).    Indeed, Paraguay does not have any problems with its  external  debt, and the ""nice"" side of its economy projects a positive and  attractive image to the world. And yet, we are unfortunately  seen as a Haiti (a poor and backward country), a Cuba  (militarized and under the hegemony of the Colorado Party), a  Panama (drug traffickers), and we trail far behind the leading  countries in the region. This is why we are neither a  predictable nor a predetermined country.    On closer examination, or by dwelling upon the present  economic circumstances, the problem of foreseeing what will  happen and preparing for it becomes even more curious and  worrisome when we see that since August 1993--when President  [Juan Carlos] Wasmosy took office--Central Bank international  reserves have increased by 50 percent, dollar deposits have  grown by 14 percent, and $273.2 million from Itaipu [in  royalties] has entered the country.    If this were not enough, the distinctive trait of the policy  of the finance minister and his team is that of a more balanced  budget management. They have at their disposal 50 percent more  financial resources than last year--some $544 million--and have  spent approximately $387 million, thus yielding a 41-percent  surplus.    On one hand, income tax collection has increased by 68  percent, revenues from value added tax and customs duties have  grown by 36 percent and 32 percent respectively, and royalties  from Itaipu have tripled. On the other hand, social expenditures  (education, health care, and housing) have edged up by 40  percent.    Notwithstanding this, Paraguayans are cautious and  distrustful, they are neither satisfied with nor reassured by  the performance of the administration, and the outlook is  uncertain. Why?    Some colleagues would argue, quite rightly, that the ""harsh""  or gloomy side of our difficulties should come before the  ""bright"" side of the economy. To spell it out; cotton  production will drop by 20 percent, there is no ""boom"" in  soybean production, economic activity is either stagnant or near  a standstill, credits that are in the process of being collected  have increased by 67 percent (from May 1993 to May 1994), one  can hardly make ends meet, and many people are barely eking out  a meager existence or are even slipping.    This is true, but regardless of the harsh economic  reality--and going beyond the positive results--the dark side of  the economy does not explain the spectacle of a country which,  instead of being predictable and predetermined, looks more like  a boat adrift.    It is my considered opinion that the problem is presently  more political than economic. Proof? 1) A government that did  not start as expected and desired; 2) A president who does not  convince and seems to be ensnared; 3) A military chief--General  Lino Cesar Oviedo--who went from being the hero in the  democratization film to being the chief bad guy, providing an  additional example of how we cheat each other; 4) The crazy  internal struggle by Colorado Party factions, which smells of a  foul and irresponsible plot to undermine Wasmosy's  administration; 5) Political chicanery and jingoism in general  that characterizes the performance of the ruling party and of  the opposition, like the case of 23 pitiful senators who tried  to deal a ""coup de grace"" to the privatization of some  state-owned companies.    This all leads me to conclude that the dark side of politics  is more prejudicial than its economic counterpart.    From this viewpoint, one should be grateful for the present  performance of the economy. Nevertheless, we could be in a much  better situation and Paraguay could have become a predictable  and predetermined country.    If the Wasmosy administration had been more concerned about  the nation than about the party, if the ANR [the National  Republican Association-Colorado Party] had been less of a  troglodyte, if Congress had been more concerned about bills, if  politicians had been more coherent, and if Gen. Oviedo had been  sent into retirement, then the state of affairs in 1994 would  have been very different and the positive results of the  ""bright"" side of the economy would have really been instrumental  in expediting and deepening change.    Although hard to believe, if Gen. Oviedo had been retired,  Paraguay would now be a credible, predictable, and predetermined  country. It would have been easier to give up being another  Haiti, Cuba, or a future Panama, and the world would know us  better.    We could be in a better situation; we should be in a better  situation. Despite all its resources, Paraguay has done very  little. We have been cheated and we have allowed it to happen.  Cowards die several times; heroes die only once.     "

Granados: ""Another Wall  Shows Its Cracks""]    [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- After leaving Cuba  tired of economic difficulties or moving because of ideological  discrepancies, or even for the sheer adventure of it, thousands  of Cubans who migrated to the United States, Spain, and other  countries have agreed to a movement effort, to be carried out  this month, that will attempt to reach an agreement with  authorities in Havana.    Almost all of them have a common idea. ""We are not people  who want Cuba's destruction,"" asserted Caridad More Zulueta, who  says she left for Miami in 1980 to ease her many problems  prompted by the domestic difficulties she had to confront every  day.    ""I say that many of us who left Cuba in the past 30 years  did  so more for domestic than for political problems,"" according to  Caridad, usually called ""Cachita,"" who is the president of the  Afro-Cuban Cultural Rescue Group (REWACO) [Grupo de Rescate  Cultural Afrocubano] in Miami.    Not only those who attribute their decision to emigrate to  economic reasons, however, have agreed to travel to Havana this  month and discuss the measures that could be adopted to  regularize their ties with the country, institutions, and  relatives with Cuban authorities.    On the list of approximately 200 guests to the conference on  the nation and emigration, scheduled to be held 22-24 April,  there are also veterans of the mercenary brigade that the United  States launched unsuccessfully against Cuba in 1961,  conspirators who tried to toppled Fidel Castro's government, and  individuals who maintain an aggressive hostility toward the  Cuban revolution in the past.    They are the visible cracks in another wall that is about to  fall. Many of those people, who show clear ideological  differences with the Cuban Government, have decided to distance  themselves from the extremist groups that favor the U.S. policy  of asphyxiating Cuba with an economic blockade and other  interventionist practices that could lead the island to a  holocaust.    ""Even if we do not like it, Cuba has created a totally  different society. A sudden change in that society, as the  ignorant people in Miami dream, would be catastrophic,"" says  Luis Ortega, an old Cuban journalist who resides in the United  States and is known for his lack of affection for the government  in Havana.    According to some Cuban analysts, this conference could open  the door to some progress in normalizing relations with a wide  sector of the emigrants who did not renounce their links to the  country, or conditioned it to some type of personal political  aspirations or group interest.    The spectrum determining an invitation to the conference has  been well defined. The participants invited will consist only  of those groups interested in solving issues related to  emigration, the country's social situation, and opposed to the  U.S. economic blockade against Cuba. In addition, invitations  will also be determined by these groups' decision not to attach  any conditions which may decide their participation.    According to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's explanation  to the media, those groups at either end of this spectrum are  excluded because they have imprinted a ""service record linked  very closely to those who permanently question our existence as  a nation.""    In reference to the subject of invitations to the meeting,  Robaina dismissed the participation of Miami extremist groups  which he described as ""hysterical."" Among these he mentioned the  Cuban-American Foundation, which has been classified as an  opposition group lacking any credibility since ""deep down it is  not genuine, but orchestrated by the United States.""    Nevertheless, according to an early April confirmation by a  Foreign Ministry official, invitations have been extended to  representatives of organizations who do not sympathize with the  Cuban Government, such as Cuban Change and the Cuban Committee  for Democracy.    Maybe it has been the time element, frustration brought on  by  unsuccessful efforts, or simple nostalgia of being far away from  ""what belongs to one"" which has prompted some of these groups to  overcome long-lasting hatred as well as hostilities and cross  over to the side of the moderate Cuban emigrants in the United  States. This has been done even at the risk of being branded as  ""traitors"" by their rivals in the more extremist groups.    At any rate, the emigrant representatives have responded  immediately to their attacks. ""Traitors are not those who go to  Cuba to observe and to listen... traitors are those who spend  their time demanding Washington tighten the embargo to cause the  people of Cuba to rise up against Castro in desperation. ""That  is a crime,"" says Ortega.    According to Foreign Relations Vice Minister Jorge Bolanos,  this conference, which is perceived as the second chapter of a  dialogue held for the first time in 1978 between Cuban officials  and representatives of the emigrants, will precipitate a process  headed toward normalizing relations between those Cubans living  overseas and the country's authorities.    The normalization process can be complex, however. The  conference responds to a consensus that intertwines approval  from a majority sector of the Cuban population, and doubts by  some people here who, as a result of old wounds, distrust, and a  lack of understanding, still perceive the emigrants as a symbol  of counterrevolution.    In Havana, an official spokesman recently commented that  there are some individuals still connected to radical sectors of  the Cuban emigrants in the United States who are equally opposed  to the dialogue and an understanding because ""of their sick  aversion to the word normalized as it relates to Cuba and the  county's future.""    According to some of the leaders of the groups invited to  the  conference, one of the issues that can attract attention to the  debate is the one related to regulations blocking an increase in  visits by the emigrants to their country of origin.    ""The blockade should not extend within one's country,""  states  Gilberto Solis, president of the Cuban-American Professionals  and Entrepreneurs (PECA), one of the emigrant groups invited to  the conference.    Solis and other moderate leaders of the emigrant community  insist on the double nationality issue, yet Cuban officials have  explained that the issue is related to what's established in the  Constitution and that any modification must be proposed by the  National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament) and  approved in a plebiscite.    At any rate, Vice Minister Bolanos recently disclosed that  the authorities will bring up their proposals and other issues  during the conference. ""All issues will be open to discussions  during the conference sessions,"" he added.    To the Cuban authorities, the invitation to this conference  is an opportunity for Cuban residents overseas to present their  ""legitimate concerns and aspirations"" to the country in good  faith.    At the same time, the Cuban authorities point out that  ""there  is no possibility for political manipulation or opportunities to  intervene in affairs which, due to their very nature, only  concern those who live, work and struggle in Cuba.""

During the regular period of sessions of the National  Assembly of the People's Government, it was established that  only 31 percent of Cuban state enterprises are profitable and  that subsidies totaled 4.6 billion pesos--that is, 73 percent  more than in 1989--during 1993.    Despite the fact that external factors are negatively  affecting the island, it is a fact that efficiency must increase  at all levels, and financial discipline must improve.    The subsidies to which some unprofitable enterprises became  accustomed have an unfavorable effect on labor productivity and  labor discipline [words indistinct], because in Cuba there is a  very flexible labor legislation that does not contemplate  different remunerations concerning each individual's  contribution for a same profession. Things will change this  year, at least as far as subsidies are concerned, if we observe  the statements made by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who  explained recently that to grant subsidies, the financial  situation of organizations and enterprises will be examined.  The entities showing deficits will be forced more than ever to  collect their accounts receivable, prior to requesting subsidies  from the state budget.    Up until last September the business sector had 2.8 billion  pesos in accounts receivable, a factor that results in  difficulties and the ensuing diversion of resources.  Authorities and Cuban unions are certain the irregularities in  the collections and payments [words indistinct] enterprises  generate discipline and [words indistinct].

I already knew this to be the case: National-Radical  deputies have approached the Prosecutor's Office, demanding that  he be charged with treason against the state. Specifically for  signing a treaty on a unified monetary system with Russia, one  paragraph of which -- concerning the status of the national bank  -- contradicts the relevant article of the Constitution.    It seems that his life since he was elected chairman of the  Council of Ministers of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic  nearly four years ago has been composed entirely of dramatic  events. His attempts to salvage the economy -- the decline in  production, inflation, the decline in living standards, the  constant attacks from the right wing and the national reformers,  and the criticism from the left.... ""You adapt to living as if  under fire in a trench,"" he confessed to journalists.    But whereas these years which have washed like a destructive  wave over all the former republics of the Union, have seen  several heads of government in Belarus' neighbors, starting with  Russia, come and go, Kebich has survived. Because he has  occupied a key post for all this time, he has naturally had more  of a chance than many others to make sense of the processes that  have brought society to the brink of disaster.    From the vantage point of his accumulated experience, how  does he currently view the ways and means for getting Belarusia  out of the crisis and providing its people with a decent life?  This was the question, a question of interest to all of us,  that I put to Kebich first of all.    There Is Only One Way    [Kebich] Basically, the only way I can see is close union  with Russia, the establishment of an effective model for the  economy and a just society. This is the main thing.    [Stepanenko] You would put union with Russia first?    [Kebich] Yes. Without it Belarusia has no future. Blood  kinship, shared roots, and age-old unity with the Russian people  are not the only issue here. We are united economically.  Almost all our energy resources, raw materials, and the bulk of  our components come from Russia, and two-thirds of our products  are sent to Russia. The destruction of the Union and the  disruption of economic ties is a tragedy whose disastrous  consequences are being felt in all the republics; it is a  tragedy that has become an economic Chernobyl for Belarusia.  Our only salvation lies in integration. The unification of  monetary systems, for which, as you know, I had to fight all the  way, is just the first step in the direction of full economic  union with Russia. If you like, this is the only realistic way  not only of surviving, but also of retaining our sovereignty.  [Kebich ends]    Just the day before, during a meeting with industrialists  and  entrepreneurs who nominated him as a candidate for the  presidency, Kebich issued a sharp rebuke to those who have  kicked up a fuss about the ""crimes"" of a government which, by  signing a treaty on the monetary system, has supposedly deprived  the republic of its sovereignty. And he voiced his profound  conviction that Belarusia actually lost its sovereignty  following the breakup of the Union, when it became  ""independent,"" because disorder and poverty are a road to  servitude and total dependence on others. Opponents of economic  union with Russia, he noted in a subsequent talk with  journalists, are prisoners of medieval illusions.       [Stepanenko] But why unite with Russia alone? After  all, there was a time when you advocated economic union within  the framework of the Commonwealth.    [Kebich] I have not given up on this idea. But you will  recall how the politicians conducted themselves: They all  destroyed even what was enshrined in the agreement on the CIS --  a single economic area, a single ruble, and joint Armed Forces.  With every summit meeting I became more and more convinced that  national ambitions and selfishness were being put first.  Everyone was in it only for what they could get out of it. I  realized that we needed to come up with another, more realistic  option. Without destroying the Commonwealth, within its  framework, those who are more prepared to integrate, for  example, and whose economy basically compels them to do so as a  result of objective ties, should draw closer together. And I  put forward the idea of an economic union of Russia, Ukraine,  Kazakhstan, and Belarusia.... [Kebich ends]    This was Kebich's idee fixe. He plugged it whenever he  could: He secured the approval of the Supreme Soviet and  discussed the concept on several occasions with Chernomyrdin,  Kuchma, and Tereshchenko. The planned union of four, and  subsequently, owing to the deterioration of the situation in  Ukraine, three, was open to other CIS member states, and was to  have been the basis for a subsequent economic union of all  Commonwealth countries. But it proved impossible to set it up.  Whereupon Kebich concentrated his efforts in just one direction  -- union with Russia.    [Kebich] Of course, we will go further -- we will completely  restore the single economic area and single economic organism.  I am sure this will accelerate the unification process on a  Commonwealth-wide scale. Here in Belarusia, this system will  enable us to keep alive the largest enterprises and whole  sectors such as those involved in radioelectronics,  machine-building, and oil refining. Russia too will benefit:  It will not have to establish industries paralleling the ones  operating here, nor will it have to shut down enterprises  working in collaboration with Belarusia.    The second condition for getting ourselves out of the  crisis,  as I have already mentioned, is the establishment of an  effective model for the economy. And here, I think, we need to  rid ourselves of one or two illusions.    You Cannot Be Wiser Than Life    [Kebich] First and foremost we need to openly acknowledge  that the economic model proposed by the radical reformers is  bankrupt. Let me be more specific: A policy geared to  indiscriminate destruction of the past and all the forms and  principles of the previous economic system is not only  wrongheaded, it is actually ruinous. This is borne out by  everything, by the way the production situation is developing  and by experience -- our own experience, I mean not just  Belarusia's, but the experience of all former Union republics  and world experience as a whole.    Let me begin with an extremely obvious fact. This model has  not achieved success anywhere on the territory of the former  USSR. On the contrary, the more the model has been applied, the  more the economy has fallen apart. We, for example, immediately  refused to adopt the ideas put forward by the radical marketeers  -- wholesale liberalization and total privatization. And we  thereby prevented the kind of collapse we are seeing among our  neighbors.    [Stepanenko] But your opponents claim that until recently  Belarusia was being helped along by cheap Russian oil.    [Kebich] Excuse me, this is just political speculation and  deception. For Russia and its enterprises, oil and gas were  even cheaper, but production there has declined at a far quicker  rate than in Belarusia.    [Stepanenko] Specialists say the fact that the republic  survived and did not go under with just 4 percent of its own raw  materials and components is nothing short of an economic miracle.    [Kebich] To a certain extent it really was a miracle. It is  important to understand why. We kept to the safety margin that  we had in the previous economic system. Let me remind you that  back in 1989 the national income grew by almost 8 percent and  was probably the highest in the world. Despite all the  distortions and deformations which for dozens of years were  imposed on this economic system, its healthy foundation, and  particularly its planning system, demonstrated its advantages.  In order to extricate ourselves from the crisis, we intend to  bolster rather than weaken this foundation. How did Franklin  Roosevelt extricate the U.S. economy from the crisis caused by  the elemental forces of the free market? By planned programs,  and control and regulation of prices and interest rates.       Even today in West Europe, EEC countries' agricultural  production prices are planned and handed down from Brussels.  And what about the Southeast Asian market and the Japanese  economic miracle? Once again, it was achieved with the help of  extremely vigorous and soundly based scientific planned  regulation. Quite frankly, I was amazed by a fact I learned not  so long ago. Almost 30 years ago in Canada our workers  witnessed an operation where, in the space of just four hours,  information was collated on the quantity, range, and quality of  footwear all over the country, as well as the demand for these  products -- and this information was then used to make forecasts  and adjust plans.    [Stepanenko] So apparently in Canada they threw all their  intellectual resources and all the structures of state and  science into combating the elemental forces of the market? And  in our country these things have become disconnected?    [Kebich] Precisely. And now, in order to extricate  ourselves from the crisis, we need to make the connection again.  It is time for us to say good-bye to the euphoria over private  property, which is alleged to be the only way of creating real  owners and ensuring the best results. World experience has  dispelled this illusion long ago. In many developed countries  almost half the enterprises are owned by the state and operate  no less efficiently than private ones. And what about  agriculture? Nowadays it should be clear to anyone that the  best results are achieved on state-owned land in Holland and the  state-run cooperatives of Israel. China has fed 1.5 billion  people without private ownership. And the production indicators  of people leasing land (in West Europe this accounts for almost  50 percent) -- and I stress leasing, not owning -- are no worse  than the indicators of those who own it.    What about our Belarusian experience? Despite all our  shortcomings and making do with far less equipment than Western  farmers, the republic's kolkhozes and sovkhozes have produced  150 percent more milk per head of population than all the farms  in the United States. And we have caught up with them in terms  of the amount of meat produced per head of population, you know.    Mistakes Must Be Corrected    [Stepanenko] Nevertheless, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, Belarusia  has also given ground. Laws have been adopted opening the way  for private ownership and a privatization program....    [Kebich] You know, if all forces -- our own ""democratic  reformers,"" the Russians, and the world community -- are  pressuring us, one single country taken separately, and moreover  a country without raw materials and energy resources, it is  practically impossible to resist all alone. The government, of  course, is to blame, but primarily because it was the government  during this difficult period.    It is even said that I am against the market. No, I am not  against it. The market exists in all modern countries. There  was even a market in the USSR. I am opposed to the kind of  market which has been foisted on us by the radical democrats. I  am convinced that privatization should not be imposed by force.  At the meeting I had with industrialists, for example, they  expressed their opposition to the privatization of a number of  major enterprises. I said: Let the labor collectives decide.  A program is a program, and life is life. But we have not  permitted private land ownership in agricultural commodity  production. Only on personal plots and gardens, but these are  basically privately owned anyway. We have taken account not  only of the greater efficiency of collective forms of ownership,  but also the unificatory commune principles inherent in the soul  of the people and the Slav mentality.    [Stepanenko] This ties in directly with the theme of a just  society, the need for which you spoke at the beginning of our  talk.    [Kebich] Yes, I am convinced that unless we pursue a policy  of building a just society, we will never climb out of the pit.  It sometimes seems to me that we are standing on the edge of a  moral abyss and spiritual catastrophe. Today immorality has  become the rule, trickery and deception are commonplace, and  cynicism is a virtue; an amazing change has taken place in  people of all social groups. Ugly economic relations primarily  engender legal and moral thuggery. We need to struggle against  this. We must not place a nuclear bomb under the economy which  will blow society to smithereens. We must not divide society  even more into rich and poor -- it has already been divided  enough. We need to correct our mistakes, honestly acknowledging  that they were made chiefly in important matters rather than  trifles.       [Stepanenko] So then, Vyachaslaw Frantsavich, do we need  to make adjustments or completely change course?    [Kebich] What, is it better to persist in wandering off on  the wrong track? Right now a reappraisal of what has been done  is already under way. People in Russia are beginning to  overcome the consequences of the narrowly monetarist approach of  the shock-therapy reforms which destroyed the economy. I am  sure that the bitter experience of the recent perestroyka and  reformist eras will help us to find the right way to extricate  ourselves from the crisis. And I hope we will come out of it  alongside Russia rather than separately.     "

This commercial agreement will be used  to pay part of the Cuban debt with Brazil, which totals $48  million. This was reported by Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage  D'Avila, who is visiting Brazil to negotiate investment  strategies in the country.    Lage met yesterday with President Itamar Franco and with  Health Minister Henrique Santillo. Lage stated that Cuba is  able to supply several medicines to Brazil at good prices. He  said Cuba can sell Brazil generic medicines, like antibiotics  and anesthetics.    Carlos Lage explained that the Cuban Government is  ""patiently"" awaiting the Brazilian discussion over the  effectiveness of the anti-meningitis meningococcic B-type  vaccine produced in Cuba.

Presidents Kim  and Yeltsin reaffirmed that North Korea must abide by the  inter-Korean agreement on denuclearization and that its nuclear  program must be deterred.    During the first summit session Wednesday evening, Kim  received a Russian promise of participation if the U.N. Security  Council decided to impose sanctions on North Korea as a last  recourse. Such pledges are reassuring, especially because  Russia is one of the five permanent members of the Security  Council and can still exert influence on North Korea.    The degree of sanctions Russia would support remained  unclear, but Moscow's stance will certainly pressure China,  which is the last remaining uncertain variable.    In a show of growing partnership, Kim and Yeltsin agreed to  open a hot line between their offices for around-the-clock  consultations on urgent situations including the North Korean  nuclear matter.    The hot line, reserved previously for close security allies  such as Japan and the United States, is symbolic of the  transformation in bilateral relations that were once  confrontational during the cold war days but are now based on  mutual cooperation.    President Kim raised the issue of the North Korea-Russia  Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance,  especially the clause in which Russia is obligated to  automatically intervene on North Korea's side in case of war.  He made clear that any supply of military equipment and  technology to North Korea, which has not yet given up hope of  national unification by force, is inappropriate.    Yeltsin suggested that a line has been drawn in  Pyongyang-Moscow relations, explaining diplomatically that the  treaty with North Korea is virtually dead in practice.    The summit cast light on future bilateral relations, the  spirit of which was embodied in the 13-clause joint declaration  released after Thursday's summit. The two presidents championed  democracy and a market economy as shared values and vowed to  build a relationship on these principles.    They accented cooperation in trade, science and technology,  hoping to wed South Korea's industrial technology and experience  in free competition with Russia's advanced science and natural  resources.    Seoul-Moscow economic relations remain marred by the  unrepaid  South Korean loan to Russia. But Seoul officials decided to  separate this issue from other economic projects and expect it  will not get in the way of bilateral trade promotion. Further  helping to thrust forward Seoul-Moscow ties, Yeltsin handed  over, as promised, Russian documents on the 1950-53 Korean war  in a gesture aimed at sweeping away the cold war past when  Moscow had aided Pyongyang during the fratricidal clash.    Kim has now wound up his summit diplomacy with all four  surrounding powers, with each providing confirmation of strong  bilateral ties.    The summit with Yeltsin was no exception.     "

[Begin Pino recording] The plan of action and the Barbados  Declaration were finally approved today after an extensive  workday of this First Global Conference on Sustainable  Development of Small Island Developing States, during which the  floor was given to the 13 speakers who were unable to speak  during the previous session.    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro, who yesterday afternoon  presided over the final part of that top-level meeting, also  joined the roundtable meeting of chiefs of states and of  governments, who held a meeting behind closed doors as of 1130  this morning.    During the final day of sessions in the (Cherbun) Center,  Commander in Chief Fidel Castro met with Lloyd Erskine  Sandiford, President of the Global Conference and Prime Minister  of Barbados. Sandiford said his country is continuously working  for everything related to the Caribbean and outside the region,  seeking Cuba's full integration into the American system in an  effort to overcome the current differences. The Barbadian prime  minister added that Cuba as a Caribbean nation plays an  important role in the development of the region and of the  hemisphere.    Likewise, the Cuban president said he was impressed by the  independent position the Carribean region adopted throughout its  history concerning Cuba, and expressed interest in tightening  relations within the context and objectives of the Association  of the Caribbean States.    Fidel Castro also stressed the delegates' contribution to  the  debate, adding that Cuba will work for the implementation of all  the decisions adopted by the conference in its plan of action.    Late this afternoon, Fidel Castro also held a meeting with  approximately 100 representatives of nongovernmental  organizations [NGO's] who participated in the Conference of  Small Island Developing States.    During this meeting, (Jian Frenz), coordinator of  nongovernmental organizations from the Caribbean, briefed the  Cuban president about the resolutions adopted by the  participants of that forum in support of the Cuban people's  right to their development, and against the U.S. blockade. In  this exchange of ideas, the commander in chief expressed his  recognition of the growing power of the NGO's and the important  contribution they have made in creating an awareness of the need  to take care of the environment, an awareness he did not  perceive among politicians during the Rio de Janeiro summit.    Fidel Castro also expressed thanks for the solidarity and  support for the Cuban people, and underscored the contribution  of the government representatives during the forum paralleling  the global conference. He added that the influence of good ideas  can be felt everywhere, and also within the NGO's. You are  leaving us a valuable experience and for this reason, the  feelings of dignity, independence, and honor are present in each  of you, and they are part of the great battle you are waging.

0,FT942-4611 ,"FT942-4611 _AN-EFIC8ABDFT 940609   FT  09 JUN 94 / OECD set for talks with five more states      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor      PARIS   Ministers from the 25 nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development yesterday moved towards expanding the Paris-based body by approving negotiations on OECD membership with South Korea and four east European countries. A statement issued after the OECD's two-day annual ministerial meeting held out the prospect of Korea becoming a member by the end of 1996 and called for 'an early start' of negotiations on membership with the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. As a further indication of the OECD's increasingly outward-looking nature in the post-cold war world, the organisation and the Russian government yesterday agreed to step up the flow of economic assistance from the OECD to Russia. Under the terms of a joint declaration on co-operation, the OECD will develop a policy dialogue with Russia, assisting the design and implementation of economic reforms aimed at helping Russia build a market-based economy. This year's ministerial meeting was notable for the participation of Mexico, which joined the organisation as its first new member in more than two decades a few weeks ago. In their statement after the meeting, ministers said this marked 'the beginning of a new phase in the OECD's development'. The four former communist east European countries have applied formally to join the organisation. South Korea, which already participates in many of the OECD's committees and activities, intends to apply for membership this year with a view to joining in 1996. The OECD will examine the terms of Korea's membership as soon as Seoul is ready to do so. Separate negotiations with each of the four European applicants could begin soon. However, yesterday's statement gave no indication as to when they might be admitted to the organisation. Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general, said it was possible one or other of the east European countries might join the OECD at the same time as Korea. But the former communist states would have to adapt their legislation to meet the terms of membership as well as be acceptable to the existing member countries. Bulgaria, Romania and Slovenia have also asked the OECD for policy advice and the organisation may also help the Baltic states. The OECD intends to explore possibilities for co-operation with China and maintain its policy dialogue with the fast-growing newly-industrialising countries of Asia and Latin America. Yesterday, Mr Paye suggested Russia might one day become an OECD member. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, also urged Russia's integration with the west; it was 'the best investment we can make in our security and in the security of all the peoples of Europe'. According to Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister and one of the signatories of the agreement with Russia, the OECD intends 'to focus in particular on helping develop the legal and institutional infrastructure necessary for the functioning of a market economy in Russia.' The Paris-based body will carry out a comprehensive survey of the Russian economy and offer advice on economic restructuring and reform of Russia's tax and statistical systems. Russian experts will be invited to take part in specialised OECD committees. OECD officials will have access to senior Russian policy makers and to the economic information needed for drawing up a programme for Russia. They will be given the same legal status and protection as officials of other international economic organisations. Russia has been receiving OECD economic assistance since 1991 on a wide range of issues, including statistics, privatisation, competition policy, financial sector reform and social security. The agreement signed yesterday will intensify this co-operation.   Countries:-  FRZ  France, EC.     QMZ  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

GRANMA newspaper today says that, under normal conditions,  the island's generation capacity is 70 percent -- a level  considered normal at the international level -- because no  system operates full-time given the time needed for maintenance  and the number of breakdowns.    The newspaper stresses that the country, despite its  monetary  limitations, already has the necessary funds and has already  purchased spare parts and other materials to work on repairing  the system.    The newspaper states that the demand for electricity  increased significantly at different times during the day in the  first quarter of 1994, compared with the previous quarter. This  was attributed to many causes, particularly the use of electric  stoves that are not in the best of operating conditions.    The newspaper stresses the importance of having national  crude oil, which guarantees about 30 percent of electric power  generation, particularly at the Maximo Gomez thermoelectric  plant in Mariel and the Santa Cruz del Norte plant, both in  Havana Province; the Rente plant in Santiago de Cuba Province;  and the Jose Marti plant in Matanzas Province.    In addition, electric union specialists note that most of  Cuba's plants came from the former Soviet Union and  Czechoslovakia, and no spare parts have been received for this  equipment since 1990.    Cuba has been able to maintain a certain response level to  deal with unexpected breakdowns and scheduled maintenance.  Nevertheless, it was reported that now 570 megawatts of the  nation's production capability are affected by repairs to the  plants, 821 megawatts are affected by breakdowns, and 372  megawatts are affected by other other limitations.    Extended outages will begin to decrease throughout the  country as soon as maintenance and other work concludes at the  generating facilities, according to the source.     "

Dellums, from California, has expressed support for the mission  of the group ""Freedom to Travel,"" which has defied U.S.  restrictions impeding U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba.    During a news conference today in this capital, Medea  Benjamin, the group spokesperson, read a letter from Delluns in  which he views as unconstitutional and senseless the limitations  on travel to Cuba.    The letter reads: ""I greet with clear understanding those  who visit Cuba, and I reject the official White House policy. I  join you in the continuous legislative efforts made to lift this  historic Cold War foolishness, and I bid all of you success.""    According to U.S. laws, U.S. citizens who visit Havana  without a special permit may be fined up to $250,000 or face  10-year prison sentences for violating the 1917 Trading With the  Enemy Law and the economic blockade imposed on Cuba more than  three decades ago.    Benjamin said the note, which she views as unusual from a  representative of the U.S. Congress, reached her two days after  the Treasury Department froze a $43,000-account established to  cover expenditures of the project.    The letter reads: Our prohibition policy toward Cuba harms  us, and it harms the island much more. The letter calls for a  strengthening of the ties of friendship and cooperation between  the two countries.    According to Benjamin, Delluns said the U.S. media welcomed  the recent lifting of the restrictions on travel to and trading  with Vietnam, and she called for the adoption of similar actions  regarding Cuba.    The letter reads: We are definitely engaged in a post-Cold  War struggle, and we support our old enemies now, as in the case  of Russia.    Delluns views the Freedom to Travel Movement's 90-mile trip  to Cuba as an act of courage. The trip, she said, is a  manifestation of the desire of the two nations (Cuban and the  United States) to establish communication and to learn from each  other.     "

During an interview that lasted more than an hour with Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Kellenberger said he was also  interested in learning about the dispute between the United  States and Cuba. He expressed his government's sympathy with  the complex situation the Latin American country is experiencing.    The Cuban foreign minister, who made a technical stop in  Bern  before beginning his tour of five African nations, told PRENSA  LATINA that, although informal, his stay had been very important  and fruitful for the development of future bilateral ties.    Besides his meeting with Kellenberger, who is also the  political director of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs,  the Caribbean minister met with Heinrich Reimann, the ambassador  and chief of the Department of African, Middle East, Asian, and  Latin American Affairs at the Swiss Foreign Ministry.    He visited the parliament of the Swiss Confederation, where  he was briefed on that body's organization.    Local authorities expressed their willingness to hold talks.  In response, Robaina invited the secretary of state to visit  Havana.    Switzerland and Cuba are working on a bilateral agreement to  promote and protect investments, similar to those Cuba has  signed with other European countries.    The Cuban foreign minister saw Nicolas Imboden, the  ambassador of the Federal Department of Public Economy [name and  title as received], before concluding his brief stay in this  capital. Imboden, who is also in charge of commerce and  investment, expressed his interest in some sort of trade  exchange with Cuba.

The debate  was enhanced by topics as important as Latin American  integration in industrial property [propiedad industrial] and  what the subcontinent could do in light of the new challenges  posed by the revamping of the international legal order, which  is gaining strength.    Regarding the use of the patents cooperation agreement,  which  began (?in May) 1978 under the auspices of the Intellectual  Property World Organization [Organizacion Mundial de Propiedad  Intellectual], the participants discussed some of the advantages  to the countries that adhere to it, including the right to  defend claims on inventions in more than 60 countries and the  extension of the time granted to applicants before entering the  national phase; these advantages allow for further development  of the invention, marketing, and facilitate a better financial  condition in order to meet other expenditures. Here, one needs  access to an extensive technological bibliography. Jesus  Sanchez Lima, from the United States, has commented on the  treaty and the North to South transfer of technology.

[pauses] regarding the lobbying by the (?First  World) against the Third World. Though I believe in the patents  system and think these limited monopolies granted to the  inventors are the most effective way to stimulate inventions, I  believe, nonetheless, there must be a limit to those monopolies.  Those limits in many countries that are forced by economic  reasons to join treaties like GATT and NAFTA may not yield the  expected results. [end recording]    During the international seminar emphasis was also placed on  the overlap between copyright or industrial property, which  provide protection to artistic and literary works, and  inventions and patent rights. There was a consensus to consider  a possible legal system, at both the national and international  levels and to establish the principle of a single right over  goods and materials. In conclusion, here is the opinion of one  of the Cuban experts who attended the meeting.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] It has challenged us  to exercise our intelligence, and by that word I mean the  intelligence of those who live in Cuba. It has made us think  beyond what we are used to thinking and even open ourselves to  the challenges our domestic policy of promoting foreign  investments in certain sectors are posing. Matters we had not  considered, including in our legislation, are discussed here as  the problems other legislations have. They will not be problems  for our laws, because we have been forewarned. In a general  sense, the [word indistinct] is highly positive.

0,FT924-2926 ,"FT924-2926 _AN-CLJCGADDFT 921210   FT  10 DEC 92 / Personal View: To Russia with resolve      By JOHN ODLING-SMEE   The International Monetary Fund has been actively involved in helping Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union (FSU) find solutions to their pressing economic and financial problems. This is one of the greatest challenges in the IMF's 48-year history. The transformation from a centrally planned to a market economy is a profoundly difficult task for two reasons. First, restructuring or replacing existing industry will take time and financial resources, which are particularly scarce. Second, there is a need to build the institutions necessary for a market economy to function efficiently. Basic institutions, such as a modern financial sector and a functioning system of commercial law, did not exist. Therefore, economic and institutional transformation has to be comprehensive, rather than piecemeal. Not surprisingly, the early results have been mixed. There are some encouraging signs. Market behaviour by producers is becoming more widespread. The government's privatisation programme is gaining momentum. New private businesses are being created all the time. However, serious strains have also emerged. With the collapse of the old system of central planning and the disruption of trade flows within the FSU, output has declined sharply. Considerable parts of the existing industrial plant cannot survive without assistance, and domestic political pressures to maintain output and employment are strong. The result has been excessive budget subsidies and credit expansion to finance loss-making enterprises. There is now a real danger that inflation will escalate into hyperinflation unless the Russian authorities act vigorously to reimpose financial discipline. And hyperinflation would threaten to wipe out all the gains made so far, and jeopardise the reform process itself. These developments point to the only practical way out of the present economic crisis: stabilise the macroeconomic situation; press ahead with the whole array of structural reform measures, including corporatisation and privatisation, enterprise restructuring and financial sector reform, market-oriented legal, institutional and accounting reforms, and improved enterprise management. At the same time, resist the temptation to reintroduce non-market methods such as price controls and large subsidies; ensure that the social safety net is adequate so that the human cost of higher unemployment, which will be inevitable, is tolerable, but not so expensive as to undermine budgetary stability. The IMF is actively working with the Russian authorities to make progress in all these areas. First, it approved Dollars 1bn in credits in August. As a second step, it is currently negotiating an economic reform and macroeconomic stabilisation programme that may be supported by more financial assistance. Unfortunately, this is taking longer than expected, because of the authorities' inability so far to decide on firm monetary and fiscal policies. The third phase, which may involve a Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble, will begin when conditions are more favourable. IMF technical experts are also active in advising on macroeconomic policies, structural reforms and the social safety net. At present as much as a third of the IMF's worldwide technical assistance effort is being devoted to Russia and other FSU countries. The IMF is also making an extraordinary commitment of human resources. The unprecedented concentration of effort is clear evidence of the priority that the IMF is giving to these countries. The IMF is not alone, by any means. The response of the community of nations to Russia's appeal for help has been very positive. Last April, the US and Germany announced a Dollars 24bn package of external financial assistance for Russia for 1992. Excluding the Dollars 6bn for a stabilisation fund (which will become available only in the third stage of IMF assistance), it is now expected that the total amount of assistance, including grants, export credits, humanitarian aid and debt relief, will approach Dollars 18bn. In terms of technical assistance, many international institutions and governments have been providing experts. In addition, many private companies, consultancies and non-profit-making bodies have been making available their skills and know-how. It could be argued that donors and creditors should have been even more generous. But it certainly cannot be claimed, as some observers have done, that the response in 1992 has fallen short of promises. At the IMF, we harbour no illusions about the scale of the problem, the possible setbacks and the time needed to complete the task. We understand the temptation to slow down the pace of reform. But we believe that this would only create worse problems in the future. It is better to take the difficult decisions at the beginning of the process, to set the economy on the right path from the outset.

Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso has  confirmed  to PRENSA LATINA the illegal entry of 17 men and 3 women into  the German Embassy by crashing a truck with Camaguey Province  license plates into the iron gate of the embassy's garage.    Shortly after this incident, German Ambassador Georg Trefftz  reported the incident to Cuban authorities and requested the  presence of Cuban Foreign Ministry officials.    Luis Garcia Peraza, deputy director of the Europe Department  of the Foreign Ministry, went to the embassy in representation  of his ministry. The ambassador told him the occupants refuse  to leave the site despite the fact he personally has urged them  to leave immediately.    The German mission has its own security. PRENSA LATINA has  learned that four guards are in charge of this embassy's  protection.    Trefftz said he would keep the Cuban Foreign Ministry  informed about the situation, although he has not given the  names of the people inside the building.    Alfonso explained that the Cuban Foreign Ministry has  reiterated the well-known Cuban position that this type of  violation of diplomatic missions accredited in the country is  unacceptable as an alternative to the legal procedures that must  be followed to travel outside national territory.    Cuba considers this a provocation and also a carefully  planned illegal action executed at the moment the president of  Mexico was arriving in Cuba and on the eve of the 4th  Ibero-American summit in Cartagena de Indias.    The spokesman noted that the origin of this incident is the  growing sense of frustration among people who form what he  described as the anti-fatherland sector abroad, because of  Cuba's victories in the international arena.    This also constitutes, according to Alfonso, additional  evidence of the negative results of the United States policy of  denying visas to people wanting to travel to that country.     "

[Dikun] For the time being the Political Declaration of  Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European  Union is not an agreement but merely a protocol of intent. Why  did you not succeed in Brussels in signing right away the treaty  that has been worked on for more than a year now?    [Shokhin] It was clear that only the declaration would be  signed in Brussels even before the visit began. The point is  that the agreement itself is huge, consisting of more than 100  pages, and time is needed in order to bring about its signing in  a purely technical sense. Individual issues were resolved during  the negotiations--this is about trade in the products of the  nuclear fuel cycle, the establishment and operation of  companies, including banking companies, in the territories of  Russia and the countries of the European Community. Experts will  now have to work on these aspects, and then it will be possible  to sign the agreement. The Brussels Declaration has removed all  obstacles on the path toward it.    [Dikun] What specifically does this declaration accomplish  for Russia?    [Shokhin] Russia is no longer considered a country with a  centralized planned economy which is capable of setting prices  and conditions for trade at its discretion, without reference to  market arrangements. All measures are possible with regard to  such a state in order to restrict its exports. As is laid down  in the declaration, Russia has now been recognized as a country  with an economy of a transitional type. That is to say that  antidumping measures cannot be used against it for purely  political motives; we will now be treated in keeping with canons  and yardsticks commonly accepted in the world. If the issue of  introducing a restrictive measure with regard to Russia arises,  it should be consulted first as to whether the country is indeed  deliberately engaging in some dumping practices, or whether  there is another reason.    Besides, it is officially codified in the declaration that  the European Community and Russia are partners from now on and  will strive for further economic rapprochement. Moreover, in the  immediate future negotiations should begin on establishing a  free zone and trade between the European Union and Russia.    Simultaneously, the Council for Cooperation between the  European Union and Russia is being established within the  framework of which it is planned to hold summits twice a year,  that is, meetings between the president of Russia, on one side,  and the chairman of the Council of the European Union, the  chairman of the European Commission, on the other side. It is  also laid down in the declaration that intensive contacts will  be organized at the parliamentary level. In a word, a continuous  dialogue, a system of regular consultations will be established  between the European Union and Russia. It is important that the  parties stated this officially: They will build mutual economic  relations on the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade, to which an overwhelming majority of the countries of  the world adhere.    [Dikun] Can the real economic effect of this agreement be  assessed?    [Shokhin] It is impossible to quantify. In the greater  scheme  of things, establishing broad-scale political and economic  cooperation with the European Union is primarily in Russia's  interest. This will simplify and facilitate market  transformations for us, and will relieve social difficulties in  the course of reforms. One way or the other, this will give a  great impetus to the participation of European companies in the  operation of Russian institutions and companies. This will  influence the progress of privatization favorably, ensuring in  the process not only an influx of capital that we badly need but  also the advent of new technologies and management expertise  which we need so much.    This is very important: The European space market is being  opened up to us. Everybody knows well to what degree the Western  market for space launches and space services as a whole is  closed, how difficult it is to break into, and what obstacles  are being thrown in our path in this case. The number of  commercial launches we will be able to carry out before the end  of this century has now been determined. Subsequently, our quota  in the space sphere is expected to be increased in keeping with  our own potential, as well as so that prices for these services  will gradually pull closer to world prices. This is completely  in our interest because our prices for such services are  somewhat below those in the world. Our entry onto the space  market is also valuable to us in that it will promote the  development of domestic industry and science, quite a number of  sectors associated with rocket building and support for space  launches.    [Dikun] As is known, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore also  came here with a program for extensive joint participation by  Russia and America in space projects. Therefore, Russia has now  got an opportunity to choose. Will the emerging rapprochement  between our country and the European Union prompt the United  States to cooperate with Russia more closely?    [Shokhin] Undoubtedly, negotiations with the European Union  concerning space which had been underway for more than a year  urged the Americans on in this area. In turn, similar contacts  between Russia and the United States caused more activity among  the Europeans. That such a breakthrough has been accomplished in  the European sector cannot fail to influence the American side  now. The United States is developing cooperation with us in the  space area gradually, but further and further; from just space  launches, it is proceeding toward cooperation in the creation  and construction of orbiting stations. As recently as half a  year ago the Americans had very serious doubts about the latter  project because this meant automatically that a proportion of  the market and a proportion of the orders would be transferred  to Russia. This meant that American producers of the requisite  equipment would fail to receive the same share. However, by all  signs the issue has been resolved in our favor.    [Dikun] Which problems did you fail to resolve in Brussels?    [Shokhin] First of all, regarding aluminum exports.  Restrictions on imports from Russia to the countries of the  European Union are still in force. In this case, the interests  of primarily France, the main producer of aluminum in the  European Union, were affected. Incidentally, coordination on  space proceeded in a quite complicated manner because of France  once again. Let us say it straightforwardly: On quite a number  of issues France hindered the reaching of agreements which could  be satisfactory to the Russian Federation. It is common  knowledge that at one time the French came out as opponents of  the agreement on partnership and cooperation with Russia, saying  that it is not all that necessary for the European Union at this  stage. However, this extreme point of view did not prevail.    [Dikun] To what degree did the edict of President Yeltsin  concerning access to Russia for Western banks hinder the signing  of the declaration?    [Shokhin] This edict changed our negotiating position. It  was  very necessary for us and extremely inconvenient for them.  However, we understand full well that if one of the parties gets  a greater advantage than the other, the latter will be left  dissatisfied and will possibly try to modify the agreement,  which, naturally, no one needs. Therefore it was very important  to strike a balance on all issues during the negotiations,  including those concerning banks. I will not dwell on the  details of how the Russian Federation intends to restrict the  operations of European financiers on the Russian market during  the period of transition; I will only say that the restrictions  we are introducing are not an insurmountable barrier to banks  from the European Union countries coming to the Russian market.  Although there is no complete agreement as of this moment, let  us hope that one will be reached within a few weeks.    [Dikun] Did the release of a report on relations between  Russia and NATO by the chief of the Foreign Intelligence  Service, Yevgeniy Primakov, affect the progress of negotiations?    [Shokhin] Actually, Primakov's report aroused the interest  of  the Russian public to these problems. What had previously  proceeded within the confines of big-time politics became  available to the general public. In Brussels the position of  Russia was clearly affirmed to the effect that it is not  prepared to see NATO as an organization expanded into Central  and Eastern Europe but without the participation of Russia.  Moreover, the idea was voiced that the parallel admission of  Russia and these countries to NATO preserves the balance of  forces in Europe. Apparently this issue will be discussed in  January during the summit of the North Atlantic Union.    [Dikun] Do you project the emergence of domestic policy  obstacles which may frustrate the signing of an agreement  between Russia and the European Union, for example, in  conjunction with the election of a new parliament?    [Shokhin] I believe that not only the firm position of the  Russian delegation but also the events that occurred in  September and October were some of the main reasons for the  acceleration of the treaty process in Brussels. European  Community countries understand that it is unwise to wait until  reforms in Russia are crowned with complete success and to begin  cranking up the cooperation mechanism only after that. The  situation here is quite fluid all the time, and for this reason  everything should be done in order to speed up the reforms. In  particular, the issue is to give Russia an opportunity to make  money by way of its exports rather than count on external  financial infusions. I believe that very shortly G-7 and other  international organizations should take certain steps in this  direction. Therefore, I do not think that the situation will  somehow deteriorate because of our domestic events.    [Dikun] However, is it ruled out that another Cabinet of  Ministers will complete this endeavor on the side of Russia?    [Shokhin] The reassignment of cadres in the government could  have occurred without the election; the issue is how this  government will work with this parliament. There are two  possible scenarios. The first is to form a government which has  a parliamentary majority. However, given this array, this may be  Zhirinovskiy's government. This is why a second scenario is not  ruled out--to take advantage of the transitional provisions of  the Constitution whereby the current government will continue to  discharge its responsibilities without relinquishing its powers  before the newly elected Duma or raising the issue of a vote of  confidence in itself. Although I personally advocated the latter  before, I thought at that time that democratic blocs would be in  a majority in the parliament.    Of course, some adjustments in the government are  possible--not on the principle proposed by Zhirinovskiy, who  demands that four, five, or 10 key figures be replaced, but  proceeding rather from the need to win over for our side people  from politically adjacent parties and movements. Their  representatives will have to be included in the government to  this end.     "

According to a GRANMA report, the interview allowed the two  sides to exchange opinions on the future development of  bilateral economic relations and took place in a cordial and  friendly atmosphere, which is the primary feature of relations  between Havana and Beijing.    GRANMA points out that on Friday, both sides concluded  another successful round of Mixed Commission talks, at the end  of which the Chinese deputy minister and Cuban Foreign Trade  Minister Ricardo Cabrisas proceeded to sign a protocol that  encompasses commercial trade goals for 1994.    The PRC delegation, which is headed by the high-ranking  official, arrived in Havana last Sunday and has signed four  other mutual cooperation agreements. The agreements are aimed  at increasing the amount of Chinese food and medication being  sent to Cuba in exchange for sugar.    According to GRANMA, Hao Jianxiu provided Fidel Castro with  a  full explanation of the situation in China in light of the  agreements arrived at during the 14th CPC Congress. At the same  time, Fidel Castro sent warm and fraternal greetings to PRC  President Jiang Zemin and to State Council Premier Li Peng in  response to the best wishes sent by that Asian nation's leaders.    Carlos Lage, secretary of the Executive Committee of the  Cuban Council of Ministers, and Cabrisas represented Cuba at the  meeting.    The newspaper adds that each countries' respective  ambassadors, Jose A. Guerra Menchero and Xu Yicong; other  members of the Chinese mission; and representatives of Chinese  enterprises involved in economic relations with Cuba were also  present during the meeting.    The Caribbean island is Beijing's No. 2 trading partner in  Latin America. In 1993, trade between the two countries  surpassed $400 million and included the sale of Chinese rice,  bicycles, and machinery spare parts in exchange for Cuban  nickel, biotechnology products, citrus products, and sugar.

Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 26 March reports that  Guantanamo  Province has been one of the most outstanding provinces in  harvest emulation during the period between 11 and 20 March.  Guantanamo has been cited in 7 of the 14 aspects rated in the  harvest emulation, and it also intends to increase sugar  production and fulfill its plan.    In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that  approximately 13,000 low-cost houses will be built in Sancti  Spiritus Province by 1996 using local resources. This will help  triple the number of houses built per year in this province,  which is experiencing a tremendous shortage of energy, cement,  and steel. Approximately 2,000 houses are under construction,  most in 40 high-priority zones.    Rebelde adds in the same newscast that the U.S. Conference  of  Catholic Bishops has donated 7 tons of medicines worth $2.5  million to Cuba.    Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision at 0100 GMT on 28 March report  that Camaguey canecutters are engaged in a campaign to increase  production and efficiency. In 80 days they cut 2 million arrobas  of cane and are talking about cutting another million, if  necessary.    In the same newscast, Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision report  that as the water shortage continues, farmers are resorting to  old techniques to provide water to their cattle. One said he is  using a mule to draw water from a deep well for his milk cows  because bringing in water tanks costs an arm and a leg.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 28 March reports that a new  system for selling medicines has been implemented with positive  results in Holguin Province pharmacies. The pharmacies ""have  been linked"" to polyclinics and assistance centers, and  ""pharmaceutical products that used to disappear off the shelves  in a single day now last up to a month....Doctors at polyclinics  and assistance centers now know daily what products are  available.""    In the same newscast, the radio reports that only 326 of the  6,751 pieces of medical equipment at Matanzas Province  assistance centers are currently out of service because they are  broken. This constitutes a praiseworthy achievement by the  workers of the provincial electromedical technical services  center.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 28 March reports that  specialists and technicians from the Rayonitro enterprise in  Matanzas are satisfactorily carrying out tests to obtain  ammonium dicyanate,""a reagent that is of interest in producing  meningitis vaccine."" Rayonitro engineer Damaso Lopez said there  is currently a plant that ""facilitates production of carbon  bisulphide, which is raw material for processing the reagent in  question."" Rayonitro can currently make, industrially, some 60  tons per year of carbon bisulphide, considerably reducing the  amount Cuba has to import. ""Carbon bisulphide is a dense,  transparent, very volatile liquid. Its cost on the world market  is between $2,000 and 2,500 per ton, while by employing the  Matanzas technology, its use is facilitated at a cost of just  500 pesos the ton.""    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 28 March reports that the  oilworkers of Ciego de Avila Province met 105 percent of their  plan for the extraction of crude oil for the first quarter of  1994 by extracting 17,373 tons before the deadline. They also  drilled 5,005 meters instead of the 2,520 established in their  drilling program.    In the same newscast, Radio Rebelde reports that over the  past two years, 60 caballerias of cacao have been planted with  hybrid seeds that have a high genetic potential and are  resistant to environmental adversity. The seeds were produced by  the cacao research station located in Baracoa Municipality,  Guantanamo Province, the municipality that produces the greatest  number of seeds from plants resistant to pests, disease, and bad  weather. Guantanamo Province produces close to 80 percent of the  national cacao crop of between 35,000 and 45,000 quintals yearly.    Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 28 March reports that tobacco  enterprises in Pinar del Rio are picking the capa dura leaves  which are normally discarded during the harvest. They plan to  use these leaves in domestic cigarettes and cigars.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 29 March reports that up to 26  March, the sugar agroindustry had planted 2,740 caballerias of  sugarcane, 80 percent of the amount scheduled for planting by  the end of this month. The provinces of Camaguey, Havana,  Matanzas, Cienfuegos, and Guantanamo are outstanding in this  activity.    Radio Reloj at 1500 GMT on 29 March reports that the (Juan  Jose Berdesi) and Jose Maria Perez brigades have cut 2 million  arrobas of sugarcane, becoming the first to reach this amount  during the current harvest in Santiago de Cuba Province.    Radio Reloj at 2057 GMT on 29 March reports that 1 million  quintals of potatoes have been harvested in Havana Province.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 29 March reports that a fish  farm in Los Palacios Municipality has successfully bred a  Chinese variety known as the (fenca china). In the first tests  in 10 ponds, 6 million eggs were obtained, of which 4.2 million  hatched. Radio Rebelde also reports that 46 quintals of  sunflower seeds have been harvested in Cienfuegos to produce  cooking oil.     "

But those forecasts were not  to be realized.    The regular meetings held between our countries' leaders are  the best indicator of the scale of bilateral relations in the  political sphere. Perhaps no other state leader in Europe  maintains such close contacts with the Russian Federation  president as Chancellor Kohl: There are reciprocal visits and a  constant exchange of opinions with Boris Yeltsin by telephone  and in the form of personal messages. Yesterday the Russian  president arrived in Germany on an official visit, and in August  he will take part in the send-off ceremony for the Russian  troops.    The cooperation between the two states rests on a  strengthening treaty and legal basis. Twenty five  intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements have been  signed in the recent period alone.    Germany is now one of Russia's main economic partners. It  accounts for 17 percent of our foreign trade turnover. Russia  is a very important partner for the FRG in the east. Fifty-five  production-sharing contracts, mainly in machine building, are  now in operation between the two countries' companies. More  than 100 companies in production, trade, transport and dispatch,  insurance, and other areas of cooperation have been set up in  Germany using Russian capital. A considerable amount of our  exports to the FRG go via them.    The German side is helping the process of privatization in  Russia. The spectrum is diverse, ranging from the formation of  the legal bases of private enterprise to joint research efforts  and specific projects. For example, a company promoting  economic reforms in the Moscow Oblast is operating with active  German government department support and oversight. The  Wintershall Erdgas Handelshaus joint venture is functioning  successfully.    Enterprises with German share capital on Russian Federation  territory number more than 1,700. Germany is entering into  cooperation with Russia in the implementation of international  space projects. It also intends to make its contribution to the  program of implementing projects of ours in chemical production,  power generation, capital construction, and aircraft  construction. Business relations are being set up between our  two states' regions.    Sessions of the Russian-German Cooperation Council for  Economic, Scientific, and Technical Cooperation are held  regularly. A bureau for a representative [delegat] of the  German economy has been opened in St. Petersburg. Special  bursaries for Russian graduates of higher educational  institutions studying management, economics, and production  organization are being established in a number of German  concerns, for example, Daimler-Benz AG.    The FRG government intends to promote the involvement of  German private capital in Russian reforms. According to  experts' figures, German companies, with a total capital of $4.2  billion, make up 60 percent of foreign investors in Russia.    The FRG has helped in no small way the development of  relations between Russia and the EU. Moscow and Bonn are  stepping up their cooperation at the UN and CSCE level. It has  stated its readiness to support Russia's membership application  to the Council of Europe and is in favor of the creation of  strategic partnership relations between Russia and NATO.    Bonn has welcomed Russian diplomacy's efforts to unblock  the crisis situation over Sarajevo. The stances of Russia and  the FRG regarding the solution of the Yugoslav crisis coincide  to a large extent and there are no substantial disagreements.    All-around contacts are maintained in the military sphere.  Joint maritime exercises involving naval combined units will be  conducted this year. Troop exercises at the level of tactical  subunits are planned in the future. A center for training and  retraining our servicemen returning from Germany in civilian  specialisms was recently opened in the Russian capital with FRG  financial assistance. The sides are cooperating effectively in  the sphere of eliminating nuclear and chemical weapons.    A joint Russian-German commission for the reciprocal return  of cultural treasures removed during World War II has begun  work. Consultations on events to mark its 50th anniversary are  being held.    The problem of the ethnic Germans on Russian Federation  territory is a very important aspect of Russian-German  relations. A protocol was signed in July 1992 which envisages  cooperation in the phased restoration of the Russian Germans'  statehood and better provision of facilities in areas where they  represent a high proportion of the population. This year the  FRG will allocate 65 million German marks [DM] for these  purposes. For the first time Russia's draft budget earmarks 30  billion rubles likewise. Thanks to these measures, it has been  possible to check somewhat the growth of repatriation of Russian  Germans to Germany.    But our relations are not unclouded. Touching on problems in  the economic sphere, reciprocal trade turnover last year,  according to preliminary figures, was DM20.5 billion as against  DM21.8 billion in 1992. The worrying thing is that Moscow has  not to date been able to repay the debt of approximately DM40  billion accumulated since Soviet times. True, an  intergovernmental accord consolidating the foreign debts of  Russia and the former USSR was signed in September 1993. We  have been granted a 10-year deferment of payment on DM8  billions' worth of debt.    The question of German investments in the Russian economy is  critical. The amount of investment is substantially less than  in, say, a country like Hungary. This year new arrangements  regulating the cost of export credit guarantees have been  introduced through the well-known FRG company Hermes: We now  have to put 15 percent up-front in order to obtain credit  guarantees. This makes it less interesting for us to take them  up.    But these sore points can be treated. Boris Yeltsin's visit  to our friendly neighboring country will undoubtedly make a  substantial contribution to further deepening all-around  Russian-German parnership links.     "

As part of the 15th Cuba '94 Tourism Convention, the  minister  met with nearly 120 foreign and local reporters who were given  detailed information about the reorganization of this economic  sector in Cuba.    He confirmed the presence at this fair of representatives  from 26 nations, 13 from America, 12 from Europe, and Algeria,  who is attending for the first time.    Cienfuegos reiterated that last year, Cuba earned  approximately $720 million in gross revenue from tourism, a 30  percent increase compared to 1992. For 1994, he added, the  revenue is expected to reach $900 million as a result of greater  efficiency and better training of personnel.    He explained that in the 12 months ending in December, an  average hotel occupancy rate of 50 percent was achieved, but  that the new facilities, such as the Melia, have satisfactory  occupancy rates.    The minister described his ministry's structure -- with only  50 officials -- as compact, adding that it was created under the  concept of efficiency, which should prevail.    He also said that 560,000 tourists entered the country in  1993. The largest number came from Canada, Germany, Mexico, and  Spain, indicating that 54,100 arrived from Spain. He compared  these figures with the plans to reach 1 million visitors in  1995, adding that tour operators and agencies are focusing on  that objective.    As an element of comparison, he said 20 million vacationers  visited the Caribbean last year, with a 50 percent distribution  between hotel installations and cruise ships. He said Cuba must  become the preferential market in the area, adding that it does  not plan to compete with its neighbors but to seek regional  integration.     "

In an address to the German-Russian Forum in Bonn,  Kinkel said that Germany wants a Russia that is open to the  world, stable, and democratic, a country that can be a  competitive economic partner and a reliable pillar in an  all-European peace system. ""This would be the best security  guarantee for our entire continent."" However, it cannot be  ignored that there are forces in Russia whose ideas of their  country's role are fundamentally different. ""Those people in  Russia who believe they could improve their rating at home by  falling back to behavioral patterns in foreign policy from the  Soviet era that everybody thought were part of the past, must  know that they risk new isolation and confrontation."" Germany  is taking seriously the spirit and letter of the UN Charter, the  Final Act of Helsinki, and the Paris Charter: ""We expect Russia  to do the same."" Germany wants to extend cooperation, but  remains determined in its defense of fundamental behavioral  standards for European security: ""In the new Europe there is no  room for so-called spheres of vital interests.""    Germany's policy toward the other countries in Central and  East Europe and on the territory of the former Soviet Union  pursues independent objectives, Kinkel said. He referred to the  worries of those countries: ""It would be fundamentally wrong to  see them as tools for our Russia policy."" Germany was aspiring  toward ever-closer integration of its Eastern neighbors into the  Euro- Atlantic forms of stability, ""which will finally also  include full membership."" Russia should be integrated into these  ""security structures."" If the smaller Eastern neighbors were to  grow into the security structures, then the relations with the  other countries in the East must be intensified at the same  time. For Russia the growing together of Europe does not  constitute a threat but an increase in stability, security, and  economic opportunities. Kinkel warned Moscow against taking  steps of its own in the conflicts in the Caucasus or other  bordering areas: ""When it comes to settling bloody conflicts in  the CIS, we have to ensure that peacekeeping missions are  carried out under the auspices and the principles of the CSCE;  this requires the agreement of all parties involved."" Ambiguous  terms such as ""immediate neighborhood"" do not fit into our time:  ""As Europe is growing together we are all becoming the  immediate neighborhood for one another; Russia does not  constitute a special case here."" Besides, the term ""immediate  neighborhood"" was blurring the differences between individual  CIS states. For all states on the area of the former Soviet  Union the following must apply without any restrictions: ""Full  respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  inviolability of existing borders."" Kinkel said that it was the  task of Russian diplomacy to build up relations with Moscow's  new neighbors that are based on trust and mutual respect: ""That  is a crucial issue for Europe.""    Nowhere were people reacting more sensibly to Russia's  position toward Europe than in the Baltics and in Ukraine.  Kinkel requested: ""The remaining Russian forces must leave  Latvia and Estonia by the end of August 1994."" The Baltics  could constitute the first proof that openness toward the world  and cooperation in partnership are superior to a way of thinking  that is guided by spheres of influence and hegemonic privileges.  Kinkel added: ""Therefore, I am in favor of consistently  connecting the Baltic states to the European Union."" Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania need associated membership agreements  including the same ""entry prospects"" that are contained in the  existing Europe agreement with Poland and Hungary. ""No threat  but a lasting impulse for parallel developments in the  neighboring Russia will emanate from the Baltics that feel safe  and begin to prosper."" However, Russia does have a legitimate  interest in preventing discrimination against Russian  minorities. Germany has advocated reasonable conciliation  consistent with the CSCE rules; the efforts by the CSCE's  minority commissioner have been ""quite successful."" Kinkel  recommended Russia and Ukraine to conclude a comprehensive  agreement on good neighborly relations, border guarantees, and  minority protection to ease tense relations.    ""Russia is of vital importance for European security,""  Kinkel  said. Russia remains the most important country in Europe and  Asia. ""Ecological problems and disasters in this part of our  continent will not leave us unaffected."" Like every other  country, Russia is pursuing interests of its own that are not  always and everywhere identical with Germany's: ""A self-assured  Russia is not necessarily a threat; conversely, a Russia that is  cooperative is not necessarily an easy partner."" What is  necessary is a business-like policy of accommodation of  interests and continuously growing confidence.    The resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Gaydar and Finance  Minister Fedorov created doubts about the new government's  reform course and its will to carry on with the reforms: ""There  is now a threat of a loss of confidence, not only at the level  of international financial institutions but also that of foreign  investors and the population at home."" Since the beginning of  the year, the ruble lost one-quarter of its value abroad. The  flight of capital from Russia is assessed at more than $1  billion per month. Unless Russian economic policy manages to  create investment opportunities at home, it cannot expect too  much from foreign capital. Kinkel said that one must hope that  the statements by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin that the reforms  would continue will be decisive for the course of the new  government. The G7 stand by their financial support, but these  alone are not enough to create the necessary structural changes  in Russia. Kinkel added: ""But there will not be more money for  less reform."" The federal foreign minister argued: ""Regarding  our support for the reforms we have to keep a balance between  our own fundamental convictions and what can be expected from  the people in Russia."" Apart from stabilizing the national  economy a system of social security independent of enterprises  is recommended. Only then can the course of reform gain wide  support. Yet, without reforms lasting improvement of social  conditions will not be possible. With almost 90 billion German  marks [DM], Germany has contributed most for Russia and more  than half of the entire international aid. Germany is in favor  of Russia's getting closer to the OECD. ""We would welcome it if  Russia were to become a member of the Council of Europe.""  Russia should become a partner with equal rights in the G7.  Germany was also supporting the efforts for early conclusion of  negotiations on a cooperation agreement between the EU and  Russia. In 1994, Germany will open consulates in Kaliningrad  (former Koenigsberg), Saratov, and Novosibirsk and is anxious to  increase exchange in all spheres.     "

They want to travel through those countries to reach  their final destination: the United States. Various U.S.  Administrations have used different methods to encourage  desertions during our people's long struggle and have proclaimed  with fanfare the need to exterminate the bad example Cuba has  set on this continent.    Encouragement for illegal escapes and forced entries into  diplomatic missions has increased recently, almost in geometric  proportion to the increasing solidarity Cuba has awakened in the  civilized world due to its unwavering position in the face of an  aggressive and clumsy policy. Seeking to propitiate the  occurrence of these irresponsible actions, visas are  systematically denied to those who want to emigrate; immigration  accords are not fulfilled; and, while legal obstacles increase,  the coasts are kept open to welcome, with ample media coverage,  those who manage to survive this odyssey.    Quite a few in Miami have established a lucrative business  by  trafficking in human beings. Our people are convinced that if  the goals were truly humanitarian, visas would simply be given  to everyone who requested one, illegal arrivals onto the  territory would be banned, and opportunities would be given to  those who want to live in the promised land. It, however, is a  promised land rather than a granted land, except with the risk  of one's life. Such is the case of those now occupying the  three diplomatic missions. Our intention is not to offend  anyone who wants to emigrate. While we respect the people's  right to live wherever they want, we will let no one swindle us  into granting nonexistent categories to people who simply  immigrate for personal reasons, family reasons, or economic  reasons or simply for adventure. That is going too far.    The Belgian hotel's guests include 34 people who have been  warned about markedly antisocial behavior and 25 others who have  been prosecuted for common crimes, including breaking and  entering -- an experience that undoubtedly facilitated the task  of breaking into the diplomatic missions. A total of 25  children -- including the world's youngest political refugee,  who is only a few months old -- were dragged into an adventure  that could only have one ending. Oblivious of the drama in which  their impulsive parents forced them to participate, they face  food problems and live in extremely close quarters. The most  critical thing is that once the alleged political refugees  illegally and disrespectfully entered the Belgian ambassador's  residence, they used the facilities to establish an alleged  organization, distribute propaganda, and display signs under the  Belgian mission's roof.    We must remember that diplomatic missions cannot be used as  centers for political activities against the host country  because this violates the functions for which they are  accredited. The Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted in a  responsible way by instructing its ambassador to notify his  guests about the nature of the illegal action they have  perpetrated because it violates that country's territory and  Cuban laws, and to ask them to abstain from carrying out  provocative acts in his garden.    We must note that our guards were calm. Their composure  prevented injuries even when their lives were in danger. A  total of 46 of the occupants have already abandoned the  facilities and are home. We must explain that whoever is guilty  of a crime before or during the action of violently entering an  embassy will have to answer for this. For example, the  criminals who stole a truck and damaged state property by  crashing through the German Embassy's gate will have to answer  to the authorities -- not because of the illegal entry, because  we have given guarantees both to Belgium and Germany on this  occasion as a gesture of goodwill toward their governments.  These guarantees, however, do not include immunity for other  crimes. To exonerate the criminals would encourage them to break  into diplomatic missions. Some of them are repeat offenders,  and this is simply inadmissible.    Cuba knows that most of the diplomatic corps accredited to  our country understand and coincide with our government's  position, and they cooperate in this concern. This is the time  to underscore our staunch principle: Absolutely no one who  enters a diplomatic mission by force will be authorized to leave  the country either now or later. This is a nonnegotiable  position, and we will not give in under any circumstances. It  would be easy for Cuba to expedite the way for those who opt to  enter the embassies. Who would pay the consequences? Who would  be left at the mercy of any intruder who violates the immunity  of his territory with the intention of emigrating? What would  be the position of the governments of these countries if  Haitians who are now repatriated en masse preferred to break  into their diplomatic missions? What if, instead of risking  their lives at a border bristling with rifles to hunt them down,  Mexican wetbacks opted to jump the walls at the European or  Latin American missions in Mexico City? Cuba has a  responsibility to protect diplomatic missions. It is dutybound  to protect the immunity and inviolability of their territories,  and it will strictly fulfill its duty.    The experience derived from over three decades of  withstanding blackmail, a blockade, and a direct and indirect  aggression have taught us that we cannot give an inch. You lose  every principle that you give up. That is the best guarantee  for those who represent their countries in Cuba. It is always  appropriate to ask: What is the purpose? Is it perhaps to  establish this option as a legitimate way to leave the country?  Inaugurate in Cuba a new style of getting documents to enter a  country, a style different from the one which exists in other  capitals? Artificially encourage a political situation for  reasons that are suspiciously similar to the ones the United  States is fruitlessly trying to create? Complicate things for  our country during the recently concluded fourth Ibero-American  summit in Cartagena de Indias?    We have yet to lose heart before powerful enemies. We have  resisted despite adversity. We are not a nation that can be  intimidated or put on the defendant's chair. It is time  something is understood once and for all: Cuba does not admit  pressure, regardless of where it comes from or who exerts the  pressure. We were taught courage, and we learned the lesson  well. We were taught unwavering principles, and we are good  students. We were taught that the enemy cannot be given a  single inch, and we are faithful disciples. Cuba is serene.  Nothing clouds the clear conscience of a nation that has  courageously faced difficult tests. Our Foreign Ministry has  amply explained our revolutionary government's position. It is  willing to fully cooperate with accredited diplomatic missions  to solve their conflict and even prevent future problems in a  sensible way.    The people who have sought asylum at the Belgian, German,  and  Chilean missions have only one option: To unconditionally leave  the same way they entered.     "

It stated that Cuban President Fidel Castro  rejected the application of reforms proposed by former Spanish  Economy Minister Carlos Solchaga. According to the newspaper,  described by Allende as ""a series of ridiculous things,""  Solchaga, in a secret report drafted after a trip to Havana,  proposed a rapid transition to capitalism, which Castro rejected.    Allende also denied that Yago Pico de Coana handed her, as  EL  PAIS published yesterday, a list of prisoners of conscience that  the Spanish Government would like freed before Robaina's visit.  ""We discussed Robaina's visit; there is no new list,"" Allende  stated. He stressed that this question (the alleged list of  prisoners) did not occupy even one moment of our conversation.""  [no opening quotation marks as received]    ""The Cuban foreign minister was invited by his Spanish  colleague Javier Solana. The government has not set any  conditions for Robaina's visit,"" she said. ""I believe the visit  is important, but it is not something extraordinary; it will be  a working visit and bilateral relations, among other things,  will be discussed,"" Allende said.    Regarding the departure from Cuba of Alina Fernandez, Fidel  Castro's illegitimate daughter, the Cuban diplomat said that ""it  has not had any special repercussions; we do not normally  prevent people from leaving. Many people depart Cuba and Cuban  migration is a topic that is manipulated extraordinarily,""  Allende added and admitted that ""there are many people who  migrate from Cuba in search of better living and working  conditions.""    The vice minister announced that Cuba is preparing for a  meeting with the Cuban community abroad that wants to cooperate  with the government's current project.    On the topic of the U.S. blockade, Allende pointed out that  the Cuban Government has never offered anything in exchange for  an end to the blockade, ""because it is illegal."" Nevertheless,  she added, right now there is a ""less aggressive language""  between the two countries.    Regarding the peasant and Indian uprising in the Mexican  State of Chiapas, the diplomat stated that ""we are interested in  a strong Mexico, without social conflicts, and we want  everything to work the best possible way.""

I will deal with only the main directions of the programs.    Let us start with the Russia's Choice program. It does not  contain populist promises or idle talk. Priority problems are  clearly identified, and the program says what needs to be done  and how.    The cornerstone is bringing down inflation, that is,  bringing  it down to 3 percent a month by the end of 1994. This is a bit  too much as compared to countries with stable economies (which  have 2-4 percent a year), but it would still make our life  easier than it is now. In August inflation was 28 percent; in  September a little less--22 percent; in October--24 percent; and  in November--15 percent. I should note that how steadily  inflation subsides will depend on how we all work.    It was inflation more than anything else that pushed the  voters into Zhirinovskiy's embrace. It irritates people more  than high prices and a low standard of living, especially  considering that in 1993 the latter rose somewhat as compared to  1992, although we still have not returned to the standard of  living of the relatively prosperous years. The entire decline in  the standard of living occurred during the first year of reforms.    Our country is not the first or the last to fall into the  inflation trap. Inflation, like an invisible thief, picks every  pocket. It would seem that people are already paid relatively  well--the average monthly wage in Russia has long exceeded the  100,000-ruble [R] mark, but this money melts away in front of  our very eyes. You have to run and buy something quick, because  prices go up instantly. I would not even mention that at this  level of inflation it is impossible to save rubles. Every family  loses in this respect, and the poor more than all the others.    If we manage to bring inflation down, every family will  benefit, too. This will by itself raise the standard of living.  Besides, capital investment is only possible after inflation has  been reined in. There are no precedents in the immense history  of the world of investment and growth of production beginning  before inflation is brought down. This does not happen.    That is why Russia's Choice did not promise that next year  would be a year of economic growth, rather that the work of the  government should create the preconditions for it beginning in  1995, provided there is stability in the country. Do not jerk  the government; give it a year to work normally, and the  conditions will be laid down for Russia's development for the  next 10-15 years. Then you will not recognize our country. After  all, there has been a Japanese miracle, Italian, Spanish, and  German... There will be a Russian one, too. But it took every  country 10-15 years. This is a normal time frame. It is silly to  believe in a fast--and double at that--increase in the  population's income, as LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia] leader Zhirinovskiy promised.    Taxes are another acute issue in the programs, which  affected  voter sympathies. Russia's Choice said honestly: It is  impossible to cut taxes right now. And I will add that lowering  them would be useless from the standpoint of economic  development. Until inflation is brought down, the benefits  accrued to tax-paying goods producers would immediately go into  raising salaries rather than investment. Income freed from taxes  would be converted to wages. And nothing else.    The Russia's Choice program envisages three kinds of taxes.  The greater part of the tax on profit and value-added tax  remains in local budgets. These are local, or municipal, taxes.  There are regional taxes, which are collected, for instance,  into the budget of an oblast, kray, or republic. In my  estimation, approximately one-third of all taxes should be  transferred into the federal budget. This sensible taxation  creates an economic foundation for staving off sovereignization  of Russia's regions. Create conditions for local enterprises'  operations and collect taxes from them for the local budget,  because they are mostly local.    Draft laws are ready on real estate taxes and introducing a  tax for use of natural resources. Most countries do this. The  total sum of taxes does not increase; it is simply that part of  it is shifted from tax on profit into tax on real estate and  natural resources.    The program for bringing inflation down is realistic, and it  is already being implemented. Taking advantage of the fact that  nobody interfered with the government's work over the past few  months, preferential credits to sectors and enterprises were  suspended already in September. I was baffled, though, to see  the president sign an edict giving agriculture preferential  credit in the amount in excess of R300 billion a few days ago.  This is an unpleasant deviation from the program, but not a  catastrophic one. In essence, it is again propping up kolkhozes  and sovkhozes, and one can see why: the agrarian lobby is  pushing it.    Tax preferences with respect to tax on profit and  value-added  tax have been reduced. So many preferences have proliferated  that nobody knew any more who was supposed to pay taxes to the  treasury, and how much.    Another anti-inflation measure: All import subsidies have  been removed, except subsidies for purchases of medications and  medical equipment. Until recently such subsidies consumed 12  percent of total national income. Now if you want to buy  something for dollars--be my guest, but buy your dollars at the  current exchange rate like everybody else and stop begging the  treasury for cheap hard currency. There had been incidents when  the treasury, sympathetic to someone in a bind--textile  producers need to buy dyes, they would say, and car makers need  to buy equipment (everyone had a good reason)--sold dollars tens  or even hundreds times below their market value.    Various nonbudget funds have been merged into budget funds,  that is, they came under the jurisdiction of the government.  This is also a serious anti-inflation measure. It is outrageous  when the means of nonbudget funds exceed the entire Russian  budget, as happened last year. The pension fund had been under  the control of the Supreme Soviet; social security by tradition  was the province of trade unions; the fuel and energy complex  had its own fund; and so on... The result was that the  government had under its control a smaller part of national  finances than the agencies that controlled nonbudget funds. It  is impermissible for several financial systems to operate within  one country.    I am enumerating only those anti-inflation measures that  have  already been implemented or are in the process of being  implemented; this means that the Russia's Choice program is  quite realistic as long as they stick to it.    Of course, anti-inflation measures are harsh. If, for  instance, a defense enterprise does not get preferential credit,  it may potentially face bankruptcy, which will cause  unemployment and possibly a social explosion. But unless tough  anti-inflation measures are taken, we will see a Ukrainization  of the Russian economy. What this entails is quite graphic.  There is no alternative, and Russia's Choice said so honestly,  which is the main distinguishing feature of this program as  compared to others.    Ninety percent of the major program planks of G.  Yavlinskiy's  bloc probably coincide with the Russia's Choice program.  Nevertheless, each plank in Yavlinskiy's program is preceded by  berating the government: We would have done it better!  Naturally, they do not say how.    There is, however, one principal difference. G. Yavlinskiy  proposes to stretch the anti-inflation program through 1997.  Broken down by year, it looks like this: 1994--monthly inflation  at 15-20 percent, that is, it remains at the current level. In  1995--10-15 percent a month. In 1996 inflation will be reduced  to 3-8 percent, and in 1997--2 percent a month.    Now let us look what a monthly inflation of 15-20 percent  will bring us next year. Prices will rise 10-fold over the year.  This year we also had a ninefold increase in prices, and we say  quite correctly that it is impossible to go on living this way.    If the current rate of inflation remains for the entire  1994,  as G. Yavlinskiy's program proposes, it will, of course, create  a reserve for the implementation of social programs and support  for priority sectors in production. But this will be support  provided by paper money not backed up by anything, or by empty  figures in noncash transactions.    I cannot say that stretching the anti-inflation thrust is  the  result of evil intentions or thoughtlessness. The leaders of  this bloc see the situation differently and, in my opinion,  overestimate the potential for social explosion resulting from  some sector not getting subsidies or the absence of new social  programs. But it has already become clear to the population that  when production declines, handing money out to enterprises does  not raise the standard of living.    G. Yavlinskiy's program envisages budget investment in  sectors that act as locomotives, that is, those that will pull  along other sectors and bring them up. At the top of the list,  however, are budget investments in....the space program and  aviation industry, followed by housing construction. Of course,  the Russia's Choice program, too, envisages support for some  sectors, but why give the space program priority? Such priority  seems very questionable to me, because the treasury's ability is  very limited. And, as I have already mentioned, budget  investment is completely impermissible. We are already fed up  with it. Practically all investment in the Soviet economy came  from the budget, that is, from the state.    We had 500,000 ongoing construction projects, spreading the  money thin, burying it into the soil and foundations, and did  not properly complete a single needed construction project. And  what we did build turned out to either be harmful, such as  canals, or a nonpriority, such as the BAM [Baykal-Amur Main  Line], because it was the state that decided where to put the  money.    Budget investment may be justified perhaps in construction  of  housing for the poor and perhaps in railroads with the  participation of private joint-stock capital. But, I repeat,  investment, especially private (which should comprise the  predominant part of it), is only possible when the ruble is  stable, not in the conditions of 15-20 percent a month  inflation. There are no fools.    G. Yavlinskiy's program also contains purely populist  promises; for instance, it promises--and at a rather high level  at that--budget support for science and culture. If this is so,  it would be good to be more precise regarding at whose expense  such support would be achieved. Science will get support, but  someone else's share in the budget will be reduced. Whose?  Pensioners? Teachers or doctors; builders or miners? There is no  other method of budget financing.    Over the past three years the share of science and culture  in  the budget has not diminished, but remained at the same level.  But in real rubles, of course, the magnitude of appropriations  has dropped by about 30 percent. The share of science and  culture in the budget will be filled with increasingly greater  amounts of money not expropriated from others only as the  economy begins to pick up.    It is more difficult to comment on Zhirinovskiy's economic  program, since it is scattered all over in verbal statements and  publications, although some points of it have been announced. As  an economist, however, I cannot seriously analyze it. The  program consists of a bunch of populist promises, most of which  cannot be fulfilled. Those that are in fact realistic already  have been or are being implemented by the government, but  Vladimir Volfovich still makes these promises.    His biggest promise to the voters is to double the  population's real income in a matter of six months.    ""How do we do that?"" Zhirinovskiy was asked. He named two  major, in his opinion, sources.    First--stop nonrepayable aid to CIS countries. But the  government has already done this. Beginning 1 January 1994  Russia will trade with CIS countries only at world prices.  Nonpayments or debts of former republics have been converted  into credits. True, the interest rate is a bit low, but we  cannot get more from them. So, the first source of immediate  enrichment for the population named by Zhirinovskiy already has  been exhausted.    The second source, in his opinion, is to stop conversion and  sell arms. He told the public the figure of earnings from arms  sales: allegedly $30-32 billion a year. Such earnings have never  existed, and cannot be real. Theoretically, the USSR sold this  much worth of arms. But last year income from arms sales was  slightly less than $2 billion. And prior to that Russia did not  get anything for arms deliveries to regimes friendly to the  USSR. All in all, the Communists left Russia an ""inheritance"" of  $130 billion. This is how much has been handed out to other  countries, and mainly it is debts for arms shipments. None of  the debtors has ever paid or intends to pay. It is hardly  realistic to demand these billions in payments. India and Egypt  pay some, but this is small change. Cuba alone owes us $18  billion, and they are merely laughing: the debt we incurred was  not to Russia, they say. Thus, earnings of $30-32 billion a year  from arms sales belongs in the realm of nonscientific fiction.    Thus, the sources through which Zhirinovskiy promised to  double the population's real income in six months simply do not  exist.    His program also promises support for state enterprises, but  it does not say how this would be done. If it is support through  preferential credits, inflation will have to be let loose.    I do not think I need to repeat what will happen next....    V. Zhirinovskiy promises regulated prices. As it turned out,  this is the most desirable device in the understanding of most  voters. But if we begin regulating prices, we will inevitably  have to freeze wages. Otherwise, wages will jump, and with fixed  prices the population will sweep the stores clean. As a result,  the stores will be empty and money will be worth absolutely  nothing. In this respect, too, Zhirinovskiy proposes a  Ukrainization of the Russian economy without using this  particular word.    The harm done to Russia by Zhirinovskiy's foreign policy  statements is already obvious; this is being enunciated quite  clearly. Through Zhirinovskiy's efforts, NATO is moving closer  to Russia's borders; Ukraine has practically rejected nuclear  disarmament; he has threatened Japan with a nuclear bomb, and  all of us--with friendship with S. Husayn.    Zhirinovskiy is war, poverty, complete disintegration of the  economy, and hyperinflation.     "

Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina addressed numerous  local and foreign journalists after officially announcing ""The  Nation and the Immigrants"" conference, scheduled for April in  this capital, and he outlined the characteristics of this  meeting.    The foreign minister recalled that contacts between Cubans  who live abroad and their country of origin have been  systematically undermined following the victory of the  revolution by Washington's hostile policy toward the Caribbean  island.    Cuba cannot continue to wait until relations with the United  States improve before attending to immigrant problems in a  civilized, coherent, and correct manner, because they do not  depend on current differences with the White House, he said.    Robaina said the event, scheduled for 22, 23, and 24 April,  will gather in Havana approximately 200 representatives of  Cubans who live in numerous countries throughout the world.    Although the largest delegation will come from the United  States, where the largest number of immigrants have settled, the  foreign minister said delegations will also arrive from Spain,  Venezuela, Mexico, Panama, Slovakia, Mozambique, Namibia,  Trinidad and Tobago, and the Czech Republic, among others.    Four Cuban Government officials will be in charge of  outlining essential issues during the meeting, and this will  serve as the basis for debates.    Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the  People's Government, will discuss the immigration issue in a  general context; Carlos Lage, vice president of the Council of  Ministers, will deal with conditions within the current economic  period, as well as the country's possibilities in the future.    Moreover, Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of  Cuban Writers and Artists, will talk about Cuban culture and  immigrant intellectuals' contributions; and Robaina will  personally talk about the tasks which correspond to Cubans  living inside the country and abroad to sponsor relations with  other countries.    Robaina emphasized: Even though all pending issues will not  be solved within three days, the goal is to start a discussion  on topics of interest, including procedures to be carried out  for trips, immigration permits, ways to help relatives, cultural  exchange, and nationality problems.    A gap must be filled, a hand must be offered to many  immigrants who seek to maintain a normal relationship with their  country, and the number of people who want to do this tends to  increase, he said.    He said: The conference will be held with absolute respect  for everyone's opinion and without provisions, which is how Cuba  would be willing to talk with Washington concerning any  improvement of relations.    The foreign minister recalled that, as far as immigration  affairs are concerned, the U.S. Government has always failed to  implement the agreements reached with Cuba. In reply to another  question, he said those who endorse an anti-Cuban hysteria would  not be allowed to attend the conference.    In reply to another question, he said the announcement of  this conference does not represent a concession, or a sign of  weakness, because everyone knows Cuba would never choose that  option.     "

Dyakov; place and date not given; under the rubric ""Exclusive  Interview"": ""Yevgeniy Saburov: Agreement With Russia Signed""]    [Text] Negotiations were held between government  delegations of Russia and Crimea in Moscow. On returning to  Simferopol from the Russian capital, Ye.F. Saburov, deputy prime  minister of the Crimean Government, answered our correspondent's  questions.    [Dyakov] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, what news did you bring from  Moscow?    [Saburov] As a result of the just-completed negotiations,  the  parties signed a Russian-Crimean framework intergovernmental  trade and economic agreement. This document defines the  boundaries within which Russia and Crimea undertake to develop  mutually profitable business relations. We speak here of trade  and economic ties. We will create the most favorable conditions  for entities engaged in economic activities.    Within the framework of this agreement, agencies and  enterprises will be able to enter into economic contracts  between themselves. This will lead to an expansion of  Russian-Crimean trade. For us, relations with our Russian  partners are very important. Thanks to a strengthening of these  ties, we will be able to speed up the implementation of economic  reforms.    [Dyakov] But the ties also existed in the past. Why was it  necessary to formalize them in an agreement?    [Saburov] It is true that Crimea is linked with Russia by a  myriad invisible threads. After the disintegration of the Soviet  Union, however, economic relations became more complicated. A  new and rather difficult situation emerged. Customs and other  artificial barriers arose between Crimea and Russia. Simply  talking about removing these barriers cannot solve the problem.  Thanks to these agreements, relations with Russia have been  elevated to a new, higher level. The two governments undertook  an obligation to facilitate the expansion of cooperation in  every way.    [Dyakov] Apparently, the framework agreement is to be  followed by concrete steps in bringing Crimea and Russia closer  together in the economic sense, is it not?    [Saburov] Some steps already have been taken to fill the  outlined framework with concrete content. For instance, Russia  had a limit on how much cash could be taken out of the country,  including to Crimea. It was set at 500,000 rubles [R]. Too  little for vacationers at current prices. Now this amount has  been increased to R1.4 million. This is extremely important for  Crimea. In the summer we expect millions of Russians to come and  vacation here. They will be able to spend their pocket  money--the R1.4 million--on our goods and services. The Crimean  budget will get an infusion. In short, the benefit is obvious.    In addition, the Russian Government made the decision to  subsidize vouchers to Crimean resorts. The corresponding  expenses will be carried by insurance funds and trade unions.  Thanks to this, our sanitariums, room-and-board facilities, and  recreation homes will not be empty...    [Dyakov] How will the agreement affect the development of  Crimean industry?    [Saburov] Most tangibly. We will define the volume of  Crimean  products to be shipped to Russia with reduced customs  formalities. We have conducted negotiations on the issues of  transportation and communications. Russian Government leaders  treated with understanding our difficulties and requests. We  count on the closest cooperation with our partners in the  brotherly country.    [Dyakov] Who conducted the negotiations on the Russian side?    [Saburov] The head of government, V.S. Chernomyrdin. At the  signing of the agreement he emphasized that nothing now stands  in the way of concrete contracts between Russian and Crimean  enterprises. He urged an intensification of this work, bringing  into its orbit broad circles of interested parties. The  agreement was signed by Russia's Deputy Prime Minister S.M.  Shakhray and myself.    [Dyakov] Were these long negotiations?    [Saburov] They began under the previous Crimean leadership,  but at some stage ground to a halt. Now we have been able to  bring them to a successful conclusion.    [Dyakov] When may the results of the negotiations have an  effect in overcoming the economic crisis in Crimea?    [Saburov] Unfortunately, not right away. The economy has a  very strong inertia. But there will definitely be positive  results. Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin suggested, for  instance, that we start thinking now of Crimea's preparations  for the winter and the fuel and energy supply. We are supposed  to sign contracts for exports of our products to Russia, which  should give a boost to our industrial production.    [Dyakov] For many Crimean enterprises, as well as Russian  ones, the problem of mutual nonpayments is practically  unsurmountable. Have you been able to resolve it?    [Saburov] We touched upon this issue in the course of  negotiations. We resolved to clear financial channels between  Russian and Crimean enterprises. Then mutual payments for  products shipped will flow through them unimpeded. We will keep  under supervision the implementation of concrete measures in  this respect. This is what we agreed on with the Russians. In  short, we see this agreement as a door that has opened between  Russia and Crimea. I am confident that it will always remain  open.     "

""This fits into the  longstanding practice of constantly changing the tax laws,"" the  German Economic Research Institute (DIW) in Berlin says. The  fact that Russia is not making progress is primarily due to the  failed economic policy. All positive approaches are  ""overcompensated for by escalating misdevelopments in central  fields of economic policy."" The forecasts for an economic  upswing are, therefore, extremely restrained. Despite the  speedy reduction of corporate taxes, there is no sufficient  security for investors in Russia. One can hardly see any  progress in the necessary restructuring of the Russian economy.  The liberalization of export quotas, which has now been  promised, is only patchwork, too, because, in the view of the  DIW experts, all energy exports -- the main source of foreign  currency -- are not affected by it.    The research institutes DIW (Berlin), IWH [Halle Economic  Research Institute] (Halle), and IW [Institute of German  Economics] (Kiel) have listed the consequences that Russia is  facing because of that. Their devastating assessment of the  situation: Indications are accumulating that mass unemployment  is unavoidable.    The joint expert report judges Moscow's policy harshly. Even  though one can still notice ""reform rhetoric,"" in reality there  is ""no strength for the necessary structural change."" The lack  of concepts of those who guide the economy can be seen in the  overall economic data. Thus, in 1993 the GDP declined by 12  percent, after it had gone down by double-digit rates during  each of the three previous years. With a drop of 16 percent  (1992: minus 18 percent), industrial production is hit  particularly.    The authors of the report criticize the fact that,  nevertheless, private consumption increased slightly last year.  Looking at the overall economy, one cannot speak of a decline  in the standard of living at all. Given the collapse of the  economic performance, the unchanged level of consumption  logically leads to a decline in investments (most recently minus  15 percent). This expresses an ""avoidance of structural  change."" The same goes for the labor market. There, the  unemployment rate of 5 percent does not adequately reflect the  obsolete structures.    The report describes the financial markets as completely  insufficient. The defects are the result of marked neglect in  terms of order policy. The financial system is abused to  preserve inefficient structures. One consequence: The illegal  export of capital, which was estimated at at least $15 billion  last year. At the end of 1993, foreign debts amounted to $80  billion.     "
0,FT943-16643 ,"FT943-16643 _AN-EGDDRAAVFT 940704   FT  04 JUL 94 / Russians hopeful for G7 summit: Shokhin would like Dollars 2bn in loans. This time, will deeds match words?      By JOHN LLOYD, PETER NORMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM      MOSCOW, LONDON, WASHINGTON   Russia is hoping this week's Group of Seven summit in Naples will yield smaller headlines but larger real support than it has received in the last two years - when vast sums were pledged at G7 summits but much less delivered. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for the economy, said on Friday that Russia might gain access to as much as Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in extra loans this year - if the summit approved plans for the International Monetary Fund to allocate some of its own reserve asset known as the special drawing right (SDR) to developing countries and former Communist 'economies in transition'. The IMF board meets in Washington on Wednesday to discuss the SDR question. But monetary officials in Washington and leading west European capitals were uncertain whether there would be a consensus for an SDR allocation in time for the summit. There is general agreement among G7 countries that present arrangements are unfair to 37 recent Fund members such as Russia, which have never received an allocation of SDRs. But it remains unclear whether the IMF's 178 members can overcome the technical and political complexities holding up an early provision of SDRs to Russia and other disadvantaged nations. Such a provision is 'certainly an issue that is going to be discussed, and we hope positively, in Naples', a senior White House official said. Mr Shokhin said an SDR allocation would provide non-inflationary support for the budget and was urgently needed if Russia's political and economic reforms were to continue. While inflation had fallen further - to 6 per cent a month in June - production would continue to decline, albeit more slowly than the 25 per cent rate in the first part of the year, he warned. He also said Russia still had to construct an economic climate in which capital would be attracted back to the country from the west. Progress on inflation, cutting credits and raising interest rates to strongly positive levels has won praise from the IMF and of the financial community generally, and opened Russia to big IMF and World Bank loans. However, huge debts, pressures on the budget and the gradually worsening political atmosphere make western officials nervous of the future, and doubtful that a programme to stabilise Russia's economy and currency will be feasible this year - though that remains the official goal. But US officials insist that 'on Russia, there is not going to be a pledging session this year'. They say Dollars 30bn of the Dollars 43bn promised to Russia at last year's summit is already approved by G7 governments and the international financial institutions. Of the remaining Dollars 13bn, Dollars 4bn is available when Russia can conclude a standby arrangement with the IMF, and Dollars 6bn more in a currency stabilisation fund when Russia makes the rouble convertible. The SDR question has been on the international agenda for several years. But discussions so far have yielded no results because G7 members, led by Germany, have been unable to agree to a general SDR allocation to all IMF members along the lines of a SDR36bn (Pounds 33.8bn) issue proposed by Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director. Until now, a selective 'catch-up' increase has been ruled out because it would need an amendment to the IMF articles, entailing approval by holders of 85 per cent the IMF's membership votes and backing from the US Congress. The Fund is understood to have suggested a blend of general and selective SDR issues. Looking ahead to Naples, Mr Shokhin, now the longest-serving Russian minister and generally seen as a moderate reformer, laid most stress on Russia's access to the 'political G8' when the G7 admits Russia to talks on general political issues next Sunday. Russia will remain out of Saturday's 'economic G7', which will discuss world economic problems. He said that this 'step-by-step approach' was in Russia's interests, though he forecast that it would become involved in a range of economic issues in which its voice would demand to be heard. He said the Paris Club of creditor nations, at which Russia now appears as a debtor, should recognise it also as a creditor - since it is owed, he said, Dollars 140bn by developing countries. Mr Shokhin also made clear that he would push hard for further openings in markets the Russians still see as closed or only partly open to their goods. 'It's hard to reconcile declarations about partnership with discriminatory measures towards the Russian economy,' he said, instancing 260 discriminatory regulations against Russian goods in the US alone.

Today, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and South  African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed the protocol that  establishes a new status in relations between Pretoria and  Havana.    Up until now, the two governments had not maintained  diplomatic ties because of the Caribbean island authorities'  rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after assuming the presidency, Nelson  Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC),  finalized the government decision, reaffirming the relations of  friendship and solidarity maintained for years between Cuba and  the then-outlawed ANC.    Regarding the possibilities of cooperation between Cuba and  the South African state, Cuban President Fidel Castro had told  PRENSA LATINA: There are few countries that have the fraternal  links that we share with South Africa.    The country has, on the one hand, great development and  standards of living, and, on the other hand, it has enormous  social needs in the areas of public health, employment,  education, housing, and transportation, which we were able to  appreciate in our talks with members of the South African  cabinet, Castro said.    Castro added: Probably with no other country is there the  possibility of such broad Cuban cooperation than with South  Africa, as we work on developing fraternal and heart-felt ties  between both peoples.    After signing the protocol, Alfredo Nzo, former secretary of  international relations of the ANC, told Robaina that the new  South Africa did not want Fidel Castro to end his visit before  making this decision.    For his part, Robaina underlined the importance of the  signing of the agreement, not only because of its great  significance, but because it is the first protocol signed by Nzo  as foreign minister. Cuba has close cooperative relations with  other African states in the areas of health, construction,  sports, and education, which can also be extended to South  Africa, he said. Hundreds of ANC youths have studied in the past  at education centers in Cuba, it was noted.    There were times of serious confrontation between the two  states, Fidel Castro pointed out during his visit, recalling  Cuba's international opposition to the aggressive policy  maintained by the dismantled apartheid regime against the South  African black majority and the peoples of Namibia and Angola.  ""Now there is a new South Africa, where peace, respect, and  love toward Cuba exist,"" he stated.    The Cuban delegation, headed by President Fidel Castro,  concluded its first official and friendly visit to South Africa  today. The Cuban delegation began its visit Monday to attend  Mandela's inauguration. Mandela is the first black president of  the country, which now has unequivocally left behind more than  three centuries of racial discrimination.    In terms of Cuba's representation, Roberto Robaina was  accompanied at the signing ceremony by Angel Dalmau, Cuban  ambassador in Namibia; Rosa Elena Simeon, minister of science,  technology, and environment; and Marcos Rodriguez, diplomatic  counselor, who will temporarily represent the Cuban Government  in Pretoria.

The move comes as relations between the two Slav neighbours deteriorate because of heavy cuts in Russian gas supplies to Ukraine and tension over the status of the Russian-dominated Crimean region of Ukraine. Russia has used Ukraine's Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn) energy debt as leverage to gain Ukraine's share of the 350-vessel fleet based in Ukraine. But Russia, which is in deep economic difficulties, is now calling in the energy debt, leaving Ukraine with little to lose by refusing to hand over the fleet. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, is also threatening to renege on a deal to give up his country's nuclear arsenal. As Russia's gas giant Gazprom announced further deep gas cuts to Ukraine over the weekend, Mr Kravchuk said in Washington that 'fulfilment of all agreements, including agreements on nuclear commitments, is possible only if the economy works. If tomorrow factories come to a halt in Ukraine, and this is a reality if there is no gas, what carrying out of commitments can be spoken of?' However, the official news agency Itar Tass said yesterday that the first 60 of the 1,600 warheads due to be shipped out of Ukraine arrived on a train in Russia on Saturday. On Friday, Russia's nuclear energy ministry said that it had begun to supply low-enriched uranium to Ukraine, thus honouring its part of the agreement reached in Moscow in January between Ukraine, Russia and the US. Meanwhile, in the naval port of Sevastopol, Vice-Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainyi, who took part in last September's talks on the Black Sea Fleet, said the Ukrainian side was now demanding a reversion to a 1992 agreement, under which the fleet would be divided by the end of 1995. Ukraine is building up a separate fleet, just five ships so far. It claims most of those serving in the fleet are Ukrainian, though most officers are Russian.

He also pointed out the importance Cuba places on tourism:  Cuba's tourism revenues for 1993 totaled over $700 million, with  hopes that this year's revenues will top $900 million. Carlos  Tades added that the number of tourists is expected to increase  25 percent.    OICI Vice President Miguel Angel Pino said he is pleased  this  event is being held in Havana. Pino recalled that the OICI was  established in Havana 56 years ago, when there were no municipal  organizations in charge of [words indistinct]. Pino added that  tourism is an economic phenomena with vast social dimensions  because it ties countries and helps to promote mutual knowledge  and unity.

""Anyone who wants to leave Cuba can obtain a  departure visa but anyone who enters an embassy violently loses  that right,"" Castro said in a statement for the Colombian  station Radio Cadena Nacional (RCN).    Castro said Cubans who are of age can request visas to leave  the country, but they cannot always obtain visas from the  corresponding embassies and therefore decide to occupy the  installations.    On Wednesday, nine persons forcefully entered the Chilean  Consulate in Havana while 20 others are currently at the German  Embassy and 118 at the Belgian ambassador's residence demanding  authorization to leave the island. Castro said the Cuban  government has the obligation of protecting the embassies. He  added, however, that force should not be used.    Yesterday, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban National  Assembly of the People's Government, noted the need to ""prevent  in a civilized manner"" the violation and vulnerability of  diplomatic missions. He stressed that Cuban authorities will  refrain from dislodging the several civilians who occupied the  embassies by force, adding that no reprisals will be taken  against them if they change their attitude. ""It is necessary to  prevent in a civilized manner"" the forceful occupation of  embassies ""if we do not want the law of the jungle to prevail or  even prevent the disappearance of diplomatic service,"" Alarcon  stressed.    He said that so far the countries affected by those  incidents  have cooperated with Cuban authorities in trying to persuade the  occupants to voluntarily and peacefully leave the installations.  Alarcon, a former foreign minister, said the occupation of  embassies is the result of U.S. immigration policy, which denies  visas to Cubans who want to emigrate to that country.    In his statement to RCN -- one of the most important radio  networks in Colombia -- Castro also referred to Cuba's relations  with the United States, denying the possibility for ""direct  contact"" at this time. He stressed that U.S. President William  Clinton is very interested in obtaining his reelection and  therefore power groups, which he did not identify, are  pressuring him to maintain the sanctions against Cuba.    Castro said he is pleased with the election of Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary general, but ruled out  the possibility that he can promote Cuba's return to the  regional organization in the very near future. For Cuba, its  return to the OAS is not a priority; what we view as a priority  is the end of the economic blockade the United States has  maintained against the island for more than 30 years, Castro  stressed. Castro described the blockade as ""inhuman and  criminal."" He added that it is not justified because the Cold  War is over and said it has hurt Cuba more due to changes in its  trade activities, 80 percent of which were carried out with the  socialist bloc.    Consulted about the situation in Colombia -- a country  facing  guerrilla groups comprised of several million armed men --  Castro denied his country interferes in the internal affairs of  other countries. He recognized that for some time, Cuba  actively supported revolutionary movements in Latin America  because they supported the [Cuban] policy toward the United  States, but he explained that that situation has changed. He  said his country's relations with Latin America are based on  mutual respect and nonintervention in the internal affairs of  each nation.    Castro refused to comment on the possible results of  Sunday's  presidential elections in Colombia. He only said he hopes the  elected president will continue working to further improve the  electoral process.    Castro recognized that he does not have the same energy as  when he was 20 or 30 years old. He added that he will retire  when the right time comes, after overcoming the current  difficult moments because he does not want to look like a  deserter. He said he would like to have ""a small piece"" of land  in Cuba to rest and dedicate his time to reading. He noted,  however, that he still works 15, 16, or 17 hours daily.     "

This means that slightly more than 600,000 foreigners  visited  tourist spots in Cuba during the past 12 months -- a period  that, according to Enrique Rodriguez, vice president of the  National Tourist Institute (INTUR), showed results that came  from very hard work.    In brief statements to local reporters, Rodriguez said  Cuba's  tourism enterprises (INTUR, Cubanacan Corporation, and Gaviota  Corporation) will work together in 1994 to boost tourism by some  40 percent.    Special emphasis will be made (in 1994) to develop  ecotourism  and water activities (marinas and diving centers), Rodriguez  said.    A noticeable gain in 1993 tourist activities also was  registered by Cubana de Aviacion airlines, which, according to  Director General Heriberto Prieto, carried more than 450,000  travelers.    According to Prieto, aside from Cubana de Aviacion, 29  foreign airlines fly to Cuba with 95 flights a week to nine  tourist hubs.     "

A  simple mathematical calculation shows that the 0.8 drop,  compared to the 10.2 registered in 1992, is equivalent to the  lives of 121 children.    According to information supplied by the Public Health  Ministry's National Statistics Directorate (Minsap), in 1993  there were 151,981 births and 1,430 deaths, which were mainly  caused by perinatal problems (those that occur in relation to  the birth process) and by several congenital anomalies.    According to Minsap statistics, child mortality rates in  Cuba  have been decreasing gradually over the past 25 years. For  example, the figure was 46.7 in 1969, 19.4 in 1979, and 11.1  child deaths for every 1,000 born alive in 1989.    The 9.4 achieved in 1993 gives Cuba the lowest child  mortality rate in Latin America -- an area that registers very  alarming figures, like those in Haiti and Bolivia, which were 87  and 80 respectively, as reported in the World Infancy Status  report published by UNICEF [United Nations Children's Fund].

When addressing the  plenum of The Nation and the Emigrants Conference, Cuban Vice  President Carlos Lage confirmed emigrants are not deprived of  the right to invest in Cuba, although the specifics of that  process are pending definition.    Future facilities for Cuban-born entrepreneurs are part of  the process of normalizing relations with the expatriate Cuban  community, the first part of which involved holding the  aforementioned conference in Havana last weekend. At that time,  the Cuban Government launched a number of measures aimed at  normalizing ties with emigrants, among them eliminating the  requirement that those who leave the country legally wait five  years before returning.    Young emigrants will also be permitted to study at Cuban  universities provided they defray the cost. Travelers will not  be required to pay for a hotel room upon arriving on the island,  and the Foreign Relations Ministry will create a special  department to deal with the affairs of the expatriate Cuban  community.    Possible emigrant investment in Cuba in the near future  complements the aforementioned measures and reveals the  soundness of previous steps taken to reach the decision.  Recently, a meeting between Cuban officials and Cuban-American  owners and businessmen, known in the United States by its  acronym OCA, was held in Havana to explore the possibility of  joint ventures.    A desire has been expressed by both sides, but that desire  is  stumbling upon the obstacles of the U.S. economic blockade,  worsened by the implementation of the so-called Torricelli Law.  The same emigrants, who met recently in this capital in The  Nation and the Emigrants Conference, agreed on the need to lift  the blockade because, in addition to threatening the very  existence of 11 million Cubans, it blocks the normalization of  ties between Cubans on and off the island.    As stated by some of the participants at the Havana  conference, the Cuban economic opening is being blocked by the  stubborn isolationist policy of Washington.     "

Who  Is He?""]    [Text] One might say that all of Azerbaijan has heard of  Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev. He was a candidate for the post of  president of the republic in 1993. He is chairman of the Veten  Adzhagy Party (previously--Gummet). He is simply a billionaire.  He is president of the Tarana firm. He is the author of the  economic program for revival of Azerbaijan. This program has  now been brought up for discussion in the National Assembly.  But...    But it was written even prior to that, two years ago, during  the summer in some beautiful little corner of Azerbaijan. In the  apt words of Mr. Tagiyev, Azerbaijan is the center of the  universe. This is why Russia, Turkey, Iran, England, and even  the United States are hankering after the ancient and rich land  of Azerbaijan. Not to mention the hostile Armenia. It is  Armenia's misfortune that it began a battle for Azerbaijani  land, as Germany did against Russia in its day. God has always  been with us because our people live according to the divine  laws of goodness, kindness, and amity. And any aggressor,  especially the unhappy and pathetic Armenians, is living  according to the laws of the devil, Iblis--the eternal enemy of  God and Man....    The war will not last forever. It will come to an end. And  then it will be necessary not only heal the wounds but also to  feed the people, build houses, and develop science, sports, and  culture. Without an economic base there can be no culture--this  is one of Mr. Tagiyev's aphorisms. The main task now is to carry  out radical economic reforms. But there should be no radicalism  in politics. Let there be leftists and rightists and centrists.  But 90 percent of social life must consist of economics, 7  percent--of politics, and only 3 percent--of foreign policy.  That is what Zakir-bek thinks. And it is true! Look at what the  independent states of the former, now collapsed, USSR are  engaged in. Russia: Yeltsin's fight against the opposition.  Ukraine: the president's fight for the Black Sea Fleet.  Kazakhstan: the fight for Baykonur. Belarus: the fight to defeat  Shushkevich. Moldova: Snegur and the Dniester region. Georgia:  Shevardnadze overthrew Gamsakhurdia, but Ardzinba appeared in  Abkhazia. Uzbekistan: Karimov is successfully suppressing the  opposition. Kyrgyzstan: The fight for power is still going on.  Turkmenistan: Turkmenbashi is reinforcing his personality cult.  And then Azerbaijan and Armenia are fighting over Karabakh....    Let us imagine for a second what would have happened if the  money lost on political fighting or war had been used for  economic development. There would have been an economic miracle  in the CIS long ago. But no, everyone is infected with the  bacilla of political fighting. They all want to become  presidents, rulers, and masters, forgetting about the destinies  of the peoples, about the standard of living of the simple  people, who have ended up on the brink of poverty and are  waiting for a political miracle!...    But there has never been such a thing in the history of  mankind...and thank the Lord God and Almighty Allah that there  are people who are thinking about economic revival! It is  curious that Zakir-bek's program received a high rating from  such luminaries of economic politics or political economics  (however you wish) as Shatalin and Yavlinskiy, who are highly  respected in the world.    The path to revival and entry into the market economy passes  through capital. And the more people who are drawn into economic  development, the richer the society will be and thus every  person who makes up this society. And if Mr. Tagiyev two years  ago asked the question in his work ""What to do?"", now he knows  how to save us from the economic crisis that is getting worse  with every leap of the dollar. The growth of prices has brought  people to the point of spiritual degradation: They lie and  deceive the new-fledged ""businessmen,"" treat relatives like  enemies, and brother turns against brother for a piece of land,  for a small area of property, and the most audacious and bitter  people assert that war is advantageous not only to Russia or  Armenia... Tagiyev's program for entering the market has been  approved by the Social Liberal Party of Russia and several  business academicians in Kazakhstan. It makes up the economic  parts of the programs of several parties in Azerbaijan, but for  some reason we do not see it here in our republic. AZERTADZH was  still even naive enough to refuse to print it, saying that there  were too many parties and too many programs. Yes there are  indeed too many programs. But not to see the advantages of Mr.  Z.I. Tagiyev's economic program is ridiculous to say the least.  Just one part of it, pertaining to the protection of mothers and  children, makes it worthwhile. Have we read many concrete  programs for social protection of children and women?    Whoever loves children loves God and whoever respects women  respects the Most High! Incidentally, to the question of whether  the esteemed Zakir believes in God and how his attitude toward  the Most High is reflected in the program, he answers instantly:  Allah will help us and bless us for serving the people...in  principle this question might not even have been  asked--journalistic curiosity got the better of me... It is  sufficient to listen to a couple of minutes of Mr. Tagiyev's  discussion with a refugee, a worker, an intellectual, a  businessman, or an academician. Goodness and kindness simply  radiate from him. He has a rare ability to understand and  sympathize with the person with whom he is speaking; all the  latter has to do is open his mouth! This is a true sign that he  is constantly thinking about the future, about people first and  then about himself! In order to understand this you yourself  have to be without selfish egoism....    The construction of that which will produce fruits in a year  has been conceived now. I do not want to get ahead of events. We  have adopted the practice of not noticing the success of another  and scoffing if what they plan does not come to pass. But to  imagine, for example, the existence of a sugar refinery in  Azerbaijan is almost a fantasy. We are not Cuba or even Ukraine.  But if Zakir-bek is certain that there will be such a plant,  then there will be one!    It is impressive that Zakir Makhmudovich is gifted with  respect to all components of human existence. One can only envy  his patience. One can only be amazed by his ability to  sympathize and understand people. His ability to penetrate to  the essence of things without a lot of verbiage and tedium is in  general apparently his main talent. And also his wisdom--not so  much acquired as innate. He is clearly aware that if you lose  two you will receive 20! If you make those around you happy,  happiness will not abandon you. If you give confidence to  another, success will not leave you. The Most High does indeed  love Zakir-bek. And perhaps Allah loves those with whom Mr.  Tagiyev himself communicates. In any case the phenomenon of  Zakir Tagiyev has still to be understood and revealed. After  all, many are not yet aware of the phenomenon of Zeynalabdin  Tagiyev! And these symbols are not random: Z. and T., for many  people are called by the name of the world-renowned patron Hajji  Zeynalabdin Tagiyev. And many assume the name of the great  patron themselves. But so far none are worthy. And, to be  honest, I would not want to name Mr. Zakir Tagiyev or compare  him to his initial namesake whom he resembles. In my opinion, he  is a personality in and of himself and in time others will be  compared to him and be said to resemble him, people who while  increasing capital do not forget about God and, the main thing,  about people or, vice versa: They do not forget about people  and, the main thing, about God!    But still, why does my title contain the question: ""Who Is  He?"" The reason is as simple as can be: Zakir-bek has a major  secret about which the time has not yet come to speak. Perhaps  he himself guesses about it intuitively. Not many people know  about it. Whether or not I know is also a secret. But as a  respectable journalist I promise to write about the secret.  When? Only the Most High knows about that. And when He allows  it, blesses it, then I will write it. Of course, with the  permission of Zakir Makhmudovich Tagiyev himself.     "

[passage  omitted] Viktor Chernomyrdin sees no serious problem in the  significant difference in value between the Russian and  Hungarian deliveries.    [Chernomyrdin] It has various reasons. I would not hold  either side responsible for that, and I would certainly not  blame either of them. The transitional, semi-market nature of  the Russian economy has of course a considerable influence on  this. [passage omitted] The creation of the legal basis of a  market economy is now taking place in Russia. The bilateral  agreements to be signed in Budapest, for instance, will  partially serve this purpose. Economic processes cannot be  changed all at once. However, I am certain that the imbalance  in Hungarian-Russian exports and imports will gradually decrease.    [Izbeki] The issue of debts inherited from the Soviet era is  also a subject matter in which our countries are ahead of  everyone else. The Russian Government is determined to settle  this debate once and for all and as soon as possible. Viktor  Chernomyrdin answered my question regarding this. He welcomes  the Hungarian proposal that part of the still outstanding debt  of about $800 million would be invested here in Russia. The  details, of course, are yet to be discussed, but in theory, it  is supported. Thus, I see no problem regarding this. The debt  issue can be resolved, he added. Russia is a reliable partner  in energy deliveries as well, he said.    [Chernomyrdin] We undertake responsibility for what we have  promised and agreed on. [passage omitted] As far as our  neighbors are concerned, in my view, Ukraine has to handle this  matter in a civilized manner, as it is customary in the world.  The diversion or tapping of deliveries, or similar non-business  methods are unacceptable. Russia and the recipient European  countries expect nothing less from the transit countries than to  fulfill their business obligations.    [Izbeki] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who has been Russia's prime  minister since December 1992, is of the view that the Russian  reforms, the economy's transformation, could not have moved  forward any faster, more successfully and less painfully than  they did. [passage omitted]    Concerning the power struggle within the Russian top  leadership, Viktor Chernomyrdin denied the allegation that he  was striving for greater power than what he currently has.

In a lengthy commentary entitled ""Public Letter to a  President"" (Clinton), GRANMA said the alleged 20 May message by  the U.S. President to Cuba is also a good example of the  ignorance of realities that have characterized Cuba's history  and its relations with the United States.    After highlighting the negative aspects of the significance  of 20 May 1902 for Cuba and clarifying the pro-independence  ideas of national hero Jose Marti, the author considered it  profane to manipulate Marti's figure and name after radio  stations that pursue objectives against those for which he  fought.    Commenting on the White House's position of repeatedly  denying visas to nationals who meet all the requirements and, on  the contrary, promoting illegal departures, the commentary warns  that ""cynical and opportunistic"" policies always turn against  those who create them.    ""Today, they tighten the blockade to promote emigration;  they  promote emigration but your Interests Section denies thousands  of visas. They deny visas but have no problems receiving those  who are able to reach the coasts of Florida in flimsy boats or  are able to seize one,"" the commentary stated.    And the commentary asks: ""How long do you think this winding  circle will last without exploding and turning against you?""    For the commentator, when the U.S. middle class, which  allowed Clinton to reach the presidency, learns and understands,  among other things, that Washington defines its policy toward  Cuba following the interests of the meager community of  immigrants, the Cuban American Foundation (terrorist group  founded by the CIA), the blockade, and 20 May messages will end.    According to the article [as published], the hour of honor  for the United States will come that day ""because that powerful  nation, which is trying to starve those who have committed the  sole crime of struggling for their ideas and their right to be  free and independent into submission, will never be considered  complete or just.""

Robaina also spoke of the bustling international  activity in Cuba and asked for solidarity against the economic  blockade imposed by the United States over three decades ago.    In that regard, Robaina asked for international solidarity  in  light of this pressure tactic, which it considers unjust.  Robaina reiterated Havana's willingness to discuss any topic  with the United States so long as no strings are attached.    Following a meeting with Guido Di Tella, his Argentine  counterpart, Robaina said that he had informed Di Tella of the  economic measures Havana has implemented as well as the steps it  is taking toward integration with Latin America and the  Caribbean.    Robaina also spoke to Di Tella about Cuba's criteria for the  democratization process of the United Nations; the preparations  for the upcoming Ibero-American summit in Cartagena, Colombia;  and a presidential summit called by Washington at the end of  1994.    Robaina, who is here on an official visit on 13 and 14  April,  made a stop in Buenos Aires as part of a tour that began in  Uruguay and will continue with Peru and Paraguay.    Robaina gave a news conference following his one-hour  meeting  with Di Tella and said that Cuba and Argentina are living in a  ""new phase with a smoother communication.""    Commenting that Cuban-Argentine relations ""have overcome  difficulties,"" he pointed out that ""the things both nations have  in common are stronger.""    Cuba is currently opening to the investment of foreign  capital. That, he emphasized, is of great interest to Argentina  and its businessmen.    Regarding Cuba's debt with Argentina, estimated at some $1  billion, Robaina reiterated Havana's intention to ""unfreeze"" the  topic and have experts from both countries begin talks in that  regard.    Argentine Foreign Minister Di Tella called his meeting with  Robaina positive, fruitful, and sincere, and added that topics  of mutual interest were discussed in a respectful manner.    Robaina gave numerous interviews to major local and foreign  media throughout the day.     "

The Cuban diplomat was interviewed by EFE before leaving the  Angolan capital, where he was received by President Jose Eduardo  Dos Santos and high-ranking officials of the government,  parliament, and the government's Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola (MPLA).    ""Current contacts between Cuba and the United States are  limited to immigration talks, which have not reached a  stalemate; certain Coast Guard-border guard contacts; some joint  operations against drug traffickers; and a telecommunications  deal that is at a deadlock,"" Robaina said.    Roberto Robaina emphasized that the new element in  Cuban-U.S.  relations ""is that (President Bill) Clinton's administration has  yet to use the aggressive language that characterized relations  between the two countries during Republican administrations.""    ""Even though that doesn't mean much, it is something that  may  surprise certain people,"" Robaina said, adding that, personally  speaking, he would rather not become ""overly enthusiastic.""    The Cuban foreign minister said he is frequently asked if,  as  head of Cuban diplomacy, he does not feel some frustration  because some of Cuba's hopes have not been fulfilled -- meaning  the normalization of relations and a suspension of the economic  embargo imposed 30 years ago by Washington for ideological  reasons -- with the arrival of the Clinton administration.    Robaina said: ""I feel no frustration whatsoever, because,  personally speaking, I made no plans beyond what is happening  and because I understand that the new U.S. Administration is not  what it really wants to be.""    The Cuban diplomat thinks President Clinton is being subject  to heavy pressure, above all from the most ""reactionary"" members  of the Cuban community in the United States, who preclude any  constructive steps toward Cuba.    Without mentioning U.S. black leader Jesse Jackson's recent  visit to Cuba, the Cuban minister, who is visiting Angola for  the first time since he replaced Isidoro Malmierca in the post  last year, admitted that ""there are other nobler areas"" where  work can be done concerning the United States.    He said the goal is to create an appropriate atmosphere to  someday allow the emergence of much more important elements of  the U.S. people and to encourage the normalization of relations  between these two countries, which are separated by a mere 150  km of sea.    Robaina said Latin America and Cuba are no longer a  ""priority"" for the U.S. Administration, although he admitted  that the situation could change given the complex international  situation.    The minister said Cuba is willing to talk about the  normalization of relations if the United States does not come to  the negotiating table with ""conditions or stipulations,"" adding  that no one in his country would accept ""subordinate conditions.""    ""We are prepared to discuss any topic (with the United  States) because we believe anything can result if we talk about  any given issue,"" Robaina said, but our ""independence,  sovereignty, and ability to state our own opinion"" will not be  on the negotiating table.""    The Cuban diplomat said negotiations concerning the  normalization of relations ""should not begin with the most  complicated issues,"" because an appropriate atmosphere must  first be created.    Robaina said that Cuba believes that ""nothing has been  gained"" by submission. ""Life gave us the privilege of seeing  that those who began by giving in were compelled to continue  down that road, even when they had little left to give.""    Moreover, Robaina said that during his visit to Angola his  hosts told him about the current peace talks in Lusaka between  the government and the National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola (UNITA) guerrilla forces.    He said they also analyzed the possibilities of increasing  cooperation between Luanda and Havana ""on a new basis.""    Robaina, who has already visited Ghana, today traveled to  Zimbabwe. He will later visit Zambia and Namibia.    Over 350,000 Cubans went to Angola over a 15-year period as  part of the so-called ""internationalist missions.""    Cuba withdrew its troops from Angola after signing  tripartite  agreements in New York in 1988. The agreement did not bring  about a normalization of relations with the United States, one  of the guarantor countries.     "

Once the decision was known, Deputy Rodolfo Becerril  Straffon, president of the chamber's Foreign Relations  Commission, cited the importance of Salinas' trip to Havana.  The trip will occur ""at a time when U.S. congressmen want to  intensify the blockade"" against the island, the deputy explained.    The media have viewed this statement as a clear allusion to  U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli, the author of the U.S. law  which bears his name and which two years ago intensified the  economic blockade the United States imposed against Cuba more  than 30 years ago.    Torricelli has just concluded a visit to Mexico where he was  bitterly criticized by all Mexican political sectors because of  his desire to supervise the federal elections that will take  place in this country in August.    Becerril said ""this (visit by Salinas to Cuba) is a  demonstration of Mexican solidarity with the Cuban people and  the norms that guide Mexico's foreign policy."" The legislator  called for the elimination of customs that hurt Latin American  economies.    During the session, the deputy announced the deputies of the  governing Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI] have decided  to donate one day's salary to Cuba, and ""this money will be used  to buy oil."" The deputies of the opposition's Party of the  Democratic Revolution have joined the PRI deputies in this  decision.    Three days ago in his request to obtain permission to travel  from the legislative body, Salinas cited the respectful  diplomatic relations Mexico and Cuba maintain as well as the  profound ties of affinity between the two nations.    During that session, Salinas said the ties with the island  have produced an international agenda of cooperation that  demonstrates the importance of existing links.    Salinas also said that since 1975, all Mexican presidents in  office have visited Havana, something that has contributed to an  intense and fruitful political dialogue at the highest level  between the two neighboring nations. The Mexican presidents who  have visited Cuba are: Luis Echeverria (1970-76), Jose Lopez  Portillo (1976-82), and Miguel de la Madrid (1982-86).    Salinas also recalled that Cuban Chief of State Fidel Castro  has been in Mexico on three occasions during the current Salinas  administration (at the presidential inauguration in 1988, a  summit meeting of the Group of Three in Cozumel in 1991, and the  first conference of Iberian-American presidents in Guadalajara  that same year).    Castro's trip in December 1988 for the Salinas presidential  inauguration was the Cuban leader's first trip to Mexico in 32  years. In 1956, he had left from the Mexican port of Tuxpan  with 82 men to renew the Cuban people's armed struggle, which  culminated with the victory of the revolution on 1 January 1959.    The illustration presented at Mexico's National Congress  explained that the presence of the Mexican president in Cuba  will serve to further promote bilateral ties, analyze the agenda  between the two countries, and explore new ways of diversifying  and strengthening existing ties.

The new  tariffs are twice as high as those on other states and are  likely to result in a sharp decrease of the eastern trade of the  Baltic states.    Prime Minister Mart Laar was of the opinion that Russia  attempted to exert pressure on the Baltic states, but harmed  itself to an equal degree. This decision proves the correctness  of the decision of the Estonian Government to reorient its  economy towards the West. ""Estonia is not dependent on Russia  and we have nothing to fear,"" he said.    Chairman of the Riigikogu [parliament] economic commission  Ivar Raig described the move as a discrimination against the  Baltic states. It may result in a growing pressure on the  kroon, an increased inflation and unemployment, he warned,  recommending to appeal to the Western powers to link the most  favoured status in trade with the abolition of discriminatory  customs tariffs towards the Baltic states.    Academician Endel Lippmaa was also convinced that ""it is a  clearly repressive measure which also violates the  Estonian-Russian agreement."" Lippmaa was concerned with the  influence on Latvia and Lithuania and recommended to impose  similar high tariffs on the Russian transit trade in order to  have something to bargain with later.    Foreign Ministry advisor Urve Ndu commented the Russian move  as a violation of the European trading traditions, adding that  restrictions may be introduced only because of threat to public  health or environment, according to the GATT requirements.    Minister of Agriculture Jaan Leetsar was the most  pessimistic. The introduction of the new tariffs may have the  same effect on the export of agricultural products as the  monetary reform of 1992 -- impossibility of export resulting in  a stockpiling of products. This further caused a chain of  indebtedness between the producers and food processing firms.  The customs tariffs on potatoes reach 50 percent, on meat, milk  and butter to 30 percent, which make export to Russia  impossible. There are two alternatives -- to find a new market  or to further reduce the livestock, Leetsar said. But he added  that the ministry had foreseen the Russian move and had also  prepared corresponding recommendations for the protection of the  Estonian market.    Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn pointed out that the  move may have been caused by Russia's domestic factors. ""The  shops are filled with goods but only 5-15 percent of the  population can afford them, since the prices are twice as high  as in Finland,"" the Ambassador said. He also linked the move  with the success of the agrarian party at the recent elections.     "

The two foreign ministers noted that there should be no  rigidity [debe descongelarse] about the Cuban debt to  Montevideo, estimated at some $33 million.

On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7  March 1991 that Washington ""stated today in an official report  the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in  its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing  narcotrafficking in the Caribbean.""    The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted  that in 1990 ""the Cuban Government continued to maintain its  policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco)  traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun  in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking.""    Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported:    ""A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month  recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in  1992.""    ""The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to  its  antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by  actions, the U.S. branch report stated.""    Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from  Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international  narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant  priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated  with the United States, ""the largest drug consumer in the world.""    That same document admitted that in the past five years,  heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document  noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America  has been diversified.    According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats  entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited  capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because  only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is  superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries  of the hemisphere.    Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the  report  published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention  and ""is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives.""    Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment  finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug trafficking efforts may  possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade  imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades  ago.    In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity  of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's  ability to intercept drug traffickers.    As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme  rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the  United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against  Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking.    This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department  on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any  distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool  to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used  by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute  those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its  present situation.

What Dr. Hector Terry, vice minister of public health, describes as ""a Cuban  health care miracle"" includes medical examinations, hospital and outpatient  treatment, the most up-to-date surgical techniques and comprehensive dental  care.    Asked how Cuba does it, Terry said the key is political will.    ""The United States is infinitely richer than we are but it does not have the  political will to provide the kind of free health care that we have,"" he said.      Rural Deprivation    There was no political will in pre-revolutionary Cuba, Terry said, when  millions in rural areas had little access to systematic medical care.    Since the early years of the revolution, when half of Cuba's 6,000 physicians  fled the island, President Fidel Castro has dreamed of making his socialist  nation, in his words, ""a medical power.""    ""Neither money nor resources were spared, although perhaps it meant a somewhat  lower standard of living in other respects,"" Terry said.    Soviet aid over the last 30 years has made the public health system financially  possible, according to Western observers.    ""The millions of dollars of Soviet aid every day in the form of long-term  credits, preferential prices and free military hardware allowed Cuba to invest  huge resources in public health,"" a Western diplomat said.      Difficulties Seen    ""If Soviet aid diminishes over the next decade, as it is expected to do, it  will be difficult for Cuba to maintain its current rate of investments in  public health,"" he said.    He noted that Cuba owes Western creditors $6.4 billion, which it is unable to  pay.    Cuban hospitals have diagnostic machines that cost $3 million each as well as  the latest machines for the nonsurgical treatment of kidney stones.    This year more than 3,600 physicians will qualify, more than all the doctors on  the island in 1964.    Medical school is free except for textbooks, which are inexpensive.      36,600 Physicians    The graduating class will bring the number of physicians to more than 36,6OO,  or about 30 for every 10,000 Cubans. Four of 10 doctors are women.    Beginning with the class of 1964, all medical school graduates have been  required to work for the government-run health care system. Only a few private  practitioners remain.    Most doctors work in one of the country's 882 hospitals or multipurpose  clinics.    In recent years many new doctors have been assigned to the ""family medicine  plan."" An idea of Castro, the plan aims to have all of Cuba covered by a  network of neighborhood family doctors by 1995.    The 220 neighborhood family doctors working in Havana attend to the medical  needs of about a quarter of the city's population. They live in the  neighborhoods under their care in complexes with an office and apartments for  the doctor and a nurse.      Salary Structure    Terry said that beyond political will and Soviet aid, the salary structure has  played a major role in the success of the health services. ""If we had to pay  doctors and administrators exorbitant salaries, we would have never been able  to afford our medical system,"" he said.    Doctors and dentists receive fixed monthly salaries. A general practitioner who  has spent six years in medical school and three years in rural ""social service""  work is paid $433 a month. Dentists' salaries are similar.    Dr. Juan Aguilar, a leading orthodontist, said he remained in Cuba because of  his conviction that he was contributing to the welfare of his people. ""I know  that I could be making $100,000 a year or more if I left Cuba, but it gives me  great satisfaction to be able to treat so many people who would not be able to  afford the services of an orthodontist in another country,"" he said.      Salaries Are Good    By Cuban standards salaries of doctors and dentists are good -- about twice the  average monthly wage.    Terry said that to progress the way it has, the health care system had to cut  its dependence on drugs bought from multinational corporations.    ""Medicines on the world market are exorbitantly priced. You cannot develop a  health care service like ours without having a pharmaceutical industry,"" he  said. ""Besides, because of its economic embargo, the United States has refused  to sell us even an aspirin over the past 30 years.""    Today 85% of the medicines used by the public health service are produced  within Cuba.      Genetic Techniques    Cuba uses genetic engineering techniques to produce reagents, such as those  used for testing AIDS, said Terry, who heads the National Commission on AIDS.  Half the population has been tested for the disease.    Cuban hospitals can perform heart, liver, kidney and lung transplants, and  neural transplants for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. They offer  prenatal diagnosis for genetic malformations and Down's Syndrome. There is an  aggressive program for detecting breast and cervical cancer.    Terry points with pride to the declining infant mortality rate, an important  public health measurement. The rate dropped to below 12 per 1,000 live births  last year from 60 or more in 1958.    ""Our population is also living 10 years longer than it did back 30 years ago,""  he said. ""Not bad for a Third World country.""

Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, Christine Stewart, and an  executive from the publication sponsoring the event opened the  conference entitled ""Second Roundtable With the Government of  Cuba,"" which formally begins two days of working sessions  tomorrow behind closed doors.    The Canadian Government supports increased investments in  Cuba not only because they contribute to this country's  development, but because they also benefit Canada, the minister  explained.    Canada currently exerts a great deal of influence in foreign  investments in Cuba's mining sector, not only in the traditional  nickel sector, but also in exploring for gold, lead, copper, and  oil deposits.    Stewart conveyed the Canadian Government's willingness to  further promote the flow of capital toward Cuba. It was also  announced in Ottawa today that developmental aid will be made  available, as well as $360,000 in emergency food aid, which will  be granted through the World Food Program. A larger amount,  $720,000, will be donated to the food program in 1995.    Meanwhile, Lage stressed the importance of having such a  renowned publication as THE ECONOMIST organizing this  conference, as well as having Canadian companies such as Sherrit  Inc. cosponsoring it. The conference has an even greater  significance in light of the current economic hardships Cuba is  facing.    Octavio Castilla, spokesman for the conference and deputy  minister for foreign investment and economic cooperation,  believes the most significant message conveyed by Lage was that  regardless of all the flaws the Cuban legal system might have,  there is a willingness to analyze those flaws and to implement  reforms that further encourage the introduction of foreign  capital.    More than 100 businessmen and officials from Europe, Canada,  the United States, and Latin America are participating in this  conference. Formal reports will be given tomorrow by Enrique  Martinez, vice president of the Cuban Central Planning Board;  Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas; and Ernesto Melendez,  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.

Nevertheless, Cuba's initial explanations were ignored  by the right-wing Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO and other forces  that strive, both within and outside of the South American  nation, to spoil the friendly atmosphere between the two nations.    The highest-ranking Cuban authorities confirmed that no  rebel  leader, or even Bishop Nel Beltran, attended the fourth  solidarity meeting held in Havana in June when, according to EL  TIEMPO's version, they reportedly held a summit. Cuba's swift  investigation of the Colombian newspaper's allegations, which  were repeated by some of that country's officials, shows the  Cuban Government's intention to expose a maneuver that could  very well be connected with the extremist groups of Cuban  immigrants in the United States.    One cannot forget the reaction, tinged with hysteria, of  ultra-conservative members of that community who are threatening  to boycott Colombian products in the United States. Miami radio  stations that respond to the interests of the extreme right-wing  groups in the Cuban immigrant community have not stopped  speaking about the eventual sale of Colombian oil to Cuba, which  both parties were negotiating to the subsequent disgust of those  who struggle to paralyze the island by the lack of fuel.    The Colombian newspaper EL TIEMPO's allegations have many  dark facets, including attributing them to a military  intelligence report which was later denied by the head of that  department, Gen. Fernando Tapia. Also, Bishop Nel Beltran and  other witnesses that remained with him in Miami during the time  of his alledged stay in Havana with guerrilla leaders have  rejected the prelate's participation in a meeting or his trip to  the Cuban capital.    The scandal unleashed by EL TIEMPO has two chapters, the  last  of which has the character of a counteroffensive. It is to be  expected that truth will prevail and that the newspaper will not  subject its readers to a third episode of such a destructive  story.     "
0,FT933-17011 ,"FT933-17011 _AN-DGACVABAFT 930701   FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Russia urges 'trade not aid' treatment - Moscow's call to be regarded as normal - with help from friends      By LEYLA BOULTON   PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin and his government are demanding an end to trade 'discrimination' against Russia as it struggles to switch to a market economy and Mr Yeltsin intends to make the point when he meets leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries at their Tokyo summit next week. 'We want Russia really to become an equal member of the world financial and trading community,' says Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for Russia's foreign economic relations. In the past few weeks, Russia has demanded rapid admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and refused to sign a partnership agreement with the European Community on the grounds that it provides insufficient access for Russian goods and services to EC markets. Last week, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called off a visit to the US in protest against sanctions imposed by Washington because of a Dollars 350m Russian contract to supply rocket engines to India. According to Washington, the deal violates international agreements to limit the proliferation of missile technology which India says it needs for a peaceful space programme. Russia says the US simply wanted its companies to get the deal. Closer to home, Russia is demanding that western loans be given to other newly-independent former Soviet republics to pay for Russian energy supplies. The beauty of this scheme, which the west does not even want to discuss until the Tokyo summit is out of the way, is that Russia would get new western funds while the other republics would get new debt. 'The fact that Russia is negotiating aggressively on trade shows that it's becoming a normal country,' said one western diplomat. 'The controversy arises from the fact that it expects better than average treatment as part of western support for reforms.' Some of the Russian complaints about discrimination are a negotiating tactic since even Russian officials acknowledge that they do not want to expose the country to foreign trading competition all in one go - which is what speedy admission to Gatt, for instance, would imply. But public posturing notwithstanding, Russia's demand for 'trade not aid' threatens vital western interests in a way which earlier forms of assistance have not. The conflict is particularly acute for the EC, Russia's close neighbour and biggest trading partner, which needs to reconcile the desire to help Russia with pressure to protect EC jobs and companies from competition from the east. Access to western markets happens to be one of the most effective forms of support the west can give Russian market reforms. It enables Russian enterprises to help themselves rather than demand subsidies from the government. It avoids the risk of Russia's inefficient state bureaucracy squandering direct grants from western governments. It also makes western demands for faster market reforms in Russia more credible. 'Jeffrey Sachs (the Harvard professor turned Russian economic adviser) is telling the Russians to restructure or close down their factories. I say we should close ours,' said one western diplomat. However, controlled domestic energy prices, the fact that many Russian enterprises have only a poor idea of what their costs are and the desire of many to make precious hard currency by pricing their exports cheaply, are all presented by western competitors as arguments for maintaining restrictions on imports from Russia. Exports of natural gas and oil needed by western Europe account for the fact that Russia has a trade surplus with the EC. But while there is no demand for most Russian industrial goods, the few which are in demand face restricted access on the grounds that Russia is not yet a market economy. The EC operates quantitative restrictions on steel and textiles, and in effect limits imports of enriched uranium by requiring a licence for each deal. It is soon to decide whether to slap anti-dumping duties on Russian aluminium imports, which last year sharply drove down western aluminium prices and hurt western producers. But with much of the EC steel industry already in the throes of painful restructuring, and no similar changes yet in evidence in Russia, even free traders within the European Commission, who are sympathetic to Russia's case, say it must make more progress with market reforms to obtain better access. In that spirit, Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for foreign economic relations, says a review clause contained in the co-operation and partnership deal could transform it into a free trade agreement in three years. Trade could certainly be useful as an incentive for Russia to speed up domestic reforms. In a move which should help strengthen Russian manufacturers' case in the face of accusations that they benefit from unfair energy subsidies, the government plans to free coal prices from today and domestic oil and gas prices by the end of the year. Russia is also putting the finishing touches to a market-sharing compromise with the US and the EC which could show the way in other sectors and will give it the right to conduct 12 commercial satellite launches between 1995 and 2000. This is despite fears at western Europe's Arianespace that it could be wiped out by Russia's ability to conduct launches at half its cost.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 17 February reports that Manuel  Hermoso, head of the autonomous government of the Canary  Islands, will arrive in Havana on 18 February for a visit both  friendly and official. He will be accompanied by a businessmen's  delegation. Hermoso and Pedro Chavez, president of the  Provincial Assembly of the People's Government of Havana City  Province, are to sign a cooperation agreement. After meeting  with the Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Small  Farmers, and other organizations, Hermoso and the delegation  accompanying him are scheduled to leave for Venezuela on 23  February.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 17 February reports the  following: Cuban biotechnology specialists have made, from  marine microorganisms, a compound that can biodegrade oil spills  in the sea. Among the advantages of this compound is the fact  that it can be stored for use when needed. Specialists say the  Cuban biological compound is very different from existing  compounds .    The four-star, 140-room Farallon del Caribe Hotel has been  officially inaugurated at the Marea del Portillo tourist hub in  Granma. Cubanacan president Abraham Maciques highlighted the  hotel's importance to the region's economic and social  development. ""The tourist complex is run by the Canadian firm  Commonwealth Hospitality, whose president was present at the  inauguration."" With the opening of the new hotel the tourist  complex has a total of 280 rooms. The Marea del Portillo and  Punta de Piedra Hotels are also in that area.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 18 February reports that the  Cuban Hydrography Institute, in cooperation with several  scientific institutions, has collected a large amount of data  through the embankment works carried out in the northern part of  Ciego de Avila and Camaguey. With these data the institute has  published an oceanographic atlas of extremely good quality which  was submitted to the third congress of marine science. According  to Engineer Angel Luis Chirino, one of the authors of the atlas,  the oceanographic atlas of the waters of the Sabana-Camaguey  archipelago is the result of more than 20 years of research by  the Cuban Hydrography Institute. This atlas reflects the  ecological changes caused by the embankment works carried out in  the zone and all the oceanographic variables of temperature,  currents, salinity, and tides. He added that more than 20  researchers participated in this work. More than 100 km of  rockfill embankments are being built in the archipelago to  facilitate exploitation of area resources for tourism purposes.

Cuba has carried out ""a social project for  more than 30 years. It has overcome imbalanced trade situations  and all those misconceptions about one's worth,"" Robaina stated.    Over the past years, according to the foreign minister, the  Cuban Government has made important reforms, above all in  economic aspects. Such reforms are not contrary to the  revolution, because the word itself signifies change and ""this  country has been changing and revolutionizing since I learned  how to reason.""    Robaina told the Mexican newspaper that over the past months  ""we saw the need to decriminalize the dollar and we did so. In  agriculture we decided to turn over the state lands to the  people so that they could make them productive."" He added that  in the future they might make other decisions ""which cannot even  be conceived now, because life dictates necessities and one must  have a fresh and agile mind to adapt to new circumstances, no  matter how hard it may seem.""    The Cuban foreign minister said that ""the same generation  that staged the Moncada attack has headed the attack on the new  times, which demonstrates its revolutionary capability, its  constant renewal, and the profound, enriched, and expert  thinking of a group that is capable of directing changes without  losing the essence.""    Robaina reiterated that Cuba is not willing to lose any of  its achievements. He stressed that ""our independence, our  sovereignty, and our capability to speak with our own voice  cannot be modified."" Personally, he said, he would like to be  able to emerge from the difficulties soon, ""so that reason will  prevail once and for all and the United States will lift the  economic, commercial, and financial blockade to which we have  been subjected.""    The foreign minister explained his wish to request that ""the  pressures be lifted, so that we can rejoin a more fair and  equitable world economy, so that our people can again enjoy the  standard of living which it had before the special period, and  so that it can achieve much more.""

A correspondent of the TATAR-INFORM Agency  asked Mukhammat Sabirov, prime minister of Tatarstan, to  describe how the government will in so short a space of time  prepare for discussion at a special session of the Supreme  Soviet a document that will possibly determine the future course  of the republic's economic development.    [Khidiatullina] The Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of  Tatarstan is working on an anticrisis program. Is the situation  in the economy that serious?    [Sabirov] Perhaps we have not been all that successful in  our  choice of terms. I would not say that our economy is in a crisis  phase. Of course, many enterprises are approaching this, but  there is a whole number of sectors that are developing perfectly  normally. Nonetheless, as of the start of 1994 the situation has  been getting more acute by the month.    It cannot be forgotten that the integration of Tatarstan's  economy in that of Russia is so strong that we cannot fail to  experience all its fluctuations. We have powers sufficient  merely for influencing the speed and abruptness of these  changes. I refer primarily to the situation that has taken shape  on account of the mutual arrears. M. Shaymiyev, president of the  Republic of Tatarstan, and members of the Cabinet of Ministers  of Tatarstan have since last year been trying to persuade the  leadership of the Russian Federation to agree to mutual offsets.  This can in no way be called a market measure, of course, but  nor has Moscow thought up any other solution as yet. And  everyone has become a debtor in this time. Even those that are  working and selling their products without interruption. The  Tatneft Association has been forced to lay people off and send  them on administrative leave because there is nothing with which  to pay them. This huge enterprise cannot obtain the R400 billion  it has earned. Reciprocal debts between enterprises of Tatarstan  and Russia now constitute approximately R2 trillion.    Several days ago I traveled to rural areas of the republic.  There are farms on which people have not been paid since  November!    Many people are applying to the banks for loans. You are  well  aware of the rate--21 percent and higher. If their repayment  times are missed, the amount doubles. The enterprises are,  understandably, embedding these charges in production costs--a  well-known chain! And there are some organizations and small  plants that are already being refused credit (the banks fear for  their money also), and the former, having spent up their working  assets, are starting to eat through their fixed capital.    We are in a position to support only firms manufacturing  products which the republic needs. We will do this regardless of  forms of ownership of the enterprises.    Some of them will be deemed insolvent, but what is to be  done? Tatarstan cannot resolve this problem alone. Particularly  when it is a question of plants of the former  military-industrial complex. It is splendid, of course, that  virtually no weapons are being produced by our hands now, but  these enormous machine tools which manufactured aircraft wings  or the hulls of warships are not ready for the manufacture of  flat-irons or washing machines. How to provide work for 160,000  persons who, following every conceivable reduction, remain at  these plants? We are managing to do some things. The  construction of a tanker fleet will ensure long-term orders for  the Gorkiy Plant in Zelenodolsk, helicopters of our specialized  association enjoy continued demand, and the Kazan Aviation Plant  has called and announced that, aside from the Tu-204, there is a  decree of the Government of the Russian Federation on the  placement of orders for the new Tu-330 cargo plane carrying  20-30 tonnes. But such enterprises as the Lenin  Science-Production Association cannot, whichever way they turn,  making linoleum and artificial leather, resolve the problems of  conversion. It is essential that Russia begin to fulfill its  obligations identified in the treaty and intergovernmental  agreements. But, despite all our efforts, we have been unable as  yet to adopt the necessary measures.    [Khidiatullina] So an operational program of the solution of  Tatarstan's problems is essential?    [Sabirov] Undoubtedly, but everything must be done to ensure  that this program work with a view to the future. Only a madman  could dream of a return to the past, but we have not really  attempted to ponder in earnest what precisely the economic  system in our country might look like. Work has been under way  in the Cabinet of Ministers for a year now, it is true, on the  ""Guidelines of the Economic and Social Development of the  Republic of Tatarstan Corresponding to the New Constitution of  the Republic of Tatarstan."" Scientists, economists, and  practical experts have been taking part. The draft has already  been prepared. Foreign specialists are conducting an expert  appraisal of it at this time. Together with the Constitution of  the Republic of Tatarstan, the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan, and the government program, it will be the basis of  the program of stabilization of the economy of the Republic of  Tatarstan that is being devised at this time. The main aim is to  ensure that any development of events have as little affect on  our people as possible. We are studying the economic situation  of many countries and borrowing the positive experience of  Germany, Hungary, and Turkey. But none of these states can  suggest specific solutions for us. For example, Turkey's private  enterprises are working excellently, and their product is  competitive. But we cannot fail to be alerted by the rate of  inflation and the appearance of large masses of impoverished  people here. We must blaze our own trail.    [Khidiatullina] How is the work on the document that will be  offered for discussion by the deputies of the Supreme Soviet of  Tatarstan going in practice?    [Sabirov] All ministries and departments are drawing up  their  proposals at this time. Every five days members of the  government meet to discuss the progress of the accomplishment of  this important task. We had been prepared to consider several  alternative versions, but when we began to listen to the  proposals of the ministers and deputy prime ministers, we  realized that there were no sharp disagreements. Everyone,  generally, sees the goal identically. Differences arise during  discussion of the tactics of its achievement.    [Khidiatullina] This is strange. A few days ago Ravil  Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan,  speaking at a news conference, complained that the number of  conservatives surrounding the prime minister was inordinate....    [Sabirov] It is possible that this opinion emerged because  everyone was engaged in the solution of problems of his own  department or sector. We had never exchanged opinions on  strategic matters so candidly before. Now, after several such  meetings and frank exchanges of opinion, we have succeeded in  bringing our positions closer together. This is easily checked,  incidentally, because there are verbatim records of all the  sessions. All agreed on the need for the adoption of  well-considered decisions. And I cannot accuse any member of the  Cabinet of Ministers of any opposition.    The program will incorporate a whole number of practical  measures. In addition, we are formulating a mechanism of its  implementation--enforceable enactments and draft laws and  edicts. Adopting another declaration would be a waste of time. I  allow of the possibility of the Supreme Soviet granting the  president special powers, in accordance with which his edicts  would have the force of law, for the time of realization of this  document. Adopting operational decisions and energetic measures  is impossible without this.    The State Committee for Economics and Forecasting has been  entrusted with collating the proposals of all departments. Its  chairman, Filza Khamidullin, has been relieved of all current  business and has the right to enlist any specialist of the  republic in this work. A rough version of the consolidated  program will be ready by 16 May, and after the amendments--20  May--it will be presented to the president and the chairman of  the Supreme Soviet. All the valuable suggestions of the foreign  experts will have been inserted in it before 25 May. Although,  granted all my respect for them, I am convinced that our  salvation lies in our own hands.    [Khidiatullina] Will you have completed all the work by 30  May, it is a painfully tight time scale.    [Sabirov] Had the Cabinet of Ministers not thus far been  working for, I repeat, almost a year, on a solution of the  problem, doing this in haste, in a matter of days, would be  impossible. But I am now confident that the deputies will on 30  May begin discussion of the program of stabilization of the  economy of Tatarstan.     "

Without implying a reduction in educational budgets, workers are  seeking solutions that would allow consolidation of classes in  several schools, establish multidisciplinary principles, and  fill the entire teaching and work schedule of the personnel.  This will undoubtedly result in the elimination of a number of  positions. However, according to preliminary analyses, only  2,500 workers out of 22,000 will lose their posts. These workers  will take retraining courses, sabbaticals, or other forms of  education, including informal education alternatives, to  maintain their ties with the education sector even if they end  up working in a sector such as the minibrigades.    Ninety-eight percent of the children in Matanzas are  enrolled  in school, with one teacher for every 14 students in all grades  and subjects. Highly developed countries have one teacher per 30  or more students. The state budget for education for 1994 is 75  million pesos; in the decade of the eighties, it reached 82  million pesos, proving that education is a priority despite  difficulties.     "
0,FT934-11893 ,"FT934-11893 _AN-DJ2DCABCFT 931029   FT  29 OCT 93 / US reaffirms its hard line towards Cuba      By LISA BRANSTEN      WASHINGTON   THE US this week firmly rebuffed speculation that there would be a thawing of relations with Cuba, despite speculation that President Bill Clinton might relax the decades-old embargo. Mr Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for Inter-American affairs, pledged total support for last year's controversial Cuban Democracy Act, which tightened many areas of the embargo, including extending it to foreign subsidiaries of US companies. Speaking at a conference sponsored by the conservative Cuban-American National Foundation this week, Mr Watson addressed directly 'a misconception that has emerged from time to time in the press and elsewhere. . . that the Clinton administration intends to soften its policy towards the Cuban regime. That is false. We can neither trade nor negotiate away the human and political rights of the Cuban people.' Mr Watson's speech, however, was not laced with the traditional squeeze-Castro-into-submission rhetoric favored by many of the most conservative Cuban-Americans. Instead he focused on the need to increase the flow of information into Cuba and said the Cuban Democracy Act had allowed substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to go to private organisations in Cuba. Members of more moderate groups who favour negotiations with the communist state said they were not surprised by the administration's tough talk especially given crucial support the powerful foundation gave Mr Clinton in last year's elections. 'He is sacrificing a rational policy for a campaign pledge,' said Mr Kevin Harris of the Cuban-American Research and Education Fund. But there were promising signs in the actions if not the words of the administration, he said. Last month, for example, Cuba turned over to the US two suspected cocaine traffickers who had fled to the island. In another sign of co-operation, the US in September agreed to repatriate Cubans who came to the US in the 1980 Mariel boatlifts and have been convicted of felonies in the US. Congressman Robert Torricelli, one of the loudest advocates of maintaining the stringent embargo on Cuba, said he had asked Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, to prosecute a group of US citizens who he said violated the embargo by traveling to Cuba as tourists.

This primarily applies to  the economy and trade. Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin  pointed out during a meeting with his British counterpart John  Major, who is paying an official visit to our country, that  according to last year's results Britain was third in Western  trade with Russia. Neither side intends to rest on its laurels.  During the British delegation's visit to Moscow they discussed  plans to step up cooperation in the field of fuel and energy and  communications, as well as in education, science, and culture.    Such an important avenue of our cooperation as British  firms'  involvement in implementing the privatization program in Russia  will be ""inspected"" by John Major in Nizhniy Novgorod, which he  is to visit after Moscow 16 February. It is there that the  practical aid that British capital has afforded the oblast  administration's efforts is most palpable.    The day before in Moscow's Kremlin a symbolic line was drawn  under the period of hostility between our states, a period which  for several years now has effectively been at an end. The  Russian president and Britain's prime minister signed a joint  statement on nontargeting of their strategic nuclear weapons  against one another. During the delegations' talks in the  Kremlin it was also pointed out that military cooperation  between our states gratifies the two countries' leaders.  However, as far as developing this cooperation is concerned,  the sides have at the moment confined themselves to a fairly  cautious ""agreement in principle"" that Russian and British Army  subunits should hold a series of joint exercises from early 1995  on both Russian and British territory.    The politicians were also cautious in their statements on  the  military-political aspects of our relations during a meeting at  the Russian Defense Ministry in the afternoon of 15 February.  Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev received  British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd. In the opinion of  Russia's defense minister, it was noted at this meeting that the  ""Partnership for Peace"" principle proposed by NATO is a good,  attractive principle. However, when talk turns to putting this  into practice, it is obvious that the concrete programs for  implementing this partnership are currently at the development  stage.    John Major voiced a fairly optimistic opinion of the results  of his discussion of the Bosnian crisis with Russia's leaders,  noting the Russian-British (in this case also read NATO) mutual  understanding ""on many important aspects of a settlement to the  conflict."" President Yeltsin was more restrained in his  opinions, saying that ""some people are trying to resolve the  Bosnian question without Russia's involvement. We will not  allow that."" It is easy to guess that the NATO  military-political leadership is the unnamed ""some people.""  Evidently one of the aims of John Major's visit was to try to  win Russia over to NATO positions, secure its consent to the  planned troop operation in Sarajevo, and thus invite Russia to  take part in that resolution of the Bosnian conflict. However,  both President Yeltsin and Premier Chernomyrdin clearly told the  British premier that Russia has its own view of how the conflict  should be resolved, namely that peace can only be secured in  Bosnia via negotiation.    On the whole the British premier's visit to Russia clearly  showed that Britain and Russia are profoundly committed to  developing a mutually beneficial partnership and establishing  the kind of relations that may indeed become partnership  relations in the near future, as Boris Yeltsin suggested during  his visit to London.

In an interview with the news agency BELINFORM, Kebich said  that ""on the contrary, (Belarus's) more modern fixed assets than  in Russia, highly skilled labour, and well developed  transportation and industrial infrastructure will ensure that  the merger of the two monetary systems will become a long-term  condition of the stabilisation of the common currency.""    The announcement followed a statement by former Russian  Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar that the merger of the two  systems is detrimental to Russia.    Kebich believes that the dispute is caused by ""the very  monetary approach towards complex economic processes in the  economy of the transitional period. Certain circles are tossing  up an idea that only a monetary system can affect the economy,  while ignoring other factors which are equally important.""    Speaking about inflation in Belarus, Kebich stressed that  the  devaluation of the Belarusian coupons is partly caused by the  huge debts of Russian consumers to Belarusian enterprises, as  well as by a big discrepancy between energy prices in the two  republics.    Earlier today Belarusian First Vice-Prime Minister Mikhail  Myasnikovich said that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems is beneficial to both republics.    The Belarusian vice-premier said that Belarus is doing  everything possible to agree the tax, banking, customs and  foreign economic policies. The talks on these issues were in  progress during the entire last year. On many of them  agreements have been reached. ""We are working within the  framework of an agreed tax, licence and quota policy,""  Myasnikovich said.    He stressed that the merger of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems aims at removing barriers in trade and monetary  cooperation that emerged after Russia seceded from the rouble  zone, starting the chaotic development of independent monetary  policies in CIS states.    In a joint statement signed on January 5, the heads of  government of Russia and Belarus stated that the necessary  preliminary work for merging the two monetary systems has been  completed.     "

I foresee a future in which all my friends have jobs, and I  am a commercial pilot, said Reinaldo Rodriguez, one of dozens of  children questioned this morning by Radio Rebelde about how they  would like to celebrate this day dedicated to them.    I would also like our neighbor to the north, the United  States, to lift the blockade that has caused my family, friends,  and country so many difficulties, added Rodriguez, a sixth grade  student who attends school in Havana.    Many other youngsters said they enjoy a happy childhood,  despite the adverse economic situation the island has  experienced during the last four years following the loss of its  main trading partners in the now-vanished socialist camp, which  was led by the former Soviet Union. Official reports gathered  by PRENSA LATINA indicate that Cuban children, despite the  critical economic situation, maintain education and health  standards equal to those of the world's most developed nations.    Cuban officials said that even in 1993, described as the  most  difficult year of the so-called special period, infant mortality  was 9.4 per 1,000 births, ranking Cuba among the 20 nations with  the lowest infant mortality rate. The officials added that the  preschool mortality rate was reduced to 5.9 per 10,000 in 1993,  one of the lowest rates internationally.    They stressed that up to five years of age, Cuba has one of  the highest survival rates in the world -- 98.8 percent, while  in the 5 to 14 year range the mortality rate has remained very  low for five years -- 0.4 per 1,000 residents.    The Health Ministry pointed out that deaths caused by  diarrheic infections and acute respiratory ailments have been  noticeably reduced to an average of between 0.3 and 0.7 percent  in infants up to one year old and between 0.3 and 0.8 percent in  children up to five years old.    The Health Ministry reported the main causes of infant  mortality in Cuba are similar to those in developed countries:  perinatal afflictions and congenital defects, adding that young  Cubans are immunized against 11 diseases, often using vaccines  developed exclusively on the island. The Health Ministry  specified the hepatitis B and the meningitis meningococcus type  B vaccines, and this year protection was intensified against  measles -- a disease whose transmission has been curbed in Cuba  since mid-1993.    Meanwhile, the Cuban Education Ministry today said that the  likelihood of all Cuban children continuing their education is  guaranteed.    The national budget assigns education and health together  2.440 billion pesos -- at the official exchange rate on par with  the U.S. dollar -- out of a total budget of 12.502 billion pesos  allocated for the current year.    Cuban children also sent greetings via fax to all of the  world's children from the UNICEF's office in Havana. May  friendship and love among children fill every corner of the  world like the rays of the sun, because we are the hope of the  world, says the text, which is accompanied by a drawing of  children holding hands surrounded by flowers.

In 1959, the Cuban Revolution implemented what would be the  first agrarian reform in a country where 3 percent of the  landowners controlled 56 percent of the country's total farming  land; 25 percent of the best lands were owned by U.S. citizens.    The law had a profound effect on U.S. monopolies and the  landowning oligarchy, but it still did not limit the possibility  for capitalist development in agriculture. Afterward, in 1963,  it became necessary to issue a second agrarian reform law that  did have a socialist nature and concept, and it represented an  important extension of the country's process of agrarian  restructurization and a reduction in the structure of large  landholdings, given its limited land ownership to 67 hectares.    State ownership of land reached almost 83 percent of the  total surface or 75 percent of the farming surface.  Agricultural and livestock production cooperatives, as well as  credit and service cooperatives, represent 22 percent of the  total farming surface today, whereas the thousands of individual  small-scale farmers hold the other 3 percent.    The state-owned lands were organized into major farms. The  development of ambitious state plans entailed substantial  changes in Cuban rural areas, namely, mechanization,  agricultural aviation utilization, the replacement of teams of  animals, the increase of cultivated areas, the extension of  irrigation, and large-scale use of pesticides, fertilizers, and  herbicides.    Bad habits were also developed, however, as in the rest of  the economy, with the creation of bureaucratic structures that  engendered huge payrolls that had personnel not directly linked  to production. Strong elements of disorganization also became  the norm.    All of these factors had already been seen since the  mid-1980's, and a series of actions, dubbed the process of  errors rectification, was started, after the Socialist bloc  vanished and the USSR fragmented, as it was with these states  with which Cuba conducted 85 percent of its trade and had  reached an important level of integration. It was for that  reason the effect on the economy was so severe.    A major plan of agricultural and livestock production was  already designed in the second half of the past decade, a plan  known as the food program, to allow the replacing of 40 percent  of food imports.    The entire process of broad investment required to develop  the necessary infrastructure was implemented, but the sources of  essential supplies on which the country relied vanished.    Quite the opposite of the results expected for 1992 and  1993,  the country experienced a profound setback in production in  almost all sectors. The agricultural situation is extremely  difficult, creating a scene in which objective and subjective  problems merge:     -  Fuel deficit    -  Shortage of spare  parts    -  Lengthy drought as sugarcane was growing    -  Administrative  and individual adjustments to await the resources that were  received before.    -  Insufficient attention to the crops during  sowing    -  Inadequate use of the available resources    -  Lack of  stimulus for individuals    -  Disorganization and indiscipline    -  Deviation and subtraction of resources.     In view of this situation, the country's leadership decided,  as part of the measures being implemented to revitalize the  economy, to create the basic cooperative production units, UBPC,  whereby farmers are given state lands for their own profit, and  to base production on cooperatives.    As a matter of fact, this situation entails a profound  structural change in the organization of agriculture in Cuba  that will have a major importance and an extraordinary potential  and scope. Although it has not been officially given that name,  we are basically facing the third agrarian reform law the  revolution is implementing. On this occasion, it is taking  place within the state sector.    This new unit of organization:     -  Sets indefinite use of  lands for profit    -  Owns production    -  Sells to the state    -  Obtains  technical and material goods through purchases    -  Holds banking  accounts    -  Acquires through credit fundamental means of  production    -  Will pay fiscal obligations as contributions to the  country's expenses.    -  Will elect as a group its leaders and  administrators.     Four of the fundamental principles taken into consideration  to create the UBPC are:     -  A direct link between the  individual and the area of work    -  Production for the consumption  of UBPC members and their families    -  The sharing of  benefits    -  Greater self-sufficiency in terms of production with  higher autonomy     The sole objective of this new organization of agricultural  and livestock production is to obtain an adequate formula to  face the crisis in a manner that succeeds in stimulating and  motivating people to raise production with scarce available  resourses under conditions of maximum efficiency and  profitability. Now, this sector has to be efficient and  decrease to a minimum the numerous resources it absorbs from the  budget concerning subsidies.    Farm workers at the service of the state are becoming, by  virtue of the new law, co-owners of production methods and  actual production, and, therefore, they cease to be wage earners  to share directly in the benefits. It is expected that with  this measure, workers will be more dedicated as they become more  supportive and motivated by this activity and that they will  develop a mentality of economics and efficiency.

Sancti  Spiritus Province is among the best in the nation in  self-sufficiency. The goal of ceasing to be a burden to the  national electric power system is being consolidated in Sancti  Spiritus Province, when we consider that they already generate  90 percent of the electricity they need. The huge Uruguay [sugar  mill] in Jatibonico is outstanding in this accomplishment, which  produces 108 percent of its electricity. The (?FNTA) and Ramon  Ponciano mills are also self-sufficient. However, the  potentialities could be even greater if capabilities were used  to greater advantage -- these potential capabilities are a  fundamental factor -- and if exploitation of the installed  turbogenerators was to be improved.    The national average is 20 kilowatt-hours per ton of cane  ground, while Sancti Spiritus' nine mills surpass 22. Other  elements for self-sufficiency in energy are to be found in the  search for alternative measures, such as at the Ramon Ponciano  Agroindustrial Complex, where the cane chaff grinder is yielding  very good results. This chaff makes decent levels of combustion  possible.    This has been a report by Rafael Daniel from Sancti  Spiritus.     "

Robaina stressed during his speech that Cuba's independence,  sovereignty, right to speak for itself, and other principles are  not negotiable.    When introducing Robaina, Monsignor Pedro Padura, bishop of  Rosario, reiterated the Argentine people's solidarity with Cuba  and encouraged the Cubans to continue ""tending their garden of  hope.""    Robaina responded by saying that his fellow countrymen know  how to tend that garden with ""their sweat, their hearts, and  their very lives if necessary.""    The event was held in a theater in downtown Buenos Aires and  attended by more than 1,000 people. It was organized by the  Solidarity With Cuba group made up of dozens of friendship  societies from various sectors.    The Cuban leader spoke at length of the current situation in  Cuba, denounced the U.S. blockade, and expressed his  appreciation for international solidarity with Cuba.    Regarding the anti-Cuban campaign focused on the alleged  violation of human rights on the island, Robaina strongly  rejected those accusations and said there are millions of people  in the world who have no rights at all.    There are millions of people, Robaina stressed, who cannot  read or write those two words (human rights).    Robaina met yesterday with Argentine President Carlos Saul  Menem during a meeting the two leaders described as positive.  Robaina also met with members of the Senate and Chamber of  Deputies foreign affairs committees, held two working sessions  with acting Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, and met with  Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez.

Podrazhanets, who  recently assumed the post, believes that it will be very  difficult to raise the level of commercial trade between the two  countries, currently ranging between $300 million and $400  million, the Sao Paulo daily GAZETA MERCANTIL reported in its 31  March-4 April issue. The reasons were cited as threefold:  political instability in Russia, which keeps Brazilian investors  away; shipping costs, which are higher than in the trade between  Brazil and the United States; and a deficiency in providing  sufficient stimulus to the space sector. Russia, GAZETA  continued, is determined to cooperate with Brazil in creating an  infrastructure by supplying technology and equipment for the  satellite launch vehicle project. Russia also wants to  participate in the Amazon protection and surveillance project,  but it lacks the resources to finance equipment sales.    The protocol of intent, signed between Brazil and Russia in  December 1993 and intended to increase bilateral trade to $2  billion annually, has not yet ``gotten off the ground,''  according to Ambassador Podrazhanets, due to difficulties in  finding the mechanisms necessary to implement the project,  particularly resources. ``It's difficult to find the right  products for that type of trade,'' he said.    In May or June, Podrazhanets continued, the Russian minister  of atomic energy will visit Brazil, and in the ensuing months, a  joint economic and commercial commission meeting will be held,  during which Russia will discuss its interest in increasing  cooperation in the areas of space, energy, and mining.    Cuba Signs ST Accords With State Governments    An article in the Sao Paulo daily O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of  22  March announced that the Cuban and Sao Paulo State Governments  will begin an ST exchange program in April that will bring a  number of Cuban specialists to Sao Paulo state universities. In  the article, Secretary Roberto Muller of the Secretariat of  Science, Technology, and Economic Development remarked: ``We are  particularly interested in the transfer of Cuban technology for  the development of research in DNA and genetic engineering for  plants.'' The exchange program is a result of discussions held  on 18 March between visiting Cuban Minister of Higher Education  Fernando Vecino Alegret and Secretary Muller, University of  Campinas (Unicamp) Rector Carlos Vogt, and Sao Paulo State  University (Unesp) Rector Arthur Roquete de Macedo. Secretary  Muller further commented that the Sao Paulo state government is  also interested in the use of sugarcane waste to generate  thermal energy, as well as the mastery of techniques to increase  the shelf life of cement. The agreement signed with Cuba was  modeled along the lines of the accord signed with the Russian  Government, O ESTADO continued. According to Muller, the  secretariat is already studying the possibility of bringing in  additional researchers, and will shortly be meeting with  university rectors to review the situation.    Consortiums Plan Telecommunications Satellites Launch    Sao Paulo daily FOLHA DE SAO PAULO reported on 25 March that  Brazilian Discount Bank (Bradesco), Odebrecht construction firm,  Monteiro Aranha, Victori Internacional, and Globopar, owned by  businessman Roberto Marinho, formed an association with the  French Matra Marconi Space firm, and established an enterprise  called Latin American Satellite Systems Communications (CLASS)  for the purpose of launching three privately owned satellites to  serve Brazil and neighboring Southern Cone countries. A second  consortium, formed by the Itamaraty Group owned by businessman  Olacyr de Morais, Splice do Brasil, and the German firm Deutsche  Aerospace will compete for the same market acting as an  associate and commercial representative of the Argentine Nahuel  satellite.    The two consortiums, according to FOLHA, want to compete  with  the Brazilian Telecommunications Company (Embratel) in data  transmission and offer options for new services, particularly in  the area of cable television. Both the Nahuel satellite and the  three satellites of the CLASS project will operate on the KU  band, which is higher than the frequencies of Brasilsat's C  band, and will allow TV signals to be picked up by 6O-cm  parabolic antennas that can even be installed on apartment  verandas.    The CLASS project, which will involve investments of $300  million, was announced on 24 March during the Fourth  International Telecommunications and Teleinformatics Congress  (Telexpo) in Sao Paulo. Victori International Vice President  Joao Santelli Junior told FOLHA that the project is only now  being made public but has been in planning since 1992. In  November 1993, the consortium asked the Ministry of  Communications for three orbital positions. On 22 December,  former Telecommunications Minister Hugo Napoleao petitioned the  UN International Telecommunications Union (UIT) to authorize the  orbital space positions, but the UIT has not yet published its  decision. If the request is granted, the CLASS project and the  Nahuel consortium will still need authorization from the  Ministry of Communications.    According to Olacyr de Morais of the Itamaraty Group, the  telecommunications market has great potential and several  competitors are vying for it. FOLHA reported that that  consortium has more ambitious plans than simply shareholder  participation in the Argentine Nahuel satellite and intends to  launch its own satellite.    Brazilian Communications Minister Djalma Morais remarked  that  Embratel and the state telephone companies are interested in  participating as shareholders in the CLASS project; there may be  criticisms from within Embratel ranks, however, of any attempt  to launch private satellites. Some Embratel representatives  believe that the operation of satellites is part of the state  telecommunications monopoly. Communications Minister Morais,  however, is of the opinion that the satellites will only provide  limited services and therefore will not effect the state's  monopoly.    Victori International Vice President Joao Santelli Junior  also told FOLHA that the CLASS project intends to launch the  first satellite in 1996 and the second in 1997. He said that the  KU band satellites will also make it possible to install  telephone terminals at an average cost of $3,000 each in remote  areas. The current installation cost in remote areas of Brazil  is as much as $100,000 per terminal.    CNEN, SCIENTISTS FAVOR QUADRIPARTITE SAFEGUARDS  ACCORD--Prior  to the 9 February Brazilian Senate's approval of the  quadripartite nuclear safeguards agreement (QSA) between Brazil,  Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and  Control of Nuclear Materials (ABACC), and the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), National Nuclear Energy Commission  (CNEN), President Marcio Costa and various scientists commented  favorably on the agreement's impending Senate ratification in  Sao Paulo O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 8 February. O ESTADO began by  quoting a press statement made in Rio on 7 February by CNEN  President Marcio Costa supporting the Senate's ratification of  the QSA which will authorize international inspections of  Brazilian nuclear installations. Although he opined that Brazil  will lose sovereignty in the nuclear area, the CNEN head said  that he was in favor of its ratification in order to avoid  retaliations by First World countries. Costa criticized Germany,  which had earlier threatened to break the 1975 Brazil-FRG  nuclear accord, suspend the transfer of technology, and withdraw  support for Brazil obtaining a permanent seat in the UN Security  Council. ``They pulled off the worst swindle in the country with  that technology transfer story.''    O ESTADO then went on to quote Ennio Candotti, former  president and member of the council of the Brazilian Society for  the Progress of Science (SBPC), as saying that Brazil should  ratify the quadripartite accord and the Treaty of Tlatelolco.  ``But it is important,'' he added, ``to extend those agreements  to the countries that today hold arsenals of nuclear arms such  as the United States, France, Britain, and Germany itself.''  Candotti then commented on Germany's threats: ``I didn't even  know that a nuclear accord with Germany was still in effect, so  numerous have been the mistakes earmarking the 1975 treaty that  provided for the construction of eight power plants.''  Furthermore, he added, ``a seat on the UN Security Council is  not acquired through bartering agreements and disagreements.''    Professor Giorgio Moscati, head of the Physics Institute's  Experimental Physics Department of the University of Sao Paulo  (USP), believes that Brazil should ratify the accords, O ESTADO  continued. ``There is no reason for the country not to open up  for a peaceful program and open itself up to international  inspections,'' he remarked. Then Brazil will, in return, be able  to demand that it cease being discriminated against in imports  of products that may have a military application, he added. O  ESTADO then noted that Professor Ivan Cunha Nascimento, head of  the USP Applied Physics Department, is of the same opinion.  ``The accord should be ratified, simply because Brazil is  discriminated against internationally and consequently does not  have access to state of the art technology that may have a  military application.'' He further explained that ``Brazil is  considered a `sensitive' country abroad for having a nuclear  program that is neither known nor inspected.''     "

Garcia]    [Text] Havana 23 Apr (PL) -- Miami resident Magda Montiel  is happy to know that many of the emigrants attending a meeting  with the Cuban authorities have put aside their arrogance, which  is a result of defeats, and are thinking of the welfare of their  country.    Montiel, a former congressional candidate for the State of  Florida, and 209 other emigrants are attending ""The Nation and  the Emigrants"" conference under way in Havana.    According to Montiel, this conference, which she describes  as  a ""reencounter with the homeland,"" is a very important step that  has been very well accepted by the Cuban community living  abroad, including those who once decided to invade the island or  were members of terrorist groups.    Montiel believes the fact that mercenaries, who were part of  the foiled Bay of Pigs invasions in 1961, are now willing to  talk with the same government they tried to overthrow 30 years  ago is very important and will be remembered and written about  in the pages of history.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Montiel said that for  days prior to the conference the television stations as well as  the newspapers talked about the conference and tried to play  down its importance. Montiel added that there were even people  who invented and spread rumors that Fidel Castro was sick.    Montiel recalled that self-appointed Cuban President Jorge  Mas Canosa, head of the ultrarightist Cuban-American National  Foundation (FNCA), has appointed a cabinet and announced the  creation of an emergency junta ""to be prepared for any action.""    The Cuban emigrant added that in the past few days she has  seen Mas Canosa more scared and angry than usual, especially  when his distorted features are picked up by the television  cameras saying: ""Let Castro's friends go to Cuba to eat  lobsters.""    According to Montiel, defeated in the elections by Liliana  Ross Lethinen, an ultrarightist and a FNCA protegee, ""the United  States and the Cubans living abroad do not have the right to  dictate what should happen in Cuba; that is up to those who live  on the island.""    I believe changes must be made on the island because of the  severe economic crisis the country is confronting. Even the  government admits this. But these changes must be made in  accordance to the needs of the people and those who lead them,  Montiel added.    Regarding another kind of change, Montiel said that if the  Cubans did not want their president, he would not be in power  because ""our people's spirit of rebellion does not accept  impositions."" On the need to respect the sovereignty of the  nation, Montiel said that ""we must let the Cubans in Cuba solve  their problems, and, if necessary, we who are outside should  support them as neighbors should.""    Montiel opposes a return to the Cuba of the past. The Cuban  emigrant recalled her happy and fortunate childhood in the Nuevo  Vedado neighborhood in Havana where Santa Claus visited her and  brought her lots of toys while other children were shoeless and  did not even have milk to drink.    I did not see the Mafia or the corruption prior to 1959, but  my parents did, and I know it existed even though there are some  who refuse to admit it, Montiel added. According to Montiel,  the ultra rightists think of yesterday's Cuba (before the  Revolution) as a paradise where everything was rose-colored; but  today, she added, it is a sin to admit the achievements of the  Revolution.    Montiel added that she left the country when she was eight  years old and that it was very difficult to leave her home, her  grandmother, her friends, and the way she lived in Cuba to go to  Miami where everything was different, where one lives in  constant fear of having one's children stolen, even at the  airport or at a shopping center.    Montiel, a well-known lawyer, has her law practice in Miami  and is currently a member of the Cuban Committee for Democracy  (CCD), even though she does not share many of the ideas of the  organization. When asked about the elections in which she ran  against Ross Lethinen for a seat in the U.S. Congress, Montiel  said that had she won she would have shown the rest of the U.S.  Congressmen that not all Cuban emigrants think like those who  support a U.S. blockade.

Addressing the  plenum at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, the Cuban president  broached a sensitive point when he called on the United States  to enact a law that would automatically legalize the status of  Latin American and Caribbean peoples who have entered the  northern country, as it is doing with Cuban citizens today.    The double standard in the U.S. policy regarding immigrants  of the hemisphere can be seen most notably in the last three and  a half decades, as Washington has given special treatment to  Cubans who reach that country while it has repressed the  citizens of other nationalities.    As a result of the Cuban Readjustment Act, enacted in the  United States in 1966, any Cuban, regardless of motive or means  of transportation, may be granted political refugee status  merely by reaching U.S. territory and remaining there for a  year. The laws favoring Cuban immigration and the slowness in  granting permanent residence through legal means have encouraged  illegal departures from Cuban territory. The exceptional,  privileged treatment the United States grants to Cuban  immigration is contingent upon a political premise that is not  given to citizens of other regional countries.    There are instances in which fragile boats full of Cubans  and  Haitians have reached the coast of the Florida peninsula: Cubans  searching for better economic opportunities and Haitians  escaping military repression. The U.S. authorities returned the  Haitians, but the Cubans received every possible assistance and  were quickly able to legalize their status and subsequently  turned over to their relatives.    More than 7 million immigrants entered the United States  between 1981 to 1990, according to official figures, but Cuba  ranks 16th among the countries that contribute the most  immigrants. There is no other reason, other than political, to  treat Cubans with privilege to the detriment of the remaining  Latin American and Caribbean immigrants, especially Mexicans.    No wonder the Cuban president just stated the following in  Cartagena de Indias: At a time when the Berlin Wall no longer  exists, the wall being built at the Mexican-U.S. border should  be torn down.

Radio Reloj at 1945 GMT on 12 April reports that the goal of  Havana Province's Agro-94 is to harvest 1.5 million quintals of  tubers and vegetables. Potatoes constitute 900,000 quintals of  this figure. A portion of this amount is to be distributed  directly to the population and the rest stored in refrigerated  facilities. The breakdown of the expected harvest is 190,000  quintals of carrots, 240,000 quintals of cabbage, and 130,000  quintals of plantains .    Cuba Vision Network at 0000 GMT on 13 April reports that an  animal feed factory, the first in Cuba, is under construction in  Primero de Enero Municipality, Ciego de Avila Province. The  factory, which is 60 percent completed, uses Cuban technology  and will produce 750 tons of feed daily. The product will be  enriched with oils and honey, producing a Cuban feed that will  serve, basically, to replace imported feed for poultry and pigs  in Ciego de Avila Province.    In the same newscast, Cuba Vision Network reports that a  bridge that is almost finished along the Caibarien-Cayo Santa  Maria causeway is considered the biggest of its kind in Cuba.  The bridge is over 7 meters high and 350 meters long and is  expected to be finished by 21 April.    Radio Reloj at 1934 GMT on 13 April reports that the  fishfarming center in Cumanayagua Municipality, Cienfuegos  Province, has promised to produce over 7 million tilapia fry by  the end of this year to be sown at dams and minidams. The radio  also reports, from Cienfuegos, that a 2.5-megawatt  turbogenerator has been installed at the Espartaco complex in  Palmira.    Radio Reloj at 1940 GMT on 13 April reports that 250,000  campers have used campsites from January to date. During a press  conference, Francisco Rodriguez, operations director of the  National People's Camping Enterprise [Empresa Nacional de  Campismo Popular], announced that, with a view to improving  campsites, the price of lodgings and equipment rentals will be  raised as of 1 May.    Radio Reloj at 1943 GMT on 13 April reports that 130,000  poles of tobacco have been collected to date by the cooperatives  and small farmer sectors in Los Palacios, Pinar del Rio  Province, a quantity that represents 50 percent of the plan for  the current harvest.    Radio Rebelde at 2300 GMT on 13 April reports that Cuba  expects to be ready to test a Cuban-made cholera vaccine in some  Latin American country by the end of the year. Cuba is employing  genetic engineering to produce the vaccine.    Radio Rebelde at 0900 GMT on 14 April carries an 1-minute  interview with Colonel (Rene Alvarez Perez), chief of the Giron  de Victoria unit in Havana Province, who says that members of  the unit are supporting the potato harvest and that 630,000  quintals of potatoes and 29,000 quintals of carrots have been  harvested. The unit has surpassed the original objective of  500,000 quintals of potatoes. This force of approximately 1,800  men has worked in six municipalities.    Radio Rebelde at 1700 GMT on 14 April reports that the  British tourist operation company Sun World will tender its  letter of credentials in Cuba to begin operations on the Santa  Lucia beach in Camaguey Province. It intends to bring the first  tourists by next month. The same report adds that at the close  of the first quarter this year, as compared to the same period  the previous year, Cubanacan's regional administration has  reported an increase in the number of tourists brought to this  northern coast beach.    The same newscast reports that the National Poultry Complex,  the CAN, is celebrating its 30th anniversary. Agriculture  Minister Alfredo Jordan Morales said that the CAN represents an  example of organization, integrity, and efficiency. Despite  difficulties affecting the supply of raw materials and other  resources necessary for egg and poultry production, egg  production has increased during the first quarter of this year.  The CAN is capable of processing its own raw materials and to  carry out complete production.    Radio Rebelde in the same newscast reports that  approximately  500,000 tons of potatoes have been harvested in Matanzas  Province with 15 caballerias yet to be harvested. This forecasts  a lower result than expected. The setbacks this time are related  to the appearance of insects. In Las Tunas Province, 1,240  caballerias of sugarcane were weeded during the past 10 days and  50 caballerias of cane were planted.     "

Yeltsin voiced this statement on Thursday morning  before his departure to the Greek island of Corfu where he is to  sign this agreement with leaders of the European Union countries  on June 24.    Responding to journalists, Yeltsin said that until now there  have been discriminating measures in the relations between the  Russian Federation and European Union ""we had no quotas for  goods export."" According to Yeltsin, this draft agreement says  that Russia is recognized as a country with an economy of a  transition type. He also added that the draft agreement with  the European partners establishes the most favored nation regime  in trade.    Yeltsin is convinced that this is a very important fact, as  well as the establishment of precise dimensions in the sphere of  trade and export of goods from Russia.    ""Russia will only win thanks to signing of this agreement.  This is the first practical move when Russia enters Europe and  becomes a European country of full value,"" Yeltsin emphasized.  He made it clear that the draft agreement also determines  concrete volumes of quotas, namely ""how much uranium and  aluminium we shall sell."" ""Earlier we were not allowed to Europe  with these goods and now we have determined how much we can and  must sell. This is very good,"" Yeltsin said.    Mentioning domestic problems, Yeltsin underlined that he  does  not intend to suspend his decree on measures to combat banditism  and organized crime.    IF Note: On Wednesday the lower chamber of the Russian  parliament recommended to the president to abstain from  introduction of this decree as it assesses this decree as an  anti-constitutional one.    In response to our Interfax special correspondent Boris  Grishchenko on his arrival to Corfu, Boris Yeltsin declared that  ""blockade will be lifted from Russia"" after the signing of these  documents with the European Union. As he said, it is Europe  ""which will be the first to remove this blockade. However, the  blockade on the part of the United States still remains.""    The agreement which Yeltsin called ""a historic document""  will  be signed on Friday afternoon. It consists of 81 pages.    In Yeltsin's words, it will help Russia to enter the  European  market and the Russian market will be open for Europe. ""We  become equal partners for the sake of mutual benefit,"" Yeltsin  empathized.     "

It is rather difficult to understand how someone could  invite  Zhirinovskiy, who a week ago spoke in an inappropriate manner  about the Czech Republic and its political life, Zieleniec said.    Miroslav Sladek's SPR-RSC today invited Zhirinovskiy to  visit  the Czech Republic with the goal of ""obtaining objective  information about the programme and objectives of Zhirinovskiy's  party."" Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP), which emerged victorious in the recent Russian  parliamentary elections, told REUTER that ""the Czech Republic  will lose Moravia soon and only Prague and a few breweries in  which the beer will turn sour will be left of it.""    Zieleniec voiced the view that what is important in the  world  from the international point of view is also important for the  Czech Republic. He said he firmly believed that the  developments in Russia were important not only for the Czech  Republic but for Europe and the whole world. ""It is a matter of  dire significance for all of us whether or not democracy will be  installed in Russia and whether or not a market economy will be  stabilised there,"" Zieleniec said.     "

Sanin was greeted at Jose Marti Airport in the capital by  her  Cuban counterpart Roberto Robaina, Colombian Ambassador to Cuba  Ricardo Santamaria Salamanca, and Cuban Ambassador to Colombia  Jesus Martinez Beaton.    Just after her arrival in Havana, the chief of Colombian  diplomacy laid a wreath at the monument of Cuban national hero  Jose Marti at Revolution Square, and later she headed to the  headquarters of the Cuban Foreign Relations Ministry to begin  official talks.    Sanin's visit was preceded in the past few weeks by visits  by  the Colombian ministers of health, mines, and agriculture and a  meeting here of a joint intergovernmental commission for  economic and scientific-technical cooperation. This reflects an  intensification in relations between Havana and Santa Fe de  Bogota.    During her visit, Sanin will have a busy schedule of  activities that includes a visit to the National Library to  donate books and to the House of the Americas to donate several  works of art.     "

Yesterday he left Slovenia after  having been asked by the Foreign Ministry in Ljubljana to leave  the country as quickly as possible. Hinting to the former  Yugoslav republics, he said that every people could not have a  state of its own. He now intends to travel to Serbia. The  following interview with Zhirinovskiy was conducted by Rolf  Gauffin for the Italian geo-political LIMES magazine. The  former French diplomat, who retired in 1991, now works as a  free-lance journalist.    [Gauffin] How important is geography for you?    [Zhirinovskiy] From my early childhood on, history and  geography have been very important for me. In the final years  of my education, I took a particular interest in historical  geography. I was born in deepest Asia, near the Chinese border.  I did my military service in the Caucasus, and then I moved to  Moscow.    [Gauffin] How could Gorbachev hope to liberalize the Soviet  Union without taking territorial and national questions into  account?    [Zhirinovskiy] Gorbachev's political concept resulted in the  disintegration of the state and the collapse of the economy. He  would have had to implement the reforms differently. He would  have had to use the existing power structures of the Communist  Party, particularly that of the KGB, and advance the  democratization of the economy via these very structures, and,  in a second stage, the democratization of politics.    [Gauffin] Why did the Moscow state coup of August 1992 fail?    [Zhirinovskiy] It was not a state coup in the real sense.  It was a fight of two or three groups from the inner circle of  power. This also explains why the state coup was neither planned  nor carried out like a military operation. This is why it  failed.    [Gauffin] In your book (entitled: ""The Last Thrust South?"")  you describe a new security system rather than a Russian empire.  This system comprehends the Baltic states, the Caucasus, and  Central Asia. What option do you prefer? A military presence  without occupation? Would Russia then not risk a repetition of  what is happening in Afghanistan?    [Zhirinovskiy] No, one cannot put it that way. The events  in the Caucasus show that without Russia civil war will break  out there: Armenia against Azerbaijan, Georgia against Abkhazia  and Ossetia. The same will repeat along Russia's southern  border. Uzbeks, Tajiks, Kazakhs -- they will all fight against  each other. There will not be any Russian troops in those  regions. The only thing we can do is sell arms. If these  people want to buy arms then only Russia can do it. We do not  want a new Afghanistan. Still, what can we witness there now?  No government, no president, cities fighting against cities.  That is the future of Afghanistan: The cities will be  destroyed, traffic will collapse, hospitals will cease to  function, and communication links will collapse. The entire  region will go down. Iran, Turkey, and Afghanistan will  intervene, there will be an inferno as in Lebanon or in Northern  Ireland, and then after 20-30 years, they will come back, tears  in their eyes, and beseech Russia to solve the situation --  mainly at a psychological level. Moscow can make sure that the  military operations will stop. The awareness of the strength of  the Russian industry and the power of the Russian Army will stop  all that. These regions and the international community will ask  us, and we will -- with certainty -- stop the disaster, but only  on condition that they pay for it.    [Gauffin] How far would you go in protecting the Russian  minorities in the former Soviet republics, such as in Estonia?    [Zhirinovskiy] First of all, all Russians living outside  Russia should be granted Russian citizenship. We will protect  the Russian minorities mainly through economic measures. If,  for example, the Russians are forced to leave the Baltic states,  thus losing their property, we will add this loss to the price  of goods that we sell there. With this money we will then be  able to pay compensation to the expelled Russians. Take  Estonia, for example: We will impose economic sanctions unless  Russians are granted the right to vote. Considering Russia's  energy resources and its infrastructure, Estonia will completely  disappear as a state. That is the reason why we will never use  military means. We will apply the law and our economy to defend  Russia's interests.    [Gauffin] In an interview with the German NATIONAL-ZEITUNG  you said that the Oder-Neisse line is not yet the last word in  history. Can you define the borders of a future Poland that are  legitimate in your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] Estonia should become part of Russia, because  a large number of Russians lives there. Yet, Tallinn should  remain a city state. Latvia should also be part of Russia,  while Lithuania will become a small, independent state, an  enclave. The area around Kaliningrad also belongs to Russia,  and Poland? Well, Prussia was a German state including Wroclaw  and Szczecin, and all these territories should go to Germany  again. Poland can have the area around Lwow in compensation for  its territorial losses. Belarus would like to be integrated  into Russia. All of eastern Ukraine belongs to Russia and so  does Moldova.    [Gauffin] What about Slovakia?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day Slovakia will also belong to Russia  -- and the Czech Republic to Germany. Austria and Slovenia  should belong together, and Germany, Austria, and Slovenia  should have access to the Adriatic. This is what the German  people want. Thus, the Germans would have historical borders in  the east and south.    [Gauffin] What does the future of Kaliningrad look like?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day we can give Kaliningrad back to the  Germans. We want to return everything to the West it would like  to have.    [Gauffin] As it used to be?    [Zhirinovskiy] Exactly as it used to be.    [Gauffin] What about Hungary?    [Zhirinovskiy] The Hungarians would also like to protect  their population in Romania, this artificial state. Romania did  not exist before World War I. This is why the Dobrudja belongs  to Bulgaria. The remainder will stay with Romania. The  population there comes from Italy.    [Gauffin] And what will happen with Yugoslavia?    [Zhirinovskiy] All foreign troops must leave the country.  The Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians should keep the borders that  exist now. The UN Forces should withdraw so that the warring  parties can settle the conflict among themselves.    [Gauffin] What about Bulgaria?    [Zhirinovskiy] Bulgaria should get back its historical  borders. The Dobrudja also belongs to Bulgaria. And the Greeks  should return Thrace to Bulgaria. But, actually, these are none  of our problems.    Our problems lie in the south. Kazakhstan was never an  independent state, and it belongs to Russia. As far as Japan,  Mongolia, China, and India are concerned, we do not have any  territorial problems.    [Gauffin] Let us take a look at the Caucasus now.    [Zhirinovskiy] Trans-Caucasus. There we have Georgia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia. One day, they will ask to be permitted  to belong to Moscow again.    Yet, we do not want these territories. There are only  criminals there, no reasonable economy, and no opportunities for  profit for Russia. Iran can take over Azerbaijan, while Armenia  and Georgia will go to Turkey. These countries have never been  independent.    [Gauffin] What about Finland and the region there?    [Zhirinovskiy] No problem. Yet, Finland would like to have  Karelia back. All I can say on this issue is that if Finland  wants to have Karelia, all of Finland must go to Russia. We  will not cede one inch in the west. One day, everybody will  return to Russia. Belarus is Russian, Ukraine is Russian, and  the people want to belong to Russia.    [Gauffin] Are you intending to set up a German-Russian axis?  A continental alliance as a counterweight to the Atlantic one?    [Zhirinovskiy] One day, greater Germany, a new Russia, and  India will form a new entente. Then there will be no problems  for the world any more. India and Russia will neutralize China  in Asia; Russia and Germany can control Europe; and Russia and  the Balkan states will solve all problems in the Balkans.     "

In a news conference held in Montevideo,  Uruguay, where he is carrying out an official visit, Robaina  stressed that the Cuban Government decided to associate itself  with foreign capital as an alternative for development in  determined spheres such as tourism, oil, and nickel. Robaina  added that Cuba's economic problems will not be solved with  foreign investments alone.    In explaining the human rights issue, Robaina said that in  Cuba there are no disappearances or tortured people. In  contrast, Robaina highlighted that for some time now, every  Cuban generation has participated in the government.    Robaina also held meetings with members of the Latin  American  Integration Association and with members of solidarity  organizations with Cuba. In the latter, Robaina stated that  Havana hopes to establish normal relations with Cuban emigres  residing in 15 countries, and that the upcoming forum The Nation  and the Emigre Community will help achieve just that.

""Cuba is maintaining absolute respect for something which  has  been the main feature of our foreign policy -- that the Mexicans  may find the best solution to the internal problems which have  developed at this time,"" Robaina added during a news conference  shortly before starting on an official visit to Switzerland and  five African nations.    For the past six days at least 12 communities located  throughout the Mexican State of Chiapas have been the scene of  clashes between the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) and  government troops.    With respect to reports appearing in the Chilean newspaper  EL  MERCURIO related to that country's government not reestablishing  diplomatic relations with Havana before 21 March, the Cuban  foreign minister pointed out that Cuba is not ""impatient or  proposing any date or deadline.    ""It is a decision that only the Chilean Government can make  whenever it considers it convenient and we respect that,"" the  Cuban minister stated.    When asked about Cuba's presence at the new Honduran  president's inauguration scheduled to take place on 27 January,  Robaina indicated that his country had not yet been invited.  Nevertheless, if there is an invitation, he indicated, Cuba  will not be absent.    ""In any Latin American setting our country will not turn  down  an opportunity or an invitation,"" the Cuban minister emphasized.    In reference to prospective relations between Cuba and the  United States in 1994, Robaina believes that there will be no  substantial changes. He added that even though Washington's  tone toward Havana has been less aggressive, a more severe  blockade is still in place.    On the other hand, he mentioned new possibilities in  political and economic ties with Europe, Latin American, and the  Caribbean.    The Cuban foreign minister said that ""Cuba's situation is  very difficult, but we are not at a dead end yet.""    Robaina believes that although 1994 will not entail any  significant changes in the country's internal situation with  respect to 1993, it may be that the [downward] spiral will begin  to reverse.

In an official statement, the Cuban Government stated the  election results end an arduous process of negotiations between  South Africa's leading political forces, a process that will  pave the way to racial equality, freedom, and justice for the  South African people.    The statement also said the end of apartheid befits the  process of profound transformations that took place in the  African South Cone following the battle of Cuito Cuanavale in  Angola, which effected a change in the correlation of forces in  that region of the world.    In the same document, Cuba also stated it is willing to  establish diplomatic relations with South Africa, to which Cuba  offered cooperation and support in the new stage of  reconstruction and consolidation of national unity.

The two sides announced after the meeting that Russia and  the  United States are still partners, although they will have  differences forever.    The statement indicates the U.S.-Russian relations of  partnership will go ahead on a road full of zigzags.    In a world characterized by multi-polarity instead of the  bi-polarity structure, both the United States and Russia are  paying great attention to their mutual relations.    The two heads of state met thrice last year in an effort to  establish a new-type relationship marked by mutual interests,  cooperation and mutual restraint.    At the January Moscow summit this year between Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the  two countries announced that they have ""entered a new phase of  mature strategic relations of partnership.""    However, as the situation in Russia and the international  situation evolve, the two countries have neither solved their  old differences nor prevented new ones from erupting. This has  resulted in repeated bumping and frictions between the two  countries over the past several weeks.    ""A number of gaps have been appearing in the mansion of  Russo-U.S. partnership"" and ""Russo-U.S. relations have  experienced some of the most serious crises for the past few  years,"" local media reports said.    It is not accidental that great ups-and-downs have occurred  in Russo-U.S. relations only months after the Moscow summit.  Local media reports summed up the causes for this change as  follows:    -- Russia is constantly adjusting its own foreign policy,  and  is putting a particular emphasis on an independent policy in  dealing with international affairs;    -- Russia is trying to strengthen its impact and role in  other former Soviet republics to check the expansion of the  United States in those areas; and    -- The evolution of the situation in Russia has aroused  worries in the United States and other Western countries.    Russia's effort to resume its big-power status in the  post-cold war world conflicts with the role of the U.S. as the  only remaining superpower on earth.    Russia has tried to adopt a pro-West foreign policy in order  to win Western aid. However, the policy has not helped Russia  tide over its economic crisis or establish a market economy that  would help the country integrate with the Western world.    Instead, the policy has greatly weakened Russia's impact and  role in the international scene and, to the dismay of many  Russians, the country has lost some of its traditional spheres  of influence.    Yeltsin pointed out recently that Russia's foreign policy is  mainly aimed at ""realizing its national interests"" and its  diplomatic ideas should always ""conform with the supreme  standard of big-power status.""    He called for an end to ""the situation of faulty and  unilateral concessions"" by Russia when it deals with Western  countries.    The Russian foreign minister also said recently that it is a  ""fanatical illusion"" to wish that the world will be ruled by  only one power -- the United States.    The differences between Russia and the United States were  fully shown in the course of the Bosnia crisis.    Russia, as an active mediator in the Bosnia war and as a  traditional friend of the Serbs, was kept out of the door when  NATO decided in mid-February to press the Serbs to withdraw  heavy weaponry from around Sarajevo with threats of air strikes.    Russia countered the NATO decision by persuading the Serbs  to  withdraw the weaponry on time and sending several hundred  Russian soldiers to Sarajevo. This foiled NATO's plan for air  strikes and increased Russia's confidence in resuming its role  in solving major international crises.    Washington, furious with Russia's action on Bosnia,  retaliated by arresting a senior CIA officer for spying for  Russia, and by expelling a Russian diplomat.    The United States has also been active in expanding into  former Soviet republics ranging from the Baltic nations to  Kazakhstan. The U.S. secretary of state visited almost all the  former Soviet republics, promising things from aid in the  removal of nuclear warheads to ""democratic partnership"" pacts.    The U.S. supported the Baltic states' call for Russian  troops withdrawal, provided aid to Ukraine at a time when Kiev  was quarreling with Russia over the natural gas supply, invited  Kazakhstan and some other Central Asia republics to cooperate  with NATO, and supported Georgia's call for sending  international peacekeeping forces to Abkhazia.    Russia, which regards these areas as its spheres of special  interests and responsibility, apparently considers the U.S.  move as a kind of threat to its own security.    Meanwhile, Russia's ever-changing domestic situation has  been  marked since last December by the victory of the right-wing  nationalists in parliamentary elections, the resigning of  pro-West economists from the government, and the amnesty by the  state Duma to free former Vice-President Aleksandr Rutskoy and  former parliament Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov.    All this has aroused worries and scepticism in the West over  the future of Russia's ""democratic and market economic reforms.""    Former U.S. President Richard Nixon, who has been on a trip  in Moscow since early March, was turned down a meeting request  [as received] with Yeltsin.    Nixon's mission is clearly to see for himself what's really  going on in Russia and to report his ""data-collection"" to  Clinton.    Kozyrev and Christopher agreed to further cooperation  between  their countries in dealing with crises like those in Bosnia and  the Middle East, and expressed satisfaction over the meeting.    They also agreed that the two sides would establish specific  organs for guaranteeing their relations of partnership in  dealing with international affairs.    But local media reports have expressed pessimism over  whether  such specific organs can be set up without difficulty.     "

Waigel deplored that the  IMF underestimated the dynamism in the new laender. The IMF  predicted a growth of 0.8 percent, but Waigel considers 1.5  percent possible.

The difference in interest  rates between Germany and the United States has declined from 6  percent to 1.5 percent in the past two years. The long-term U.S.  interest rates have in the meantime even risen above the German  level. This was possible without a change concerning the  exchange rates.    The two German representatives reject plans by the IMF to  create new special drawing rights worth $50 billion.

A Public Health Ministry report  states that top priority is given to vaccinating children  against tuberculosis, hepatitis-B, polio, diphtheria, tetanus,  whooping cough, meningococcus groups B and C, mumps, German  measles, measles, and typhus.    These maladies cause a great number of deaths in  underdeveloped countries, including Latin American countries,  but in Cuba, with its prevention policies, a 95 percent rate of  eradication among the country's children has been guaranteed.    The system begins working immediately after the child is  born, through tuberculosis and hepatitis B vaccinations; and  when they are four weeks old children receive the polio vaccine,  which is then reactivated in subsequent booster shots.    Cuba produces the only effective meningococcus groups B and  C  vaccine in the world, as well as the tetanus toxin and vaccines  intended to prevent typhoid and hepatitis B.    The newspaper GRANMA reported today that a vaccine against  leptospisarosis, as well as other vaccines designed to prevent  various illnesses, is currently being clinically tested as part  of the program that fully protects children and adults.

Now that the final obstacles  have been removed, the way is clear for the new partnership and  cooperation agreement to be signed in Corfu by Boris Yeltsin,  the leaders of the Twelve EU member states and the European  Commission on June 24-25. It marks the most ambitious agreement  ever signed between the Russian Federation and one of its major  world partners.    The agreement, negotiated over one and a half years by the  European Commission will gradually draw the economies of Russia  and the European Union closer together by lifting trade  barriers, offering greater certainty to traders and investors  and promoting the direct investment that the Russian economy  needs. It also paves the way for negotiations on a free trade  area after 1998, while establishing regular political contacts  at all levels and promoting respect for democracy and human  rights.    Welcoming the signature of the agreement, Sir Leon Brittan,  European commissioner for external economic relations, issued  the following statement:    ""By creating a relationship between the European Union and  Russia rooted in friendship, cooperation and mutual economic  interest, this agreement marks a milestone on the road towards  greater economic and political stability across the entire  continent. It builds a solid framework based on mutual respect.  For European companies particularly, it will encourage  investment in Russia by ensuring they are treated as fairly as  domestic companies while guaranteeing them the right to  repatriate profits earned on the Russian market. And it will  help cement reform in Russia by offering the prospect of free  trade in the next century if Russia's reforms are sufficiently  advanced by 1998.""    On this occasion Hans van den Broek, commissioner for  external political relations, stated:    ""This agreement will set the European Union's political ties  with Russia on a far sounder footing by ensuring that heads of  government, ministers and officials meet regularly and  systematically rather than on an ad hoc basis as at present. It  will establish a regular political dialogue enabling the two  sides to consult whenever the need arises. This should  contribute to overall security and stability in Europe. At the  same time, the agreement, which is based on a shared commitment  to human rights and fundamental freedom, will reinforce  political reform in Russia.""    The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement Covers Three Main  Areas:     -  Political dialogue    -  Trade relations    -  The investment  and business environment.     Significant Areas of Agreement Include:     -  Substantial  elimination of restrictions on Russian exports to the European  Union    -  Rules on trade in nuclear materials    -  Steps to open up the  flow of capital and improve conditions for business    -  Agreement on  arrangements to allow banks and other financial services  providers from the European Union to operate in Russia    -  A  provision that the agreement could develop into a free trade  agreement covering cross-border trade in services, the freedom  of establishment of companies and capital movements.     One of the bases of the agreement is the commitment by both  sides to respect the rule of law, to safeguard ethnic  minorities, and to uphold human rights and multi-party  democracy, while stating that the establishment of a market  economy in Russia is of paramount importance.    The Details of the Agreement    Political Dialogue    The agreement seeks to strengthen political links between  the  EU and Russia by establishing a regular political dialogue  between the two sides. The Russian president will meet the  president of the European Council and Commission twice a year,  besides regular meetings between ministers and civil servants.  Dialogue will also be encouraged at parliamentary level. In  addition, a cooperation council has been set up to monitor the  agreement, also enabling the two sides to seek to bring together  their positions on international issues of mutual concern, and  cooperate more closely to ensure that the principles of  democracy and human rights are respected.    Trade Relations    The agreement provides a framework which will allow Russia  to  become integrated into a wider European economic area. 1998 has  been set as the date when the parties will meet to review  progress in economic reform and decide whether to move towards a  free trade agreement. The agreement does not seek to remove all  tariffs right away, for Russia currently has a far higher tariff  wall against EU imports than vice-versa, (the average weighted  Russian tariff to the EU [European Union] is currently 12-14  percent while the average EU tariff to Russia is under 1  percent) suggesting that Russian industry would need time to  adjust before tariffs were removed altogether.    The partnership and cooperation agreement also supports  Russia's future accession to the General Agreement on Trade and  Tariffs (GATT) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO), a move  actively supported by the EU. It does this by already referring  to certain GATT provisions while setting up a reviewing  mechanism which will allow the agreement to be adapted to  accommodate Russia's progressive adoption of various articles of  the GATT.    The partnership and cooperation agreement confirms the  removal of all quotas and other quantitative restrictions on  Russian exports to the European Union, with the exception of  certain textile and steel products. Russia does not currently  impose any quantitative restrictions on European Union imports.  however, the partnership and cooperation agreement recognises  that Russia may need to introduce certain restrictions, given  the extensive restructuring of the Russian economy. Russia  therefore may under certain circumstances introduce some  restrictions in sectors which are curently being restructured,  or where there are serious social problems, or where Russian  companies face near elimination of market share or where new  industries are emerging.    These restrictions, however, can only apply for limited  quantities of goods and for a limited time. Any proposed  restrictions will be discussed between Russia and the European  Union before they are applied.    Under the agreement, both sides agree to consult one another  before increasing tariffs on each other's imports. This is an  important provision. In 1993, Russia exported ECU14.8 billion  ($17.4 billion) of goods to the member states of the European  Union, representing almost 50 per cent of its total exports. In  the same period European Union exports to Russia were worth  ECU11.5 billion ($13.5 billion). Since Russia is not yet a  member of GATT, Russia is largely free to impose tariff  protection. It is therefore necessary to ensure that there is  adequate consultation on any proposed increase in tariffs.    The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement also includes a  safeguard clause, similar to that in the GATT, which protects  against substantial injury to domestic producers. This means  that before curbing imports in a given product, Russia or the EU  must show that there has been both a surge in imports and  substantial injury caused to domestic competitors as a result --  either through loss of market share or a fall in profits, for  example. The agreement also clarifies the terms on which  defensive measures may be used against unfairly subsidised or  ""dumped"" imports. In fact the impact of EU safeguards and  anti-dumping measures has had only a negligeable economic  impact. Only seven products from ex-USSR have faced  anti-dumping duties, while a further eight cases are under way.  Even if these led to anti-dumping action, the total volume of  EU imports from ex-USSR affected would be a mere one percent.    The agreement also contains rules on the trade in nuclear  materials -- both enriched and natural uranium - an issue which  had significantly delayed the negotiation process given the  concern of some EU countries about the impact of increased  Russian imports on their producers. Trade in nuclear materIals  is now covered by the agreement. The two sides will seek to  negotiate a separate agreement covering nuclear fuels by 1997.  A special safeguard provision will apply to trade in nuclear  materials under which the EU will have to show that imports of  Russian uranium have either increased greatly, or are causing  injury to EU uranium producers, before invoking safeguard  restrictions on those imports (i.e. the terms of the previous  1989 ex-USSR agreement)    Investment and Business Environment    The partnership and cooperation agreement introduces some  important initiatives which will improve the ability of  companies from the European Union to operate in Russia and also  improve the climate for direct investment -- a critical issue  given the vast investment needs of the Russian economy. The  first steps in opening up the flow of capital have been taken.  Direct investment in Russia by companies or individuals from  the EU will be freely allowed, as will be the repatriation of  such investments and the profits from them, removing one of the  major disincentives to foreign companies investing in Russia.    As a general principle, European companies will be able to  set up in Russia under conditions at least as favourable as  other foreign companies, and once set up will be treated at  least as favourably as Russian or other foreign companies. The  same will be the case for Russian companies in the European  Union. Once established in Russia, a European Company cannot be  subjected to more restrictive legislation which comes into force  up to three years afterwards.    Russian banks will be able to establish a subsidiary in the  European Union and in return, the Russian market will be  progressively opened up to European banks. This is a  significant step, given that most foreign banks are currently  prohibited from any activity with Russian clients. Moreover,  Russia has agreed to abolish a decree by 1996 which would have  maintained curbs on foreign banks, while assuring that this law  will not apply to those five European banks - Dresdner Bank,  Credit Lyonnais, Generale de Banque of France, Ingbank and ABN,  AMRO of the Netherlands -- which had already been granted  licences to operate in Russia.    The agreement also establishes a framework for insurance  companies in the European Union who wish to enter the Russian  market and also for Russian insurance companies who wish to do  the same in the European Union. Conditions for businessmen and  employees will be improved. There will be nondiscriminatory  treatment of employees once they are legally employed in an EU  member state or in Russia. Mobility of key personnel on  temporary corporate transfers will be increased and the  cooperation council will examine the whole area of business  conditions, including the prompt issuing of visas and residence  permits.    All these initiatives, in both the trade and investment  sectors, will be supported by specific arrangements on taxation,  competition, approximation of legislation and the protection of  intellectual property rights.    The partnership and cooperation agreement also fosters  economic cooperation in a wide range of areas. The objective of  such cooperation is the expansion of the economies of both  Russia and the European Union.    The European Union will provide support for economic  cooperation through the TACIS [Technical Assistance to the CIS]  programme, which fosters the development of harmonious and  prosperous economic links between the European Union and the new  independent states. Through TACIS, the EU has committed some  ECU500 million ($588 million) to Russia between 1991 and 1993,  mainly to promote nuclear safety, restructure state-run  companies, set up public administrations and boost efficiency in  farming, energy, transport and telecommunications, as well as  providing emergency aid.    The partnership and cooperation agreement will only come  into  force after it has been ratified by the parliaments of the  member states of the European Union, the European Parliament and  the federal assembly of the Russian Federation. The European  Commission will therefore prepare an interim agreement which  will allow trade related aspects to be applied as early as  possible.

About half of the ex-USSR's total exports are sold to the EU,  while some 40-45 percent of its imports come from the EU.  Furthermore, the EU has become an increasingly important trading  partner both for Russia and for the whole of the ex-USSR since  the old system collapsed.    In 1993, EU imports from Russia were predominantly minerals  (44 percent) and metals (14 percent), wood and wood products (3  percent) chemicals and allied industries (4 percent). The share  of imports taken up by products considered especially sensitive  to European industry (steel, textiles, nuclear materials,  aluminium, fish) is around 11 percent.    Russian imports from the EU in 1993 were predominantly  electrical and mechanical machines and parts (30 percent),  processed foodstuffs (16 percent), vehicles and aircrafts (11  percent), chemicals and allied products (7 percent), optical and  medical equipment and other precision tools (4 percent),  plastics and rubber (2 percent).    Russia accounts for a little over three quarters of the EU's  trade with the ex-USSR.     "

Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, made an unprecedented appearance at a G7 meeting to brief finance ministers about his negotiations in Moscow on Russia's economic reform programme. The backing given by the G7 communique to co-operation between the IMF and Russia showed how the big industrial democracies have effectively subcontracted responsibility for helping Russia and other former Soviet republics integrate into the world economy to the IMF. But is the IMF's high-profile role in Russia such a good thing? Is the fund itself the right organisation to deal with Russia's problems? Could it be that the western industrial powers are overestimating its ability to keep Russia on track? Is there a danger that it will be overwhelmed by the huge difficulties to be tackled in Russia and emerge from the experience with its prestige and effectiveness diminished? The failure of the Russian government to achieve economic policy goals set five months ago must cast some doubt on whether it will meet the performance targets agreed with Mr Camdessus just before he went to Munich. Recent research into the IMF policies and operations over the past decade by the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, a US think tank, also raises the question as to whether the fund is best suited to the task of promoting economic reform in Russia. Mr Camdessus agreed in Moscow to release a first Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) tranche of IMF credits to Russia in return for sharp cuts in its projected budget deficit and inflation by December. Russia will reduce its inflation to less than 10 per cent a month by the end of 1992 from 15 per cent (and rising) at present. It plans to cut its domestically financed fiscal deficit from 17 per cent of gross domestic product to 5 per cent in the same period. It was not clear in Munich how this would be achieved. The necessary fiscal and monetary measures will be introduced over the coming weeks. The IMF has been assured that most will be enacted by presidential decree, presumably after parliament breaks up for the summer this week. But are these goals realistic in the light of past experience? In late February Russia's government and central bank agreed a programme of stabilisation and reform that envisaged a sharp decline in inflation to a range of between 1 per cent and 3 per cent a month by the fourth quarter of this year when the budget deficit would be around zero. This programme appeared to be on track until upset by decisions of the Russian parliament in the spring. Things may be different this time. The IMF has been careful to strengthen the hand of the Russian finance ministry in drawing up the new programme so that it can be considered as a Russian government programme. If the fulsome tribute made by President Boris Yeltsin in his Munich press conference to Mr Yegor Gaidar, his prime minister, means anything, the Russian government should be able to count on Mr Yeltsin's support in pushing ahead with economic reform. There is some hope that the Russian people and parliament, looking as they are over the abyss at hyperinflation, will pull back and put up with the conditions that IMF support will entail. There is little doubt that the conditions will be painful. Moreover, the IMF will have leverage because of the staged nature of its support. Another Dollars 3bn of credits will not be released before autumn when Russia will have been obliged to meet further economic performance targets and sort out its monetary relations with other republics and especially those staying in the rouble zone. The promised Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund is further off. It depends on progress to currency stability and is unlikely before 1993. This drip-feed technique gives the IMF a strong negotiating position in the event of Russia backsliding on its targets. That Russia could well backslide is suggested by the IMF Assessment Project carried out by the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution of Arlington near Washington. According to Mr Gregory Fossedal, the institution's chairman, achieving currency stabilisation and inflation reduction have been among the weakest areas of fund performance. The institution's study of 90 IMF programmes between 1980 and 1991 also found that the successful achievement of monetary and fiscal targets depended crucially on the implementation of fiscal and monetary policies as planned. Mr Fossedal argues that the IMF is most successful in countries with long-standing democratic and capitalist traditions. He wonders whether the fund can be the 'bold, energetic catalyst' needed to rebuild the former communist states. 'The last time the West faced a challenge of of this magnitude, after the Second World War, the IMF, the World Bank and the UN Rehabilitation and Relief Agency all spent two years attempting to revive the economy of western Europe, to no avail,' he says. Harking back to the introduction of the Marshall Plan, he says: 'Only when a special, self-terminating executive agency was funded, created, debated openly, co-ordinated with joint commissions in the recipient countries, and staffed by the businessmen and investors who would be called upon to support it, did the more focused efforts of the fund and the Bank begin to bear fruit.' Mr Fossedal would like to see a new Marshall Plan for Russia with a new organisation that would move reforms ahead rapidly and have a Dollars 50bn annual budget. But herein lies the rub. One of the reasons the IMF has so much responsibility thrust upon it is that the western industrial nations either will not or cannot produce such financial support. As Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, pointed out last week, the US devoted 1.2 per cent of its gross national product to the Marshall Plan. So far, the G7's contribution to the former Soviet Union amounts to just 0.2 per cent of its combined GNP.  The Financial Times   London Page 13  "

'The differences are significant,' Mr David Johnson, spokesman for the US delegation, said after three hours of talks in the office of the US Mission to the United Nations. Talks will resume today at Cuba's UN mission. Cuba has been reluctant to agree on measures to stem the exodus of refugees to Florida unless the talks are widened to include a relaxation of the 32-year-old US economic embargo on the socialist state. Cuba's chief negotiator at the talks, Mr Ricardo Alarcon, has predicted little progress until the discussions tackle the economic embargo. Before yesterday's round of talks began, Mr Alarcon, Cuba's former foreign minister, insisted that refugees were making the risky crossing of the Florida Straits in flimsy rafts because of hardship caused by the US embargo. The latest flood of Cubans leaving the island began when President Fidel Castro responded to riots in Havana on August 5 by suggesting that his government would no longer stop citizens trying to leave. Since then, more than 28,000 Cubans have tried to reach Florida. President Bill Clinton has tried to stop the flow of refugees arriving illegally by barring them from the US and taking them to US naval base at Guantanamo on the western tip of Cuba. The US has also been seeking other temporary havens in the region for refugees. Panama said yesterday it would let the US house up to 10,000 Cuban refugees in US-controlled territory alongside the Panama Canal. Panama's Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo said the refugees could stay in four makeshift tent cities being built by the US military. The US Coast Guard picked up 620 Cubans from rafts at sea by late afternoon yesterday. Saturday's total was 946, down from nearly 1,300 on Friday. In the talks in New York, Washington has proposed putting in place an 'expanded, predictable, dependable and legal' migration programme, provided Cuba takes steps to prevent an illegal, disorganised exodus from the island.

0,FT924-7214 ,"FT924-7214 _AN-CKSC7AG1FT 921118   FT  18 NOV 92 / Moscow cash crisis hits German exports      By SANDER THOENES      MOSCOW   BETWEEN 1954 and last year, Sachsische Kunststofftechnik Freital exported 12,000 plastic moulding machines from East Germany to the Soviet Union. This year, it has yet to export one. 'Demand for our products in this country is so huge that we could never produce enough,' said Mr Kurt Mitsch, the firm's representative in Moscow. 'But the Russian customers have no money.' For 40 years, Russia was the main customer for East German products. But last year's collapse of Comecon, the economic community of the Communist Bloc, led to a sharp drop in East German trade with Russia. The recent fall of the rouble, a rising D-Mark and severe cash shortages in Russian industry have slowed German trade with Russia to a trickle. In 1991, East German supplies to the former Soviet Union dropped 50 per cent to DM10bn (Dollars 6.2bn), and another steep drop is expected this year. Many exporters have cut working hours and staff, while the textile industry may have to lay off 90 per cent of its 450,000 employees. For Deutsche Wagonbau, maker of nearly all the coaches used on Russian railways, Russian demand is three times higher than its production capacity. But marketing director Mr Hans-Dieter Heinrich says Deutsche Wagonbau has yet to find a way to finance the DM1.5bn delivery of about 1,500 coaches and cargo wagons to Russia in 1993, a deal that covers 70 per cent of its annual production. If the Russian government can not find the money and the German government does not intervene, Deutsche Wagonbau will have to shut down much of its production line, Mr Heinrich said. He fears for 11,000 jobs at the factory itself, and for at least another 60,000 jobs in the supply industry. East German businessmen accuse the German and Russian government of dragging their feet on credits. Most exports from the former GDR to Russia should be paid through Hermes export guarantees, provided by the German government with preferential treatment for East German companies. So far, however, only half of the nearly DM5bn allocated for export credits has been used in Russia. The Russian and German governments had been expected to finalise the Hermes credits by May, but recently the deadline was moved to March 1993. According to Mitsch and other businessmen, the German government has delayed the process by demanding new guarantees from the Russian government, particularly on the malfunctioning bank of international trade, the Vnesheconombank. The Russian government has in the meantime changed its list of priority goods, requesting medical and consumer goods instead of machine parts, for which the Hermes credits were intended. Mr Mitsch fears that his business in Russia may not survive to see the credits approved.

0,FT933-9665 ,"FT933-9665 _AN-DHIDBAAUFT 930809   FT  09 AUG 93 / Belarus seeks currency union with Russia      By MATTHEW KAMINSKI and LEYLA BOULTON      MINSK, MOSCOW   BELARUS, having seen its surrogate currency tumble after the Russian central bank's withdrawal of pre-1993 banknotes, is now trying to tie its economic survival to a new currency union with Russia. The value of coupons issued last year in Belarus to make up for a shortage of rouble banknotes from Russia has fallen 25 per cent in the past two weeks. While roubles traded in Moscow have remained at about Rbs1,000 to the dollar, the coupon, called the hare because of the animal shown on the makeshift banknote, was fetching the equivalent of Rbs1,550 to Dollars 1 on Friday. The weakening of the hare also means that Belarus has to pay more for Russian goods and effectively earns less from its exports to Russia - a body-blow in that most Belarus trade is with its giant neighbour. The exchange rate between the Russian rouble and the Belarus rouble had risen from 1:1.8 on July 24 to 1:2.6 on Friday. Unlike other former Soviet republics enraged by the Russian central bank's withdrawal of notes, the Belarusian government, always respectful towards Moscow in public, appears to accept the central bank move. The reformist chairman of the Belarus parliament, Mr Stanislav Shushkevich, who is also head of state, insisted in an interview that the step had done 'no great damage'. Instead of introducing its own fully fledged currency, as some republics, such as Turkmenistan, plan to do, Belarus would keep the rouble on conditions to be agreed with Moscow, he said. Similar undertakings were made at the weekend by Kazakhstan, the second largest former Soviet republic, and Uzbekistan, the most populous of the Central Asian republics. Central Asian leaders, meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow at the weekend, called for a meeting on September 7 of all republics keen to build an economic union. Russia has long demanded that republics abandon the rouble as their currency or subscribe to common budgetary, financial and monetary policies dictated by Moscow. The central bank move appears to have helped speed their decision. 'We are ready to establish common credit and bank policies, a common tax policy and to set aside all Customs duties,' Mr Shushkevich said. A small country of 10.7m people, which made up just 4 per cent of GDP of the former Soviet Union in 1992, Belarus has staked much political capital on rebuilding economic ties with the rest of the ex-Soviet Union. Staying in a newly recreated rouble zone, government officials hope, might stem the drop in inter-republican trade, down by 40 per cent since 1991. About 70 per cent of imports, including 90 per cent of energy supplies, come from Russia. 'If our relations remained the same as before, the economy would be better,' said Mr Vladimir Khilko, chairman of the Belarus Savings Bank. To that end, even before the central bank move, Mr Vyacheslav Kebich, the prime minister and a conservative, last month agreed to work on an economic union with Russia and Ukraine, due to be signed next month. Mr Kebich and Mr Shushkevich, political opponents, see eye-to-eye on economic union - though Mr Shushkevich, against a majority in parliament, opposes a collective security agreement with Russia.

The information was revealed today during a modest ceremony  to bid farewell to the Cuban delegation that will leave for  Colombia tomorrow to implement the agreement to link the capital  of Valle del Cauca Department and the city located in the  central part of the island.    The Cubans will also participate in the sessions of the  world  meeting of mayors of healthy cities convened by Colombia, which  will be attended by some 100 mayors from various countries of  the world between 1 and 4 June.    The purpose of the meeting will be to exchange experiences  regarding primary health care. The invitation sent to Cuba is  based on the progress attained by the country in that field.    The Cuban delegation includes Humberto Rodriguez Gonzalez,  president of the People's Government (mayor) of Santa Clara, and  Jose Luis Garcia, rector of the Central University of Las  Villas, both deputies and members of the Central Committee of  the Cuban Communist Party (PCC). Another member of the  delegation traveling to Cali is Marcelino Rodriguez Tejeda,  director of the important mechanical industry plant in Santa  Clara and also a member of the PCC Central Committee.    Colombian ambassador to Cuba, Ricardo Santamaria, who was  present at the ceremony, said the movement to twin the cities of  both countries will contribute to the intensification of  bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, economy, and  culture.    Santamaria said one of the fundamental objectives is the  mutual learning of the productive, cultural, and social  activities of both cities. He added that, later on, a Cali  delegation will visit Santa Clara, which will facilitate the  identification of areas of cooperation.    Through this symbolism of city twinning, there are great  efforts made to strengthen bilateral relations because the  future visits of Cali officials to Cuba will include a  delegation of businessmen interested in specific projects.    The diplomat also talked about the important increase in the  balance of trade between the two countries during the last four  months as recognized in the latest report by the Colombian  foreign trade authorities. He also recognized the work done by  Jesus Martinez Beato, the Cuban ambassador in Santa Fe de Bogota.    Moreover, Rodriguez Gonzalez said this direct exchange will  facilitate the strengthening of the Latin American integration  movement. He mentioned the bilateral cooperation possibilities  to which the industrial potential that exists in Santa Clara can  also contribute.    University rector Garcia Cuevas talked about the recognized  level of the institutions of higher learning in Valle del Cauca  Department and predicted the achievement of a higher qualitative  level in the exchanges that have already taken place with El  Valle University and other institutions.    The movement to twin the cities of Cuba and Colombia began  with the twinning of Santiago de Cuba and Cartagena. It will  continue with the one between Cali and Santa Clara, and there  are plans to continue with the twinning of Barranquilla and  Matanzas.    Likewise there is an interest in twinning Cienfuegos and  Medellin, Varadero and Santa Marta, the island of San Andres  with the western Isle of Youth in Cuba.     "

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Ayda Lucero, an activist of  the Venceremos Brigade National Committee, pointed out that U.S  newspapers and radio and television stations normally report the  difficulties the island is going through, yet fail to provide  in-depth reports on issues such as the economic blockade and  Washington's hostility toward Havana.    Lucero, a member of the Brigade's 25th contingent who  arrived  yesterday in Havana from Mexico, described the lack of  objectivity and misleading information on Cuba's status.  According to Lucero, the reports ignore satisfactory conditions  in areas such as health, education, social security, and  employment.    The group, which includes 142 persons, stated that its  objective is to challenge regulations restricting U.S. citizens  from freely traveling to Cuba. In addition, it plans to urge an  end to the economic restrictions affecting Cuba for the past  three decades.    In this respect, Lucero pointed to the growing movement  within the United States favoring normalized relations between  both countries, which, she said, includes the Solidarity with  Cuba National Network organizations. In addition, she also  mentioned some Cuban-Americans who help to let the truth be  known about Cuba.    In her opinion, U.S. citizens and the Cuban community in the  United States are also suffering the consequences of the  blockade. Members of the latter group are prevented from  traveling, seeing their relatives, or having close ties with the  land in which they were born.    That is why, she added, I, as well as the other brigade  members, agree with having The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference, which the Foreign Ministry organized to find  mechanisms of understanding between the government and  expatriate Cubans, take place in Havana.    Ayda Lucero was also in Cuba this past October as part of a  group of U.S. pacifists who support the ""freedom to travel""  project. In a gesture of solidarity, she then decided to spend  her honeymoon in this country despite pressures and penalties  she may encounter, which according to current U.S. legal  provisions could range from fines of up to $250,000 and prison  sentences of up to 10 years.

[Contreras] Approximately how many millimeters?    [Zanabria] Tercer Frente is the municipality where the most  rainfall, over 300 mm, has been recorded in the last few hours.    [Contreras] Excuse me, how much did you say?    [Zanabria] Over 300 mm of rainfall in less than 24 hours.    [Contreras] Over 300 mm of rainfall. This is the rainfall  recorded in many provinces during one entire year.    [Zanabria] For this municipality it is the average amount of  rainfall for one year.    [Contreras] As I said, that would be the amount of rainfall  expected in one year, and it fell within a 24-hour period.    [Zanabria] Exactly, and the same thing happened in Songo-La  Maya where rainfall has been intense. In Santiago de Cuba 116 mm  of rainfall fell in the last few hours.    [Contreras] I imagine that the floodgates of most dams are  open.    [Zanabria] Yes. There are over 3,000 houses damaged, with  over 1,000 of these in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, 80 of  which were totally destroyed. In the municipality of Guama,  unfortunately, there has been a fatality: Juan Gonzalez Jinarte,  who was drunk and drowned while trying to cross a local river  with his mules.    [Contreras] This was the only fatality?    [Zanabria] No, this was the second fatality. The first  fatality occurred in Segundo Frente Municipality.    [Contreras] Given the magnitude of the rainfall, there have  been very few vicitms.    [Zanabria] There were also fires this weekend in the  Hermanos  Diaz refinery and the Retome medical equipment factory. There  have been many landslides, and floods in low-lying areas.    I am preparing a complete report for Doing Radio listeners,  and then I will go out with the mobile unit and visit some of  the places affected, for instance, the Rente Electric Plant  which is off-line from the national electrical system. This is  of great importance. Last night [22 May] there were long power  outages in Santiago de Cuba, and in the midst of this rain, so  you can imagine the situation here.    [Contreras] We await further information. I believe the news  that you have given us up to now is outright poignant. There is  another fatality in Santiago, and we can imagine that last night  must have been very tense, considering everything that is  happening.    [Zanabria] Last night, I spoke with the pilot of the  (Aero-Caribbean) flight that arrived in Santiago de Cuba. I went  to pick up Diosdado Maso and accompany Carmen Oria to the  airport, as she was returning to Havana. The pilot informed me  that he does not know how he managed to land at the Holguin  airport, where the plane made a stopover, because the rainfall  made it almost impossible to see the runway lights.    That is the situation here; and as I said earlier, I am  about  to visit some of the most hard-hit areas to obtain information  for my next report. We will remain in contact the rest of the  day.

A glance back at the three previous summits makes it  possible  for us to see that the Ibero-American nations have focused their  discussions on various subjects usually recommended by the host  country. Guadalajara (Mexico, 1991) marked a very special  occasion because, for the first time, all of the Iberian-origin  countries on the American continent were convened under the  banner of joint support for the unity and integration of our  peoples and to lay the forum's fundamental groundwork on topics  such as plurality, diversity, and the people's right to  peacefully create institutions and the best political system  possible.    Certainly, the idea of this meeting had been conceived  within  the framework of the festivities organized by Spain in 1992 to  commemorate the 500th anniversary of the ""discovery"" of America.  Mexico, however, had the good idea of convening the first such  meeting in the region -- a move that guaranteed continuity and  the fulfillment of unity and integration at a time when NAFTA  caused concern among some people about Mexico's future role in  Latin America.    Madrid (1992), in the already mentioned context of its  festivities, underlined the contribution and implementation of  cultural and educational cooperation projects. It was in  Salvador de Bahia last year, however, where for the first time  the Ibero-American Summit discussed development with a social  emphasis, and it did so at a time when Brazil was proposing in  the United Nations an ""agenda for development.""    On focusing its attention on ""economics, integration, and  commerce"" in June, Cartagena de Indias seeks to give the forum a  new dimension beyond common history, language, and culture. The  meeting seeks to turn the association of peoples into an  economic opportunity for all. In this context, Cuba has always  longed for a united Latin America -- a Latin America of which  Bolivar and Marti had dreamed -- and integration as a function  of the most precious interests of our peoples.    Great are the challenges and efforts found on this difficult  yet vital path. Cuba has pointed these out more than once. To  achieve the desired regional dimension, it is necessary to bring  together all ongoing regional processes. At the same time, we  must defend our joint positions on political, economic, and  social matters of interest, particularly those related to  regional integration and incorporation, from a point of  fairness, of Latin America and the Caribbean into international  relations.    It is also essential to give this process a broader scope  and  greater depth through the gradual integration of the productive  and service sectors, but without playing down the importance of  scientific, technological, health, and educational cooperation  as vital instruments of an irreversible and permanent  integration process. This process, conceived as a means to  improve the welfare of our peoples through the integration of  the social sector and actions that give it a human dimension,  would be the adequate framework for Cuba to put at the service  of regional cooperation its progress and experience in the field  of social development for the solution of collective problems  that, above ideologies, require urgent measures.    Of continual concern for the Cuban delegations attending the  three previous summits have been both the prevailing enthusiasm  for neoliberalism and the enormous optimism in terms of its  results. On each occasion, Cuba has made known that it  respects, but does not share, these viewpoints, because they do  not favor the development of our peoples or stimulate a revision  of dependency as a function of the interests of the current  centers of power. For this reason, the unanimous recognition,  even by the Inter-American meeting, of the extreme poverty and  social imbalance situation experienced by most of the countries  south of the Rio Grande is clear proof of neoliberalism's  failure in the region.    Cuba will attend the Cartagena de Indias summit with these  ideas in mind and with the purpose of contributing to the  strength of this important forum at a time when the hemisphere  summit convened by the United States undermines the permanence  of Ibero-American summits as a mechanism for a concerted effort.    False Agenda    The new U.S. Democratic administration is trying to exploit  the success attained with the approval of NAFTA with the  intention of casting a positive image of its policy throughout  the continent and recovering lost ground. This explains the  lack of definition regarding the topics to be discussed in the  meeting.    By definition, Cuba cannot oppose this convocation, because  there are indeed numerous problems to be discussed regarding  relations between the United States and Latin America. This is  not a bad idea, provided the meeting serves to discuss  undeniable existing disagreements. If we are to be honest,  Latin America and the Caribbean know they cannot have great  expectations for the possible results of the meeting. Past  Washington-convened meetings have proven to result in much ado  about nothing.    The attempts to once again exclude Cuba show a U.S. policy  of  discrimination against our country, and they run against  international trends in which collective wisdom advises against  making contrived exclusions. Such exclusions have not been made  in the meetings under the Ibero-American framework, the Security  and Cooperation Conference in Europe, or the Asian-Pacific  summit.    The Hemispheric Summit should not be used as a tool of  specific U.S. interests but, rather, as a tool of the interests  of all participating countries. For this reason, it would be  good for the summit's date, venue, agenda, and participants to  be decided by mutual agreement and not by a unilateral dictate  from Washington. What merit can Miami claim for hosting a  meeting of the nations of the continent, other than the city's  well-known record of violence; the lack of freedom of expression  imposed by the intransigence and terrorism of the Cuban-American  extreme rightists; and, as a bad joke, the fact that it serves  as the main organizational center for the continent's drug  traffickers?    The people of the region should concentrate their efforts in  promoting an agenda to discuss the true problems of  Inter-American relations to prevent any one country on the  continent from being excluded, to keep alive the Ibero-American  movement, and to keep Washington from once again making our  decisions for us.

0,FT921-15485 ,"FT921-15485 _AN-CAJARAACFT 920110   FT  10 JAN 92 / Russia's new economy chief warns west on aid      By LEYLA BOULTON      MOSCOW   THE Russian government may not survive unless it gets rapid help from the west in pushing through bold market reforms, according to Mr Peter Aven, Russia's new foreign economic relations minister. Mr Aven warned yesterday that unless Russia obtained further debt relief, the west could soon be dealing with a communist regime again, but a much tougher one. He said that even after the deferral of principal payments on medium- and long-term loans finalised with the Paris Club last week, Russia and the republics have to pay Dollars 9bn (Pounds 4.9bn) to creditors this year. None of the other republics have so far honoured a pledge to share responsibility for foreign debt obligations. Mr Aven said Russia wanted a Dollars 4-Dollars 5bn stabilisation fund to make the rouble convertible at a pegged exchange rate this year. It was also seeking balance of payments loans, more direct food aid credits, and a lifting of western trade barriers - for instance to sell uranium on the US market. The 36-year-old economist displayed all the cheering characteristics of Russia's first post-communist government: youth, intelligence, ability, and self-confidence. He said, however, that many westerners were still nostalgic for 'the older friendlier government bureaucrats' who were swept from office with the collapse of the union. Another problem was westerners' lack of knowledge about the severity of Russia's economic crisis, partly because 'we have a great tradition of lying to the west about how great this country is, and about how many tanks and gold we have'. Mr Aven hoped the stabilisation fund advocated by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, architect of Poland's shock therapy and now part of a team of western economists advising the new government, would be forthcoming in March or April. By then the government would have freed the domestic price of oil and stabilised prices. With a western stabilisation fund behind it, the government wanted to introduce a stable exchange rate. Mr Aven said the rate was bound to come down from its current rate of around Rbs100 to the dollar - he hoped to between Rbs15 to Rbs35 to the dollar.  The Financial Times   London Page 2  "

Here are two  acceptable methods for performing this task:     -  using nonconvertible currencies in settling accounts,  bringing them into circulation, and later forming an  international currency system like the Western European one;    -  combining monetary systems into a new type of ruble zone.        I would like to mention that a nonconvertible currency  cannot  play the role of an international means of payment. ""Soft""  national currencies have an unstable currency rate and are not  properly supported with goods, gold, and other assets. As a  rule, they rely on an inflationary economy, one in crisis, and  frequently they move parallel to the U.S. dollar.    Taking into account the experience of 1950s Western Europe,  creating a payments union of the republics of the former USSR is  a step toward the convertibility of national currencies and the  transition from bilateral account settlements to multilateral  ones. Moreover, a payments union could at the same time help  perform another pressing task, conserving means of payment  through the mutual accounts settlement mechanism.    Settlement of accounts on nontrade payments, that is to say,  a smoothrunning mechanism for citizens' money transfers, could  become an inseparable part of an efficient system for mutual  settlement of accounts on nontrade transactions. As yet there is  still no clarity regarding the procedure for setting the  currency exchange rate needed for nontrade settlement of  accounts, the mechanism for linking nontrade circulation with  trade circulation, or agreement between central (national) banks  on norms for citizens and participants in money transfers to  take out and bring in ready money. We must not allow national  income to be pumped from one state to another.    Recently the idea of creating a unified currency in the  context of the possible creation of a Eurasian Union expressed  by the president of Kazakhstan, N. Nazarbayev, has drawn  attention. If we start to create a payments union as an organ to  assist multilateral settlement of accounts, then we will need a  rated supranational monetary unit for it to function.    But the most important question may be the joining of  monetary systems into a new type of ruble zone, taking into  account the centrifugal trend which is becoming stronger. The  creation of a single emissions center will be one of the  mandatory conditions here. In this case the transition period  presupposes coordinating the economic, tax, budget, and monetary  policies of the states which have decided to integrate their  monetary systems into the Russian one.    The position of the Bank of Russia was presented by the  deputy chairman of the RF Bank of Russia, V. Solovov.  It is that either a new ruble zone will be created under  conditions defined by Russia or each national bank will have to  resolve the problems of payments on its own. There is no way to  create normal conditions for carrying out interstate settlement  of accounts other than to ensure a sensible currency and  monetary-credit policy, strengthen the national currency, fight  against nonpayments within the country, and develop currency  markets. Commercial banks are doing the main work on settlement  of accounts between Russia and the former Soviet  republics--those banks handle two-thirds of all payments. In  supporting a large part of the payments, commercial banks can  offer credits to the CIS countries in the form of overdraft or  debit balance on a correspondent account. But because of late  payments, the CIS countries also automatically receive a  commodity credit from Russia (goods are shipped, but payment is  not received). The behavior of Russia's partners is also  notable: after signing documents on combining the monetary  systems of Russia and Belarus and fixing the exchange rate, the  National Bank of Belarus doubled emissions. This will obviously  force Russia to raise the question of revising exchange rate  ratios. The main condition of a ruble zone is the creation of a  single emissions center and abandonment of the republic's right  of emission. That is perfectly natural; a unified currency  certainly requires a single emissions center. Whether the  Central Bank of Russia should be this center is another matter.  Perhaps the Interstate Bank, which will represent the interests  of all participants, should assume this function.    The president of the Interstate Bank, V. Savanin:  The Interstate Bank should ensure fair settlement of accounts  among the states of the former USSR. Balanced foreign trade,  state control over the dynamics of the exchange rate, and  regulation of a positive payments balance are necessary for  mutual recognition of the quotations of national currencies.  Russia's relations with Western partners from the far abroad are  similar to the relations of the countries of the near abroad to  Russia.    To do this, the CIS countries need to take measures on  currency regulation and control which ensure that currency  earnings are returned during trade with Russia, measures similar  to those which Russia takes in relation to trade with the West.  The damage done to a country's economy because of the drain of  capital to Russia or the West undermines the basis for  settlement of accounts among the CIS countries. The situation  with the medium-term balance of payments among the countries of  the near abroad has deteriorated. Moreover, I must mention that  the activity of the Central Bank of the CIS (if such a thing is  created) and of the Interstate Bank must be stable and  independent of the political situation.    Commercial banks help resolve day-to-day problems fairly  well--interstate settlement of accounts among enterprises and  the like, but they simply are unable to resolve more global  questions such as stabilization of currencies and their  quotations and regulation of the payment balance. That is the  task of the Interstate Bank. But there are certain difficulties  in organizing its work: as of today the capital stock has not  been formed and the parties are not properly interested in its  work. Today R5 billion (the amount of the bank's declared  capital stock) is clearly not enough to support continuous  settlement of accounts, and that may lead to the revival of the  practice of offering technical credits.    M. Bronshteyn, the economics consultant at Estonia's  embassy to the Russian Federation: Introducing a national  currency in the summer of 1992 was advantageous for both Russia  and Estonia. For Russia because it had stopped subsidizing the  republic's economy. But for Estonia its own currency allowed it  to establish and maintain a set rate in relation to the German  mark and thereby check escalating inflation. The problem of  settlement of accounts was immediately solved--commercial banks  rather than the Central Bank make all payments. There is no  problem of nonpayments in the republic. The fixed level of the  Estonian kroon is the result of the independence of commercial  banks and the absence of any settlement of accounts through the  republic's Central Bank whatsoever; legislative restriction on  the volumes of emissions; and the exclusive use of the kroon for  payments and personal savings.    The possibility of normal settlement of accounts is based on  this. But there can be a healthy currency only with a healthy  balance. The introduction of world prices for oil and gas was a  shock for Estonia too, and the problem of maintaining the  equilibrium of the balance was extremely complicated. Despite  strong competition on world markets, Estonia has reoriented the  economy to trade with the West.    The deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences  Institute of Europe, S. Karagenov, noted that all countries  must recognize the absurdity of building a superstructure  without a foundation and discussing minor questions before  resolving global problems. If at least Russia decides what it  wants and works out a long-term concept of development of  economic and political cooperation with the countries of the  former USSR, that alone will fundamentally facilitate the  adoption of decisions on particular problems in cooperation with  the CIS countries.    In the opinion of representatives of the Rossiyskiy  kredit Bank, conversion of currencies with the  participation of the national banks of the CIS countries is made  difficult by ambitions regarding local currencies. Enterprises  are obliged to sell ruble earnings at too low a rate and that  causes prices to rise and earnings to be hidden. The lack of  rubles at both national banks and at enterprises complicates the  normal passage of payments to Russia. It is necessary to expand  the group of participants in trade in ""soft"" currency and  liberalize RF legislation in relation to CIS residents in order  to resolve these problems.    The TOKObank advisor, A. Barnovskiy: The Russian  ruble does not necessarily have to be the means for settling  accounts among the CIS countries. A technically unified currency  can be created on the basis of a weighted basket of national  currencies. Today the multiple exchange rates of national  currencies create speculation on cross rates, thereby causing  the reciprocal export of inflation. The task of the Interstate  Bank is clearing balances on unbalanced payments and regulating  the net balance using credits, goods, securities, property, and  so forth.    The advisor of the Center for European Policy Research,  D. Gros, noted that using the experience of the European  Community [EC] to create a system of payments in the states of  the former USSR is problematical.    The point is that the structure of trade within the EC was  very similar--most of them export and import similar goods. In  contrast, the structures of the economies of the countries of  the former USSR are fundamentally different. Some are exporters  of raw materials, others depend on exports of agricultural  goods, and yet others export industrially produced goods.  Consequently, these countries have completely different  interests and are subject to the influence of changes in the  world economy in a different way. For example, higher prices for  oil on the world market are good for some countries but require  strict regulation for others. But in the EC all countries react  the same way.    The second condition for successful integration into the EC  was complete consensus on questions of economic policy. The tax  systems of the EC member countries are similar, and stable  prices and a stable national currency are a goal of  monetary-credit policy common to all. The tax policy ensures a  limited budget deficit in such a way that the government can  service its debt without escalating inflation. There is no such  accord among the countries of the former USSR now. Different  countries are at different stages of reform; not one of them has  stabilized its currency and there is not even accord on the  question of the desirability of stabilizing it.    Until recently the CIS countries were part of one strongly  integrated economy, and commodity exchange among the USSR  republics was more intensive than among the EC countries. But a  large part of the trade ties created in the past cannot be  maintained for a long time. In the long run, all the CIS  countries will trade more with other countries, especially with  the EC countries, than with one another. For example, Russia's  turnover with other former USSR republics now is roughly only  one-third of the trade with the rest of the world.    The following conclusion can be drawn from what has been  said: the countries of the former USSR do not now form an  ""optimal currency space."" That is to say, from the purely  economic standpoint, it would be unprofitable to create a common  currency space with a common central bank. So the probability of  the successful survival of the ""new type of ruble zone"" is  small. Nonetheless, there is potential to stop the breakdown of  mutual trade. To do this, all quotas, licenses, and tariffs on  trade within the CIS must be abolished. The new national  currencies must be stabilized and made convertible. Only then is  the normalization of mutual payments possible.    The opinions expressed by the conference participants did  not  always match or did not completely match. But the question of  the possibility of creating a common economic space and  reintegration and accordingly the need to create special forms  of unification of the CIS countries in order to handle  international settlement of accounts, especially in the form of  a ""new ruble space,"" was the main disagreement between the  representatives of the Center for European Policy Research and  the Russian participants.    The question of creating a system of mutual settlement of  accounts can be reduced not to the technical problem of  organization, stabilization, and so forth, but to a political  one: are the participating states (of the Interstate Bank or the  ruble zone, for example) really ready to give up some of their  interests and rights for the sake of creating an overall  efficient system? For an ""overall efficient"" system will have  some partial inconveniences for each participant. And now when  young states which have just been formed are worried about  preserving their ""sovereignty"" and ""independence,"" can they  abandon certain of their national ambitions? The answer is not  an unequivocal one.    Another aspect is that the states which have been formed  have  different structures of economies, at times very irrational  ones, and are at different levels of development and accordingly  have different economic interests. So combining monetary systems  may seem altogether economically unprofitable for some countries.    But if for subjective (political) or objective reasons,  certain CIS countries lack incentive, then naturally there will  be neither energetic work nor results.    In addition to that, there are altogether real  contradictions  among the subjects of the market within the country as well. For  example, in most CIS countries there are contradictions between  the state's goals (raising the exchange rate of its currency in  relation to the ruble, supporting the national economy through  its inflationary financing, and regulating currency in order to  prevent the drain of capital) and the needs of enterprises  (normal organization of interstate payments and the opportunity  to freely buy and sell rubles and other currency at other than  the real rate) as well as the needs of commercial banks which  want to be able to work on the currency market unhindered.    The following conclusion may be drawn from everything which  was said above: first of all, it must be clarified whether those  countries for which integration is intended are interested in  integration. Otherwise, even the optimal system worked out is in  danger of not being realized in practice. Even with great  incentive, the sides face a long path of realization in stages,  one which has taken the countries of the European Community, for  example, 50 years.     "

0,FT923-15137 ,"FT923-15137 _AN-CGCA3AD4FT 920703   FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (9): Prepared to consider alternative approaches - Russia The important thing is that after months of agonising over how to start privatisation, Russia has at last begun the process which all reformers in the former Soviet Union agree is essential to moving towards a market economy      By LEYLA BOULTON      MOSCOW   Before it was privatised, the windows of Moscow's Gastronom number 44 were decorated with empty cartons for milk which it rarely sold. Now that it has been privatised and renamed Ukraine Trading Firm, the cartons remain and there is still no milk for sale on a regular basis. This is the meagre result of a mass privatisation of the capital's shops by virtually handing them over to their workers for a nominal price by Mr Gavril Popov, the capital's former mayor. His aim, he said was 'smashing state property at any cost' to reverse 75 years of socialism. Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's privatisation minister, argues that such transfers of assets to workers for an extremely low book value are 'socially unfair, economically ineffective and politically dangerous'. However, he also admits that the task of taking out of state hands an economy which is 97 per cent state owned is 'so great that one should not forbid or exclude alternative approaches'. Mr Chubais's biggest worry about his approach is that there wil be insufficient demand for enterprises that will be offered for sale. The important thing is that after months of agonising over how to start privatisation, Russia has at last begun the process which all reformers in the former Soviet Union agree is essential to moving towards a market economy. The next headache is how to progress from small privatisation to the privatisation of big enterprises, most of which badly need painful and costly restructuring, and many of which are so obsolescent or so polluting that they need closing. While some republics have gone further in some directions - Armenia, for example, has privatised most of its farming land - others, such as Belarus and the central Asian republics have not even begun taking the economy out of state control. For the small-scale privatisation which Russia is trying to achieve this year, Mr Chubais favours auctions to dispose of shops, restaurants and small enterprises in those parts of he country over which he has some control. The extent of his authority falls far short of the formal borders of the Russian federation which stretches from St Petersburg to Vladivostok and everything in between. Moscow, for example, has special permission to use its own approach with the city boundaries. The autonomous republics within Russia, such as Tataria, simply do not obey the government, while everywhere else the rules are frequently broken by acts of so-called nomenklatura privatisation. This is the process wherebye state-owned assets are transferred, usually at nominal prices, to private companies owned by friends or family of the managers involved, defrauding both the state treasury and ordinary citizens. Earlier this year the untypically enlightened local authorities of Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, teamed up with the World Bank to conduct a model auction of shops, which was a big success. Using this politically useful but rare example Mr Chubais, in his welcoming speech, underlined that collective or state owned enterprises need the shock of competition, and the experience of having to pay real money for their acquisitions, in order to change their behaviour. Although Moscow provides impressive statistics for the creation of property owners, there is little incentive for a change in habits. There is no danger of going bankrupt because there is no law on bankruptcy, there is little competition, and for the time being shops are simply passing increased costs on to the beleaguered consumer. 'There is a big political danger that Muscovites will read the newspapers, and hear that trade has been privatised but then when they go to the shops, they'll see nothing there,' Mr Chubais warns. Mr Chubais believes his method is the least prone to corruption, while Mr Popov, a man of older years, says corruption is inevitable, and indeed desirable. That there should be few practical benefits from the privatisation conducted so far in Moscow is also a sign of how much more needs to be done in the rest of the economy. There is no wholesale system to speak of - just an inefficient state-controlled distribution system and virtually no competition. While Gastronom 4 bought pineapples from a local hard currency store and sold them for a big rouble mark up, it rarely has basic items such as milk (other than extremely expensive long-life milk from Italy). This is a consequence of the poor supply, storage and transport facilities which blight all aspects of the economy. The need to think of the entire food chain as one long, series of unbroken links stretching from the field or dairy, through to the wholesaler or processor and on to the eventual consumer is the principal lesson which the British Food Consortium, consisting of the UK's biggest food and distribution companies, has been emphasising. It sees it as part of the uphill struggle to improve and privatise food supply in Russia and Ukraine. For the privatisation of large enterprises, which is due to start next year, Mr Chubais believes that the Czechoslovak system of distributing vouchers to the population is the most promising route for Russia to follow. Just back from a trip to Prague, he noted that 420 investment funds set up to manage shares had appeared spontaneously. The Russian government plans to launch its own voucher distribution scheme this autumn - after sorting out practical details such as whether they should be given out for free or paid for, and who would receive them. The situation in Russia is complicated by the fact that it was born out of the Soviet Union's collapse. In the absence of Russian citizenship laws, the government had to find an effective criteria for supplying vouchers to Russians only. Not all the inhabitants of Russia are Russians, while a lot of Russians live outside Russia. For this reason the government will be declaring a deadline for Russians to return to Russia in order to receive vouchers, while everybody who is permanently resident in Russia will receive vouchers even if they are not Russian. The government is also in the process of sorting out what to do about foreigners. Having dropped plans for a special exchange rate for foreigners (to prevent Russians from being squeezed out of the race by an extremely weak rouble), the government is casting around for an alternative system of giving its own nationals equal opportunities. The suggestions it has come up with so far - setting aside special enterprises for foreign investors or multiplying the price of assets bought by foreigners by special coefficients - are all difficult to operate in practice. Mr Chubais claims to prefer avoiding any special practices for foreigners on the grounds 'that the more foreign investment there is the better'. In the absence of a bankruptcy law on which is a prerequisite for closing down inefficient enterprises and a threat for those which fail to restructure, privatisation of large enterprises is likely to remain a limited for some time to come. The government has ordered them to turn themselves into joint stock companies in preparation for possible privatisation starting next year, or earlier if they are ready. Attempts to attract foreign investment to big enterprises show this is likely to continue to be negotiated on a case-by-case basis. But foreigners are reluctant to buy into enterprises which are heavily overmanned and over which they are unlikely to have control. What is more likely is that there will be a prolongation of the present system where joint ventures are limited to those assets which foreign investors are interested in. These are then hived off from the rest of the enterprise in order to insulate them from the inefficiency of the complex as a whole.  The Financial Times   London Page V  "

In Washington yesterday Mr Larry Summers, Treasury undersecretary-designate for international affairs, told Congress that rebuilding the Russian economy was a task comparable to the post-war Marshall Plan. He said the G7 nations would have 'significant support' available to Russia 'in the coming months,' but he disclosed no details. He argued that past estimates of the Russian economy were largely inaccurate because they had focused on the volume of output rather than marketable value. The focus now, he said, should be on facilitating the sale of marketable Russian goods at home and overseas. President Bill Clinton, it was announced, would confer next week with Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, before his meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 3-4. Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, is also to give what has been billed as a 'major' speech on the need for assistance in Chicago next Monday. It will be designed in part to meet resistance in Congress to any substantial increase in bilateral US aid. The administration itself is understood to have under review a series of measures designed to provide immediate relief to the average Russian and to demonstrate the extent of US support for Mr Yeltsin. According to a senior officials quoted in yesterday's Los Angeles Times, options include emergency shipments of pharmaceutical supplies for Russian hospitals, more grain and meat shipments, new housing for the Russian military and proposals to assist the conversion to civilian purposes of military factories. Meanwhile the Japanese government is proposing a special meeting of G7 finance and foreign ministers in Tokyo on April 18 to consider a multilateral Russian aid package. Bowing to western pressure not to delay such a consideration until the economic summit in the Japanese capital in early July, Mr Hisashi Owada, the vice foreign minister, is in Washington conveying the latest Japanese thinking before flying on to Paris. The April session would take place immediately after the US visit of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister. Japanese officials still favour a variety of short term assistance measures, including food and construction aid, rather than a more ambitious package under G7 auspices, partly on the grounds that much of last year's Dollars 24bn package has yet to be disbursed. Russian economics minister Mr Andrei Nechayev left for Germany yesterday to discuss further aid to Moscow, particularly supplies of baby food, milk and other foodstuffs, Itar-Tass news agency said. Tass said Mr Nechayev would discuss an extension of credits and the purchase of industrial goods on favourable terms. He was expected to hold talks with his counterpart Mr Gunter Rexrodt.

The businessmen commented: ""Judging from the  development of the negotiations, it is quite likely we will  establish a joint venture [preceding word in English] in the  next two or three months.""    Andriani is general director of Inepar Trading, a Parana  State company trying to enter the Cuban market with Audiolab  Electronic Systems, from Belo Horizonte, of which Fares is  president. The idea is to refurbish thermoelectric plants and,  eventually, participate in the nuclear project.    ""The Cubans accept any deal,"" said the Brazilian businessmen  after observing the speed with which the representatives of the  socialist public enterprises close deals with foreign  capitalists.    In Brazil's case, some previous agreements at the government  level have expedited the negotiations. Brazilian Ambassador  Jose Nogueira Filho, who has been in Cuba for about one year,  commented: ""In the transportation field, for example, the Cubana  de Aviacion airline already has one flight a week between Havana  and Sao Paulo, and soon we will have a Brazilian airline  covering this route.""    Moreover, a Cypriot shipping company has a regular service  between the Cuban ports and Belem, in Para State, where it  unloads cement and loads timber. The trade balance currently  tilts in Cuba's favor. Last year Cuba exported goods worth $21  million and imported goods worth $9 million. The volume this  year will be even larger.    Prospects are also good in the tourism field, where the  Cuban  Government has focused its investments. The first deals already  have been made, and Spaniards are Cuba's main partners in this  field. In 1993 the hotel business made $600 million. This  year, with an income of more than $1 billion, the hotel business  should surpass sugar production. Canadians and Venezuelans also  are interested in this sector.    Foreign capitalists have even greater interest. Chilean and  Israeli businessmen have engaged in fruit production while the  French, Canadians, and Swedish are interested in oil  prospecting. A South American diplomat tells business people  inquiring about the prospects in Cuba: ""The only risk of  investing in Cuba is that the United States might lift the  embargo because, if so, then they will crush the competitors.""

Officials of the oil  extraction enterprise of Central Cuba said that of a potential  21 million cubic meters of natural gas, just over 15.5 million  cubic meters were used, ""which shows that the demand for this  fuel is still low. Despite failure to fulfill the investment  programs, difficulties with the system for moving crude oil  along the coast by ship, and scarce resources, this enterprise  -- which produced the greatest amount of oil in Cuba -- showed  an increase in drilling last year, with 15,500 meters. There are  currently 180 wells in the largest oil deposit yet discovered in  Cuba. Exploration continues in that zone with a view to  increasing its potential and extracting higher- quality oil.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 4 January reports that Cuban  oil workers hope to extract 1.2 million tons of crude in 1994.  There are also plans to increase seismic research in 1994 with a  view to improving exploration; Cuba hopes to have a much  stronger investments program and to begin drilling all over the  country. ""Four new sites, located in the traditional petroleum  areas, also will be opened.""    In the same newscast, Progreso's Sanciti Spiritus  correspondent reports that the industrial gases factory in  Sancti Spiritus has begun making chalk for use in Cuba's  schools. The plant engineer notes that most of the chalk in Cuba  used to be imported from China and that the chalk being produced  in Cuba now is ""almost of better quality than the Chinese chalk.""    Radio Rebelde Network at 1255 GMT on 4 January reports that  Granma Province sugar sector workers have fulfilled the  cold-season cane planting plan. They planted almost 437  caballerias; and 10 of the 11 sugar industry complexes met their  commitments. Also, ""Havana farmers made a big effort in December  to catch up as regards the cold-season planting, and they began  1994 with close to 1,500 caballerias planted in tubers and  vegetables, which will guarantee the program for February.""    Radio Rebelde Network at 1800 GMT on 4 January reports that  the ""La Victoria de Giron"" citrus-producing complex, the largest  in the nation, managed to stop the decline in its plantations by  the end of 1993 by establishing cooperation in production that  facilitated credits for buying fuel and agricultural inputs.  This allowed the recovery of approximately 20,000 hectares,  which constitute over 50 percent of the complex's lands. In 1993  the complex produced over 7 million quintals of citrus fruits.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that 359 high-voltage  transformers were recovered in Ciego de Avila Province in 1993.  ""The work team that specializes in the recovery of that kind of  equipment is currently working on rewinding and adapting a group  of 160-kilovolt Italian transformers that will be set up at  sugar-production complexes in Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  for the current harvest.""    In the same cast, Rebelde also reports that a new type of  materials-efficient floor tile, sometimes called ""the  streamlined tile"", has been developed by the Construction  Materials Enterprise of Sancti Spiritus. Production of this tile  allows for practically doubling the amount of surface that can  be tiled using the same amount of raw materials. The tile is  made with scrap residue from the sugar mills in place of silica  and powdered stone. Because of its light weight, this tile also  is easier to transport and to lay.     "

Right now, Cuba  has such an installation under construction and it is fostering  an extensive program for sustained progress in the nuclear field  on the basis of the promotion of general progress in the nuclear  field in area countries.    Under the administration of the Executive Secretariat for  Nuclear Affairs [SEAN], Cuba's nuclear program and the  implementation of this technology for peaceful purposes, include  quite a few achievements in various economic and industrial  fields.    Cuba makes these achievements available to other countries  of the continent through ARCAL [Regional Cooperation  Arrangements for the Development of Nuclear Science and  Technology], a program sponsored by the Atomic Energy  Organization, to contribute to the peaceful utilization of  nuclear energy in the region. Cuba has participated in 12  projects since it joined ARCAL in 1987.    Let us listen to Daniel Codorniu, deputy coordinator of  Cuba's SEAN:    [Begin Codorniu recording] To give you an example of the  projects being developed, I will tell you that there is one that  has to do with the utilization of nuclear technology for animal  feeding and reproduction. This has to do with everything  related to immunoanalyses for the development of livestock.  This project is now in its fourth year. Last year, Cuba, in the  framework of this project, conducted seminars on the diagnosis  of brucellosis using nuclear and related technology. Four Latin  Americans, not counting Cubans, participated in this seminar.    Another project being developed is one on the development of  nuclear techniques to study environmental contamination.  Lately, this project has also received a lot of support in view  of recent global awareness of the need for protection of the  environment. From the analytical and chemical points of view,  nuclear methods are very precise and very effective.    Last year, within the framework of this project, we held a  seminar in Cuba on the subject of the utilization of nuclear  techniques on the environment. Three Latin American scholars  participated in this seminar and benefitted from it. [end  recording]    One of the most important projects of the ARCAL program in  Latin America involves the industrial utilization of radioactive  isotopes as tracers to further improve the quality of industrial  processes.    As in previous cases, Cuban experts and technicians are  obtaining precious experience in the implementation of these  techniques and plan to pass it on to other regional countries  through meetings, scholarship, and specialization courses in the  future.    [Begin Codorniu recording] This year, 1994, we plan three  important regional projects within the framework of ARCAL. One  project involves a regional seminar on nuclear progress and  instrumentation.    One objective of this seminar is to share with other Latin  American countries experiences -- especially Cuban experiences,  although those of other regional countries will also be  presented -- regarding progress in developing equipment for  nuclear programs.    That seminar will be followed, right here, by a final  meeting  on nuclear instrumentation. This is a five-year project that  has concluded. The coordinators of this project will come from  all countries involved in it. The participating countries will  take advantage of the seminar to analyze the results of the  project. One of the most positive aspects of this project, in  our opinion, is that it has enabled the acquisition of spare  parts by Latin American countries.    We are going to have another regional seminar from 28  November to 11 December. This seminar will be an advanced  course on the synthesis of modern radiopharmaceutical products.  As you know, one of the main objectives of our current program  -- and this is also an objective of other Latin American  countries, each focussing on its own development and national  policies -- is to produce in our country the radioactive  substances necessary for the program. Radiopharmaceuticals, as  you all know, are the substances used by doctors who practice  what we call nuclear medicine to make medical diganosis.    By 1995, the work of the Cuban nuclear program will be  directed toward research to complement research already being  done in agriculture. One aspect of this research, which has a  broad participation from all the research centers in the  country, has to do with the combined used of nuclear and  hydrotechnology for improved agricultural production of items  important to Cuba, such as rice, sugarcane, and beans.    We firmly back this program. We are calling for very active  participation by our center in this program, which is being  planned on the basis of coordinated research, that is, on the  basis of the idea that various research centers in various  countries of the region tackle one single problem from various  angles. For example, the problem of how to produce more and  better rice, suitable for the various regions of Latin America.  Various research centers of the region would then have specific  tasks in that program and their information would be shared, so  that regional resources may be utilized in a more rational way,  realizing, for example, that my laboratory may have some  techniques that Mexico does not have and Mexico may have things  that I do not have. This way we could complement each other.    Another very interesting program we believe Cuba could  participate in is the improvement of vegetables and the handling  of soil and water resources using nuclear techniques.    This program is very much linked to agriculture. It is like  guaranteeing the best and most inexpensive -- speaking from the  point of view of the cost of fertilizers, irrigation, and so  forth -- growing of certain crops. Our country also has  experience in the use of radioactive istopes, such as stable  isotopes like nitrogen 15, to determine the amount necessary and  the adequate moment for using a fertilizer or to determine,  using nuclear techniques, when an irrigation effort has not been  effective.    This program has an objective. It has been designed in a way  similar to that of Peru's, that is, through coordinated research  among countries. This particular program relies, basically, on  four countries. This does not mean that they will be the only  ones that participate because other countries will participate  also, but basically, Cuba, Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela, will be  the four countries on which the program will rely. [end  recording]    Cuba's efforts through ARCAL in favor of Latin America and  the rest of the developing countries to secure the latest  information on nuclear science and technology enhance the  prestige of the island. Cuba's nuclear achievements have been  praised by well-known international experts.    Cuba's nuclear program continues developing in the midst of  shortages and limitations the country is enduring and it is  expanding its ratio of action to include research that may offer  new alternatives for national progress.

He emphasized the agreements achieved and the  prospect for greater cooperation.    Londono has considered as most important the opportunity he  had for more than a week to study closely the health system,  which has made Cuba one of the most advanced countries in that  field in Latin America.    He said he signed an agreement with the Genetic Engineering  and Biotechnology Center to supply 2.5 million doses of  hepatitis B vaccine during the first quarter of 1994. The  vaccine was used here last year in a program that covered the  regions and sectors most threatened by this disease. Progress  was also made in the negotiations to buy 200,000 doses of  meningitis vaccine. The disease can be fatal, and Cuba is the  only country to have developed an effective vaccine against it.  Lodono has said it was agreed that a technical mission would  visit Colombia during the first week of February to help design  a broader immunization program for the next five years.    He also explored the possibility of Cuban cooperation to  strengthen Colombia's epidemiologic surveillance network through  the development of a data system and the addition of more  control laboratories, as well as increasing its capability.

The removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from the post of the  Belarussian parliament chairman was an unpleasant surprise for  Moscow and quite unexpected by Russian diplomats, according to  ITOGI host Yevgeniy Kiselev. He said the removal of Shushkevich  ""means nothing good for Russian-Belarussian relations"".    ""Yeltsin has lost reliable ally who unconditionally took his  side last October,"" Kiselev said. ""The Belarussian leader was  one of the few commonwealth leaders on whose loyalty Yeltsin  could always count. Shushkevich's reputation was very high also  on the international arena where he was viewed as a reformer and  a staunch advocate of the market economy.    A report from Minsk about the events preceding Shushkevich's  resignation and reaction to the fact in Russia and other  countries cited different views on what happened in Belarus.  Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich disagreed with the  allegation that the toppling of Shushkevich was tantamount to a  ""communist coup"". ""It was nothing of the kind. All the forces  in the pariament remained there and the policy pursued by the  parliament will continue to be pursued, Kebich said.    Itogi paid much attention to the unification of the monetary  systems of Russia and Belarus and the creation of a single  rouble zone of these two countries. According to a survey  conducted by the public opinion fund, 32 per cent of Russian  citizens last week believed that Russia should unify its  monetary system with that of Belarus, even if the Russian  economy suffers from the move. Fifty per cent of those polled  were opposed to the move, and 18 per cent had not yet made up  their minds.    As concerns changes in the Russian Government, most Russian  voters were ""sceptical in their attitude"", according to Yevgeniy  Kiselev. He proceeded from the results of another poll  conducted by the public opinion fund which revealed that 27 per  cent of those polled believed the reshuffle would affect  negatively the lives of the Russian people. Only 17 per cent  believed that the resignations and reshuffles in the government  would yield a positive result. Thirty per cent of those polled  said the government changes would not affect the life of the  population in any way. Twenty-six per cent were uncertain.    ""The results of the past two years enable us to say that  many  tasks in reforming our economy and switching to a market economy  have failed to be accomplished,"" economist Stanislav Shatalin  said in an interview with the Ostankino television Sunday  programme Voskresenye. ""An analysis of the past two years shows  that we must re-define guidelines for our social and economic  policy,"" Shatalin said.    ""While the past week was critical and most unpleasant in the  political career of one of the initiators of the commonwealth,  Stanislav Shushkevich who resigned under the insupportable  burden of the problems -- political and economic -- which arose  in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  coming week threatens much unexpected in connection with the  same problems to another consignee of the first commonwealth  agreement, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk"", Kiselev said.  Much will depend on the outcome of the second round of the  presidential elections in the Crimea, he said. A report from  Simferopol made it clear that the pro-Russia Yuriy Meshkov was  running well ahead of his rival in the first presidential  elections in the peninsula republic contested by Ukraine and  Russia.    Itogi recalled that a criminal cases was opened last week  against parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who heads the  parliamentary faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia.  Zhirinovskiy is charged with war propaganda under Article 71 of  the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.    First Deputy Chief of the Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service Lieutenant-General Sergey Stepashin spoke in an  interview with Itogi about the aims and tasks of this  organisation established on the basis of the former Security  Ministry. He said that although the number of the personnel has  been cut almost by half, the number of operational,  counter-intellligence units remained the same. Asked if the  names of KGB informers would be made public, Stepashin said, ""We  will do everything to prevent it"". He explained that all  similar services across the world maintained ""undercover  personnels"", ""regardless of whether the state is democratic,  anti- democratic, communist or any other"". Moreover he said it  was wrong not to keep the promise of confidence given to former  KGB informers, because ""it was destroy their lives"". The  general expressed anxiety about the considerable leaks of  nuclear, military and other technologies, as well as about  attempts at recruiting Russian researchers and specialists by  foreign special services.    Itogi reported on the latest developments in the Vil  Mirzayanov's affair -- this Russian chemist is now in custody on  charges of revealing state secrets relating to the production of  new chemical weapons in Russia. The programme reported that  Mirzayanov's colleague Vladimir Uglev announced his intention to  make public on February 4 the formula of the secret chemical  substance unless Vil Mirzayanov was released by that time.

Alfonso on  migration policy, entitled: ""Open or Closed Doors."" Following  are some of its most important aspects.    Stating that migration laws are customary, and more than  that, necessary in any contemporary state, she notes that these  laws vary according to political, economic, social, military,  and other interests, and that Cuba is no exception to these  general conditions.    Carmen Alfonso states in her analysis that our case cannot  be  ignored when analyzing the migration issue and its complexity  within the Cuban-U.S. conflict, taking into account that a large  number of Cubans have traditionally migrated to the United  States because of its geographic proximity and economic  development.    In addition to those who travel to other nations for work or  for other official reasons, there are also those who travel for  personal reasons. Among them, we can mention three categories:  those who wish to leave and return; those who definitely want to  reside in another country; and those who request residence  authorization abroad.    At present, temporary leave is authorized for those over 20  years of age, although men up to the age of 26 or 27 years old  who wish to reside abroad must first fulfill their military  obligation. Minors under 18 must be authorized by one of their  parents. It is appropriate to mention that last year, Cuba  authorized temporary leave for 100,000 people, but only 40,000  managed to leave the country because the others had their  requests denied, usually by the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.    There are also conditions for Cubans who already left the  country. Those who left before 1959 must use the consulate of  the country in which they are residing, and those who left after  1959 also have the chance to return to their native country  through various programs devised for that purpose.    However, U.S. Immigration policy toward Cuba has an  essentially political nature, which justifies the exceptionally  privileged treatment of Cuban immigrants, especially those who  violate the laws that are in effect in our country.    Nevertheless, an agreement signed in 1984 provides for the  annual granting of up to 20,000 visas for those who wish to live  in the United States. But the failure of the U.S. to fulfill  this agreement has been notorious. Paradoxically, the  TRABAJADORES article notes, risky, illegal departure is  facilitated without exception or restriction of the number of  immigrants.     "

If estimates prepared less than two years ago are fulfilled,  Cuba will receive approximately 800,000 tourists in the next 12  months. The figure represents a precursor to the great goal for  1995 -- to welcome 1 million vacationers and surpass the  $1-billion mark in gross revenues.    Unofficial estimates indicate that Cuba last year provided  accommodations for approximately 600,000 foreign visitors and  reached approximately $700 million in gross revenues, which  represented an increase of between 26 and 28 percent compared  with the previous year.    Cuba welcomed 340,000 summer visitors early in the 1990's.  The number rose to 424,000 in 1991 and it surpassed the  488,000-mark in 1992, according to statements made by Rafael Sed  Perez, president of the National Institute of Tourism (Intur).    The tourism industry was mentioned barely three days ago by  Cuban President Fidel Castro as one of the activities that would  indicate -- with its results in 1994 -- the country's economic  situation was showing signs of improvement.    The boom in this sector coincided, perhaps paradoxically,  with the loss of the island's import capability, which was  reduced from $8.139 billion in 1991 to $1.179 billion last year,  when the sugar harvest -- approximately 4.28 million tons --  suffered an estimated loss of $450 million.    The Cuban authorities' confidence in a more efficient  tourism  industry is based, among other thingss, on foreign investors'  increasing interest to establish their presence in that sector.    Nearly 10 European and American hotel chains have contracts  for the management and marketing of hotel facilities, basically  in the beach resort of Varadero, eastern Santiago de Cuba  Province; Cayo Coco (in the country's central area); and in the  capital.    These chains include Spain's Sol-Melia, Guitart Hotels,  Kawama Caribbean Hotels, Iberostar, Raytur Caribe, and RIU;  Germany's LTI; Jamaica's Superclubs; and Canada's Delta.    The latter officially inaugurated on Sunday the picturesque  Delta-Sierra Mar Hotel, built on a ridge of the most important  mountain range on the island, the Sierra Maestra, on the  Caribbean sea.    The Cuban tourism sector's lodging capabilities for the  remainder of 1994 should be approximately 25,000 rooms (it  currently exploits about 20,000), a figure that barely  represents 12 percent of the archipelago's potential -- an  estimated 200,000 rooms.    The Seagull, Inc. tourism group alone plans to open two  hotels early this year: The Coral, in Varadero, and the Rio de  Mares, in northeastern Holguin Province.    Other elements that favor the development of this industry  are an increase in the number of foreign airlines (29) which  land at nine tourism centers in over 90 weekly flights, as well  as the momentum gathered by the so-called cruise tourism in 1993.    Referring to the latter, there are great expectations  concerning the advantages of opening a maritime navigation line  between Havana and Jamaican and Mexican ports. This would, in  turn, favor the development of multiple destination operations.    The cruise ship ""Santiago de Cuba"" is operated by the  Havanatur, Inc., Acemex [not further identified], and Fratelli  Consulich firms; and its launching, last December, had a great  impact at the international level because it features a casino  that only begins to operate when the ship is more than 12  nautical miles from the Cuban coast.

Upon  returning from Cuba, Arce voiced his concern that while the  government celebrates the fourth anniversary of its electoral  victory, it has not yet appointed an ambassador to Cuba.    There are thousands of Nicaraguan students in Cuba, health  cooperation agreements are maintained, and many people travel to  that country to receive medical treatment for exceptional health  problems.    He stressed that Cuba renegotiated its debt with Nicaragua,  reducing it to almost symbolic levels, and that those  obligations have not even been honored by the Nicaraguan  Government.

On the one hand -- after last week's meeting of the  Commonwealth of Independent States -- we see the beginnings of a  ""defensive union"" which edges Russia still further from the  Partnership For Peace that NATO half-heartedly offered. There  is, here, the beginning of a countervailing alliance which, if  the documents as duly signed have reality, will one day put  Russian troops on the borders of Iran, Turkey and Poland.  Meanwhile (the other hand) we're poised tomorrow for final  International Monetary Fund approval of a $1.5 billion loan deal  with Russia -- the breaking of the long log-jam to reform. This  loan -- tiny though it is -- could pave the way for the next  ($4.1 billion) tranche of the $28 billion announced long ago by  the Group of Seven -- but never authorised.    The Russian economy is still in an apocalyptic condition.  The monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in  January to 9 per cent in March as a result of the new-found  stringency of the central bank, but industrial output fell 24  per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1994 after a 21 per  cent contraction in 1992.    These figures may exaggerate the scale of decline. Some of  the lost output may have been worthless and the output of the  fledgling private sector may have been underestimated; but,  after all the excuses, it still leaves a huge hole at the centre  of the economy. The stoicism of the Russian people may be  legendary, but it is not inexhaustible. Economic erosion of  this order can't go on for much longer without extremely serious  social consequences.    Such statistics paint a bleak backdrop to this week's annual  meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  [EBRD] in St Petersburg. The EBRD, set up to help reconstruct  East Europe, has been busily reconstructing itself after the  financial excesses of Jacques Attali. Yet, even now, it has yet  to make a serious impact on the spiralling problems of Russia,  let alone the rest of East Europe.    That is a job which, ultimately, can only be done by Russia.  But the daunting task of economic stabilisation and market  reform can, and must, be assisted by the world's richer nations.  It is no use telling Russia that they will get Western billions  after they have reformed -- for the simple reason they need help  in order to put their house in order. A currency stabilisation  plan of the kind that gave Poland a kick-start could have  short-circuited the vicious devaluation-led spiral of inflation  which is still a constant threat to the economy. It remains to  be seen whether the new Russian parliament approves the austere  budget proposals. If it doesn't, it will clearly make it more  difficult for the IMF to speed up the aid programme. That said,  the Russian government which ditched the Gaydar reformists has  gone much further than anyone could have hoped at the time in  accepting the economic strait-jacket which the IMF, sadly,  expects supplicants to wear. If this opportunity is missed, the  consequences for Russia could be very serious indeed -- which is  precisely where the revival of some of the old Soviet military  reach enters the equation. There are some who already see  historic folly in the West's bolstering of a potential enemy.  And the first flexing of those arthritic muscles -- against the  poisonous background of a rampant Zhirinovskiy -- will  exacerbate such fears. Mixed signals, and motives. But there is  still a central equation. A Russia recovering economically will  be a Russia more at ease with itself and more bound into a world  whose Partnership For Peace needs to go further. The tracks  don't yet diverge.     "
0,FT932-8836 ,"FT932-8836 _AN-DEQB4ACNFT 930517   FT  17 MAY 93 / Personal View: The brave way to banish inflation      By HEINER FLASSBECK   Prices in Russia are currently rising at an annual rate of more than 1,000 per cent. Such hyperinflation is destroying the monetary system, which has just begun to operate on market principles. Indeed, it also dashes hopes of reaping all the other benefits of the market economy. No one is willing to invest, domestic trade has degenerated to mere barter, and the country finds itself unable to exploit the advantages of international specialisation. Time horizons have shrunk to days if not hours. All are agreed that the hyperinflation must be stopped - but 'at all costs', in the words of Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund? Is there only one way to bring inflation under control, and must it be pursued even if it runs counter to the goal of establishing a functioning market economy? Money must be scarce, say the economics textbooks; the IMF's recommendation is for a 'strong, restrictive, market-oriented monetary policy'. But what does the scarcity of money mean, when the aim is not to finance the creation of an effective, western-style market economy, but rather to curb a hyperinflation which has become entrenched in both the actions and expectations of the entire population. Two hundred years of monetary macroeconomics have taught us that the success of restrictive monetary policies, and the price which must be paid for that success, depend on the flexibility of prices. This flexibility is, in turn, heavily contingent on wage flexibility: if wages react quickly to a rise in unemployment, the price which must be paid for a restrictive monetary policy is low, and vice versa. The reality of western market economies is that prices are highly inflexible. Contemporary experience shows that even in the country which has been shown to have the most flexible wages in the world, West Germany, it has taken three years to push the inflation rate down from 4 per cent to 2 per cent; and even this has been at the cost of a deep recession and a sharp rise in unemployment. How long will it take to free Russia from inflation in excess of 1,000 per cent, and what will be the cost? During the entire transition period the scarcity of money will prevent the market economy from performing its most important function - to induce investment and entrepreneurial activity. Even in western countries investment declines in such phases. It is both absurd and irresponsible for the west to recommend a cure for the struggling east European countries which would certainly be the death of far healthier patients. The great majority of western economists seem unable or unwilling to understand that restrictive monetary policy can only ever be the exception to the rule of a relatively expansionary monetary policy coupled with moderate wage growth. Even in the west, a scarce-money policy can never be the leitmotif of economic policy in the longer term, without threatening the market economy itself. Those western countries which have enjoyed greatest success have been able to maintain expansionary monetary policies and low interest rates over long periods because trade unions have refrained from making income distribution a matter for day-to-day bargaining. In Russia, restrictive monetary policies would merely serve to complete the destruction begun by runaway inflation. There is only one way to banish hyperinflation without doing irreversible damage: Russia must gather its political strength in order to break inflationary expectations at a stroke. This will require a reform of the currency. Of course, it is clear that currency reform itself - the mere exchange of bank notes - will not solve the underlying problems. Currency reform can, however, be the cornerstone of a successful approach where it is embedded in a far-reaching reform of economic policy, one which effectively stabilises prices and wages, preventing new inflationary expectations arising. This, of course, is conditional on at least a minimal social consensus - and on scarce money. But it is not until price stability can be entrusted more to social consensus than to the scarcity of money that Russia will fulfil a necessary condition for the creation of a successful market economy. Even if this path is taken, the chances of success appear far from rosy. Restrictive monetary policies, however, in an attempt to impose social discipline through rising unemployment and to break inflationary expectations step by step, offer no hope whatsoever given the conditions prevailing in Russia.

This means that the  truth about Cuba is prevailing.    In an article published on 7 April, GRANMA journalists Leon  Nicanor Cotayo mentions the specific dates of the U.S. State  Department reports on this issue: 7 March 1991, 12 April 1993,  and 4 April 1994. It is interesting how in the last report, the  U.S. Government notes that Cuba's efforts against drug  trafficking have not been more extensive because of the effects  of the more than 30-year-old U.S. blockade. In this regard, the  document states that the shortage of fuel and essential spare  parts somewhat limits the Cuban Government's capabilities to  intercept drug traffickers.    Leon Cotayo adds that Miami's far right and other  conservative sectors in the United States frequently unleash  smear campaigns, tying Cuba to drug trafficking. This is the  third communique issued by the U.S. State Department, which once  again putting objectivity before any propagandistic defamation,  seems to add an element of significant value to anyone pondering  the seriousness of Cuba's arguments when it comes to explaining  its actions, or when it comes to repudiating those who around  the clock, try to distort Cuba's reality.

0,FT933-16035 ,"FT933-16035 _AN-DGFC3AD4FT 930706   FT  06 JUL 93 / Personal View: Remove roadblock to Russian reforms      By STANLEY FISCHER and JEFFREY SACHS   Six months ago, the Russian economy stood at the brink of hyperinflation. Today the stabilisation of the rouble and the end of high inflation are within reach. The near-hyperinflation at the end of last year was caused by virtually unrestrained central bank credit creation, amounting to an astonishing 40 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992. Since then, Mr Boris Fedorov, the new finance minister, has gradually been gaining control of macroeconomic policy. In April, Mr Fedorov and the central bank governor, Mr Viktor Geraschenko, signed an agreement committing the central bank to reduce the rate of credit creation to less than 10 per cent a month by December. Inflation is now running at about 15 per cent a month, down sharply from the near-hyperinflationary 30 per cent at the end of 1992. This credit agreement reflects the growing political strength of the government relative to the congress, to which the central bank is responsible. The government has been strengthened by President Yeltsin's victory in the April referendum and indications that the constitutional convention is going his way. The Group of Seven industrial countries' announcement in April of a Dollars 28bn aid package has also strengthened the reformers. In May, the Russian government and the International Monetary Fund agreed on budget and credit targets, which will mean Dollars 3bn in IMF loans should start flowing to Russia in July. The budget deficit planned for the second half of 1993 is about 10 per cent of GNP. Of this, about 3 per cent will be financed by central bank credit and 7 per cent from abroad, including the IMF, World Bank and western governments. By borrowing abroad to finance the budget deficit, the government reduces the amount of money it has to print, so reducing inflationary pressures. Implementation of these fiscal and credit policies will make low inflation possible, but they are not sufficient to stabilise the currency. To do that and reduce inflation rapidly, Russia should peg the exchange rate. The market value of the rouble would be supported by tight monetary and fiscal policies, and defended by the central bank. Russian stabilisation will not succeed without delivery of already-committed western financial assistance. Part of the assistance is needed to finance the budget deficit. Part is needed to help defend the exchange rate: the Dollars 6bn stabilisation fund that the IMF controls should be made available on a rapid timetable, provided the Russians tighten credit and the budget. Similarly, an IMF standby loan of Dollars 4bn and a new World Bank loan of Dollars 1bn should be brought on line quickly. These western commitments should be reaffirmed to President Yeltsin at this week's Tokyo summit, though the actual flow of assistance would be conditional on Russia's implementation of the remaining steps for stabilisation. The Russians could credibly commit to a stable, pegged exchange rate by September or October. They need several weeks to ensure that the credit agreement with the central bank is working; to adjust energy and other controlled prices before the start of the stabilisation programme; and to be reasonably sure that the budget deficit can be held to 5 per cent of GNP. The Russians should go for it. But will they? Ironically, one thing that might hold them back is the view that things are going rather well now. So why rock the boat? The answer is that restructuring of the economy cannot be undertaken with annual inflation of more than 400 per cent. At some point, Russia will have to stabilise, and the circumstances are unlikely to be more favourable than now. Unfortunately, the G-7 is threatening to put a roadblock in the way at this critical juncture. Recent reports suggest the Europeans and Japanese want to scale back sharply the Dollars 4bn 'privatisation fund' for enterprise restructuring, proposed by the US to complement the Western aid package announced previously. Failure to make significant funding available for this purpose would set back the restructuring of industry and lower the chances for successful stabilisation. No single policy by the West will make or break Russia's stabilisation. But, with the opportunity for Russia's success so high, we can only hope that both Russia and the G-7 recognise the historic opportunity when they meet in Tokyo.

0,FT943-1905 ,"FT943-1905 _AN-EIVD2ABEFT 940922   FT  22 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Mexican investors to help restart Cuban refinery - Joint venture to operate Soviet-built facility      By PASCAL FLETCHER      HAVANA   A group of Mexican state and private investors has formed a joint venture with Cuba that will spend Dollars 200m to restart and operate a Cuban oil refinery built by the former Soviet Union. Since the 1990 collapse of Cuba's trade and aid ties with the former Soviet bloc, the Cuban government had been seeking a foreign partner to help run the refinery at the south-central port of Cienfuegos. The installation, completed at the end of the last decade, was practically unused and is currently idle. Announcing the deal in Havana yesterday, Mexico's secretary for foreign relations (foreign minister), Mr Manuel Tello, said the Mexpetrol group would have a 49 per cent stake in the refining joint venture. The group is formed by state institutions Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomex), and Mexico's Instituto de Petroleo, and by four private companies, Ingenieros Civiles Asociados, Bufete Industrial, Protexa and Empresa de Transportaciones Maritimas Mexicanas. Cuba's state oil company, Cubapetroleo, will control 51 per cent of the venture. Mr Tello said the latest investment by Mexican entrepreneurs in Cuba completed the liquidation of Cuba's remaining Dollars 340m debt with Mexico. Cuba, seeking foreign capital to revitalise its recession-hit economy, has already opened up offshore and onshore exploration blocks to oil companies from Canada, France and Britain. Once operating fully again, the Cienfuegos refinery, which has a capacity of 75,000 barrels a day, will refine crude oil from both Mexico and other countries. The resulting oil products could be sold in Cuba, Mexico or to third-party buyers on a commercial basis, Mr Tello said. Besides earning hard currency, the refining deal is also expected to help Cuba alleviate the chronic shortages of oil and oil products since oil supplies from the former Soviet Union fell precipitously. Mr Tello said Mexican investments in Cuba to date totalled more than Dollars 1bn and included joint ventures in tourism, textiles and cement. Another joint production agreement in glass manufacture will be finalised in two or three weeks, Mr Tello said. Mexico, a member of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), is one of Cuba's biggest trading partners in Latin America and has maintained strong diplomatic and trade links with the island despite continuing US sanctions against the Cuban government.

Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 8 February reports that a  miscellaneous crops plenum was held in Cienfuegos Province at  which it was announced that an additional 400 caballerias of  plantain are going to be planted in Cienfuegos Province, above  and beyond those under the current agricultural plan. Also, in  salute to 26 July, 42 organic plots are to be added to the  present 15.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 8 February reports that in 1993  Cuba received approximately $50 million in diverse donations --  mainly food, medicine, and school supplies -- channeled by the  Cuban Institute of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP] from 72  countries. ICAP President Sergio Corrieri added that 11  international brigades visited Cuba in 1993, and 32 cultural  delegations traveled abroad.    Cuba Vision Network at 0100 GMT on 9 February reports that  the Faustino Vega rice mill in Manzanillo, Granma Province, has  fulfilled its 1993 goal by husking a total of 8,500 tons of  rice. This rice mill belongs to the Fernando Chenique Rice  Company, which must plant 2,000 caballerias of rice this year,  the largest number in the country. With an industrial  performance of 64 percent, the Faustino Vega rice mill is also  one of the best in this area.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 9 February reports that the  Antillana de Acero enterprise produced 8,000 tons of steel in  January. This year's plan per four-month period is 50,000 tons.    Radio Reloj at 1508 GMT on 9 February reports that Pinar del  Rio Province has approximately 170 caballerias of land planted  in miscellaneous crops, earmarked for use by schools. These are  self-sufficiency plots. In 1993, 62 percent of the schools'  needs in food were provided for by these plots. Over 64,000  quintals of miscellaneous food crops were produced in Pinar del  Rio Province in 1993. This year, the School of Medical Sciences  and other centers of higher learning will be given land to  cultivate for self-sufficiency.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 10 February reports that  Federico Ramon Puerta, governor of the Argentine province of  Misiones, announced a donation to Cuba of 28 tons of paper. He  announced this shortly before his departure for Argentina after  a visit to several Cuban provinces. He was accompanied by  Argentine Ambassador (Susana Sara Grane) [Diplomatic List shows  Adolfo Enrique Nanclares as Argentine ambassador to Cuba), and  Pedro Chavez, president of Havana's People's Government.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 10 February reports on an  ""experiment"" underway in the food industry in Sibanicu  Municipality, Camaguey Province, where workers are receiving a  portion of the profits from sales at all centers, in lieu of  salaries. ""The worker earns according to his sales, receiving  some 20 or 30 percent of what he sells."" Omar del Risco, the  local first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba, explains  that a unit's administrator is authorized to negotiate and  purchase products from specific places and to manage the entire  supply process for the unit. The administrator also decides,  after consulting with the workers, how many workers should be  kept at a given unit. Del Risco notes that ""by distributing 20  percent among the workers, the workers try to have as few  workers as possible. They do not keep anyone they do not need.  Since they are paid in profits, they try to reduce costs to a  minimum. They are tripling sales but lowering costs, and of  course, there is an improvement in income."" Del Risco notes that  working for profit seems to motivate workers.    Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 11 February reports that at the  end of an extensive tour of San Cristobal Municipality  cane-growing areas, Fidel Ramos, first secretary of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] in Pinar del Rio Province, has  issued a call to catch up and to increase both efficiency and  the amount of sugar produced during the current harvest.  Rebelde's correspondent notes that workers are working around  the clock at the 30 de Noviembre agroindustrial complex to get a  1,000-cubic-meter water tank operative again because problems  with it paralyzed the sugar mill's operations. Ramos also  inspected the Basic Cooperative Production Units' [UBPCs']  planting areas and a Youth Labor Army military grange. Along  with Jose Marrero Camacho, like Ramos a member of the PCC's  Central Committee and also president of the Provincial Assembly  of the People's Government in Pinar del Rio, Ramos participated  in a seminar for the economists of the 47 cane sector UBPC in  the province, as well as in an overall inspection of the sugar  harvest in Pinar del Rio.    Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 11 February reports that the  country's objective is to plant more than 18,000 caballerias of  sugarcane by the end of June 1994, the largest figure over the  past 13 years. Thus far, 61 percent of that program has already  been achieved. Havana and Cienfuegos Provinces are leading in  this planting program.    Rebelde adds that the Armed Forces will be in charge of  maintaining more than 11,000 light and heavy tractors, and more  than 11,000 previously inoperative light trucks, to participate  in this new Cuban agricultural project. The Armed Forces has the  most experience and best techniques for maintaining both Armed  Forces and agricultural equipment.    The same newscast reports that despite the economic crisis  affecting the country, there are and have always been the  fraternal hands of many governments and institutions supporting  our government. Such is the case with the Spanish Government,  which in 1993 alone contributed approximately $5 million worth  of donations. Spanish ambassador to Havana Jose Antonio San Gil  said his government hopes to maintain and further develop  cooperation with Cuba. In 1993, the Spanish Agency for  International Cooperation brought 337 tons of powdered milk for  children. Spain also contributed, with $550,000 worth of  medicine in 1993.     "

In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, the daughter of  Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, who was imprisoned in Cuba for 22 years  for conducting activities against the revolution and who later  traveled to the United States, talked about the failure of the  last-minute attempts by the aforementioned groups to recover  their lost political ground.    In this context, she even mentioned the recent spreading of  false rumors in Miami regarding the health of Cuban President  Fidel Castro and the attacks against the emigrants who are  participating in the current talks in Cuba.    Gutierrez said she was pleased to be able to personally  prove  the falsehood of these reports. She said she believes in Fidel  and in Cuba and was pleased to be on the island for the first  time because she was born and raised abroad but recognizes Cuba  as her fatherland. She noted the hospitality received since her  arrival and the positive experiences at the conference. I  believe the meeting is the first big step, she said and added  that she is willing to contribute to the fulfillment of the  nation's dreams.    In another part of the interview, she criticized U.S.  intervention in Cuban affairs and said she is opposed to the  U.S. blockade of the Caribbean island. Gutierrez said she  opposes any return to the past in Cuba, which she described as  useless. She said the group that supports that position among  the Cubans living in the United States is a majority, although  very silent at times, for fear of attacks from the recalcitrant  minority.    Proof of this -- and this is important in Miami -- is that  there were no unfavorable farewells to all those who came to the  conference in response to an invitation from the Cuban  Government, she said. I believe it is a message from those who  live there because love is always stronger than hate, she said.    Patricia Gutierrez said she supports the search for  solutions  to matters such as the simplification of immigration paperwork,  which interests those living outside of Cuba. She said she is  optimistic about the meeting's success which has gathered over  200 emigrants in the capital of her homeland.     "
0,FT931-2820 ,"FT931-2820 _AN-DCRCHADWFT 930318   FT  18 MAR 93 / Japanese unearth perils of G7 summit: Domestic politicking and the Russian question are upsetting Tokyo's plans      By CHARLES LEADBEATER      TOKYO   JAPAN IS desperately trying to defend the centrepiece of its political year, the Tokyo summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations due to be held in July. The summit is supposed to be a meticulously planned display of Japan's ability to command a larger role in international affairs. In the absence of a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, the G7 is Japan's best hope of acquiring such a role. But Japanese diplomacy will be tested to the full if the summit is to mark a smooth beginning for Japan's wider role. A complicating factor is Japanese domestic politics. Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, is in failing health and had to go into hospital after a recent trip to the US. Mr Watanabe wants to use a carefully managed summit as a launch pad for his last attempt to become prime minister, replacing Mr Kiichi Miyazawa in Liberal Democratic party leadership elections in the autumn. The summit was always likely to be tricky because Japan is renegotiating its relationship with the US, which has guided its foreign policy for four decades. Japan's growing trade surplus will provoke further calls from the Clinton administration for a stimulus to the Japanese economy to boost demand for imports as well as measures to open up Japanese markets. Mr Miyazawa will visit Washington next month to mollify the Clinton team with an outline economic package. But that will be just the start of potentially fractious trade negotiations which could cast a shadow over the summit. As a senior diplomat put it: 'There is a crunch coming with the US on trade and we better wake up to that fact.' However, in the past two weeks the mounting Russian political crisis has threatened to wreck all of Tokyo's carefully laid summit plans. Tokyo's deeply ingrained sense of protocol has been offended by European calls, led by the French, for an emergency summit on the Russian crisis. Mr Yohei Kono, the cabinet secretary, yesterday bluntly told Paris to stop trying to hijack the summit. It was Tokyo's job to issue invitations, he said. Even if Japan's summit partners accept that an April meeting of foreign and finance ministers will suffice, it still risks becoming isolated if the Russian crisis gathers momentum. Japan has conspicuously failed to echo German and US messages of support for Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The unresolved dispute with Russia over the four islands off the northern tip of Japan, known as the Kuriles or Northern Territories, is only one factor behind Japan's reluctance. Japanese officials argue that the Russian economy is in such a dire state that further aid would be like pouring money down the drain. They say half the aid Japan has so far provided has not been disbursed, largely because of Russian bureaucratic chaos. Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice-minister for international affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, remarked: 'We should fully disburse the Dollars 24bn aid agreed by the G7 last year before we agree more aid.' Japan's Export-Import Bank said yesterday it was disbursing a Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m) soft loan to help Russia buy food and medicines from Japanese companies, fulfilling a pledge made in December 1990, after receiving letters of guarantee from Moscow. Mr Yeltsin's sudden decision to cancel a trip to Japan last autumn, but then to visit South Korea and India, has merely hardened opposition to further help to him among the elderly upper echelons of the LDP. But even younger officials believe Japan should avoid taking sides in political disputes in other countries. As an international official in the Finance Ministry put it: 'A message of support for Mr Yeltsin would not be welcomed by Mr Khasbulatov.' Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker of the Russian parliament, is Mr Yeltsin's rival for power. Japan's diplomats, led by the highly skilled Mr Hisashi Owada, the head of the Foreign Ministry, who is in Washington for talks, are trying to paper over the emerging cracks. But if they fail Japan faces the prospect of hosting a summit at which it appears to be isolated. At the least, Japan's stance on Russia may further distance it from Europe at a time when trade tensions with the EC are rising. At the worst, Japan may be accused of fumbling during a crucial phase of the Russian crisis, mishandling a golden opportunity to take an international initiative on Russia which would be widely welcomed, and once again showing that it often only acts when foreign pressure on it becomes irresistible.

THEIR  TIES COULD STYMIE ATTEMPTS TO OVERTHROW THE DICTATOR.      By DON A. SCHANCHE, TIMES STAFF WRITER      HAVANA      Cheered by the collapse of communism in East Europe, Cuban exiles have been  dancing in the streets of Miami in expectation of Fidel Castro's imminent  downfall. One militant anti-Castro group, Alpha-66, has even begun paramilitary  training in the Everglades to join battle instantly if there is an armed  uprising.    But Cubans in the streets of Havana, and experts here from both East and West,  say that despite international pressures and increased domestic grumbling over  the Communist country's severe economic problems, the hemisphere's most durable  dictator may stay in power for years.    ""His relationship with the Soviet Union is the key,"" a Western diplomat said,  noting that the Soviets' annual $5.5-billion package of aid and credits has  been the Havana government's lifeline for the past three decades. ""If that goes  on, he goes on.""    A top Soviet diplomat, who is privately critical of the Castro regime but  believes it is in no danger of collapse, said: ""I don't think it is possible  that we will cut our aid to Cuba. We need their products. They need our  assistance. It will go on.""    Not one expert interviewed recently in the course of a two-week visit to Havana  saw any sign of a significant weakening in Soviet-Cuban ties. This despite a  newly abrasive tone in the relationship, including stingingly critical articles  and ominous grumblings about continued aid to Cuba in the Moscow press.    Nor have they detected the kind of restiveness in the military and among the  people that would suggest that the regime is losing its grip. Among the  specialists who talked with a reporter on the condition of anonymity were  diplomats from East and West Europe, Latin and North America, and the Soviet  Union.    None foresaw a Caribbean copy of East Europe's experience, but all agreed that  even with continued Soviet aid, Cuba faces hard times that will keep the  country on a tough austerity diet for as long as the U.S. embargo lasts. The  main problems today, they said, are a shortage of hard currency, brought on by  the country's almost total reliance on trade in nonconvertible rubles and  barter with the Soviets and the former East Bloc countries, and sluggishness  and mismanagement in Cuba's centrally controlled economy.    Castro and other government officials have been candid about the grim  prospects, which they said will become acute in 1991, when trade agreements  expire and Cuba must begin paying hard currency for spare parts and other vital  goods from its suppliers in East Europe.    ""We don't deny that when our economic ties with Eastern Europe are torn down we  are going to face some problems,"" said Jorge Gomez Barata, a top Castro adviser  in the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party. ""But we will be able to  continue without disorder.""    While barter and ruble-based trade with the Soviets is expected to continue,  Castro and the government-run press have warned frequently of the need for  belt-tightening. Gomez Barata and other senior officials emphasize that they  have reordered government priorities to emphasize greater self-sufficiency in  industry and agriculture and a crash program to develop tourism and other  hard-currency earners.    On the streets of Havana, there is ample evidence that hard times already are  here. Long lines form quickly at food markets when sparse supplies of imported  pork, beef and chicken arrive from hard-currency countries such as Brazil. A  running joke heard in food lines at several Havana markets has it that ""if  there's another revolution it won't be over ideology, it'll be over a chicken  breast.""    As they queue for food, people complain openly about recent increases in the  price of bread and eggs, both in short supply since December when the Soviets  delayed a bonus shipment of wheat and feed grains and the Cuban larder ran dry.    A Soviet Embassy official said wheat had routinely been sent a month or more in  advance of its committed due date, so that Cuba, in effect, received a bonus of  an extra month's wheat supply after each year's commitment was fulfilled. The  expectation was that Cuba would stockpile the bonus grain against a rainy day.    The rainy day came in December, when, facing problems at home and with their  formal 1989 commitment fulfilled, the Soviets withheld the advance shipment.    ""We've been telling them all along they should have prepared for it,"" a Soviet  economic specialist complained. ""It is impossible to live without at least a  minimum stockpile. It's all very frustrating.""    Cuban economist Eugenio Balari, who directs the government's think tank on  domestic consumption, acknowledged: ""There was a certain amount of guilt on our  side. We should have stockpiled so we had a cushion. As it was, we practically  had to unload the wheat from the boats and truck it directly to the bakers when  it came. Now we've increased the price of bread and eggs, not for the money but  for conservation, so we will have a cushion. Once we have a stockpile, maybe we  will lower the prices again.""    Although one hears grumbling in the food lines, none of the foreign experts  here believe that the public's unhappiness even borders on the kind of  discontent that has been responsible for bread riots and rebellion in many  other Third World countries.    ""The average Cuban may be eating a bland diet, but even with shortages, he is  better fed than most other Latin Americans,"" a Scandinavian diplomat said.    Another bonus feature of Soviet-Cuban trade has been a liberal flow of  subsidized Soviet oil, about 20% to 25% more than enough to meet Cuba's  domestic needs. Until now, the Castro government has routinely sold the surplus  oil for desperately needed hard currency. As recently as 1985, the last year  Cuba reported its oil trade figures, the re-export of Soviet oil earned Havana  a tidy $621 million.    Since then, re-export earnings have gone unreported, leading some specialists  to conclude that the bonus oil flow has slowed or even ended. But a Soviet  diplomat, without revealing figures, said the oil flow continues in excess of  Cuba's needs.    ""The Russians may cut back somewhat, but it's not in their interest to cut Cuba  down to starvation rations,"" another diplomat said.    The Soviet economic specialist agreed, saying: ""There's no question that we  need these products. In the U.S.S.R., we produce about 8 to 9 million tons of  sugar a year and have to buy 4 million tons from Cuba to make up the shortfall.  The significance to us of the Cuban sugar is considerable. Nickel is vital for  our industry. And Cuba's citrus fruits are very important to us.""    But he hinted at harder bargaining by a Soviet delegation now in Havana to  begin negotiating new trade terms to replace the five-year cooperation  agreement that expires at the end of this year. Because of the use of barter  and overvalued rubles and Cuban pesos, it is hard to calculate the extent of  the Soviet subsidy to the Castro regime. But experts say the Soviets pay more  than twice the world price for Cuban sugar and similarly unrealistic prices for  raw materials and citrus fruits.    Thus Cuba may soon be getting less nourishment from the Soviets than it has in  the past, but the experts doubt that any future cutback will be sharp enough to  endanger the Castro government. Even if Soviet aid dropped to only $3 billion a  year, it would suffice to keep Castro's troubled economic machine running,  predicted Prof. Philip Brenner, a Cuba specialist at American University in  Washington.    Like many diplomatic specialists here, Brenner predicted that Soviet aid will  continue and that Castro might survive as Cuba's leader for another decade.    ""Cuba is essential to the Soviet Union's image as a superpower,"" Brenner said.  ""While it is costly, there are certain benefits, both military and civil.""    He cited in particular Moscow's largest electronic eavesdropping network  outside the Soviet Union and the continued use of Cuban bases for aerial  surveillance and naval support.    Most of the experts here believe that Cuba's military importance to the Soviets  has waned, except, as one said, ""as the last nice tropical outpost for KGB and  army officers to do temporary duty."" But they said Cuba's military importance  is not the chief element of the strategic equation in Moscow.    ""It's not the strategic military value but the broader geopolitical value that  counts,"" one said. ""This is one of the Soviets' last claims to being a great  power. With East Germany gone, Cuba is their most important ally.""    As a result, he said, Moscow cannot afford to endanger Castro's grip on power  by undercutting him too severely in economic terms.    ""The regime's arms are still strong, and the army is loyal to Fidel,"" a  European diplomat said. ""And he still exercises a moral authority unlike that  of any of the fallen East European Communist leaders. As long as the military  remains behind him, he will be able to repress any challenge to his power.""

To  have them speak first?    [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I suggest that you answer  some of their questions.    [Castro] This is like arriving to take a test without having  studied the subject.    [Unidentified speaker] Professors do not have to study the  subject.    [Castro] That is so for professors, but I have been a  student  all my life and have always felt like a student whenever I have  been before an audience.    [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I am from Argentina's  Tele-C News...    [Castro, interrupting] Yes, but the question from Argentina  was left unfinished. [laughter]    [Unidentified speaker] I am always on the way. Commander...    [Castro, interrupting] Let me stand. I cannot see who is  speaking. [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Commander, I wanted to ask for the  [words indistinct] of Argentina: What role do you believe  tourism plays for Cuba at this historic junction?    [Castro] I believe that for everyone [words indistinct]. I  hope it will play a special role and must say sincerely that we  are prioritizing it while maintaining other sectors, despite  everything bad and good tourism is said to bring. I say, as  some say, because we do not know anything about it. We are now  beginning to learn. In general, I must stress that I have seen  good things. I do not know if tourism is categorized as very  good, outstanding, good, regular, fair, or bad. I have yet to  see the bad tourism category. Rather, I have seen tourists  falling into the outstanding and good categories.    Anything that helps the economy today is enormously  important  to Cuba. This is one of the most influential sectors. This  sector has maintained a growth rate of a little over 30 percent  annually. Our future success will depend heavily on our ability  to work and, particularly, on our ability to attain your  cooperation worldwide.    I believe we have the potential. I believe we have great  tourism potential and an educated people. We have a highly  developed spirit of hospitality, as well as the will to do  things right.    However, I will answer your question specifically by saying  that tourism occupies one of the topmost places at this historic  junction in the country's life and finances.    [Unidentified speaker] Thank you.    [BBC correspondent Rose Hays, in English with  passage-by-passage translation into Spanish] I have been at the  Varadero convention for a week now. There have been many  debates on tourism industry profits. It is said that right now  it has probably reached a phase where tourism profits are  surpassing sugar industry profits. It has been predicted that  the tourism industry will surpass sugar as Cuba's main source of  revenue. Do you agree?    [Castro] Yes, at least that is our hope. We hope the tourism  industry will overcome the sugar industry. I have been  pondering this. The large-scale sugar industry and tourism seem  to be two difficult things to reconcile. We have almost 11  million people and a little over 110,000 square kilometers of  land. I believe we can do both things right. We have hundreds  of kilometers of beach and thousands of kilometers of coast,  some of it nestled between the sea and the mountains. In other  words, we have great tourism potential. However, we still have  great sugar potential.    Other industries certainly tend to surpass the sugar  industry  in modern times. For example, Puerto Rico produced 1 million  tons of sugar about 30 years ago yet does not produce enough  sugar today to satisfy national demand. Many sugar fields were  used to grow other crops, to meet urban growth demands, or to  establish industrial parks. Above all, the sugar industry is  very difficult and entails extremely hard work.    The introduction of slavery in the Caribbean was followed  by the development of the sugar industry in the tropical heat.  It is such hard work that the native population was practically  unable to do it. This is what gave rise to the macabre idea of  enslaving Africans to make them work in the fields here, in the  tropics, because they were better suited to that hard work in  sugarcane, as well coffee, although coffee is not as hard.  Sugarcane was the hardest crop because the harvesting and  weeding had to be done by hand. However, the sugarcane harvest  demands great effort even if you improve working and living  conditions. Also, it has a cyclic nature. It does not guarantee  year-long jobs for everyone. This results in a large emigration  of the labor force from the sugar fields to other activities.    Slavery was allegedly abolished at the turn of the century,  yet tens of thousands of Caribbean people emigrated from  Jamaica, Haiti, and other Caribbean islands following the great  boom the sugar industry experienced after the U.S. intervention,  when hundreds of millions of dollars -- which had a greater  value then -- were invested to develop the sugar industry. A  new form of slavery ensued because the Jamaicans and Haitians  who came to Cuba to work in the sugarcane lived under similarly  harsh conditions. It is very hard work.    I have noticed that sugar production declines as tourism  develops in the Caribbean islands. The work force transfers to  tourism. There are islands of every size, from 400 square  kilometers to 1,000 square kilometers and every other size in  between. I have noticed the incompatibility of these  industries. Boosting the tourism industry has resulted in a  decline of the sugar industry in those countries.    Cuba should be able to maintain a highly vital sugar  industry  through mechanization and chemical resources once we are again  under normal conditions and given the available land area,  population, machinery, herbicides, and automation processes at  sugar mills. This is what we plan to do. However, there is a  sugar mill nearby which is about empty of personnel. Almost  every worker is here, in Varadero. Tourism work is not as hard  and is more appealing than agriculture and sugarcane. Yet, I  believe we have a large enough population to maintain both  industries. However, tourism's potential, keeping in mind that  we have thousands of kilometers of virgin beaches, is much  higher than the sugar industry's potential.    If we fully develop our tourism potential, undoubtedly,  apart  from other factors, the tourism industry will render much higher  revenues to Cuba than the sugar industry, even if this  incompatibility did not exist between both sectors. In  addition, the tourism market is growing much more than the sugar  market. I have yet to hear anyone say that sunshine makes you  fat. [laughter]    Unfortunately, people are going around saying that sugar is  fattening and all those kinds of things, all those calumnies  against sugar. [laughter]    However, tourism is healthy and has great prestige. It seems  that tourism is the faster growing industry in the world. I  have heard many people say this.    [Unidentified speaker] Once again, for Argentina: Regarding  the U.S. blockade, is the Clinton administration as severe as  previous administrations?    [Castro] I would have to ask you to define severity.    [Unidentified speaker] Argentina is well aware of the U.S.  position, which is not fair to the Cuban people. This is why I  ask the question. You raised this issue last year, when I had  the opportunity to meet you and the Council of State. I would  like to know your thoughts on this today.    [Castro] I could say that Clinton maintains the same  severity, because he maintains the blockade, the Torricelli Law,  everything. However, he does so in a softer manner and with less  threatening and less bellicose words. But the severity of U.S.  policy toward Cuba has not changed. It remains the same.    [Rene Capriles, correspondent for Brazil's ECO RIO  magazine] Commander, I had the pleasure of hearing you at the  Rio summit. Your address was the most applauded, even by  President Bush, which was a surprise, as you might remember.    You just came from a conference on island-states and  biodiversity. Biodiversity plays an important role worldwide  when it comes to genetic patents, on which Cuba has broad  experience. What are Cuba's prospects in this regard,  considering tourism, island-states, and the creation of the  Caribbean common market in the future?    [Castro] The analysis of environmental problems was good at  the Barbados meeting. Both the environment and sustainable  development were discussed. We noticed in Rio that  island-states are highly anxious about this. I noticed that  many countries are highly anxious about the prospects that  global...[pauses] changes in weather patterns and the greenhouse  effect. Changes in weather patterns mean more droughts, more  intense hurricanes, and other climate phenomena which are  generally disastrous for those small nations.    While a hurricane in Florida damages a very small portion of  the territory, a hurricane on St. Vincent or on any other small  Caribbean island -- such as St. Lucia or Jamaica -- covers 100  percent of the island's territory and can destroy everything.  The rest of the nation can help Florida repair the hurricane  damage. Islands face territorial limitations and serious  communication problems. A man from Santiago de Cuba was  complaining because there are no direct flights between Mexico  and Santiago de Cuba. Yet, there are no flights between many  Carribean islands. There are no flight routes. Sea  transportation is also very difficult. These countries  experience diverse difficulties for their development.    They are affected the most, environmentally speaking. Many  of those islands, particularly those in the Pacific, would  disappear if the water were to rise four meters. It would be a  global disaster because it would affect every port's  infrastructure. However, certain countries would disappear  altogether. Certain countries, such as Bangladesh, with a  population of over 100 million people, would disappear almost  completely, despite being one of the most densely populated  countries.    Of course, this explains the high anxiety experienced by  these states and why it was decided at the Rio summit to hold an  international conference of small island-states. There was an  increased awareness of the problem in Barbados, more of an  awareness than in Rio. However, the Rio summit and the efforts  of the nongovernmental organizations were extremely significant  in creating an awareness of this problem. I dare affirm 90  percent of the governments of the world were not aware of  ecological problems.    This was the first time that dozens of heads of state had a  chance to think about these problems and were compelled to think  about them. The representatives of the most industrialized  nations also had to speak and explain things in Rio.  Consumerist societies are the main culprits of the destructive  phenomena that has ravished the environment in past decades.  They consume an overwhelming majority of energy and fossil fuel  and have poisoned the rivers, lakes, and seas the most. They  have poisoned the air, have created acid rain, and have  increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. They are creating  serious, real problems, including extremely serious problems  with weather pattern changes.    This awareness is somewhat late. Certain damages are already  irreversible. The amounts of fluorocarbons released have  damaged the ozone layer and will continue to do so for a long  time. We must ask ourselves if there is still time to reverse  this trend. However, since we cannot afford to be pessimistic,  the least we can do is fight hard to increase awareness so that  measures are adopted as soon as possible to solve these problems.    You might remember from Rio that the U.S. Government  objected  and put up the most resistance to the accords. It was  practically isolated. I must add that this is not the case with  the current administration. This administration is more  concerned with environmental issues. The U.S. vice president  has a book out on the environment. I believe he is quite  committed to environmental issues. The United States, the  number one consumer of energy and natural resources, is called  upon to play a very important role here.    This is why any change in the U.S. Government's position  must seen as positive. This had not taken place yet at the time  of the Rio summit but was hinted at in the U.S. representative's  address in Rio and noticed again during the Barbados conference.    We must fight harder and harder and harder if we want to  avoid the catastrophe of incalculable magnitude toward which we  are heading right now. This is an issue that can be discussed  at length. A great many variables enter into play because the  development of various countries can differ so greatly. I  pointed out in Barbados that Bangladesh's per capita income is  $220, while Switzerland's is $34,000. [Words indistinct] 1  billion tons of carbon is consumed. How much more do the  Chinese people need to attain a gross income 10 times higher?  India has similar problems. These are very complex, acute  problems. How will global resources be distributed? How will  development be apportioned? Will we just decide to leave  developing nations as they are while developed nations continue  to develop?    Mankind must exert great effort and revise certain theories.  I hinted at this in my 15-minute address on the problems of  inequitable worldwide development. What does the future hold  for a society that can only survive by growing and can only grow  by depleting the world's natural resources? That question has  no answer. They are condemned to grow. This is why when one  speaks of sustainable development, no one knows what one is  talking about. We ought to speak of societies that can sustain  themselves or that can survive as they are by recycling and  reducing levels of carbon dioxide and other polluting gases and  not by continuing to deplete natural resources.    Neoliberalism is in vogue today. However, we are not talking  politics here, nor do we want to discuss politics. Yet, it is  in fashion. Neoliberalism is based on the concept of continuous  growth to prevent a disaster. However, continuous growth will  result in a bigger disaster. We must focus primarily on the  growth of those countries further behind, the poorest nations.  We must do a better job distributing the world's natural  resources. We must distribute the world's wealth better and  more equally. Otherwise, the problems will not be solved. Yet,  we cannot discuss this further here nor turn this into a  conference on extremely complex philosophical issues. We risk  missing the mark regarding tourism.    [Faustino Castilla, director of Spain's VIAJE Y TOURISMO  magazine] How can capitalist and socialist views coexist in the  tourism industry? Unfortunately, I remember what the Cuban  tourism industry had to endure in the '50s. That was not like  tourism today but was tourism, nevertheless. How can both  doctrines coexist today?    I would also like to present to you an example of Habanera,  a  typically Cuban-Spanish form of music that symbolizes  Cuban-Spanish unity. [applause]    [Castro] He asks: How can the two views coexist? That of  tourism and what else? Within tourism? You refer to joint  investments, right?    Unfortunately, I do not have Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, or  Vladimir Ilich Lenin by my side to help me answer your question.  Yet, I believe, referring even to the founders of socialism,  Lenin for example, at the time of the famous Bolshevik  revolution, had even considered the idea of establishing  capitalism under the control of the proletariat. Lenin's  original idea was to establish socialism in that country, which  was one of the most industrially backward, a country besieged  and blockaded. Lenin finally came up with the idea of  developing capitalism in Russia, not under the control of  capitalists but under the control of workers. There were other  ideas among the political leaders of that era: The  impossibility of establishing socialism in only one country.  This was discussed extensively.    We must add that among the CPSU's founding concepts was the  idea that the revolution was going to take place simultaneously  in every industrialized nation. History has still not proven  that that was wrong. Although, I will keep my opinion regarding  what has happened in those countries, there is no doubt that  building socialism in one single country, entirely surrounded by  industrialized capitalist countries [words indistinct]. Their  accomplishments were, in my opinion, truly extraordinary. They  will be praised someday once this contemporary period is over.  They conceived with a highly dialectic sense and flexibility  how to build socialism.    We have not relinquished the idea of building socialism.  We have not relinquished our goals. We are simply adapting to  our current reality and acknowledging that under such  exceptional circumstances, following the collapse of the  socialist bloc and the disappearance of the USSR, our goals  cannot be the building of socialism but the defense of the  fatherland, the revolution, and accomplishments of socialism.    The development of any country requires capital, technology,  and markets which we do not have at this time. These are far  from ideal conditions. We are no longer dealing with building  socialism in a single country but on a tiny island lost  somewhere in the Caribbean, lost geographically but not  politically.    Tourism provided the first opportunity to create joint  associations and to introduce foreign capital in Cuba. We need  all three things -- capital, technology, and markets -- to  develop tourism in Cuba. We did not hesitate on the need to  promote its development. We have been talking about tourism,  which is a very typical example. There are many other fields  where the same is happening or could be happening, like the oil  sector.    We will never exploit the oil beneath the Varadero  peninsula.  We do not want to...[pauses] A well had already been drilled  nearby, but we closed it. Estimates have been made on the  amount of fuel underground, but Varadero's tourism development  and oil extraction are incompatible. Developing Varadero's  tourism will yield much more than the extraction of the oil  underneath it.    There are diverse positive indicators regarding the presence  of oil. However, we need seismological research with advanced  technology, well-drilling, and capital investment. We do not  have the capital or the technology to exploit these resources.  How could we do this if not by associating with foreign  companies and capital? It would not be socialist but stupid to  turn a blind eye to this reality. Nothing would be accomplished  if we did that. We would be left stranded, would fail to  fulfill the goal of defending the fatherland, the revolution,  and the accomplishments of socialism. I have given two examples.    As we set off down this path -- free of dogma, armed with  flexibility, and keeping clearly in mind our goals and the means  to attain them -- we have been making this overture, which  continues to expand. I believe our goals and the means being  used to attain them are perfectly in keeping with one another.  The goals we are seeking are perfectly in keeping with the  means we are using to achieve them.    To tell the truth, it is very important that there be trust.  We have taken great pains to ensure that we have created trust  among those who invest in Cuba and are giving investors  advantages they do not get in many other parts of the world so  as to make investing here truly attractive.    [Words indistinct] show that those first experiences were  successful. We must calculate how much the capital yields in  each European country. How much in Italy? How much in  Switzerland? How much in France? How much must be paid in  rent? How much does capital invested in Costa Brava, Spain,  yield? How much in the Canary Islands? We must find ways to  make capital yield more in Cuba than it does in Costa Brava, the  Canary Islands, or any other country.    All in all, it is a competition. I believe that we are in a  position to compete and that Cuba has some advantages. As the  managers of this hotel can attest, cooperation between the  population and the investors is high because we have persuaded  the population of the need to take these steps, these measures,  and to make these investments.    I want to stress to you that our people are socialist.  Harbor no doubts: Our people cannot return to capitalism.  However, they understand perfectly well all the measures we are  taking in this sphere and that the associations with capitalist  companies are in response to the reality of today's world.  Thus, we have growing ties with multinationals. We do. This  is a reality and a power in today's world. No one in today's  world can do without multinationals, because their power  continues to increase. They have more power, even more than  governments. The power of governments is declining and that of  multinationals increasing. We are surrounded by capitalists in  this world.    We are told in geography class that an island is a piece of  land surrounded by water on all sides. If someone were to ask  us at present to define socialism in Cuba, the answer would be:  A noble, courageous, heroic effort surrounded by capitalism on  all sides. [laughter]    We cannot ignore capitalism any more than we can ignore the  sea around us. Besides -- and this was pointed out by Marx --  capitalism has made significant contributions to mankind's  economic development, such as technological and scientific  contributions and a great development of the productive forces.  We could add other things that were unknown at Marx's time:  management capability, [words indistinct], use of computers in  administration and management. We could add many other  contributions capitalism has made to mankind.    Also, it would be stupid of me not to make use of any useful  experience capitalism can contribute. This is how we see what  we are doing, without relinquishing our principles, goals, or  ideals. I believe Cuba is not the only country doing this. The  Chinese people are doing it and have been doing it much longer  than we. The Vietnamese people are doing it and have had very  significant successes. However, history will have the last  word. New paths are always strewn with obstacles, problems, and  difficulties. Our intelligence and wisdom should help us  overcome all these difficulties.    There are many other difficulties. There are difficulties  that are not political, ideological, or philosophical in nature.  Other difficulties could be of a moral nature.    I was explaining to the comrades and have at times explained  to the Cuban people that we cannot afford to be pure within a  glass case. Purity is not as praiseworthy if one is alone,  isolated, unpolluted, free of contact with any virus, germ, or  bacteria. Virtue blooms in the struggle against vice. These  methods or things we are introducing might bring with them  certain vices, yet this can serve to develop our virtue.    Many have questioned the influence tourism might have upon  the minds of our people, upon their basic traits. These matters  have come up. However, experience is teaching us that we can  develop our country perfectly well. Cuba's ties, culture, and  contact with the world are growing. We will be all the more  pure if we are able to preserve our virtues amid the  contamination certain things might bring with them. I believe  we will do so in this effort we are making. It will be, above  all, a test.    I once used a metaphor but later had to recant because it  was  wrong. I said that virtue could not be preserved in a cloister,  a convent. Several nuns immediately wrote me and told me the  remark was unfair. I agreed with them and no longer speak of  cloisters or convents. I speak of ivory towers. [laughter,  applause]    [Unidentified speaker] [Words indistinct]    [Castro] From what magazine?    [Unidentified speaker] (SUARA), a magazine with a  circulation  of over 300,000 and [words indistinct]. I will not ask any  questions because my questions were answered by the minister. I  asked if Cuba was ready to welcome tourists and so on. As you  have said...    [Castro, interrupting] What did he answer? Yes?    [Unidentified speaker] Yes.    [Castro] He lied to your readers. [laughter]    Did he say we were ready or learning?    [Unidentified speaker] No, no. This is my first trip to  Cuba. I want to take this opportunity to do something very  personal or my daughter will never forgive me: I must tell you  that she admires you greatly. She is 15 years old, and we have  explained to her that Cuba is the only socialist country left in  the world. She asked me to tell you that she is at your service  for whatever you might need and that you can always count on her  help. [applause]    She has written many letters to you that remain on her desk.  I have explained to her that it is not easy to reach you.  However, I will not leave Cuba without asking you to please  sign this for her and to take our picture. Otherwise, she would  never forgive me. I am sorry, but this is my only chance. I  hope the others will forgive me. [applause]    [Castro] I will take a chance and honor your request,  although I can foresee about 350 more like them...[pause]    Those noble feelings of solidarity encourage us along, in  this struggle. Our struggle is not easy. Not everyone  understands it. I have wanted to talk about it. The fact that  there are so many good and noble people in the world fills us  with energy and is an extraordinary boost to continuing to  struggle, resist, and triumph. Thank you very much. [applause]    [(Pablo Amalce), Spanish national radio editor and deputy  director of VIAJEROS magazine's Cuba section] [Words indistinct]  in the world, the matter of image as regards tourism. A  country's image is vital. You know that it is oversimplified  sometimes. There is also the pitfall of putting forth an image  currently being used by several other countries, resulting in a  failure to present the unique characteristics of a destination.    What do you -- the president of the Republic of Cuba, a  great  communicator, and someone who knows how to rouse and motivate  diverse audiences well -- think Cuba's tourism image ought to be?    [Castro] I do not know what a communicator is. That is a  technical term used nowadays regarding television, radio, and  other such resources. I have always relied on the same thing:  speaking very frankly and trying to explain things as I see  them. If I do not understand something, I do not attempt to  explain it. I have endured enough of that in school already. I  had teachers who explained things in the books that they did not  understand, could not understand either.    First, we could say that Cuba presents the image of a  beautiful country. It has the natural, physical conditions.  Columbus first took notice of this. It is a proven fact that  when he arrived in Cuba, he said it was the most beautiful land  human eyes had ever seen. I do not know if Columbus ever said  this to a woman, but it is a fact that he said it about Cuba.  We have an image as a country of extreme natural beauty.  However, its people are more important than the land. Cuba's  image is that of an hospitable, warm, generous, fraternal  nation. We want the image of a morally and physically healthy  nation. We want the image of an organized country, the image of  a country which protects the environment, the air, the water,  with pure waters, pure air, a welcoming climate. Of course, we  are a tropical country. Many visitors come from frigid places,  particularly in winter. They come to escape the snow and cold  weather or the like.    We do not want to be seen as a country with gambling or  drugs  or prostitution. We have the image of a country with a high  level of culture and capability [words indistinct] and pleasant  the stay of our visitors. We want to educate the people on this  profession of hospitality so that services can attain levels  equal or superior to those found in any other country. We want  a tourism of the people. Everyone wants the tourists to pay more  money for greater luxury. Of course, we will have some services  that will also serve those who can afford higher prices.  However, we also want tourism to be a source of knowledge,  contact, and brotherly ties among the peoples.    We also want the world to see Cuba as an honest country, a  moral country. This is highly cherished by us because we know  that in the world such qualities are not abundant. Finally, I  will borrow from the Bible and Adam and Eve, who are said to  have been very happy in Eden: We want the world to see Cuba as  a terrestrial paradise. [applause]    [Ed Caprice, director of Berlin's Tropicana tourist company]  Mr. President, it is not always easy for a small tour operator  who is not under the German tourism conglomerates' control to  bring tourism to Cuba. However, I do not want to dwell on the  difficulties but on the happy moments. One such occasion took  place recently, when a group of over 40 people came to Santiago  de Cuba. All of their misgivings were cleared up by the time  they returned to Berlin. Some of them asked before departing  Berlin: Can we really travel to Cuba, given the current  difficulties in supplying the population? However, they were  all very happy and taken by the tropical beauty, the hospitality  you mentioned, the revolutionary spirit of the Cuban people  [words indistinct]. The oldest in the group -- an 84-year-old  man -- said that the trip to Cuba was the happiest time in his  entire life.    Mr. President, I would like you to accept the catalog we  have  put together for Cuba with all our love. Thank you, very much.  [applause]    [Unidentified speaker] Commander Fidel, I have come from  Bolivia with a friend who works in an enterprise. First, I want  to express Bolivia's love and admiration for your efforts on the  Cuban people's survival and freedom and for being an example of  independence to all Latin American leaders. I do not want to  leave Cuba without firmly shaking your hand as a symbol of the  struggle against the economic blockade endured by Cuba and its  people. [applause]    [Emilio Galdez, sales director of Grupo Sol in Cuba] I do  not  have any questions because I already have my answers after  living in Cuba for three and a half years; I received them on a  daily basis from the honest efforts of the Cuban people and the  efforts which I have witnessed at all levels day to day in the  tourism sector, as well as in the society. I ask that you  continue your struggle and your efforts, which in the last three  and a half years have yielded results and successes. I ask that  you continue to set the example which other countries were,  perhaps, not virtuous enough to adopt.    I refer to positive and negative things which have been  attained in tourism. For example, in my country -- Spain -- we  have had many successes, but we must lament not having been  successful in other things and even failures. We have  experienced a crisis from which we are now recovering. We will  have to make investments to regain the levels of years ago.    Keeping these things in mind, I ask of you to continue this  path to attain what I believe everyone augurs for this beautiful  country, which has all the right conditions to fulfill its  goals. My cooperation with Cuba does not end, but my stay does  in two months. I must follow orders. My boss has asked me, and  I agree. I must return to Majorca.    However, during my stay in Cuba I have had the great luck of  working with and making friends not easily found in other  countries, wholehearted friends, true friends to the end. I  have had the luck of meeting my wife and having a daughter --  Daria Lucia -- in this beautiful country. She is 44 days old  today. Therefore, my wish is that very soon and before she can  talk, but when she can understand me I will be able to tell her  that Cuba has overcome the very difficult special period because  it truly deserves it.    Finally, it is also my wish -- I have asked many friends at  work to help me with this -- to take a photo of you with me and  my wife and daughter.    Dear friends, I ask you to continue working together and  more  united and strong each day for the good and future of tourism in  Cuba! Viva Cuba! Viva Fidel! Viva the Revolution! [applause,  pause]    [Castro] I have been told that you have made a great effort  and that it is time to conclude this meeting. I believe you  have other things scheduled, including a closing ceremony. Is  that right? When? At nine? I imagine you have to go to your  rooms and do things. I believe I have tired you enough.    It has been a great pleasure to come to this meeting. We  have heard very friendly words and intelligent and interesting  questions. We have also experienced moving moments, such as the  case of the comrade who spoke just now and introduced his wife  and daughter. We have seen a great example of the ties and  relations that can be established among the peoples through  tourism. He asked us to continue along this path. I can affirm  that we will and that we will never betray the trust of those  who believed in us. [applause]    Our word and commitments are sacred. In no [words  indistinct] of law, or any canon by Osmany, because we have the  canon of honor, seriousness, the given word which will always  prevail. We follow principles of honesty and good faith. We  follow principles of optimism, and that will always prevail.    We only began a short while back and can already see certain  results. I believe we can speak of a future, given the efforts  we are conducting. You cannot imagine with what difficulties we  began to build those renowned causeways. This has helped us  gain access to marvelous beaches, as marvelous as this Varadero  beach, in other places around Cuba. We will continue working in  this manner, with efforts and sacrifice. We cannot nor do we  deny that we are working under hard and difficult conditions.    This is why words such as the ones we have heard today are  so encouraging; the words of the lady who spoke about her  daughter and the faith and trust she has in Cuba; the words, the  words by the Bolivian gentleman; those by the German gentleman.  I mentioned this because he relayed a message from an  84-year-old man who said his stay had been the happiest days of  his life; 84 is a considerable age. Those of us who are a  little younger felt it. [laughter]    An 84-year-old man has experienced practically the entire  century. He lived through World Wars I and II and has  experienced calamities of every kind, hard and good moments in  his life. The fact that he felt the happiest here is  encouraging and honors us.    I will try to maintain that tradition and set this example  for as long as I can. I am sorry not everyone is here, but this  hall can only accommodate so many.    As you can see, we have a brand new minister. [applause]    Perhaps I am getting ahead of myself and prompted your  generous applause. He has yet to earn that applause. What I  should have said is that we have a brand new ministry. We must  find out if we have a brilliant minister. [applause]    This has to be seen. However, we have the greatest hope that  he will prove so. [applause]    In any case, another will have to if he does not prove so.  [laughter]    What is clear is that we need a good ministry and an even  better minister. He has many ideas and initiatives that have  been warmly welcomed and endorsed. I hope that this will help  accelerate the development of tourism in Cuba, which will  continue to have the support of our people, government, and  everyone.    I want to add: Our people did not understand tourism at  first. It was necessary to conduct an educational campaign so  that our people, who had been brought up in the strictest ivory  tower puritanism, would understand the need for tourism, its  portended dangers, what tourism would represent, etc.    I assure you that that struggle is being amply won and that  the people's enthusiasm and happiness is immediately recognized  anywhere in Cuba today where a new tourist project is announced.    We have had to do difficult things to reconcile certain  issues. The people had a hard time understanding the dollar  decriminalization issue, which is why we have had to explain  every step. We normally explain things to the people. We do  not want things to appear by decree but by persuading the  population. We had to explain our own difficulties, the excess  of currency we have and which any tourist or tour operator  understands readily, the approximate value of a peso, a dollar,  a pound. This required taking measures to correct the national  financial imbalance. However, these measures were not taken by  decree or accord of the Council of Ministers but were discussed  at the National Assembly of the People's Government. They were  discussed at every workplace with millions of workers. A  consensus was reached before measures were taken.    We sometimes have difficult tasks. You see this everywhere.  However, I believe the essential key is to persuade the people  and to attain a consensus among the population for every step  taken. This is how our population came to understand the need  for tourism and understands it more and more each day. They  understood the need for the highly touted decriminalization of  dollars and all that.    Our people were brought up in deeply rooted egalitarism, and  anytime anything gave the appearance of privilege it upset them.  For example, if someone has a wealthy relative abroad who sends  things the others did not have, that is still a certain  privilege. Our population had a very deep sense of equality. We  have explained to them that this is necessary, that it helps the  national economy, that it helps those who do not have wealthy  relatives abroad and that somehow what is received makes its way  back to them. That is the argument we used to persuade our  people. I am happy to see how they have come to understand and  to support tourism.    I must also add that I am pleased, very pleased to have had  the opportunity to meet outstanding people such as you.    Thank you, very much. [applause]     "
0,FT942-13530 ,"FT942-13530 _AN-EDYDRABIFT 940425   FT  25 APR 94 / G7 warns Russia to keep economy on tight rein      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor      WASHINGTON   Russia was yesterday given a clear warning from the world's leading industrial nations that it must put into effect tough economic decisions following last week's approval of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) credit from the International Monetary Fund. At a meeting with finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven leading industrial countries, Russian officials were told they must deliver on their promises to reduce the budget deficit to 6.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year from 8 per cent in 1993 and reduce the expansion of credit by the monetary authorities. 'We must now have a decisive implementation of budget and monetary policies' by Russia, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said. According to UK officials, the message was echoed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who said the Russians must keep up their reform policies if they were to obtain more assistance. The G7 discussed the prospect of Russia obtaining debt relief on obligations falling due this year from western creditor countries in the Paris Club. According to Mr Waigel, the Paris Club has offered to continue its 1993 debt rescheduling agreement until a 1994 deal has been agreed. Russia is also expected to begin negotiations with the IMF on a stand-by credit facility that could total Dollars 4bn once it has produced first details of its 1995 budget in the autumn. The G7 ministers were critical of the slow pace at which money passes through the pipeline to reach the ground in Russia, but put much of the blame on obstacles set up by Russia's government. US officials said the report from the G7 team in Moscow seeking to coordinate assistance was 'sobering' and complained that Russian officials even obstructed the delivery of visas to technical experts. 'The Russians were saying many of the right words but it remains to be seen what the deeds will be,' a senior US Treasury official said. 'There's a great deal the Russians can do to move things along,' he added. But G7 ministers also criticised the international financial institutions for not doing enough to use their own money to help the economies of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in their transition to a market economy. A US official said it was important that the IMF and the World Bank 'do all that they prudently can,' noting that the IMF's own cash in proportion to its commitments is at historically high levels. The Russian delegation told the G7 meeting that the government was now ready to tap the World Bank loan proposed last year to help Russian local governments take over some of the social welfare services previously provided by the big state companies. The government had previously been reluctant to use these resources because of doubts about how the loan would be repaid.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.     DEZ  Germany, EC.

When doing this, it is assumed that the reforms' general  orientation toward shifting to a market-type economy will remain  immutable.    It is significant that one part of the analysts support the  above-mentioned changes, considering their implementation to be  almost the only way out of the ""Gaydar blind alley;"" the other  part thinks that such a change in course will be disastrous and  will lead to the downfall of the entire program of market  reforms and, as a result, to the revival of a planned-directive  economy of the Soviet model.    The extremely high level of politicalization in the  appraisals of possible avenues for the future course of reforms  and their detachment from economic logic call attention to  themselves. The political right-wing (LDP [Liberal Democratic  Party], communists, agrarians, and the political forces and  leaders sympathetic to them) is completely and unconditionally  insisting on a sharp change in the course of the reforms whereas  the left-wing (Russia's Choice and the parties siding with it)  are defending the correctness and necessity for continuing the  selected policy.    Let us ask the question: Was the policy of economic reforms  conducted during 1992-1993 really connected with a firm  rejection of state control over the economy in favor of market  self-regulation and the non-interference of the state in  economic processes? There is every reason to answer this  question negatively on the whole.    Let us begin with the fact that even the neoclassical  doctrine of a market economy, which the administration of the  U.S. economy is now following to a significant degree, does not  repudiate the principle of state regulation of the economy and  proceeds from the concept of a mixed economy of the market-state  type. When implementing market reforms in Russia during the last  two years, the government not only listened to the voices of  Western advisers but also took into consideration the specific  nature of the Russian economic situation and the presence of the  Soviet economic system's legacy.    Even the liberalization of prices, which had the strongest  influence on the economy, was practically not carried out using  the shock method but was accompanied and is still being  accompanied by numerous state regulation measures. State prices  were maintained for a long time on products from the fuel and  energy complex, purchase prices for agricultural products  remained under the strong influence of the state, marginal  levels of profitability were established on the prices for  products from enterprise monopolists, extremely low state  regulated prices (tariffs) for apartments and municipal services  still exist, and numerous price subsidies from the federal and  local budgets are being used.    One can argue about the success or failure of the  privatization methods being implemented, including the voucher  version; however, it is difficult to deny the fact that  privatization is being directed by state programs.    Recognizing that the macroeconomic approach has predominated  in the policy followed by the government during the last two  years of reforms, one cannot deny the fact that as soon as  affairs reached mutual nonpayments by enterprises and an acute  shortage of their working capital or the threat of bankruptcy,  the government and Central Bank did not turn enterprises over to  market forces to be torn apart. State management levers were put  into operation on the spot, state assistance was provided, loans  were issued, and credits and even the forgiveness of debts were  implemented although all these measures undermined the state  policy for stabilizing currency circulation. If there had not  been a strong state influence on the economy in Russia during  the 1991-1992 period, not dozens but many thousands of  enterprises would have gone bankrupt and the number of  unemployed would have been not one million but tens of millions.    There is no reason to say that the state released social  processes from its control although individual elements of the  income and distribution regulation used by the state can in no  way be recognized as successful. This primarily concerns the  fact that the state ""forgot"" a great deal about the needs of  science and higher education, released from its control the  processes for an extremely sharp income differentiation, and  moved to the cause not of those who most needed but of those who  were ""a little louder."" At the same time, it is actually clear  that, with the extremely limited state resources and budgetary  capabilities, no method of state regulation permits critical  social problems to be solved. State distribution adds absolutely  nothing to consumer benefits and services which are produced in  the country or purchased abroad.    Much of the criticism addressed to the tax policy being  followed is known; however, hardly anyone dares to declare that  the state is not using tax levers, including the export-import  duty mechanism. The problem here is different: What is the  maximum permissible taxation level, how should the collection of  taxes be guaranteed and is it necessary to pursue a state  protectionist policy through taxes?    Apparently, the rebukes addressed to the government, which  consist of the fact that it has impacted poorly on structural  policy through the regulation of investments, are not devoid of  justification. However, those meager amounts of state  investments, which the government had and has at its disposal,  must be directed against its will to the priority branches and  the critical zones in the economy. Another matter is foreign  investments and the investment assets of enterprises and  entrepreneurs: it is necessary to look for levers having a more  powerful state influence on them.    Without disputing the need for maintaining and even  deepening  state regulation of the economy during periods when it is in a  crisis situation, one must understand at the same time that this  problem is not being solved by a return to directive state  planning and command, bureaucratic and official management  methods. One must look for flexible state regulation forms and  methods that have been adapted to market relations and permit  the organization, responsibility and interest of economic  subjects to be maintained by state influence methods until an  effective competitive mechanism for market self-regulation  exists in the Russian economy.

The special session, called in response to the deteriorating economy, will also review the effect of economic changes implemented over the past eight months. Increasingly concerned about its budget deficit, the government announced a 50 per cent cut in the budget for the armed forces last month, saying the military should 'cost the country as little as possible'. Given the central role of the armed forces in Cuban politics, the reduction is a telling indicator of the nature of the economic problems facing the country, diplomats in Havana said. Introduction of income tax is intended to recapture billions of pesos in circulation which government officials say are being used by Cubans to purchase hard currency. The government announced last year that Cubans were free to hold foreign currency. The assembly debate will effectively be a continuation of the regular session which was held last December. That reviewed the government's more liberal attitude to foreign currency, foreign investment and increasing private and co-operative ownership of farms and a range of small businesses. Since then, however, there have been signs that the island's economy is buckling. Economic problems have worsened over the past three years following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Cuba's main trading partner, and the failure last year of the sugar harvest which caused a shortfall in foreign earnings. The assembly session comes a week after the government reorganised the administration of the economy, creating new ministries and suggesting a move away from central planning on which decisions have been based since the revolution 35 years ago. The government has also adopted a more liberal attitude to exiles. A meeting in Havana last week attended by 200 leaders of exile communities concluded with a decision by the government allow all exiles to return to the island whenever they want. However, Cuban-American leaders in Florida said yesterday they could not accept the invitation because they would be punished by the US government for violating Washington's economic embargo on the island.

In an  interview to ITAR-TASS he said that the discussion of Boris  Yeltsin's message is put by deputies of the upper chamber of  parliament on the agenda of its third meeting that opened on  Thursday.    The main directions of the consolidation of the Russian  state  indicated by the president will undoubtedly have an effect on a  plan of legislative work that the chamber will endorse at its  current meeting, the speaker believes.    In an interview to ITAR-TASS, deputy of the State Duma,  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin said that the presidential  message should be used as the guide for adjusting normal  mechanisms of market relations. Shokhin believes that the state  authorities are capable of doing so.    The problem of Russians who constitute the absolute majority  of the population, 83 per cent, has been raised for the first  time in the presidential message. Commenting on this section of  the message, Russian Minister for Nationalities and Regional  Policy Sergey Shakhray told ITAR-TASS that ""all politicians  should be constantly aware that there is direct relationship  between a sense of well-being of the Russian people and that of  all other peoples in the federation"".    Shakhray said that the forming of the Russian nation should  not be in the imperial spirit, at the expense of the interests  of other peoples. The Russian state is a form of  self-determination of all its ethnic groups with guarantees of  the development of each of them.    Regarding Russians' positions in former union republics,  Shakhray said that Russia has juridical obligations to them,  also under international law. As the successor of the USSR,  Russia must protect citizens under its jurisdiction who live  outside Russian boundaries.    Tatarstan's President Mintimer Shaymiyev believes that  virtually every deputy went along with the Russian president's  message to the Federal Assembly. It is now essential to embark  on its implementation and to continue the economic reforms, he  told ITAR-TASS on Thursday.    Tatarstan's president supported the Russian president's  attitude that decentralisation of russian economy is needed. He  believes that important economic matters should be tackled  locally.     "

It is said that Boris  Yeltsin suffers from cirrhosis of the liver. How is he really?    [Chernomyrdin] Anyone who wants to test Yeltsin's state of  health should play tennis with him. This talk about his  illnesses is simply insulting. The president was on vacation,  during which he relaxed and also went hunting.    [STERN] Meanwhile, rumors of a putsch circulated in Moscow.    [Chernomyrdin] This is nonsense. Someone wants to  destabilize the situation. I do not react to such rumors at  all. Yeltsin is the master of the situation. He will complete  his term of office -- until 1996. Then we will have new  elections.    [STERN] During public appearances, however, Yeltsin looks  sick. And he had to accept the amnesty of his opponents  Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov without being able to  do anything against it. They wanted to overthrow him last  October.    [Chernomyrdin] Once again: Yeltsin is well. Concerning the  amnesty, one can be of different opinions. As quickly as it was  done, it got out of control. Here, too, Yeltsin was supposed to  be presented as someone who no longer holds the reins. This is  not true.    [STERN] The Russians elected communists and right-wing  extremist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy into parliament in December.  Does Russia actually want democracy?    [Chernomyrdin] The Russians do not want to go back to the  past, but a good life does not fall from heaven. One has to  work hard for it. It is the task of my government to establish  the conditions for it. We must find a feasible path in this  labyrinth of reforms. Above all, we need a rule-of-law state  and private property.    [STERN] How dangerous is Zhirinovskiy?    [Chernomyrdin] The people voted for him because their  standard of living is going down. They did not vote for  Zhirinovskiy as a person but against us and our mistakes.    [STERN] Could Zhirinovskiy become president?    [Chernomyrdin] The worse our economy is the greater are  Zhirinovskiy's prospects for success. Regardless of how  Zhirinovskiy is assessed, fascism in Russia does not have a  chance. It is not Zhirinovskiy who is dangerous but the decline  of industrial production. The reforms are making too little  progress.    [STERN] And this is said by the man who is criticized as a  braker of reforms and as an apparachik.    [Chernomyrdin] This is claimed by those who do not know  anything. My task is to make as few mistakes as possible and to  push the reforms ahead quickly.    [STERN] In the West, it is your former Deputy Prime Minister  Yegor Gaydar who is praised as a reformer and not you.    [Chernomyrdin] Gaydar and Boris Fedorov....    [STERN] ...the finance minister who has also resigned...    [Chernomyrdin] ...are not the fathers of the reform. These  guys just like to see themselves in this role. It was and is  Boris Yeltsin who stands for economic reforms. As finance  minister, Fedorov could not decide anything without me and  Yeltsin. Yegor Gaydar was in my cabinet for just three months  last year.    [STERN] As prime minister, you are responsible for the fact  that today, almost one out of three Russians live in poverty.  How do you plan to bring Russia to its feet again?    [Chernomyrdin] I would feel better if there were a simple  answer to that. I pity Russia from the bottom of my heart.  However, there is no standard solution. We cannot simply copy  Germany or the United States or take over something from a  textbook. This is the mistake that many so-called reformers  make. They do not know Russia.    [STERN] But under your leadership, industrial production  declined by 16 percent in 1993.    [Chernomyrdin] Yes, at the moment many companies are idle.  However, things will get even worse: Companies will go  bankrupt. We need that so that our economy can recover. It  takes time to convert the powerful military-industrial complex.  One cannot simply change from tanks to tractors.    [STERN] Russian politicians have already been calling for an  economic state of emergency.    [Chernomyrdin] For me, there is only one way -- market  economy. But we also need industrial policy by the state ---  not a planned economy. As a former head of a corporation, I  know very well what the latter did. Centralism was such that I  felt regularly sick. Going back to that? I do not even dare to  think of that. I cannot decide in Moscow today how a road  should be built in Vladivostok on the Pacific coast. Let the  people think themselves.    [STERN] But the call for a strong hand is getting louder and  louder.    [Chernomyrdin] I, too, am against chaos. By the way, market  economy does not mean chaos. The people in our country have  always been ruled by a strong hand. First Father Tsar, then the  communists. For many people that was easy: There was no need  to think. It is impossible to change people overnight in such a  way that they are suddenly suitable for the market economy.    [STERN] The legacy of the command economy....    [Chernomyrdin] Let us take the example of Germany. It is  not enough that the east German changes from a Trabant car to a  Mercedes. He is still different from a west German. He works  differently. When work is over at six in the evening, some of  them drop what they are doing and go to a bar.    [STERN] Germany is facing Bundestag elections. What would a  change in government from Kohl to a Social Democrat mean for you?    [Chernomyrdin] The German people, whom I value very highly,  will make the right choice. I respect Mr. Kohl very much.  Personally, I would welcome it if he remained chancellor.""    [STERN] Does your reform policy meet with sufficient support  in the West?    [Chernomyrdin] We were promised $24 billion....    [STERN] ...at the international economic summit in Munich in  1992....    [Chernomyrdin] ...and if we had received this money, we  would not have suffered such a slump. Then reforms would have  been easier. All these Western promises of the past years were  not fulfilled. The Russian people know that. But we are no  beggars. We are equal partners because our country has enormous  resources.    [STERN] Should Germany help with even more than 80 billion  marks.    [Chernomyrdin] Germany is the key country for us. The  Germans understand us best. But they are not investing enough.  I appeal to German entrepreneurs: Do not be afraid of  investing in Russia. We have gotten through the worst. One can  earn good money in our country....    [STERN] ...and lose it. Anyone who invests here must bribe  the corrupt bureaucracy and pay protection money to the Mafia.    [Chernomyrdin] This is a big problem. We need extremely  tough measures against crime. There must finally be order, just  as in Germany.    [STERN] Do you actually still have hope for Russia?    [Chernomyrdin] Certainly. Nevertheless, I do not understand  at all why so many people want to become prime minister.  Sometimes my life seems to be an absolute nightmare. My  biggest worry is that time is running out. I am confident, I do  not sway.     "

The administration to be headed by Frei is analyzing the  possibilities of resuming diplomatic relations with Cuba.    Since 19 July 1991, Chile and Cuba have had diplomatic  relations only at the level of consulates.    Some Chilean entrepreneurs already are doing businesses in  Cuba.

The Agrarian Crisis Will Continue Unless the Government Attitude  Toward Rural Areas Changes""]    [Text] Agrarian reforms have been under way for three years  in Russia. It is now possible to sum up certain results and look  to the future. But first--about their initial base.    It is known that the Russian Federation had exaggerated  specialization of the national economy. By 1989 the branches of  group A here (the military-industrial, fuel-energy,  metallurgical, machine building, and chemical-timber complexes)  accounted for more than 70 percent of the gross national  product. Immense quantities of their output went to other  republics and CEMA countries, and also to the West. The share of  the agro-industrial complex was only 15.2 percent. For  comparison: in the Baltic countries it exceeded 50 percent. And  about two-thirds of what was produced was consumed locally.    The center did not devote the proper attention to Russian  agriculture. Farms of Russia received less in capital  investments, fertilizers, technical equipment, manufactured  concentrated feeds, construction materials, and energy resources  per 100 hectares of arable land. The capital availability for  agriculture in Russia, for example, was 12 times less than in  the Baltic region. The disparity was just as great in the levels  of land reclamation (88.5 percent in Lithuania and 6.2 percent  in the RSFSR), the provision of natural gas, and social  structuring of the rural areas. For this reason there were more  and more ghost towns that had lost their able-bodied population.  The demographic crisis became irreversible in a number of  regions. And the demand for food products in Russia was covered  through three sources: its own production, deliveries from Union  republics, and imports. The last two items provided for more  than a third of all the consumption.    Such were the starting conditions for the agrarian reforms.  It seems that because of these, the collapse of the Union and  previous ties dealt an especially painful blow to the food  supply for Russians. Well, one learns from one's mistakes. Of  course it would be better to learn from others'. But since this  is the way it has turned out....    In other words, it is necessary to restructure the entire  economy, assigning a larger role in it to the agro-industrial  complex. But it seems that once again life has not taught us a  thing. The share of the agro-industrial complex in the national  economy not only is not growing, but is rapidly decreasing. And  it is not difficult to guess the result: a rapid collapse of  production. In terms of per capita consumption of meat and milk,  we have dropped back to the 1965 level. The number of Russians  is decreasing. In 1992 the natural attrition amounted to only  200,000 people, while the preliminary estimate for this year was  about 600,000.    And still today there is not even the smallest significant  social group of the population that would be against the  reforms. Debates about how to conduct them are another matter.  Throughout the year, over 500 days, or according to the Stolypin  method: ""Leave me alone for 20 years and I will make Russia  prosperous""?    During three years of reforms, about 170 million hectares of  arable land have been turned over to the ownership of  agricultural commodity producers. A multiple-system economy is  being created. Hundreds of thousands of peasant farms have been  registered. Millions of city dwellers have received garden plots  and orchards, and land is being allotted for residential  buildings. The system of administration is changing. There is no  longer the previous dictatorship from the center. What to plant,  what production structure to have, how to use profit--these  things are being decided by the people themselves. This is good.    The only problem is that the rural areas are continuing to  decline from day to day. And one cannot agree with those who  justify this rapid collapse. They say that it is necessary to  pay for the reforms. The experience of other countries does not  confirm this. In China during 12 years of reforms, the gross  agricultural output increased 2.2-fold, meat  production--3.7-fold, fish production--2.8-fold, and sugar  production--3.5-fold. These reforms were based not on  ideological but on economic principles. The Chinese say: ""The  color of the cat makes no difference as long as it catches mice.""    Instead of having a clear-cut concept of our own, we are  inclined to borrow others' models. Hastiness in the development  of legislative and normative documents and standard formulas for  reform of all of the immense area of Russia without preliminary  checking in various regions has led to mistakes and pro forma  actions.    One of them was the attempt to solve the food problem solely  through deep reformation and change in the forms of ownership  and management. We must be realistic. This alone will not  stabilize production or increase its effectiveness. Especially  when deliveries of technical equipment, fertilizers, and  construction materials to agriculture are being catastrophically  reduced. When procurement prices for agricultural products are  growing much more slowly than the prices of industrial products  for rural areas. Because of the lack of equivalence in exchange,  rural areas are failing to receive hundreds of billions of  rubles.    With the destruction of the state procurement system,  numerous middlemen and speculators attach themselves to rural  commodity producers like barnacles on an old ship. Rural  residents sell their goods for three to five times less than we  buy them for in the stores. As we can see, it is by no means the  agricultural workers who are to blame for the high retail prices.    Because of the impoverishment of the masses, even the  significantly curtailed production remains largely unconsumed.  In many regions of Russia, an immense quantity of butter, meat,  grain, and potatoes has accumulated in the warehouses. At the  same time, the state continues to buy them abroad at higher  prices.    The government is ripping off the rural residents, forcing  them to sell grain at prices set from above without paying for  it. At the same time, peasants today have to pay in advance for  every nail, while for products that are produced the prime  minister is promising that by the new year a maximum of 80  percent of the debt of more than 2 trillion will be paid. By  that time the ruble will be worth even less.    In the past the peasantry took on the job of accelerated  industrialization and restoration of the national economy  destroyed by the war. Today an attempt is being made to make it  responsible for emerging from the financial crisis. But even  Adam Smith said that the country gives the city exactly the same  amount as the city gives the country. High prices of industrial  goods and high taxes have sharply reduced investment activity  and have blocked structural changes in the agro-industrial  complex which are necessary for the formation of a market. And  this predetermines the long-term tendencies toward decline of  production.    The already weak social sphere of the rural areas is being  destroyed. But perhaps the most terrible thing is the  degradation of the production and scientific-technical potential  and the fertility of the soil. The gene pool of the animals,  breeding work, and seed growing are being destroyed, and  production construction has been reduced many times over. Fixed  capital is aging, and the load per tractor and combine is  increasing. Capacities and work force are engaged in repair of  machines and equipment just as they are in agricultural machine  building. A process of physical disintegration of productive  forces has begun, and the demand for scientific and technical  products is decreasing.    Nonetheless, the state refuses to grant subsidies to  agriculture. Although in the West, even with a surplus of  foodstuffs, the governments grant immense subsidies to the  farmers. Incidentally, in developed countries, approximately  half of the increase in production of food products comes  through technical progress.    Government leaders justify their policy with respect to  agriculture by saying that the state has no funds. Although it  is known that the enterprises and citizens pay immense taxes.  Prices, apartment rents, and the costs of other services have  increased many times over. Energy resources, timber, and metal  are being exported in considerable quantities to nearby and  distant foreign countries.    There are many holes. They include the bloated state  apparatus, which has occupied not only all republic buildings,  but also the buildings of the former Union ministries and  departments. Numerous bureaucrats of the state apparatus are  receiving wages that are several times higher than those of  world-renowned scientists.    Today a large proportion of the members of government,  especially deputy prime ministers, are bending over  backwards--they travel through foreign countries trying to scare  up a billion and a half or two billion dollars in credit. At the  same time, with the help of their own government, funds of  Russian entrepreneurs amounting to more than $20 billion a year  are sitting in Western banks. Creating an economic mechanism  that would make it possible to motivate our entrepreneurs to  invest this money in Russia's economy--this is what our  government should be working on.    And another large financial source would be to demand  repayment of debts from republics of the former Union. After the  proclamation of sovereignty by the parliament of Russia in 1990,  there was the hope that we would become the masters of our own  wealth, that we would develop the economy on the basis of our  own advantage and determine an efficient specialization. Then  the peoples of the former Union would know who is who. Because  relations among independent states should be arranged on an  equivalent basis and their well-being should be made directly  dependent on labor productivity and the generation of capital as  the basis of social justice. After all, it is known that of all  the republics of the former USSR, only Russia previously had a  positive balance in interrepublic exchange, and in 1989 it was  more than $50 billion.    Alas, Russia is continuing to supply its neighbors with  energy sources, raw materials, and processed materials at  extremely low prices. Because of the differences in prices  (world and transfer) it annually loses $17 billion.    With this kind of state foreign economic policy, where are  we  supposed to get the money to repay our debts to rural workers?  Here it is necessary to resort to deception or, rather, get  involved in the state rackets with respect to our peasants.  Because we are not used to paying them their due. At the end of  the 1920's, Stalin spoke about tribute from the rural areas as a  temporary measure.

The Agrarian Crisis Will Continue Unless the Government Attitude  Toward Rural Areas Changes""]    [Text] Agrarian reforms have been under way for three years  in Russia. It is now possible to sum up certain results and look  to the future. But first--about their initial base.    It is known that the Russian Federation had exaggerated  specialization of the national economy. By 1989 the branches of  group A here (the military-industrial, fuel-energy,  metallurgical, machine building, and chemical-timber complexes)  accounted for more than 70 percent of the gross national  product. Immense quantities of their output went to other  republics and CEMA countries, and also to the West. The share of  the agro-industrial complex was only 15.2 percent. For  comparison: in the Baltic countries it exceeded 50 percent. And  about two-thirds of what was produced was consumed locally.    The center did not devote the proper attention to Russian  agriculture. Farms of Russia received less in capital  investments, fertilizers, technical equipment, manufactured  concentrated feeds, construction materials, and energy resources  per 100 hectares of arable land. The capital availability for  agriculture in Russia, for example, was 12 times less than in  the Baltic region. The disparity was just as great in the levels  of land reclamation (88.5 percent in Lithuania and 6.2 percent  in the RSFSR), the provision of natural gas, and social  structuring of the rural areas. For this reason there were more  and more ghost towns that had lost their able-bodied population.  The demographic crisis became irreversible in a number of  regions. And the demand for food products in Russia was covered  through three sources: its own production, deliveries from Union  republics, and imports. The last two items provided for more  than a third of all the consumption.    Such were the starting conditions for the agrarian reforms.  It seems that because of these, the collapse of the Union and  previous ties dealt an especially painful blow to the food  supply for Russians. Well, one learns from one's mistakes. Of  course it would be better to learn from others'. But since this  is the way it has turned out....    In other words, it is necessary to restructure the entire  economy, assigning a larger role in it to the agro-industrial  complex. But it seems that once again life has not taught us a  thing. The share of the agro-industrial complex in the national  economy not only is not growing, but is rapidly decreasing. And  it is not difficult to guess the result: a rapid collapse of  production. In terms of per capita consumption of meat and milk,  we have dropped back to the 1965 level. The number of Russians  is decreasing. In 1992 the natural attrition amounted to only  200,000 people, while the preliminary estimate for this year was  about 600,000.    And still today there is not even the smallest significant  social group of the population that would be against the  reforms. Debates about how to conduct them are another matter.  Throughout the year, over 500 days, or according to the Stolypin  method: ""Leave me alone for 20 years and I will make Russia  prosperous""?    During three years of reforms, about 170 million hectares of  arable land have been turned over to the ownership of  agricultural commodity producers. A multiple-system economy is  being created. Hundreds of thousands of peasant farms have been  registered. Millions of city dwellers have received garden plots  and orchards, and land is being allotted for residential  buildings. The system of administration is changing. There is no  longer the previous dictatorship from the center. What to plant,  what production structure to have, how to use profit--these  things are being decided by the people themselves. This is good.    The only problem is that the rural areas are continuing to  decline from day to day. And one cannot agree with those who  justify this rapid collapse. They say that it is necessary to  pay for the reforms. The experience of other countries does not  confirm this. In China during 12 years of reforms, the gross  agricultural output increased 2.2-fold, meat  production--3.7-fold, fish production--2.8-fold, and sugar  production--3.5-fold. These reforms were based not on  ideological but on economic principles. The Chinese say: ""The  color of the cat makes no difference as long as it catches mice.""    Instead of having a clear-cut concept of our own, we are  inclined to borrow others' models. Hastiness in the development  of legislative and normative documents and standard formulas for  reform of all of the immense area of Russia without preliminary  checking in various regions has led to mistakes and pro forma  actions.    One of them was the attempt to solve the food problem solely  through deep reformation and change in the forms of ownership  and management. We must be realistic. This alone will not  stabilize production or increase its effectiveness. Especially  when deliveries of technical equipment, fertilizers, and  construction materials to agriculture are being catastrophically  reduced. When procurement prices for agricultural products are  growing much more slowly than the prices of industrial products  for rural areas. Because of the lack of equivalence in exchange,  rural areas are failing to receive hundreds of billions of  rubles.    With the destruction of the state procurement system,  numerous middlemen and speculators attach themselves to rural  commodity producers like barnacles on an old ship. Rural  residents sell their goods for three to five times less than we  buy them for in the stores. As we can see, it is by no means the  agricultural workers who are to blame for the high retail prices.    Because of the impoverishment of the masses, even the  significantly curtailed production remains largely unconsumed.  In many regions of Russia, an immense quantity of butter, meat,  grain, and potatoes has accumulated in the warehouses. At the  same time, the state continues to buy them abroad at higher  prices.    The government is ripping off the rural residents, forcing  them to sell grain at prices set from above without paying for  it. At the same time, peasants today have to pay in advance for  every nail, while for products that are produced the prime  minister is promising that by the new year a maximum of 80  percent of the debt of more than 2 trillion will be paid. By  that time the ruble will be worth even less.    In the past the peasantry took on the job of accelerated  industrialization and restoration of the national economy  destroyed by the war. Today an attempt is being made to make it  responsible for emerging from the financial crisis. But even  Adam Smith said that the country gives the city exactly the same  amount as the city gives the country. High prices of industrial  goods and high taxes have sharply reduced investment activity  and have blocked structural changes in the agro-industrial  complex which are necessary for the formation of a market. And  this predetermines the long-term tendencies toward decline of  production.    The already weak social sphere of the rural areas is being  destroyed. But perhaps the most terrible thing is the  degradation of the production and scientific-technical potential  and the fertility of the soil. The gene pool of the animals,  breeding work, and seed growing are being destroyed, and  production construction has been reduced many times over. Fixed  capital is aging, and the load per tractor and combine is  increasing. Capacities and work force are engaged in repair of  machines and equipment just as they are in agricultural machine  building. A process of physical disintegration of productive  forces has begun, and the demand for scientific and technical  products is decreasing.    Nonetheless, the state refuses to grant subsidies to  agriculture. Although in the West, even with a surplus of  foodstuffs, the governments grant immense subsidies to the  farmers. Incidentally, in developed countries, approximately  half of the increase in production of food products comes  through technical progress.    Government leaders justify their policy with respect to  agriculture by saying that the state has no funds. Although it  is known that the enterprises and citizens pay immense taxes.  Prices, apartment rents, and the costs of other services have  increased many times over. Energy resources, timber, and metal  are being exported in considerable quantities to nearby and  distant foreign countries.    There are many holes. They include the bloated state  apparatus, which has occupied not only all republic buildings,  but also the buildings of the former Union ministries and  departments. Numerous bureaucrats of the state apparatus are  receiving wages that are several times higher than those of  world-renowned scientists.    Today a large proportion of the members of government,  especially deputy prime ministers, are bending over  backwards--they travel through foreign countries trying to scare  up a billion and a half or two billion dollars in credit. At the  same time, with the help of their own government, funds of  Russian entrepreneurs amounting to more than $20 billion a year  are sitting in Western banks. Creating an economic mechanism  that would make it possible to motivate our entrepreneurs to  invest this money in Russia's economy--this is what our  government should be working on.    And another large financial source would be to demand  repayment of debts from republics of the former Union. After the  proclamation of sovereignty by the parliament of Russia in 1990,  there was the hope that we would become the masters of our own  wealth, that we would develop the economy on the basis of our  own advantage and determine an efficient specialization. Then  the peoples of the former Union would know who is who. Because  relations among independent states should be arranged on an  equivalent basis and their well-being should be made directly  dependent on labor productivity and the generation of capital as  the basis of social justice. After all, it is known that of all  the republics of the former USSR, only Russia previously had a  positive balance in interrepublic exchange, and in 1989 it was  more than $50 billion.    Alas, Russia is continuing to supply its neighbors with  energy sources, raw materials, and processed materials at  extremely low prices. Because of the differences in prices  (world and transfer) it annually loses $17 billion.    With this kind of state foreign economic policy, where are  we  supposed to get the money to repay our debts to rural workers?  Here it is necessary to resort to deception or, rather, get  involved in the state rackets with respect to our peasants.  Because we are not used to paying them their due. At the end of  the 1920's, Stalin spoke about tribute from the rural areas as a  temporary measure. Today this is considered to be an ordinary  phenomenon: the peasant can be patient a little longer for the  sake of the reforms. He has already been patient for 75 years!    The agrarian crisis will continue unless the attitude toward  it changes.    Do not neglect the disease, esteemed state leaders!     "

[Begin recording] [Ross] At the moment, the efforts being  made by Cuban workers are the highest expression of patriotism.  We are in the trenches, where we should be, and without  expecting immediate material benefits. To those workers,  especially the women, who get up early in the morning to take  their children to the infant circle by bicycle, then go to work,  to return home later and employ magic in preparing the family's  food -- to those workers we express our deepest recognition.    [Rumbao] The 55th anniversary of the CTC will be marked by  the labor union assemblies known as the workers parliaments: an  example of what the workers democracy can do when united to save  the achievements of the Revolution.    [Ross] This is a great process. In fact, I can say that I am  very satisfied with the assemblies I have attended. So far I  have participated in ten assemblies since the process began. I  believe they have all been the quintessence of what we expected.    [Rumbao] Ross pointed out that more than 3 million workers  and 1 million retired workers have been invited for February and  half of March to participate, with their ideas and actions, in  the solution our parliament will establish during its next  session.

Two plants supply the capital, the Mario Fortuni Plant,  which  operates with French technology, and the so-called Melones  plant, which was purchased in the United States at the turn of  the century. Jointly, they produce a little bit over 400,000  cubic meters of manufactured gas, a volume far below the current  demand.    Although other factors are involved, four have essentially  caused a production deficit in that industry: a tank out of  service due to necessary repairs; lack of number 40 gas because  the Nico Lopez Refinery closed down; damage in one of the Mario  Fortuni Plant's lines; and a failure in its hydraulic system due  to low-quality rubber gaskets.    [Begin recording] [Engineer Flora Elena Mesa] Repairs  disrupt  our service because although we can manufacture gas at night, we  need to stop once the storage tanks are full -- we have nowhere  else to store the gas -- and the next day we have less gas  available to provide this service to the population.    Regarding the rubber gaskets problem, some of the gaskets  lasted three, six, and even 12 months -- for example the  (Clavier) gaskets -- yet these last only a week, 15 days,  sometimes hours. This results in constant breakdowns, and we  have to stop the plant to solve the problem.    This line should have been repaired by now. Its  effectiveness  has decreased; its efficiency is not the same and it has lower  production.    The lack of number 40 gas... [pauses] like I said, the Nino  Lopez Refinery's catalytic cracking plant, the one that produces  liquefied gas, is undergoing general repairs. Consequently, we  cannot receive the number 40 gas, which represents an important  support in our production.    [Unidentified Reporter] When do you think the gas service  can  be restored?    [Mesa] The situation cannot change in the near future  because  the gasket problem has not been solved, and the gasometer is  still out of service. The gas situation will improve next month.  [end recording]    [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at  0000 GMT on 17 June reports in its ""NTV"" newscast that the  Melones Plant tank, which can store 70,000 cubic meters of  manufactured gas, has been repaired so Havana's manufactured gas  enterprise will now be able to store more gas to supply the  population.]     "

Clinton, having met together in Moscow from  January 12- 15, 1994, reaffirmed the fundamental importance of  Russian-U.S. cooperation based upon the Charter of  Russian-American Partnership and Friendship, the Vancouver  Declaration, and existing treaties and agreements. They noted  with satisfaction that the relationship between Russia and the  United States has entered a new stage of mature strategic  partnership based on equality, mutual advantage, and recognition  of each other's national interests. From this perspective, they  reviewed the full range of bilateral and international issues.    The two presidents had an extensive discussion of security  issues, including arms reduction and non-proliferation regimes.  They agreed upon the need to strengthen those regimes and to  create, together with other interested states, a new mechanism  to enhance transparency and responsibility in the transfer of  conventional arms and sensitive dual use technologies. They  also strongly supported completion of negotiations on a  comprehensive test ban at the earliest possible time. The two  presidents reiterated their support for a cutoff of production  of fissile materials for weapons and considered new measures to  strengthen strategic stability.    Based on ongoing discussions of strategic disengagement  measures between the Ministries of Defense of the two countries,  the presidents announced that they would direct the detargeting  of strategic nuclear missiles under their respective commands so  that by not later than May 30, 1994 those missiles will not be  targeted. Thus, for the first time in nearly half a century --  virtually since the dawn of the nuclear age -- Russia and United  States will not operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner  that presumes they are adversaries.    Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton expressed  satisfaction with the accelerating development of a wide range  of economic, scientific and technological relationships between  Russia and the United States. They also reaffirmed their strong  support for the rapid growth of bilateral trade and investment  as a special priority. In their view, the Gore-Chernomyrdin  Commission has become a dynamic and effective mechanism for  coordination and expansion of Russian-U.S. cooperation. A key  expression of this relationship is the Russian-U.S. joint  cooperation in space, especially their partnership, with other  interested parties, in the construction of a space station.    The two presidents reaffirmed their readiness to move  forward  on the path of openness and mutual trust in Russian-U.S.  relations and to create favorable conditions for the  comprehensive development of political, commercial, humanitarian  and people-to-people contacts between the two countries. In  this connection, a mutual interest in enlarging consular  presence on each other's territory was expressed. In particular,  the American side intends to open a consulate general in  Yekaterinburg in February 1994.    With the approval by the U.S. Congress of NAFTA [North  American Free Trade Agreement] and the successful completion of  the Uruguay round of global trade negotiations, President  Yeltsin and President Clinton welcomed the accelerating progress  toward creation of an open and prosperous world economy and  trading system. President Yeltsin informed President Clinton of  recent steps among the member-states of the Commonwealth of  Independent States towards increased economic coordination and  cooperation. The two presidents agreed that such initiatives,  pursued in an open and voluntary manner consistent with GATT  rules and procedures, should be conducive to the rapid inclusion  of all the participating states into the global economy.    In this context, President Yeltsin and President Clinton  exchanged views on the economic strategies of their respective  governments. President Yeltsin described the economic situation  in Russia. He affirmed the irreversibility of Russia's  transition to a market economy and his intention to further  promote reforms and to address social needs associated with this  transition. President Clinton stressed his strong support for  Russian reform and suggested that social issues could be a new  and promising area for cooperation.    President Yeltsin and President Clinton noted with  satisfaction that the end of the Cold War has brought continuous  progress toward overcoming the division of the European  continent and opened the way for broad cooperation among  European states on a new agenda of urgent tasks, with priority  being given to preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping and protection  of human rights and the rights of national and other minorities.  In this connection, the two presidents welcomed the decisions  of the CSCE foreign ministers' meeting in Rome, which they  consider to be an important step in making the CSCE a key  mechanism of international cooperation in Europe.    Proceeding from the conviction that new divisions of Europe  must be avoided, President Yeltsin and President Clinton agreed  upon the need to create a new European security order that is  inclusive, non-discriminatory and focused on practical political  and security cooperation. The two presidents agreed that the  concept of the Partnership for Peace adopted at the Brussels  meeting of the NATO member states is an important element of an  emerging new European security architecture. President Yeltsin  informed President Clinton of Russia's intention to participate  actively in the partnership for peace and to conclude  substantive agreements opening the way for broad and intensive  cooperation between Russia and NATO as a partner. Taking into  account Russia's international role, President Clinton welcomed  the prospect of Russia's active participation in the Partnership  for Peace.    The two presidents condemned aggressive nationalism,  violations of human rights, and religious intolerance of any  kind, including anti-Semitism. They expressed serious concern  about the existence and potential for intensification of  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and in a number of the new  independent states of the former Soviet Union. President  Yeltsin apprised President Clinton of the peacekeeping efforts  undertaken by Russia on the territory of the former USSR. The  two presidents are determined to intensify the coordination of  their efforts, within the framework of the United Nations and  the CSCE, to promote rapid and peaceful resolution of conflicts  on conditions that correspond to generally accepted standards of  international law, including respect for the independence,  sovereignty, and existing borders of the new independent states  of the former Soviet Union.    The two presidents reaffirmed the support of Russia and the  United States for the United Nations. They will act with other  countries to strengthen the potential of the UN to support and  establish peace and to prevent conflicts. The two sides will  work out practical activities among themselves and other  countries to improve preparation for participation in UN  peacekeeping operations. In connection with the upcoming 50th  anniversary of the UN, Presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin  consider it important to convene at the appropriate time a  meeting of the heads of state and government of the members of  the UN Security Council for a review of the work established for  the UN at the January 1992 Security Council summit and an  examination of tasks for the future.    President Yeltsin and President Clinton are convinced that  the United States and Russia will continue to consolidate their  partnership and together promote global stability, peace, and  prosperity.

It recalls that the sugar industry represents the main  source  of income for the island and that it is also ""the measure of the  nation's pulse, a crucial parameter on which all eyes are  directed, with or without reason, to make a diagnosis"" of the  current economic situation.    The production goals for this harvest, which does not end  until June, only exceeds by several hundred thousand tons the  previous harvest of 4.2 million tons, the second smallest in the  past 30 years, according to the CTC.    It also considers the effect the drop in sugar production in  1993 may have had, both on the island and abroad. This  repercussion was even more intense than the fact that in the  same year importations were reduced by a little more than 70  percent compared to 1989.    The last sugar harvest netted $700 million, $450 million  less  than in previous years.    ""To produce more sugar than last year and not leave a single  sugarcane unprocessed is a task that demands unlimited heroism  and stoicism,"" the weekly states.    Among the negative factors it cites during this harvest are  a  lack of tires, batteries, and all kinds of spare parts for the  harvest, transportation, and the selfsame industry [propia  industria], a lack of electricity, and an irregular rain pattern.    The weekly notes industry and harvest workers have not been  wearing appropriate clothes or shoes, and their food intake has  been far below that received in other years to carry out their  work.    It also notes that in May and June efforts were concentrated  not only in cutting and milling but also in the harvest in order  to increase sugarcane production levels to those of several  years ago when results exceeded 8 million tons.

He said: ""We are not the ones experiencing the greatest  difficulties. Cuba is not only interested in resolving its own  problems, but it is also interested in devising common  strategies for cooperation among all the members of AOSIS  [Alliance of Small Insular States], which includes the small  islands of the Caribbean, the Atlantic and the Indian Oceans,  the Mediterranean, and Oceania.    The Cuban foreign minister is one of the participants in the  high-level sessions of the First World Conference on the  Sustainable Development of Small Island States, which is being  held in Bridgetown.    Robaina believes the presence here of a high-level Cuban  delegation headed by President Fidel Castro and also including  Ricardo Alarcon, president of the Cuban parliament, and Minister  Rosa Elena Simeon, represents a continuation of the policy Cuba  maintains toward the Caribbean and the rest of the island states.    He added: ""Cuba has the commitment of honor of joining  efforts with small island states threatened by natural  catastrophes as well as by a hostile economic environment.

Cuba has significantly contributed to the various seminars  of  the governmental meeting and to the parallel meetings held by  the Nongovernment Organizations [NGO].    At these meetings, Cuban delegates will speak about measures  to combat natural disasters, technology for sugar-industry  byproducts, the maintenance of agricultural production, and  environmental protection and biodiversity.    At the conclusion of yesterday's NGO session, the  representatives recommended to the chiefs of state in charge of  ratifying the Barbados Declaration that they include in it a  call to the United States to obey the UN resolution that demands  the lifting of the economic blockade on Cuba.

The new rules do not release Cuba's estimated Dollars 80m share of earlier telecommunications revenues, frozen in an escrow account in New York, but they allow Cuba to receive half of future telephone revenues. Cuban exiles are allowed to make small remittances to relatives in Cuba, but other dollar transfers to the island are banned by the US. The relaxation of rules for telephone services was authorised by US legislation last year that otherwise sought to tighten the US embargo against Cuba by extending restrictions to the foreign subsidiaries of US companies. This was hotly contested by foreign countries, including the UK, as an unwarranted extension of US jurisdiction. Cuban exiles in the US, including those who otherwise oppose any thaw in relations with the Castro government, strongly favour improved telephone links. Telephone links with Cuba have always been difficult, but became even more so after Hurricane Andrew last year knocked out ATT's transmission towers in south Florida. It is not clear whether Cuba, which has insisted on receiving its money from escrow, will accept the proposal, but its increasingly desperate need for foreign exchange may well cause it to settle for the offer under the new rules.

The foreign minister said  that on several occasions the so-called protection of Russians'  rights had been mentioned, and these are not the generally  accepted human rights that are the case here but the rights of  Russians. A threatening voice was used repeatedly in the course  of the speech, firm and tough action was promised in protection  of those rights. Russia did not make a reference to  international law. Instead, she takes the liberty to interfere  in the domestic affairs of others whenever she sees fit.    Luik is worried about the Russian president's (?statement)  that regarding relations with the West there have been  concessions made unilaterally, [word indistinct] in respect of  the state budget. It seems that the idea of dismantling the  totalitarian war machine has been abandoned and it is considered  important to restore it.    [Words indistinct] that part of the speech devoted to  Europe.  The impression is that there is no desire to accept the  standards that exist in Europe; instead, there is a desire to  rework them. Such an approach is incomprehensible to Estonia.  Estonia is fully satisfied with a Europe based on a market  economy and a policy of consensus. It emerges quite clearly  what Russia's interests are. It remains completely unclear,  though, how Russia plans to consider other countries' interests,  said Foreign Minister Luik.     "

EL DIA affirms in an editorial column that the Mexican  president's visit to Cuba confirms Mexico's right to expand its  international relations and exercise its sovereignty to  establish or strengthen its relations with every country of the  world. The article adds that Mexico's position illustrates that  we are not willing to bend under the United States' intervention  policy. It also states that the U.S. trade embargo against the  island and the so-called Torricelli Bill can only be the  brainchild of ""a government that lives in a barbaric era,  ignoring law and morality.""    In addressing U.S. Congressman Robert Torricelli's visit to  this country, EL DIA affirms that the legislator was sent home  with nothing to tell. ""He went home empty-handed and full of  resentment."" The same paper, in a front-page story, highlights  the SELA resolution approved here yesterday protesting the U.S.  blockade against Cuba.    It also publishes a letter from the group known as Let's Go  for Cuba praising the gesture made by Mexican legislators of all  parties to donate one day's pay to purchase crude oil for the  island. The letter announced that the group will cast off with  the ""third solidarity shipment"" to Cuba at the end of this month.    The newspaper LA JORNADA carries a front-page headline that  says ""SELA Calls for Lifting of Blockade Against Cuba"" and an  editorial column on the resolution the organization issued  against the U.S. trade embargo on the island. According to the  daily, SELA spoke out clearly against Washington's measure.  Furthermore, says the editorial, the organization's decision to  protest the blockade ""constitutes recognition of its blatant  inappropriateness and its undeniable interventionist nature.""  It stresses that the step taken by SELA morally discredits the  blockade's validity, while it rallies 27 American nations around  an issue that has been the reason for conflict since 1962.    Mexico's daily EXCELSIOR also devoted a portion of its front  page to the organization's decision, with a headline reading  ""SELA Demands That the United States Lift the Trade Embargo  Against Cuba.""

During an analysis of the current harvest in three eastern  provinces, Lage, who is also member of the Politburo of the  Communist Party of Cuba, said that the final stage of this  harvest (extended until June in certain regions of the island)  demands great determination and strength from all workers,  according to GRANMA.    ""As never before, we need to meet our sugar production  target  [comprometida],"" said Lage, who referred to the serious and  costly limitations imposed by a lack of certain basic inputs,  including spare parts for sugar harvest machinery, such as cane  harvester-loaders [combinadas caneras y alzadoras].    After explaining the causes for the reduction in electricity  production in the country, he urged technicians, specialists,  and leaders of the sector to seek local alternatives and  solutions to maintain, even under the worst of conditions, an  acceptable supply of sugar cane for the industry.    Cuba last year registered low sugar production (4.2 million  tons) due to weather conditions and other problems, and is  intent on increasing production to market and barter it abroad  for multiple material resources that are indispensable to  improving the economy.

President  Rawlings received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina at the  Presidential Palace. During the meeting, Rawlings said that his  government still has much to do for Cuba because we must, in  some way, thank Cuba for what it has done for Africa. Ghana has  never hidden its appreciation for all that the Cuban Government  has done for us, President Rawlings told Foreign Minister  Robaina who has just concluded a two-day visit to Ghana.

Rawlings also expressed his  willingness to develop bilateral cooperation in the field of  health.    At the conclusion of his two-day trip to Accra, Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina thanked Ghana for its support of the  island at international fora, particularly at the United  Nations. The head of Cuban diplomacy also thanked Ghana for its  position on issues such as the economic blockade imposed by the  U.S. Government more than 30 years ago. After describing 1993  as the most difficult year for the Cuban Revolution, Robaina  predicted that 1994 will represent the beginning of an ascending  curve for his people. Robaina said that among Cuba's foreign  policy priorities are the democratization of the United Nations  and the strengthening of the role played by the nonaligned  countries.     "

Shushkevich met with the staff of our  newspaper and answered numerous questions. Mr. Shuskevich  concentrated on the issue of creating the ruble zone. What is  his assessment of this move by the Belarusian parliament? What  implications will it have for Belarusian citizens? When should  the unification be expected? Here is what Stanislav Shushkevich  told journalists.    [Shushkevich] I abstained from voting on the issue of  unification of the monetary systems because this is not the only  way to solve this problem. Even when Russia, for political  reasons, accepts the losses it would incur by the merger, our  life will continue to depend on the way we manage our economy.  No one is going to take care of us all the time. But what  kinds of situations might this move create? For example,  salaries may not be paid out because a Russian bank did not  release the cash. (Incidentally, it would be a wise thing to do  -- one should shrewdly conduct business.) Thus, all this can  give rise to populist politicians who want to capitalize on this  move. Let us see what advantages it will bring for the  Belarusian economy? Take our tractor plant, for instance.  Suppose the price for one tractor is about 1 million Russian  rubles [R]. For this money, the plant can receive 4 million  ""hares"" [nickname for Belarusian national currency] at the  official exchange rate. The purchasing power of our currency,  as far as foodstuffs are concerned, is almost the same as that  of the Russian ruble. So what do we get? A rank-and-file  worker gains by exchanging the ""hare"" for the ruble. However,  it is like a shot out of the blue for the manager of the tractor  plant. Now, with the plant's funds in Russia, he is able to  settle there accounts for raw materials and components, while  here he has to pay using the one-to-four exchange rate.    By the way, Fedorov and Gerashchenko no longer have anything  against this idea. Only their deputies continue to press for  the one-to-two rate. A political decision certainly depends on  Russia's highest leadership.    I believe that different prices for energy sources is the  key  issue in our relations with Russia today. This undermines our  economy. Experts estimate that energy consumption accounts for  4 percent of the production cost of the world's best tractors.  The figure for Belarusian tractors is almost twice as big. If  this tendency continues, energy consumption might jump to 15  percent this year. In this case, we will pay 40 ECU more for  oil than Russia, greatly reducing the competitiveness of our  products. This puts our economy at the edge of an abyss.    Among consequences that we could see from the merger of our  currencies is the removal of all custom duties. However, one  should be completely frank here. When the OPEC countries gather  for their meetings, they do not decide what price they should  sell oil to Germany or France. They set just one common price.  Russia is a kind of OPEC for us. What happened? It set  different prices for Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and  Uzbekistan. Even though we behaved ourselves, we pay 40 ECU  more for their oil than clients inside Russia. We should be  outspoken about this if we consider ourselves honest  politicians. What kind of political union it is supposed to be  when it makes our economy a mess. I think it tightens the noose  around our neck, which is in the interests of Russia. I believe  that in this situation, Russia should make some concessions to  us and cancel all customs payments. And when we manage to merge  our monetary systems along decent and fair lines, I think a lot  of government members, bank chairmen, and many other officials  will lose their jobs. It is going to be a time for tough  monetary policies, which many politicians are not able to accept  because of their market-hostile mentality.     "

Acting Argentine Foreign Minister Fernando Petrella, who  also  attended the meeting, told PRENSA LATINA that the Cuban  minister's visit is ""very significant, successful, and  important.""    In statements to reporters, the Cuban foreign minister, who  also met with the Senate president and the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, pointed out that ""there are many more  things that unite us than separate us.""    Regardless of our differences, which stem from our different  political systems, the meeting with the president at all times  focused on the common ground in Cuban-Argentine relations, he  added.    During the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister explained to  the president the current situation in Cuba with emphasis on  economic aspects and informed him of how Cubans are tackling  their difficulties.    Robaina and Menem reportedly also discussed the  opportunities  for Cuba and Argentina to promote Latin American integration.    PRENSA LATINA learned that the president suggested further  exchanges between the two Foreign Ministries and proposed a trip  to the island by Argentine businessmen to survey current  conditions for investment and trade.    After meeting with Menem, the chief of Cuban diplomacy gave  a  lecture on Cuban foreign policy to a large group of Argentine  and foreign diplomats at the headquarters of the Advisory  Council on International Relations (CARI).    Robaina, who was declared an ""illustrious visitor"" by the  Buenos Aires Deliberative Council yesterday, later met with  partners of the Commodity Exchange in this capital, with members  of the Cuban community living here, and with leaders of the  Grand Front Leftist Coalition, among other activities.

For us, a  peaceful solution to the conflict is of prime importance. There  are at present two proposals for achieving peace in  Nagorno-Karabakh: The CSCE proposal and the Russian proposal.  Armenia has accepted both and what is more, we have convinced  the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities to accept them too. But do not  believe it was an easy task.    [Luzzani] Why?    [Papazyan] Because neither proposal guarantees protection  for  the Karabakh population following the peace agreement, and it  goes without saying that the documents do not talk about the  enclave's ""independence.""    [Luzzani] Both proposals speak about withdrawal of troops.  Is Karabakh willing to withdraw from the occupied Azerbaijani  territory?    [Papazyan] One should put that question to Karabakh's  authorities, but I believe that if they accepted the proposals  it is because they are willing to withdraw their troops.  Azerbaijan will also have to withdraw its troops from northern  Karabakh. The Azerbaijani Government has, however, rejected  both proposals.    [Luzzani] Is there practically no possibility of a  cease-fire?    [Papazyan] I would not say so. Azerbaijan is also steeped in  a critical situation and sooner or later will have to accept  that the solution will not be found through military  intervention. There will come a moment when it will have to  accept the CSCE's proposal since it does not want Russian troops  to return to its territory. Ideally, international troops should  be used to ensure that peace will not be broken. Russia will  not be able to oppose this.    [Luzzani] How are relations between Armenia and Iran at  present?    [Papazyan] Our relations are those of good neighbors. There  are some problems because the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has  spread to its boarders and Iran does not like that at all. Iran  is also interested in a peaceful solution.    [Luzzani] And with Turkey?    [Papazyan] We do not have diplomatic relations with Turkey,  which totally closed its border with Armenia and it openly  promotes Azerbaijani interests.    [Luzzani] Does Russia continue to be Armenia's leading  partner?    [Papazyan] Russia is enmeshed in a very serious economic  crisis. Armenia is Moscow's ally, but the Russian Government  finds it difficult to provide aid to its allies. Moreover, we  have very good relations with the EC, the United States,  Argentina. Our foreign policy is orientated towards a balanced  opening.    [Luzzani] And with the other former Soviet Republics?    [Papazyan] Relations with the Ukraine are not as deep as  they  should be because Kiev is in an even worse situation than  Moscow. We have very good relations with republics in Central  Asia, especially with Turkmenistan. From the economic  standpoint, I would say our main partners are Russia first,  followed by Turkmenistan, with Iran in third place.     "

Why is it those who were not invited to the upcoming  meeting in Havana on the nation and the emigres were not  included? This is the topic Luis Sexto, a reporter for BOHEMIA  magazine, and your host, Osvaldo Rodriguez from JUVENTUD REBELDE  will discuss. I turn the time over to my colleague.    [Sexto] Osvaldo, we must begin by saying that we still do  not  know who is invited and who is not. We still do not have the  names of those who have been invited or of those who have said  that they will come to this meeting convened by the  revolutionary government to discuss relations between Cuba and  its emigres. I believe that by explaining the aim or the goal of  the this conference we can explain why there are many people who  have emigrated but who will not be able to attend this  conference, which will be held in April. As I was saying, by  analyzing the goal or the aim, we will be able to understand why  some, who lament or oppose the observance of this conference  from abroad, will not attend. In other words, this conference  will be held to discuss and analyze the relations that exist and  the normalization of those relations between Cuba and Cuban  emigrants.    [Rodriguez] We must specify that it is not a dialogue. That  is something....[pauses] Because some people have confused this  meeting of Cubans on the island with their relatives who  emigrated abroad, to the United States or any other place, with  the dialogue that was proposed by opponents to the revolutionary  project. We must understand that this is not a dialogue.    [Sexto] Well, the word dialogue, in a semantic sense, is one  that connotes cordiality. It is a positive word. But in the  current political language, the counterrevolution's political  language, it is a double-edged word. When you talk about  establishing a dialogue with someone, it is because you  recognize in that person a belligerency or sufficient power for  you to dialogue with him, and even to reconcile yourself with  that person. Dialogue implies establishing agreements and it  implies a certain reconciliation. That is the reason that in the  counterrevolution's political language, the language that is so  commonly used in Miami or Madrid, dialogue has that connotation  -- as if the Cuban Revolution, the revolutionary government, or  socialist Cuba, had to dialogue with its opponents abroad.    [Rodriguez] Who do not represent any political force.    [Sexto] Exactly. They represent only the forces of their own  interests. We will talk about this in a minute.    I believe Cuba is not going to dialogue with its enemies.  Cuba has called a conference where it will talk with certain  emigrants, with certain people, on relations with Cuban emigres.  You know very well that Cuban emigration has been a process. The  Cuban emigration has been grossly manipulated by the United  States of America. We must consider how, from the beginning of  this process in 1959 and in the 60's, human feelings and needs  have been manipulated to the point that they would serve the  political interests of the illegitimate sons [espurios] and  bastards -- excuse me for using such harsh words.    Therefore, the Cuban emigration process must be looked at  with certain objectivity, because emigration is a world  phenomenon. It is a phenomenon that characterizes today's world.  It has been rarefied by political interests, political interests  of interference, ambitious political interests, and illegitimate  political interests.    [Rodriguez] We are talking to Luis Sexto, a reporter for  BOHEMIA magazine on a topic that is being discussed in Havana  and other places in the world: the upcoming meeting in Havana of  the nation and the emigres. We are discussing why those who were  not included were not included.    [Sexto] In other words, why it is that those who will not be  there will not be there. That would be the appropriate term.  Because those who will not be, or those who cannot be, at this  conference are those who demand that the Revolution give up its  power. It is that group who would like to return to Cuba to  impose their vision and class interests. That is very clear.  Those who will come will be emigrants who wish to maintain good,  stable, and cordial relations with their native country. Just  recently I wrote an article in BOHEMIA in which I commented on  the phenomenon of emigration and its history in our country and  I proposed the hypothesis that emigration generally has two  sides, especially the Cuban emigration. First, a political  emigration: an emigration of people who oppose the Revolution or  who have been affected in a sense by the Revolution.    [Rodriguez] In other words, class enemies.    [Sexto] Enemies of the Revolution who went abroad to seek  support with the intent of returning. What distinguishes  political emigration from economic emigration is the urge to  return. Then we have the other side, which is the economic  emigrant.    [Rodriguez] Before you talk about the economic emigrant,  these political emigrants want to return to Cuba and occupy the  position they once had.    [Sexto] Right.    [Rodriguez] That is why they ask the Revolution to give up  its power.    [Sexto] Right. The political emigrant goes abroad to prepare  his return and with his return to reimpose his interests,  vision, and the supremacy of his class or party. For now, Cuba  has nothing to talk about with those who, from abroad, conspire  against the nation. Because, obviously, those political groups  who, from Miami or Madrid, propose or want a dialogue are  combating and harassing Cuba. What they want is to take power  from the Revolution. As a matter of fact, what do some of the  more moderate members of that political group, that political  superstructure, propose for Cuba? To solve Cuba's problems? To  solve them in such a way that would benefit the majority of the  Cuban people, that would allow the Cuban people to continue  enjoying the achievements brought about by the Revolution? No!    The least moderate of these groups asks for a multiparty  system, private property, general openings and uncontrolled  foreign investments, subordination to the United States. Those  are their demands. I doubt that any Cuban citizen with a  patriotic conscience would be able to consider the most minute  possibility of sitting down to discuss those issues with the  enemies of Cuba.    [Rodriguez] You were going to talk about economic emigrants  when I interrupted you.    [Sexto] The economic emigrant is the person who leaves to  seek better living conditions. He leaves for the purpose of  starting a new life. For the economic emigrant, what he leaves  behind does not present a conflict. He is leaving to start a new  life. He probably does not even want to return because the  economic emigrant breaks his connections with the past. He has a  different goal. The economic emigrant is sometimes nostalgic for  his roots but he does not think about returning.    Osvaldo, I am the son and grandson of emigrants. My  grandparents came from Spain to Cuba. Part of my family,  especially my parents, emigrated after the triumph of the Cuban  Revolution; I know the mechanics and the nature of the emigrant  because I learned about it from my own family. My grandparents  never talked about returning to Spain. I believe that my  relatives who left Cuba at the beginning of the Revolution have  never expressed the desire to reestablish themselves in Cuba.    Therefore, I believe that the majority of Cuban emigres  during these 35 years -- because there was emigration in Cuba  prior to the Revolution, and in the 50's there was growing  emigration -- I believe that in some years, such as 1956, more  than 25,000 Cubans went to the U.S. Interests Section to ask for  visas to enter the United States, to live and work there. The  phenomenon of emigration is a bit old in Cuba. It was not caused  by the Cuban Revolution. It reached its peak with the Revolution.    Therefore, the majority of economic emigrants who live in  the  United States and other countries around the world, those who  will come to talk with Cuban authorities, will come to converse  on how to establish a line of communication with what we could  call the Cuban diaspora. How to achieve stable and firm ties,  despite the world situation, with their native land. That is  what they will come to discuss and that is all that the  conference will allow to be discussed.    [Rodriguez] Yes, and in the political sense, I believe the  United States will no longer be able to use that portion of the  emigres as a political weapon or as a hostage to its policy.    [Sexto] The United States politicized emigration and we did  too, as a reflection or as a rejection. As an imposition of the  struggle, we also helped politicize emigration. There was a time  when we thought that a person who left the country was taking  sides against the Cuban Revolution and the country; that is not  true. Practice and experience have demonstrated that that is not  true and it is time to refocus and change our point of view.    [Rodriguez] Why is it those who were not invited to the  upcoming meeting in Havana on the nation and emigration were not  invited? Luis Sexto from BOHEMIA magazine has spoken to us on  this topic.     "

0,FT922-10917 ,"FT922-10917 _AN-CD2BIAAHFT 920429   FT  29 APR 92 / New economic allies begin the long haul      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent      WASHINGTON   THIS week's decisions in Washington to admit Russia and other former Soviet republics to membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank have provided an important, historic moment in the process of integrating the former Soviet Union into the world economy. But the really hard work is only just beginning. Difficult negotiations are in prospect over conditions to be attached to IMF financial support for its new members and on details of the proposed rouble stabilisation fund. Russia and the other entrants will soon find themselves on a difficult learning curve as they discover that the IMF and World Bank are no 'soft touch' for easily available finance. Although the IMF has produced an impressive battery of documents over recent weeks detailing economic developments in Russia and the republics, monetary officials admit it is difficult to tell what relevance these have to conditions 'on the ground' outside the main metropolitan centres such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. President Boris Yeltsin's remarks yesterday that Russia 'would not work under the direct orders' of the IMF were a pointer to future tussles over economic policy between Moscow and the IMF. The detailed difficulties which lie ahead are symbolised by discussions over the proposed Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) rouble stabilisation fund, which was agreed in principle by the Group of 10 industrialised countries this week. The idea is simple: that the fund should exist in reserve to support rouble parity once Russia has agreed to an IMF economic reform programme. Ideally, as Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, said on Tuesday, the best use of the fund would be not to use it at all because that would show confidence had been established in the rouble. But the questions are many. Nobody knows what the rouble parity should be, although the Russian government feels existing market-determined rates undervalue the currency. The future regime for the rouble is open. Will it be fixed, put in a crawling peg of adjustable rates or float? G10 senior officials have suggested at least an initial period of floating, while Mr Gaidar favours fluctuation margins of 7.5 per cent either side of an eventual parity. What, if any, will be the anchor currency for the rouble? Will it be the Ecu, as proposed by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, or the dollar as suggested by Mr Gaidar? What will be the arrangements to ensure that monetary policy in the other countries of the planned rouble zone does not undermine the currency? It is also far from clear whether the industrialised countries agree on how the fund should operate. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, has suggested it should run for only one year and that extensions be agreed among the G10. This would keep the Russians on a short leash. The stabilisation fund itself will only come into effect when Russia and the republics have satisfied the IMF and G10 that they have effective macro-economic and structural reform programmes in place. It is therefore far from certain that it can be established in time for Russia's planned move to a unified exchange rate for the rouble on July 1. It is little wonder that some senior western monetary officials privately doubt whether the fund will come into being at all. But the stabilisation fund is only a small part of a bigger and more confusing mosaic. 'The big question is how much they - that is their government, the country and the Russian political community - recognise the true magnitude of what faces them,' one senior western official mused this week. Mr Gaidar spoke of Russia having a stable and high rate of growth after five years. Some western officials talk of a 25-year process of economic rehabilitation for Russia and the republics. Ominous parallels are drawn with the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s. That is only now resolving itself after nearly 10 years. Yet the Latin American countries had experience of the market economy and market-orientated structures in place; Russia and its neighbours have none of these. But Russia clearly has one asset in the shape of Mr Gaidar. Mr Nicholas Brady, US Treasury secretary, expressed a fairly general view of Russia's deputy prime minister when he described him as 'an enormously convincing person'.

From the panicky statements about a ""reactionary turn in the  economy"" to the forecasts of a burst of hyperinflation which  prevailed in January, the world's media has begun to offer a  more considered and objective view. And though at the beginning  of the year some ultra-radicals, including some of our own in  Russia, called on the west not to give a cent to the ""red  directors"" who had taken control of the Russian government, the  International Monetary Fund still took the symbolic decision to  assign to Moscow the second tranche of a $3bn loan in exchange  for commitments to market reform.    What happened in these first 10-12 weeks of this year to  justify the IMF's decision? There was no great turnover of  ministers in the Russian government. The economic reform  programme, adopted in August 1993, did not change. Most  significantly, events themselves have refuted the unscrupulous  allegation that our course would change, an allegation that  proceeded simply from the political ambitions of those who made  it.    The continuation of reform, financial stabilisation and  structural change remain the core of Russia's economic policy.  The economic evidence of the first three months of this year  attest to that. Between February and April, the monthly rate of  inflation fell to 10 per cent. We do not expect the picture to  change in May. In the planned 1994 budget, the deficit is pegged  at 9 per cent of gross domestic product. By observing these  parameters, we will see inflation lowered to a monthly rate of  7-8 per cent by the end of the year.    To achieve this goal we must adopt the most resolute  measures  aimed at limiting the budget deficit and the emission of  credits. In particular, we took a difficult decision to increase  state revenues by changing a range of previously-fixed taxes,  customs and excise duties. And we did that against the backdrop  of a 25 per cent fall in production in the first quarter of this  year compared to the corresponding period in 1993. At the same  time we continued to carry out a tight monetary policy to which  the central bank interest rate -- significantly higher than the  inflation rate in the past few months -- bears witness.    It is vitally important that every member of the Russian  government fully understands that a strong rouble is the  indispensable condition for the revival of the Russian economy,  and the Russian state as a whole. Naturally, as elsewhere in  the world, ministers will lobby for more resources. However as  every member of the Russian government knows, the important  thing is not the amount of money they receive; rather it is that  the money they get should have a real and lasting worth. It is  counter-productive to have a currency which in one month alone  loses about a quarter of its value. Such has been the fate of  the rouble.    Our common task is thus clear: to ensure that Russian  citizens should know that everything their government does is  directed towards protecting the purchasing power of the rouble,  so that with these roubles Russian citizens will be welcomed  anywhere in the world.    The question naturally arises as to why we do not introduce  an even tougher financial policy and limit even more tightly  budgetary expenditure so as to bring down inflation more  rapidly. We are told by critics that in other countries, in  eastern Europe and the Baltics for instance, the authorities  have managed to achieve financial stabilisation more quickly.  And when we insist, in defence, that Russia is fundamentally  different from these countries, our critics retort that all  countries are different but that economic laws work in the same  way everywhere.    Posing the question in this way reveals an inadequate  understanding of the specifics of the Russian situation. In a  small state the government can follow what happens in every  large enterprise and, where needed, take urgent action: in  Russia, however, the geography of the country significantly  reduces such a possibility.    If a disaster strikes a small country and its economy grinds  to a halt, the world community will come to its aid. Even  Russia, in spite of its worsening economic crisis, continues to  help its neighbours in trying to overcome their poverty. Indeed  Russia's donor status vis-a-vis the member countries of the  Commonwealth of Independent States is parallel to that of the  Group of Seven leading industrialised countries vis-a-vis Russia.    In other words, while economic laws work the same in all  countries, the possibility of a government responding to them  depends on the historic particularities of that country's  economy.    For 70 years, the former Soviet totalitarian economy  accumulated vast structural disparities. Tackling these  problems demands prolonged effort and huge expense. It is clear  that we cannot sanction mass closures of our exhausted plants  since that would usher in an unsupportable rise in unemployment  and sharply worsen both the political and the social situation  in the country. Besides, it would be simply unreasonable, since  many enterprises have significant reserves with which to improve  their financial position. All industrial enterprises should get  the chance -- and that means time -- to overcome their present  difficulties.    Today, we can define three groups of basic industries in  Russia:    Enterprises that have successfully completed a period of  adaptation to new market conditions and are already increasing  turnover.    Enterprises which have yet to undergo such a period of  adaptation, but which display the necessary potential to do so  and have some hope of succeeding. It is these enterprises which  should get help from the government. This group is by far the  most numerous.    Enterprises which are beyond salvation and should be closed  down in accordance with the law on bankruptcy. A list of such  companies is already prepared. We do not, however, want to  throw the baby out with the bathwater; and we cannot ignore the  social consequences of each step on this road.    Imagine a provincial Russian town, built up around a big  defence plant set up some years ago. The entire population of  the town -- maybe 100,000 people -- works at the defence plant,  including those engaged in the service sector. Assume that the  plant has long since ceased to have any social use and no longer  receives orders. Should we shut the enterprise without  considering the consequences for its employees?    Consider another example: a northern mining town with a  population of 50,000 which was established to work the coal  reserves. The extraction of the coal is carried on with huge  losses, the reserves are near to exhaustion, the equipment is  obsolete and the cost of transporting the coal has gone up  several times. There is no other settlement for 500km. There  are hundreds of such cities and towns throughout Russia.    What should be done? We have no choice but to study  carefully each case and patiently find a solution.    We do now feel there is some understanding in the west for  these problems. The talks last month between the Russian  government and representatives of the Group of Seven during the  annual meeting of the European Bank of Reconstruction and  Development in St Petersburg showed that our colleagues in the  US, the UK and other countries recognise the importance of  assistance in the social sphere. They intend to take an active  part in the search for a way to separate out from the  enterprises the social components traditionally provided by  them, such as schools and kindergartens, so as not to threaten  the basic living conditions of millions of people. The issue  here is the possibility of channelling the international credit  given to Russia towards the resolution of, above all, social  problems. We can cope with the other issues ourselves.    We recently finished a round of talks in Moscow with the  IMF;  our approach met with understanding and support. Our relations  with the IMF, to which we have furnished the most complete  information both on the economic situation on what we intend to  do to correct problems in that sphere, have become a symbol of  our new openness in economic matters. We believe that the  agreement with the IMF will lay a good foundation for our talks  with the Paris and London clubs of sovereign and commercial  creditors on the restructuring of Russia's foreign debt which we  inherited from the Soviet Union. Successful co-operation with  our creditors should also assist our efforts to achieve  financial stabilisation.    The further integration of Russia into the world economy  fully accords with our interests. We have left behind the  former artificial exchange rate of the rouble, the state  monopoly of internal trade and other former obstacles and  limitations. We welcome foreign investment in the Russian  economy and very much count on attracting further foreign  investment -- even though we understand that much will depend on  the success of our economic reforms and the improvement of the  legal and tax regimes for foreign investors.    At the same time we will continue to insist on the  establishment of equal trading relations, on the ending of the  discrimination against Russian exports. In that regard, we are  determined to push through Russia's application to join the  General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. In the near future  Russia will take its proper place in the system of world trade  and it will benefit both Russia and its trading partners.    I know that much of this appears over-optimistic. Indeed the  country has still to emerge from its deep economic crisis. At  the same time, we see the first signs that our efforts are  bearing fruit. The privatisation of small businesses -- shops,  restaurants, workshops -- is almost complete. As a result, the  look of Russian cities is changing: in place of the dejected  and sombre queues to which we were accustomed we see smart  advertising hoardings and attractive, lively goods. We count on  the privatisation of the larger companies to produce the same  positive effect.    The first stage of privatisation, based on the use of  vouchers issued free to every citizen, will soon be complete.  From 1 July the remaining shares in state hands will be sold  not for vouchers but for money. This new approach should  replenish the state budget and also strengthen the financial  position of the enterprises themselves.    The strengthening of political stability is also an  enormously important condition for successfully addressing the  economic crisis. Last year, a new constitution was endorsed by  the people in a popular referendum, marking the end of the  long-drawn out and weary confrontation between the executive and  legislative powers. The other important step in the development  of the democratic process was the holding of parliamentary  elections, also in December.    There are differing views on the results of the December  parliamentary elections. Yet the first 100 days of the federal  assembly's work shows that the new parliament is a great  improvement on the old Supreme Soviet. We count on close  co-operation between the government and the parliament as a  necessary condition for the creation of a legal base for the new  economic environment. Political stability has been further  strengthened by the achievement of a civil accord of national  reconciliation, a process led by President Boris Yeltsin and now  endorsed by a broad range of Russian political parties,  enterprises and associations.    In today's Russia we are seeing a new beginning: a time for  those who know how, and have the ability, to do business. We  are now living through the trough of the economic crisis. In  the next few months we can make a break from the basic negative  tendencies which have held back our development in the past two  or three years.    I am certain that we will make the break. Russia has only  one path to tread -- that of reform, and it will not depart from  it.     "

After years of  sworn enmity between Cuba and South Africa, President Castro  arrived on his first visit to South Africa, and what a moment it  was. Pieter Theron asked him about impressions of South Africa.    [Begin recording] [Castro] It is wonderful to be in South  Africa. It grabbed my imagination. It is indeed an  extraordinary country in every respect -- the organization,  nature. I have only been here for a short while, but I have  spoken to many people. I was impressed by their hospitality and  the warmth with which I was received. I felt a sense of harmony  and unity, quite the opposite of what a stranger would have  expected. I followed the news every day and was impressed by  the country's people. They are well brought up. I realized  that what has taken place over the past few days was without  doubt an historic event for South Africa, for Africa, and for  the world. It has been a privilege to witness the events. I  was really impressed by what I saw. It is something I will take  with me when I return to Cuba.    [Theron] How do you see future relations between South  Africa  and Cuba?    [Castro] I would like to believe we are more than friends.  We are like family. A family does not discuss formal  relations. The ties which have grown between the people of Cuba  and South Africa are so deep that we feel at home here. My  visit has also provided the opportunity for even better  relations between the two countries in the future. This could  be of mutual benefit.    [Theron] What has South Africa got to offer Cuba, and what  has Cuba got to offer South Africa?    [Castro] Regarding trade, there is a long list of products  which South Africa could offer to Cuba. We do not want gold, as  we have no use for it. Apart from that, we could use almost  anything you could imagine. South Africa has advanced  technology. In many areas such as agriculture, you produce  everything. There are many areas for cooperation between our  two countries. South Africa will play an important role in  Africa and in the Third World. We have been doing it for many  years now, and I believe our experience could be of great value  for South Africa. South Africa is now involved in a great  experiment, and the whole world would like this experiment to  succeed. It is important to mankind, which is involved in  serious conflicts in many places.    [Theron] Cuba was involved in the conflict in Namibia and  Angola. You were engaged in war against South Africa. Do you  think your involvement contributed towards the changes that took  place in South Africa?    [Castro] Our involvement in Angola led to many sacrifices.  But we took the decision on our own, without the Soviet Union's  knowledge. We did it out of sympathy and historical ties. It  was not without risk. One always runs the risk of being  defeated.    [Theron] President Castro, communism collapsed in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union. Why do you think communism is  still the right system for Cuba?    [Castro] Communism was not imported to Cuba. It was our own  creation, and it developed differently from the way it developed  in other countries. It was the result of our own struggle  against a dictator. No one brought socialism to Cuba. Rather,  it was a case of Cuba finding its own solutions. We achieved a  great deal, but we lost 80 percent of our trade -- many of the  things we imported from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless we  overcame that setback. Not many countries could have achieved  that. But Cuba is a united country, with a spirit all its own.  This is the spirit which emerged in Angola. At one point,  without any assistance, we supported more than 50,000 troops  almost 10,000 kilometers from home. That is proof of a strong  nation driven by certain principles.    [Theron] Will the future system of government still be  communism for Cuba?    [Castro] We see it as socialism. We want to maintain it, but  we have left an economic opening. We lost capital markets and  technology, which we now need in order to develop our country.  So there is room in the economic field. We need investments in  many areas. There is a process of change under way in our  country, to keep us in touch with the present realities of the  world. But we have not given up our principles. [end recording]     "

The media say the  program of the meeting between the American head of state and  President Boris Yeltsin has been agreed upon on all key matters.  It will be a continuation of the summit that took place last  April in Vancouver, Canada.    According to the press service of the Russian president, the  Moscow meeting will continue the search for ways of expanding  partnership, in particular cooperation in the light of the  strategy of reform carried out in Russia. The agenda also  includes key international problems, such as the strengthening  of security and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,  peace-making operations in regional conflicts. The talks should  cover the entire spectrum of questions of bilateral relations  too.    The Moscow summit should become a major international event,  like the meeting in Vancouver and other top-level talks between  the two great powers. This can be explained by the role that  Russian- American relations play in the world community.    Still, one can say that the coming summit talks will have  their own identity. They are going to take place in conditions  of the further advancement of reforms in Russia. The reforms  were in the centre of attention during the parliamentary  elections in Russia last month. The pros and cons of the  reforms became evident then. The election results influenced the  domestic political scene in Russia and to a certain extent  international relations too. A somewhat new situation emerged  and new questions appeared, some of which are linked to  Russian-American relations.    Vladislav Kozyakov comments on the distinctive features of  the upcoming Moscow meeting. He writes:    If you review the road between Vancouver and Moscow, that is  between last April and January, you will notice quite a few  achievements. Russia and the United States have come closer to  each other. Much of what was agreed on in Vancouver has been  done. Here one could name the decision of the United States  Congress to earmark means for support to Russia and several  concrete aid programs. What is more important, scores of  agreements in economy have been concluded. Russia will take  part in the construction of an international space station  together with the United States, while America will be involved  in the modernization of the Russian oil industry. These and  other programs should benefit both nations.    But now new tasks have come to the fore, primarily  cooperation directed at encouraging democratic changes in  Russia. The parliamentary elections in Russia clearly showed  that the reforms, the way they were carried out so far, were too  harsh for the broad masses. At a recent news conference  President Yeltsin spoke of the need for additional social  measures. The Russian reformers are determined to somewhat  amend their own strategy and take steps to raise living  standards. It is indicative that Western capitals arrived at a  similar conclusion. Declarations were made there in support of  broader efforts to back social programs in Russia. President  Clinton even spoke for doubling the efforts of Western countries  in this sphere. One can foresee that this aspect of  Russian-American partnership is going to be discussed in detail  at the Moscow summit.    However, certain aspects of relations between Moscow and  Washington should be altered in the current situation. The time  that has passed since Vancouver has demonstrated the great  potential of the establishment of fully normalized, equal  relations in trade. However, even now, far from all the  restrictions introduced by the United States during the cold war  have gone down in history. Unfortunately, in some other spheres  one can also notice that the West does not fully realize the  true needs and lawful interests of Russian reformers, conducting  democratic changes in such a mammoth country. Washington and  other Western capitals, as well as international financial  organizations, are trying to measure the progress of Russian  reforms, their scale and speed, according to their own pattern  and accordingly determine their attitudes to actual programmes  of economic cooperation. Meanwhile, such an approach is  absolutely unacceptable in relations with a great power.    There are also some other areas in which the west should  stop  being didactical in its dialogue with Moscow, to use the  expression of the Russian foreign minister, Andrey Kozyrev.  Russia expects the coming summit in Moscow to be productive and  be marked by new understanding, greater partnership in all  spheres of cooperation.     "

The occupants, of which only 73 remain in the Belgian  ambassador's residence and 21 in the German Embassy,  discontinued their efforts to travel to the countries whose  missions they invaded, the Cuban foreign minister asserted.    Robaina told almost 200 U.S. citizens, who came to Cuba as  part of a campaign to challenge the Washington government's  prohibition against U.S. citizens' travel to the island, about  the occupation of diplomatic missions. He said the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana has denied 40,000 visas to Cubans  who had their documents in order and wanted to visit the United  States this year.    ""We could add the almost 150 Cubans in the embassies to  those  40,000 because they would not have acted by force if they knew  they would achieve their objective through regular mechanisms,""  Robaina said.    Cuba and the United States have a valid immigration  agreement, which was signed in 1987. The agreement stipulates  that Washington will grant up to 20,000 entry visas to Cuban  citizens every year. In reality, however, it only grants  approximately 1,500 every year.    Robaina confirmed the Cuban Government's position that it  will not authorize the people who occupied foreign missions by  force to leave the country. [passage omitted]     "

Union leaders, deputies, and delegates to the People's  Government in the province held an intense debate on the  economic problems being confronted and the possible solutions.  It was stressed that the most important thing is to seek  efficiency at each work place and labor post. The meeting, held  prior to the beginning of the process in the work centers, was  presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and Pedro  Ross.    It was stated that Matanzas Province has a budget deficit of  120 million pesos and that 11 local enterprises received  subsidies totaling 213 million pesos during 1993. The money in  circulation totals 1.12 billion pesos, which is equivalent to  the salary of 20 months. Confronting these problems demands  intelligence, creativity, and, above all, work.    [Begin Alarcon recording] In the meetings in which we have  participated so far, we have seen clearly how the workers are  capable of identifying in each place how costs can be reduced,  and how to increase production and economic efficiency.

Koptyug: ""Attempts To Resolve the Question in  Parts Is Doomed to Failure (Speech at the Scientific-Practical  Conference `Strategy of Stabilization of the Economy of the  Region: Problems and Resolutions'""]    [Text] A feverish search is going on today at the level of  state and territorial structures for extricating industries and  territorial multibranch complexes out of the profound crisis in  which they find themselves. Programs are being considered and  formed on how to stop the slump and to restore the most  important spheres of the economy of Russia (the fuel-energy  sphere, enterprises of the military-industrial complex, the  agro-industrial sector, the municipal economy, etc.) and its  regions, krays, and oblasts. These programs are being lobbied by  representatives of industries and territories in the Federal  Assembly, in the Russian Federation Government, and on the  president's staff. In the process, someone succeeds in  extracting something, but the situation, on the whole, is only  getting worse.    To do justice to the significance of today's conference on  problems of the development of Novosibirsk Oblast and the  efforts of the Siberian Accord interregional association  throughout Siberia in general, which is important for the  future, I would like to note immediately that the efforts to  resolve the question in parts are doomed to failure. The  question of ""how to survive"" can be resolved in part, but it is  impossible to find an answer to the question of ""how to live and  develop?""    If we go along with the ""reforms"" conducted in recent years,  if fundamental changes are not introduced in the strategy of  socio-economic transformations in the country, then it simply  would be daydreaming to count on the fact that, with the help of  industrial and territorial programs, we will succeed in averting  a further drop into the abyss of a crisis and in improving the  situation in the regions.    Why? Let us analyze it.    The pivotal point of the reforms being conducted in our  country is the attempt to introduce comprehensive market  relations and private property across the board, even on the  land on which we all live and feed ourselves. To expect that the  market and general privatization in property will themselves  regulate everything is ridiculous. Russians have already felt  the full impact on themselves of just what a ""wild market"" is,  but a civilized market is built over decades. It is impossible  to build a civilized, regulated system of market relations in  500 or 1,000 days. And this must be clearly understood. The  country is reaping the fruit today of the ""revolutionary"" effort  to join the market.    Why do I think that today's attempts to resolve the problem  in parts is hopeless? First of all, because the country at all  levels of management--state, branches of industry, and  local--was deprived of the basic part of investment resources.  And the matter here is by no means only in the catastrophic  slump in the volumes of production, although there was no such  production crisis in the entire history of the development of  industrial countries in peacetime. The sharp slump in production  is not so much a reason as a consequence. The consequence of the  kind of policy that was conducted in Russia during the last two  years.    What then do we have as a result of the clumsy reformation?    The introduction of elements of the market system were  absolutely correctly reasoned as a need to arouse the initiative  of the people, and with the help of entrepreneurial structures  to ensure a rise in the output of products for the spheres of  consumption and production. But for this, the levers of state  stimulation of private-entrepreneurial production should be  engaged, not even to mention the state sector. Did the state  guarantee this? No. Although the support and protection of the  domestic producer is the sacred obligation of the state and of  those who formulate policy.    Today, as a result of the disproportion of prices for raw  materials, energy, transport, and industrial articles, and the  incredibly high credit interest, to produce something in the  overwhelming majority of production sectors means to operate at  a financial loss. What kind of an entrepreneur will begin to do  this? It is precisely for this reason that the entrepreneurial  structures in Russia went mainly (by 90 percent) along the path  of trade, and, more specifically, speculation. Playing on the  already mentioned price disproportions, they are amassing  enormous capital that is not invested in domestic production,  but is exported abroad. The accumulation of capital in the  countries to which capital is exported makes it possible to  lower credit rates there and thereby expand investment in  production. It is embarrassing for me to call things by their  name. Ask Western economists how they would characterize the  actions of their government, if they would permit a similar  situation. In the system of market relations, the principle of  ""self comes first"" works especially distinctly. But so that the  concept of ""self"" include not only personal, but also national  interest, developed countries have built a very tough system of  regulators and limiters.    But how much capital ""flows away"" abroad? According to the  estimates of the experts, about $30 billion have been exported,  and about $1.5 billion are exported monthly at the present time.  This is an enormous blow against the economy of Russia.    Judge for yourself. An attempt is being made to draw up the  state budget of Russia for 1994, which is being discussed at the  present time, with an increase in expenditures over incomes by  approximately 10 percent, or, in a monetary expression, by 60  trillion rubles [R], which is equivalent to $33 billion, and the  annual export of capital is valued at the present time at $18  billion; i.e., more than half the budget deficit. According to  official data, $15.5 billion out of the $48 billion value of  exports did not return to Russia. But through channels that are  not monitored?    In similar situations, civilized countries conduct strict  control over the export of capital in order to force it, with  the help of economic and legislative measures, ""to work"" in  their own country.    While not undertaking the necessary measures in this  direction, Russia at the same time is trying to cover the  chronic deficit of the state budget at the expense of foreign  loans. But, first, two-thirds of foreign credits usually remain  in the crediting countries to support the production of that  product (be it grain, industrial articles, or technology) that  is later delivered to Russia owing to the credits. Thus, we are  once again stimulating the development of production and the  creation of jobs most of all not in our own country, but among  our neighbors, burdening our state budget with foreign debt  interest payment obligations. Second, that third that does come  to Russia disappears ""in the sand,"" as a result of the chaos in  the spheres of management and control. Third, the real sum of  financial resources that came to our country during two years  (1992-1993) because $15 billion in foreign credits amounted to  $4 billion, which corresponds to the total export of capital for  two and a half months.    No less a powerful blow to the economy of the country was  delivered and is being delivered by the insane policy of  privatization. I cannot call the privatization that is being  conducted at government level anything other than a fantastic  swindle. I will not talk about the enormous disorganizational  role of this policy with respect to industry, agriculture, the  municipal sphere, etc. I will dwell only on the financial side  of the matter. What is a voucher from a financial standpoint?  Nothing more than a small share of a monthly wage. Anatoliy  Borisovich Chubays, at the beginning of the ""division"" of state  property, gave assurances that every voucher is at least  equivalent to a passenger car. But no matter how much you try,  you will not succeed in finding a commercial structure that is  ready to take a voucher in exchange for a passenger car or other  motor vehicle. One voucher is nothing, but thousands and tens of  thousands of vouchers in the same hands, this is considerable,  inasmuch as they give the owner the right to acquire large  property at a favorable price, and in this case the voucher can  really be ""converted"" into a passenger car.    Did the people win as a result of voucherization? No. Did  the  state win from it? Also, no. I will explain why the last answer  is also negative. Toward the beginning of 1994, somewhat more  than half of the state enterprises in the country were  privatized, principally small and average ones. Now, in order to  complete the privatization program before the summer of 1994,  the privatization of large enterprises is unfolding at an  increased pace. The ""revolutionary"" nature of the pace and  methods of privatization is akin to the ""revolutionary nature""  of the shock construction of the system of market relations. The  privatization program allegedly pursued economic objectives,  but, in fact, they were purely political. Now, these objectives  are no longer concealed--to quickly create a class of large  property owners who would not allow the policy of capitalization  of the country to be stopped. And it must be said that the  achievement of this objective is not far off. And perhaps it has  already been achieved, which I will talk about below.    Did the state receive anything on an economic plane from the  implementation of the privatization program? As an answer to  this question, I will quote an excerpt from a March article of  John Ross, an economic adviser to a group of Laborites of the  British Parliament, which was published in DELOVOY MIR.    ""...In order to understand what this means for state  incomes,  it is necessary simply to note that the privatization of one  large steel foundry in Brazil--Usiminas--gave the state $1.17  billion. In Mexico, the privatization of 950 enterprises (and in  Russia by the start of 1994, 85,000 enterprises were  privatized--V.K.) gave the state $23 billion. But,  after all, both the Brazilian and Mexican enterprises are  incomparably smaller than, for example, ZIL. Nevertheless, in  Russia the income from privatization was practically zero in  comparison with the value of the removed funds.    ""The implementation of this program had an exclusively  macroeconomic consequence. The squandering of state property  made it qualitatively difficult to finance the budget deficit.  Thus, this privatization program from the beginning deprived the  country of income from property that belonged to it, and  afterwards the possible profits from its potential sale. The  indirect consequences of this policy, operating through the  budget, will lead to a reduction of credits and, as a  consequence, to the closing of enterprises.    ""Unquestionably, it was not the Central Bank that was the  biggest creator of the budget deficit in Russia, but the  privatization committee.""    Thus, the objective that was really pursued by the authors  and implementers of ""shock"" methods of introducing the market  system and privatization, and specifically, the formation of a  class of large owners of capital and property, was achieved.  According to official data, 10 percent of the most well-to-do  people in Russia on the average have incomes that are 11-12  times greater than 10 percent of the people who are least  provided for. In a number of regions, this ratio is two to three  times higher, and if the unaccounted for and concealed incomes  are considered, it undoubtedly is even more. Such a  disproportion cannot help but prompt social disruption.    For the reasons talked about above, the new class will not  invest its capital in Russia's economy in the near future. Their  prime task now is to take power into their own hands, real  power, and not official, window-dressing power. The answer to  the question ""Can something still be done to stop the fall of  Russia into the abyss?"" depends on how far they have already  moved ahead in this direction.    It is a difficult question. Judging by certain signs, they  have moved ahead far. Remember, for example, how many times a  resolute struggle was proclaimed against organized large-scale  economic and physical crime and against that without which  organized crime cannot exist--against corruption of the state  apparatus--but it turns out in practice that despite the  measures that are being proclaimed, these monstrous ulcers on  the body of the country are only spreading. Not only is trade  shifting to the control of criminal structures in increasingly  greater measure, but also such very important spheres as the  system of money circulation, foreign economic relations, and  privatization. The state allows the swindlers in the sphere of  business to collect enormous amounts of money from the  population through fake banks and funds and to disappear with  them without a trace.    But what is to be done, if some chances of saving the  economy  still exist? It follows from what was said above that the  resolution of economic problems today lies most of all in the  political sphere and in the sphere of government management.    The failure of the ""shock therapy"" policy in Russia is  obvious. The consequences of this are very grave. It is  necessary to admit this courageously and to display the will for  a decisive correction in policy. This is required of both the  leaders of the country and society. I will mention in this  connection the winged phrase of Academician L.I. Abalkin:  ""Christ was crucified on the demand of the masses!"" By whom and  how such a demand of the masses is formed is another question.    I fully agree with the words the president of the Russian  Federation uttered at an expanded meeting of the government at  the beginning of March of this year: ""A policy is required of  the government today that is calculated to have promise. To  reform the economy at any price is an erroneous slogan. The  people can reject a reform that is too burdensome"" (which, in  fact, occurred in the elections to parliament of Russia in  December of last year). ""In the end, the government must  realistically develop a structural-investment policy. There is  no other way to stop the technological roll back of Russia's  industry. Otherwise, we can lose what little we  have--industries, retained personnel, technological and other  positions on the world market, and a native intellectual  potential.""    Correct words, only they are pronounced with a big delay. If  deeds follow words with just as much of a big delay, then it  will already be late.    What steps have to be taken now to create the conditions for  restoring production in Russia? The same ones spoken by that  outstanding president of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt,  who was elected to this post at the beginning of the 1930's,  when the country was rapidly plunged into the abyss of an  economic crisis that resulted from ""a wild market""--he  introduced tough state regulation and began to ease it when the  country was once again on its feet. Borrowing from the Country  of the Soviets the experience of strategic planning and state  regulation, after adapting it to the capitalistic system, he  saved this system.    But over the course of three-quarters of a century, we have  closed our eyes to the experience of the development of  capitalist countries, ignoring the fact that state regulation  can be implemented not only by the command method, for which we  paid or plunged ourselves (or we were pushed) into another  extreme, but by more effective economic methods. Perhaps, at  least now, while sliding toward the abyss of a crisis, we will  see clearly and we will borrow from the history of the United  States the path suggested to them by our country for getting out  of the crisis. But this requires the firm will of the leaders of  the country and an understanding of their actions by the people.  Persuasions according to the principle of Leopold the cat have  little promise today.    In a speech at the expanded meeting of the government, the  president of the Russian Federation, while characterizing the  actions planned for 1994, declared: ""I will begin by bringing  order and strengthening state economic principles."" It would be  very nice, if this did not remain just a declaration.    If we are talking about a correction of the economic sphere  as such, then one of the paramount questions here is the  monstrous disproportions in prices, and the key elements are the  prices in the fuel-energy complex and in transport. On the one  hand, the fact that domestic prices for energy sources are below  world prices leads to the current conditions of criminalizing  the sphere of their removal to the foreign market and to an  increase in the already mentioned accumulation of capital  abroad. On the other hand, an increase in domestic prices for  energy sources will result in an industry that is already  collapsing without this and will increase the total amount of  mutual nonpayments.    Let us imagine that the prices of energy sources will be  increased to world prices. Inasmuch as the energy and material  consumption of our industries, as a rule, is higher than in  developed countries, and labor productivity is lower, the prices  for the products of these industries will increase higher than  world prices, and, given open national borders (with respect to  foreign economic relations), this production will turn out to be  noncompetitive not only in the foreign market, but in the  domestic market as well. The consequences are obvious--industry  and agriculture will be utterly ruined    Consequently, to raise domestic prices for energy sources to  world level without erecting customs barriers for imports of key  types of products is impermissible. But inasmuch as our  industrial production should be brought onto the world  market--otherwise we will always only sell raw materials and  become a raw material appendage of the developed countries--then  it is obvious that before industry is reconstructed and its  indices approach those of the West, domestic prices for energy  sources must be lower than world prices.    The level of favorable prices for energy sources should be  tied strictly to a program of phased reduction of the specific  (per unit of product) energy consumption of an enterprise. The  wage fund of the workers of the enterprise should also be tied  to this and other programs for increasing the efficiency of  production. As long as the market mechanism is not working, the  state is obliged to regulate the price of manpower; i.e., wages,  at least in the main industries of the economy. But, today, the  lack of coordination on wages in our country is unbelievable.    As for the fuel-energy complex, at least at first, it will  have to be subsidized, while simultaneously cutting the Gordian  knot of mutual nonpayments.    No less important for Siberia with its enormous territory is  the level of the cost of transportation services. Expenditures  on railroad transportation render many types of raw materials  unsuitable for extraction, inasmuch as the processing complexes  are usually located in other points of Siberia. Even without  this, transportation costs greatly weaken cooperative relations.    And, finally, the last thing I want to talk about, while  contemplating the future of the country. Knowledge will be and  is already becoming the main capital in postindustrial society  in the developed countries. The destruction at all levels of  education, fundamental and applied science, and culture will  deprive our country of the future.    Therefore, it is necessary to consider the plans of the  economic development of Novosibirsk Oblast and Siberia, but only  the nearest events can be predicted. As for long-term projects  and programs, without resolution of the aforementioned global  overall state problems, there is a great probability that they  will turn into harebrained schemes.    Territorial efforts today must be combined and directed at  changes in the strategy of socio-economic reorganizations. The  details of the strategy can be argued, but its outline is  generally apparent. There is a whole series of sensible  documents and reports bearing on this question, and pertinent  decisions must be made. The time is short.    The adoption of such decisions can really only be achieved  by  the united efforts of the regions. The attempts of certain  territories to extract resources or benefits only for themselves  will turn into losses for everyone. Siberia needs economic  integration of the territories on the basis of resourceful,  technological, and economic mutual replenishment of each, and  not disintegration. There is a need for the collective defense  of a worthy place and role of Siberia in the economy of the  country. It will be sad and vexing if the ""Siberian Agreement""  does not fulfill the hopes placed on it.    On occasion, one hears reproaches of separatist tendencies  directed at Siberians. I do not think that there are objective  grounds for this. It seems to me that an understanding prevails  in Siberia that a sensible combination of regional and national  interests can be achieved only given the unconditional supremacy  of the federal legislative authority and the simultaneous  transfer of a significant part of executive authority functions  to the localities with a guarantee of economic opportunities to  fulfill these functions. At the same time, the general federal  policy with respect to the regions should take into account  their main features and the significance of their development of  the country as a whole.    As for the predictions and recommendations for the economic  development of Siberia and its territories, we presented them at  the appropriate All-Russian conference in June of 1993. They  will also be given with an amendment to the events of recent  months in this congress in speeches of representatives of the  Siberian Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences.    Without going into detail, I will say that the core of these  recommendations is the position that it is precisely Siberia  with its very rich resources, production, and scientific  potential, and special territorial situation, that can play the  ""role of the locomotive"" that will pull the country out of the  crisis. This can be done by implementing the conditions  mentioned above and by declaring Siberia a zone of strategic  interests of Russia.    The alternative is that Siberia can become a zone of  strategic interests of the United States. After all, fantastic  ideas of purchasing Siberia from Russia for about $3 trillion,  with the payment of this sum over 20 years, are already being  nurtured; moreover, half with ""payment in kind""; i.e., with the  goods and services of the producers of the United States. The  delirium of a madman? I would grade similar proposals precisely  as delirium, but the fact is that the Western mass media only  publishes ""delirium,"" when there is a demand for it, and when it  is necessary to sound out the opinion of those whom this might  concern. This should be kept in mind when encountering similar  delirious ideas.     "

The dam with highest capacity, (La Yaya), is releasing 525 cubic  meters per second causing floods downstream. This has affected  numerous agricultural areas.    Likewise, the dams close to the Salt mines in Caimanera are  completely full, which has caused flooding in the lower areas.  The municipalities of Yateras, Niceto Perez, El Salvador, and  Maisi are completely cut off. Serious damage to the Farola road  has rendered Baracoa completely inaccessible and has cut  communications to Maisi. Also, Guantanamo Province does not have  access to neighboring provinces by road or train.    This entire situation has brought about the evacuation of  more than 7,800 people, 3,202 of which are being sheltered by  the state. The rest of the people are receiving warm help at  private residences from solidary neighbors and relatives.    So far, 764 homes have been affected by the storm, eight of  which were completely destoyed. In that sense, the  municipalities most affected are Guantanamo, Yateras, and Imias.  It has also been necessary to evacuate more than 12,000 heads of  cattle. The Provincial Defense Council's concern as well as that  of the State's highest leadership, which has kept itself  informed on the decisions made and solutions determined  regarding each case, is constant.    There is a reason for saying water costs the people of  Guantanamo a lot: sometimes because there is too little water;  other times because there is too much. Nevertheless, we continue  our struggles against nature because life goes on. [end  recording]     "

In an editorial on the recent occupations of the Belgian and  German embassies and the Chilean consulate, the official  newspaper of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba stressed the  only solution for the embassy occupiers, who number slightly  more than 100 and want to travel to the United States, ""is to  unconditionally withdraw the same way they entered.""    The newspaper explains that the Cuban Government has  guaranteed the German and Belgian Governments that the people  involved in the incidents, except those charged with common  crimes, will be granted immunity and returned to their homes.    Recalling the various methods used by different U.S.  Administrations to encourage desertions and proclaim ""with noisy  and loud publicity"" the need to exterminate the ""bad example""  Cuba has set on the continent, the newspaper states there has  been a recent intensification in the encouragement of illegal  escapes and forceful embassy occupations.    To foster these irresponsible actions, GRANMA adds, there  has  been a systematic denial of visas to individuals seeking  immigration. Immigration agreements have been violated, and  although legal obstacles are increasing, the coasts remain open  for well publicized welcomes to individuals who survive the  odyssey. Many people in Miami have made a profitable business  out of trafficking humans, the newspaper states.    If the purpose of this were truly humanitarian, the  editorial  states, it would suffice to grant visas to whomever has  requested one, to ban illegal entries to U.S. territory, and to  offer residency facilities. The newspaper states, however, that  it is ""a matter of a promised land that is not granted unless a  person risks his life.""    This is the case of the people who are occupying the three  missions, the newspaper says, explaining that among the guests  at the Belgian Embassy are 25 children, among them the youngest  ""political refugee"" on earth because he is only a few months old.    Also in the group are 25 individuals prosecuted for common  crimes, 34 who have been issued repeated warnings for markedly  antisocial behavior, and 46 have returned to their homes.    The newspaper describes as ""much more serious"" the fact that  the alleged refugees, who have occupied the Belgian ambassador's  residence, have used it to establish an alleged organization,  distribute propaganda, and put up posters.    The newspaper adds: ""We must remember embassies cannot be  used as centers of political activities against their host  countries because to do so would violate the functions for which  they are accredited.""    GRANMA states the Belgian Foreign Ministry has acted  responsibly by instructing its ambassador to inform his guests  of the illegality of their action.    We are respectful of every individuals' right to live  wherever he chooses, but we cannot allow ourselves to be taken  in by allowing embassies to classify simple immigrants under  nonexistent categories for personal, familiar, or economic  reasons or simply to seek an adventure, the newspaper stated,  adding ""this just goes too far.""    It would be easy to clear the way for those who decide to  occupy embassies, adds the newspaper, which then asks the  question, ""Who would be harmed by that? Who would be at the  mercy of any intruder seeking the immunity of an embassy's  territory for the purpose of migrating?""    GRANMA also asks what the position of the governments of  these countries would be if the Haitians, who are now being  repatriated en masse, chose instead to break into their  embassies or if the Mexican wetbacks chose to jump the fences of  European or Latin American embassies in Mexico City instead of  risking their lives on the border?    Cuba, the newspaper maintains, is responsible for protecting  the embassies and is duty bound to safeguard the immunity and  inviolateness of their territories and will honor this  commitment to the letter.    The best guarantee for those who represent their countries  in  Cuba, the editorial states, is that the experience of three  decades of resisting blackmail, a blockade, and direct and  indirect aggressions has taught us we cannot yield 1 inch. A  principle surrendered is a principle lost, the newspaper states.    The newspaper asks other questions, including: What do they  expect? The beginning of a new style of obtaining documents in  Cuba to enter a country, different from existing methods in  other capitals? Is it an effort to artificially create a  political situation for purposes suspiciously similar to those  with which the United States has been unsuccessful? Was it an  effort to taint the atmosphere surrounding our country during  the recently concluded Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena  de Indias?    After stressing Cuba will not tolerate pressures regardless  of from where they may come, GRANMA confirmed the Cuban Foreign  Ministry is totally willing to cooperate with accredited  diplomatic missions to sensibly resolve their problem and even  to prevent future difficulties.

In statements made to Radio Santa Fe, the diplomat said such  accusations have been made to attempt to damage the relations  between both countries, which, he said, are excellent now.

Bishop Nel Beltran, which the newspaper EL TIEMPO mentions  as  one of the participants of the alleged meeting of guerrilla  commanders in Havana during the latter part of January, has told  two radio stations today he was not in Cuba at that time, is not  familiar with that country, and much less had met with the  people the newspaper has mentioned.    In a news conference held this afternoon, Colombian Foreign  Minister Sanin reported although the reports on this alleged  event have not been proven, they will ask the Cuban Government  for explanations,because the Prosecutor's Office has stated the  EL TIEMPO reports could be true.    She admitted if this were true, they would not ask for  explanations, and she said she hoped they will be satisfactory  to clarify the issue.

According to Ramon Pez Ferro, an official of the National  Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP], the group is headed  by Deputy Anial Pacheco Lopez, who has distinguished himself in  the Mexican parliament, and includes Agustin Basabe, president  of the Border Affairs Commission, Alberto Monteverde, Juan  Adrian, and Alfonso Ribera.    The visitors will meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Isabel  Allende and Lazaro Barredo, acting president of ANPP's  International Relations Commission. The delegation's agenda  includes meetings with leaders of the University Students  Federation and the Union of Young Communists [UJC], meetings  which will acquaint them with the Cuban reality and inform them  of the activities of the younger Cuban generations, Pez Ferro  said.    The Mexican deputies attended the local all-star baseball  game at the Latin American Stadium in Havana to commemorate the  UJC anniversary, the leading organization of young Cubans, on 4  April.    The Mexican deputies' visit to Cuba is part of a program  between the assemblies of the two countries to improve and  expand their relations.

Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma  Committee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen, by I.  Rotar; place and date not given: ""Become Our Satellites or  Perish]""    [Text]    That is the view held by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the  State Duma Comittee on CIS Affairs and Relations With Countrymen.    Revelations    [Zatulin] I am an admirer of the empire if it is understood  as imperial peace. I am not a proponent of ultranationalist  empires and regard that concept as a means for the maintenance  of peace. There is such a concept as sphere of influence, sphere  of vital interest, regardless of whether you are a democrat or  not. A small country must be happy that it is within the sphere  of influence of a big power. A vivid example of that is the  economic blossoming of postwar Japan when it was under the aegis  of the U.S.A. The policy in the CIS is the domestic policy of  Russia whether that offends anyone or not. We must win our  special role in the near abroad.    [Rotar] Do you recognize the territorial integrity of  countries of the near abroad?    [Zatulin] It is impossible to be pulling chestnuts out of  the  fire for others and recognize the territorial integrity of  states which never existed within those borders. With all due  respect for those states, many of them are destined to become  our satellites or perish and I recognize their territorial  integrity right up to that degree.    [Rotar] What meaning do you attach to the concept of a  satellite?    [Zatulin] Countries of the near abroad must conclude special  agreements establishing their special relations with Russia.  That is neither relations within the framework of the USSR nor  is it simply membership in the CIS the effectiveness of which is  under question. Our special relations must deal primarily with  the economy and the problem of national minorities living in  those states. Russia must assume the protection of Russians  living in the near abroad. If the national minorities live in  compact groups, they must be granted autonomy--the state must  become a federation. The special status of regions populated by  national minorities must be backed up with guarantees from  Moscow.    [Rotar] Could you indicate specifically which of the  countries in the near abroad should have autonomies?    [Zatulin] Georgia--Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Moldova--the  Dniester Region and Gagaus. Kazakhstan--northern part of the  republic. Ukraine--eastern regions and Crimea.    [Rotar] How do you view the political situation in Georgia?    [Zatulin] The viewpoint that everyone, except the Georgians,  is responsible for its troubles is still prevalent in Georgia.  Recently, for instance, we had a meeting with a Georgian  parliamentary delegation and one of its members consistently  stressed that Russia must grant every concession since Georgia  made a sacrifice by joining the CIS. This is some kind of a  hypertrophied concept of reality. Let us begin with the fact  that Russia helped the current leader of Georgia win in the most  acute domestic confrontation with the, by the way, legal,  president Eduard Gamsakhurdia. That gave Shevardnadze a great  advantage (I am not even going to mention that Russia saved him  from death in Abkhazia). Russia confirmed the territorial  integrity of Georgia whereas in reality it does not exist,  helped the republic economically, and in return received only  the entry of that state into the CIS which thus far is a rather  amorphous formation.    [Rotar] In your opinion what future awaits Ukraine?    [Zatulin] This is a complicated question. I believe that  here  there are fewer chances than in Moldova and Georgia that  objective realities will be recognized. One political wing  (mainly those who came from Western Ukraine) is adamantly  dreaming of participation in all foreign political blocs hostile  to Russia and visualizes the only possibility for existence of  an independent Ukrainian state to be with the support of the  enemies of Russia. But I am still hoping that the resolution of  the problem will be the same as in Moldova and Georgia: alliance  with Russia and a special status reinforced with guarantees by  Moscow for eastern regions and Crimea. This is the only  relatively peaceful outcome. The other variant means the  disintegration of Ukraine.    [Rotar] Today Russian soldiers are dying in Tajikistan. One  of the more widespread explanations of the reason for  nonwithdrawal of the Russian army from that country consists is  that Russia has no funds for the maintenance of a new border  region. But even today Moscow is compelled to invest significant  sums in that country. Tajikistan may turn into a bottomless pit  for Russian money.    [Zatulin] Any expenditure is justified to preserve that  outpost.    [Rotar] Do you have disagreements with the Russian MID  [Ministry of Foreign Affairs]?    [Zatulin] After December, you understand what I am referring  to, the Russian MID sharply changed its positions and our  official positions are practically the same. It is true, I do  lack confidence that declarations of the Russian MID will be  implemented in practice.     "

Caldera assumes the presidency on 2 February.    On his way to Brazil, Lage stopped in Caracas for a few  hours  where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich  and Venezuelan businessmen.    The Cuban leader told reporters that the ties between both  nations are at a good level, and he said he had reasons to hope  that those ties would continue to progress because both nations  are very close.    Lage commented that in general that relations between the  Latin American governments and the people are progressing and  strengthening.    Lage exchanged points of view with Ochoa Antich on the  situation in Cuba and Venezuela. Ochoa Antich visited Havana  four months ago as part of the consulting mechanism that exists  between the foreign ministries of the two nations.    On the approximately $45 million debt that Havana has with  Caracas, Lage reiterated his government's willingness to find a  solution to meet this commitment.    Lage said: Currently our economic conditions are difficult.  It is difficult for us to cancel this debt soon; however,  together we could find -- in a spirit of understanding and  cooperation -- formulas that will allow Cuba to slowly pay off  its debt.

0,FT923-11789 ,"FT923-11789 _AN-CGWASAAWFT 920723   FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Kiev gripped in Russian stranglehold - Ukraine's economy will pay a heavy price for defying Moscow      By CHRYSTIA FREELAND      TRADE between Ukraine and Russia,   72 per cent of trade within the old Soviet Union - is grinding to a halt as the political link which sustained it breaks down. For troubled Ukrainian enterprise directors, the tale told by Mr Viktor Antonov, Ukrainian minister for conversion and the defence industry, is distressingly familiar. He was asked this spring to produce 10 T-8 tanks for the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence but found that Ukraine's mighty military industrial complex, which Khrushchev once bragged was capable of 'churning out rockets like sausages,' was unable to fill the modest order because Russian enterprises would not supply the necessary parts. This was in spite of the formal co-operation agreement signed in April by Mr Antonov and his Russian counterpart. The situation is likely to get worse. Like the Comecon countries which shared Ukraine's dependence on heavily-subsidised Russian oil, Ukraine could pay a heavy economic price for its determination to break out of the Russian orbit. According to Mr Evhen Baramikov, chief of the inter-republican trade department in the Ukrainian Ministry of Economy, Russian experts have warned Ukraine that the moment Ukraine introduces a separate currency Russia will demand world prices for oil. This threat underscores Ukraine's structural vulnerability in its trade with Russia. 'They can last a year without our food, but Russia can halt Ukrainian industry in a day,' says Mr Baramikov. 'We will eat our sugar while freezing in the dark.' Mr Baramikov said Ukraine was paying Rbs2,840 per tonne for Russian crude supplied according to inter-governmental agreements. If Ukraine remained in the rouble zone, Russia had offered to continue selling crude at between Rbs2,820 and Rbs3,500 per tonne, well below the world rate. However, that enticement to remain in the Russian economic sphere is less attractive than it might seem because even today Russian oil sold to Ukraine at the subsidised rate covers barely half of the requirements of Ukrainian enterprises. Ukraine traditionally purchased 52m tonnes of oil from Russia each year. This year that has been cut to 40m tonnes and in the first quarter of 1992 Russia supplied Ukraine with only 7.4m tonnes at subsidised rates. Ukraine is suffering even more extreme shortages of the coal, gasoline and lumber normally supplied by Russia. In the first three months of 1992, Ukraine received only 14.7 per cent of the lumber and 19.8 per cent of the coking coal Russia had pledged to deliver. The shortage of Russian fuel has a knock-on effect: in the first quarter of this year, Ukraine supplied Russia with only 13.8 per cent of the black metal and 35.4 per cent of the tubing it had agreed to provide. The mounting political hostility between Ukraine and Russia is one explanation for the collapse in trade. Mr Baramikov describes negotiations with Russia as acrimonious and emotional encounters in which 'the Russians try to turn the thumb-screws on us'. But trade is also jeopardised by the economic limbo in which the former Soviet Union is trapped. 'The old system no longer works,' Mr Baramikov says, 'but there is no new mechanism yet.' Enterprises were responsible under the old system to central planners, not to each other. The planners provided raw material, dictated how much they should produce and disposed of their products. Today, the planners still set guidelines - they are the men who draft the huge inter-state trade deals - but, as the non-fulfilment of the agreements demonstrates, their word is no longer law. The hybrid system in operation today has bred some costly distortions. For example, some Ukrainian enterprises have fulfilled or over-fulfilled their obligations to Russian customers without being paid because they know their national bank will make up any shortfall. Hence Ukrainian factories' shipped 2 1/2 times the eggs and twice the processed foods which Kiev had agreed to supply to Russia. The Ukrainian national bank hopes to put a stop to this costly practice by abolishing the old payments system, but Ukrainian experts claim that Ukrainian enterprises have amassed debt of up to a thousand billion roubles owed by Russian enterprises which seem unlikely to repay it. To avoid these sorts of loopholes Mr Baramikov thinks that 'we should open our borders and not block our enterprises from trading directly.'

The meeting is  sponsored by the Eurosolar organization, UNESCO, and other  organizations.    The workshop was organized by the Cuban Ministry of Science,  Technology, and the Environment [as received]. Almost 100  foreign specialists -- mostly Argentines, Mexicans, and Italians  -- will attend the workshop. The same number of Cuban  specialists will also attend.    Jose M. Oriol, an engineer and president of the organizing  committee, told PRENSA LATINA that the meeting will include  conferences and seminars by renowned personalities, such as  Enrico Turrini, the vice president of the Eurosolar group.  Turrini will speak about the environment, independence, and  democracy.    Besides the investigative presentations, there will be  several symposiums and round tables on photo voltage power,  converting solar energy into heat, solar energy, the  environment, and solar and aeolian energy architecture; there  will also be a technological exhibit.    Cuba is looking at alternate energy sources to address the  acute energy crisis it is currently experiencing, after the  disappearance of the USSR, which was once its main supplier of  fuel oil.    A world conference on biomass energy generation,  development,  and the environment will be held in Havana in January of 1995.  Eurosolar, UNESCO, and the Latin American Energy Organization  (OLADE), among other organizations interested in promoting  sustainable energy generation, will sponsor this gathering as  well.     "

The  most hostile elements went as far as to launch a campaign of  terror against a group of U.S.-based emigres who came to Havana  in late April to participate in the meeting, which the attendees  described as very useful.    Cubans, who until now have comprised the so-called silent  majority, prevented by the right from expressing their views in  favor of a dialogue with the island's government, are beginning  to defy extremists like the members of the Cuban American  National Foundation [FNCA], one of the groups that has tried  hardest to minimize the scope of the Havana meeting.    Raymundo del Toro, president of the Cuban-American Committee  for Peace, in a letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, pointed out that  his only son lives in Cuba and all members of his group have  relatives on the island. That is why, Del Toro noted, we will  no longer be the silent majority who remain quiet in the face of  attacks by opportunistic politicians like Representative Robert  Torricelli, who sponsored the amendment that stiffened the  blockade on Cuba, and egomaniacs like Jorge Mas Canosa, head of  the FNCA.    In his letter to THE NEW YORK TIMES, Del Toro affirmed that  the important thing about the aforementioned conference is the  agreements reached, not whether the participants had a chat with  Cuban President Fidel Castro. Del Toro is among the emigres who  left the meeting satisfied, as its balance was significant in  terms facilites for emigrants.    In the opinion of Andres Gomez, coordinator of the Antonio  Maceo Brigade, the changes in migration policy that eliminate  the five-year waiting period for Cubans who left the country  legally to return to the country will benefit thousands of  Cubans eager to have more fluid relations with their family  members and country of origin. Although this was not the only  agreement reached in Havana, the extreme right among the emigres  and in the Western media insist on saying that participants in  the conference left empty-handed. In this letter, Del Toro  regretted that the meeting in Havana has been downplayed.    During a news conference in Miami, Gomez took a step farther  in asking: Why do the gentlemen of the extreme right and the  media refuse to hold a debate? Are not they always claiming  they are democrats? Let them dare to practice what they claim  to be.     "

[Anatoliy Chubays] These words epitomize the essence of what  the party sees as a goal for Russia as a whole and what the  party has to offer as Russian values. [ passage omitted on  Chubays expanding on the importance of the above concepts]    [Correspondent] Anatoliy Borisovich, the party has changed  its name from Russia's Choice to Russia's Democratic Choice....    [Chubays, interrupting] Yes, there were long and heated  debates about the name. As a result, I believe a very correct  version was chosen. Many people said that we should not do that  because the word democratic had lost its attractiveness, and  many people did not respond to it any longer. But I agree with  those who argued that we should not try to recruit supporters  from among those who are not our supporters. We have a position  and a policy and our own view of things which we offer to anyone  who is ready to listen to it. Yes, we support the democratic  choice. We supported it when it was popular and continue to do  so after it has lost its popularity, perhaps. Generally  speaking, a true politician should not seek popularity, but  popularity should find its politician, the one who does not  change his position even in difficult conditions. That is why  the new name Russia's Democratic Choice appeared.    [Correspondent] Upon whom do you rely most?    [Chubays] A report at the party congress [held 12-13 June]  was devoted to just this question. We were told about a  large-scale sociological study of those who voted for the  Russia's Choice, that is, those upon whom we rely. What  transpired was that if a general image of supporters of the  Russia's Choice were drawn, it would show an educated person,  though not necessarily a doctor or candidate of sciences. It  could be a well-trained worker, or engineering and technical  personnel, aged 25 to 45-50, as a rule. This person understands  that the country and the economy are in a difficult situation;  nevertheless, he does not think that everything has collapsed  catastrophically, that life is over, and that the only thing to  do is to commit suicide. This person is inclined to believe in  himself, in his own capabilities, and has certain grounds for  this, like education, positive thinking, and so on. In other  words, this is the strata that has saved Russia and our economy  through its work. So this sociological study we were told about  is very encouraging. It shows that the party relies upon the  people to whom the future belongs.    [Correspondent] Why should a vice premier, who has problems  up to his ears, want to deal with party affairs?    [Chubays] I will not hide that I was a little sceptical,  especially looking at our numerous parties, which are  mushrooming and disappearing without having really changed  anything. I will tell you frankly that the congress itself, the  people who gathered and the serious, substantial, and committed  way the congress' real work was done had a very strong effect on  me. There were fears that it could turn into some kind of  democratic tea party, with senseless discussions of procedural  matters, like why Article Five or Six of the Charter uses a  comma instead of an and or why this wording was chosen over  another. However, it turned out that the overwhelming majority  of the people who gathered at the congress and who devoted  themselves to the cause are people who understand very well what  is really important and significant, people who are ready to  devote themselves to this work. Being fully aware that, on the  whole, this work is unlikely to be a bed of roses, and many can  even expect to be hurt because many of them have difficult  relations with local authorities, people came, nevertheless, and  people are and will be working. They have already had the  experience of last October and March 1993 and many other events  which they have lived through in Russia where they work and  live. Looking at these people, one understands that this is not  empty talk, not a ticket to an ego trip, but a real cause which  requires real strength and work. That is why I worked, work  now, and will continue this work despite all my government  duties.    [Correspondent] When do you think a breakthrough will come  and in what shape? When will the country see a better life?    [Chubays] Naturally we discussed this issue. I must say,  though, that the congress discussed such noneconomic issues as  military reform, relations with CIS countries, the  countryside--a lot of attention was paid to this. As regards  your question, there is the following view: If the policy that  is being implemented in Russia today, the government's and the  president's policy, retains a reformist component of the kind  represented by the latest package of presidential decrees,  experts from the Russia's Choice believe that there is quite a  real possibility that 1994 can become a year of stabilization  and 1995 can become a year when the Russian economy starts  overcoming the crisis.    [Correspondent] What other steps should be taken to make  reforms irreversible and then to bring if not prosperity then at  least a certain amount of well being the shortest possible way?    [Chubays] A lot has to be done. First, the legislative base  of reforms is still very inadequate, that is, the very word,  legality, we mentioned earlier. Today, unfortunately, the  largest part of economic foundation is made up of presidential  edicts, not laws. After six months of work the Duma can  scarcely credit itself with any major legislative decisions.  But this is very important because law is a kind of stable  long-term foundation on which stable economic relations, stable  investments, and so on can be built.    [Correspondent] Does the president support you?    [Chubays] One must mention that Yegor Gaydar has discussed  with the president more than once our work within the framework  of Russia's Choice. The president supports our activity, and  the party supports a reformist president, something that was  stated officially at a news conference. I am convinced that if  Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is a candidate in the 1996  presidential elections, Russia's Democratic Choice will be a  party which will unequivocally support Yeltsin's candidature.    [Correspondent] Are you going to nominate a candidate of  your  own?    [Chubays] But Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin is our candidate.     "

Noting that the victory of the Cuban revolution was an  epoch-making event that terminated domination and subjugation,  backwardness and poverty on the land of Cuba and opened a way of  socialism guaranteeing sovereignty and independence, creation  and prosperity, the editorial article says:    The 35 years covered by the Cuban people after the victory  of  the revolution have been a course of constant confrontation and  struggle with the imperialist reactionaries and days in which  they decorated their history with creation and innovation. The  socialist changes and the victorious progress of the revolution  in those years clearly indicate that no force on earth can block  the road of socialism of the heroic Cuban people.    The Korean people note with high appreciation that the Cuban  people are defending the country's sovereignty and national  dignity and accelerating socialist construction, not yielding to  any adversity.    The militant comradeship and unity between the peoples of  Korea and Cuba have been further consolidated and developed in  the course of overcoming trials together and struggling hand in  hand for the common cause.    Friendship and unity between Korea and Cuba are an excellent  model of comradely relations between the peoples of  revolutionary countries.    The Korean people will, in the future, too, make every  possible effort to strengthen and fully develop their friendship  and unity with the Cuban people.    The just cause of the Cuban people will certainly end in  victory.     "

Vice Foreign Minister Allende who is on a  working visit to Spain said that, as in every relation, the  parties involved have differing views on some topics, but the  important thing is the attitude assumed to overcome the  differences and difficulties. During her stay in Madrid, Isabel  Allende met with high-ranking Spanish Foreign Ministry officials  with whom she discussed bilateral matters such as the progress  being made by the joint scientific and cultural and technical  and industrial commissions. Allende also talked about Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's upcoming trip to Spain.  Robaina was been invited to visit the country by his Spanish  counterpart, Javier Solana.    Many Madrid newspapers today reported on Vice Foreign  Minister Allende's visit to Spain. The fact that the newspapers  covered Allende's visit has been interpreted as a sign of  interest in the island which has opened up to foreign  investment, mainly Spain's. In response to questions asked by  reporters about the blockade, Allende said that this U.S.  measure against Cuba is illegal, that it violates international  laws, and denies the precepts of a market economy, which is  based on freedom of trade, enterprise, and navigation. Allende  also admitted that since President Bill Clinton assumed office,  a less aggressive language toward Cuba has been evidenced;  however, this does not mean that their policy toward the island  will change. Allende, who is currently visiting the Cuban  consulates in Barcelona, Vigo, and Sevilla, will return to the  island next week.     "

The tour began  with a visit to the Qatari Steel Company, a steel plant that  utilizes more than 100 workers and produced more than 7 million  tons of steel in 1993.    A management delegation representing this steel company  visited Cuba recently and expressed its interest in establishing  cooperation in this field with the Cuban Government. The Cuban  foreign minister reiterated to the Qatari company Cuba's  willingness to encourage an exchange of expertise in this field  in which the island has a considerable infrastructure.    Robaina and the delegation accompanying him also visited the  Qatari Fertilizer Company, which was founded in 1969 and is  considered the largest ammonium manufacturing company in the  Middle East. This Monday, the Cuban foreign minister will be  received by Amir Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the Qatari chief  of state, and will also meet with the ministers of foreign  relations, health, and finance.

The  reporters note that Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina has  discussed this issue and that most Cuban emigration has been of  an economic nature -- with the exception of the exodus of 1959,  when hundreds of professionals and political henchmen and other  kinds of criminals left for political reasons. In conclusion,  the reporters note the way the United States, by giving a hero's  welcome to those who make such a trip while denying visas to  ordinary Cuban citizens, encourages dangerous attempted  departures by rafters.    Next, reporter Tony Gonzalez Martin conducts a five-minute  telephone interview of Cuba exile Nicolas Rios, who lives in  Miami, publishes the magazine CONTRAPUNTO, and received PRENSA  LATINA's 1993 journalism award.    Asked how people in Miami feel about the rafters in light of  the recent deaths of nine people -- five of whom were minors --  Rios stresses that it is a known fact that the Cuban Government  grants anyone with a visa and the money to buy a ticket  permission to leave Cuba. However, despite having signed an  accord to that effect, the U.S. Government fails to grant the  20,000 visas a year for which the accord calls. This is why  rafters take to the seas -- adds Rios.    Rios points out that official U.S. and Miami stations  encourage people to do this by giving rafters a hero's welcome.  He stresses that responsibility lies with those, both in Miami  and within the U.S. Government, who control public opinion.    In conclusion, Rios stresses that the Cuban community's  opinion cannot be perceived properly because there is no room in  the media for those whose opinions differ from the official  position. He adds that many reject such oppression but have no  means for saying so.    An announcer conducts a telephone interview with a relative  of one of those who died recently at sea. The relative stresses  that the idea of leaving in a raft ""got just stuck"" in the  deceased's head.    The announcer plays a 1967 recording of a Radio Havana Cuba  program entitled ""Our Leaders Respond"" in which former Cuban  Foreign Minister Raul Roa Kouri addresses the issue of  emigration from Cuba. In this recording, Roa says the Cuban  Government's policy has always been to let people go freely;  that the United States, which blocks legal departures, is  responsible for the plight of the rafters; and that all of that  is part of a smear campaign against Cuba.    The announcer reiterates that Cuba continues to abide by the  1984 immigration accords.     "

The government organized the ""The Nation and the Emigrants  Conference"" and limited its goals to the following: To begin  changing ideas in order to reach an eventual normalization of  relations between Cuba and Cubans living abroad.    Cubans who call for the armed overthrow of Castro and who  support the U.S. trade, economic, and financial embargo against  Cuba that has been in effect since 1962 were excluded from the  meeting.

In short, Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus has scored a big  success  in Russia, the paper writes, adding that besides a largely  routine agreement on the support and protection of investments  and a 1994 bilateral trade agreement, Klaus's mission to Russia  is notable for achieving a visible turnabout in the Russian  approach to bilateral relations.    If until now Russia has been accepting Czech payments for  oil  and other raw materials while allowing Czech imports go unpaid  for, this policy has now probably come to an end. The two  countries' finance ministries have until the end of May to draw  up a document which would set out terms for the Russian debt  repayment.    The Czech Republic has at long last been deemed to be a  country with which it pays to have good long-term relations  instead of shortsightedly abusing Czech dependence on oil from  Russia, the paper writes.    In recent years, Russia has acquired a bad image in general,  but especially as regards the economy. The Russian economy is  incredibly inefficient and the limping reform is not expected to  improve noticeably in the years to come.    In view of the lack of recovery factors it comes as no  surprise that quality of goods does not improve. And yet in  some respects Russia has remained an economic superpower, the  paper writes.    Russian trade balance registered a $19.5 billion surplus in  1993 with the balance of payments running even. The country,  therefore, has not run further into debt, the paper says.    Russia's overall foreign debt has attained the $80 billion  mark but even so, its value per head remains lower than, to give  an example, the one for the Czech Republic, not to mention other  former Warsaw Pact countries except Romania.    Russia, then, does not belong to countries hopelessly in  debt  which should or must be allowed some write-offs. Such an  approach would be mistaken both in logic and the assessment of  reality, the paper says.    The lasting quality of what has been achieved, however, is  to  be doubted as it depends on Russia remaining stable. In any  case, the Czech negotiating position will improve markedly once  the Ingolstadt oil pipeline has been built, doing away with the  dependence on its pipeline from Russia.    That said, the Czech Government's fundamental policy should  aim to recapture the Russian market. The partial capitalization  of Russian debt, meaning that Russian firms are sold to Czech  investors, would be a meaningful contribution to that end. The  question is, however, the paper asks, whether Czech companies  are capable yet of such an expansion.    LIDOVA DEMOKRACIE, writing on the same theme, says that  during his two days in Moscow, Klaus presented himself as being  on an equal footing with his counterparts and as someone who  does not even shrink from telling unpalatable facts.    Klaus's thoroughly pragmatic or even utilitarian approach  found expression in shifting the emphasis from the past,  exemplified by the Russian debt and the vassal-like attitude of  the former COMECON countries to the Soviet Union, to the future,  ideally conceived as one of standard trade relations between two  countries with equal rights.    In contrast to the former ""mutually unprofitable  cooperation""  Klaus proposed ""business as usual,"" the paper says.     "

Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the administration would 'take every measure to protect the US and to prevent such activities from being carried out in the future'. He insisted, however, that Russia's progress towards elective democracy and a market economy was more important to the US's strategic interests. 'Events in Russia over the past few weeks have revived our fears about the future. The dangers in Russia are very real, but I would want to emphasise that these events should be put into perspective,' Mr Christopher told the Senate committee on foreign relations. US officials were certainly not under the illusion that the KGB's successor agencies had entirely given up operations in the US, nor has the CIA stopped spying in Russia. Nevertheless, Monday's arrest of Mr Aldrich Ames, a senior CIA official, makes it more difficult for the administration to argue publicly for large sums of financial aid to Russia. Charges filed against him in a federal court alleged that he continued spying for the Russian foreign intelligence service, in return for a total of Dollars 1.5m, after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Senator Dennis DeConcini, chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, called last night for a 60-day freeze on aid to Russia. 'We're handing over Dollars 2bn to the Russians, and it seems to me it's not asking too much to ask them to back off this kind of stuff,' he said. Russia yesterday sought to play down the issue, pointing out that both countries continued to spy on each other. 'It would be inappropriate to blow this story into a political scandal. After all, intelligence, even in a changing world, remains intelligence, with its own specific methods and interests,' Itar-Tass said. 'Nothing has changed,' said Mr Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first deputy director of the External Intelligence Service recently. The latter was hived off from the former KGB with the Soviet Union's collapse, while domestic operations were concentrated in a new Security Ministry which in December was replaced by the Federal Counter-Intelligence Service. The Russian paymasters of Mr Ames and other spies were doubtless seeking the same sort of information as most other intelligence agencies, with the added suspicion that their former cold war enemy was seeking to make the most of chaos in the former Soviet Union. Russia's new weaknesses range from political instability, a loss of water-tight borders as a result of the Soviet Union's collapse, and the creation around it of a dozen new states, which Russia says are also spying on it. Without giving details, one Russian security source, obviously proud of the public news of a Russian success in penetrating US intelligence, said yesterday that Mr Ames had been an important agent. Mr Ames's former role in counter-intelligence would have given him access to sensitive details of the CIA's own agents in the former Soviet Union, as well as to the CIA's efforts to ensure that it was not penetrated in turn by the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, US officials appear to be ready to smooth over the row so long as Russia is willing to go through the motions of contrition. Among other gestures, the US would like Russia voluntarily to withdraw those of its diplomats who were involved with Mr Ames. It would also like Russia to refrain from expelling the CIA's station chief in Moscow, which in the cold war years would have been a traditional tit-for-tat measure. Although the CIA is smarting over the discovery of a 'mole' so high in its ranks, the case may help the agency make the case for preserving the US intelligence budget, which has come under fire in Congress as overblown for the post-cold war era. Mr James Woolsey, director of central intelligence, has argued that the CIA is needed more than ever both in tracking new threats such as terrorism or nuclear proliferation, and in economic intelligence, which he has described as 'the hottest current topic in intelligence policy'.

0,FT933-1483 ,"FT933-1483 _AN-DIWC2AF3FT 930923   FT  23 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wind of change hits Cuban agriculture - This year's storms have brought tentative reform in their wake      By CANUTE JAMES   THE CUBAN government is reorganising its agriculture in an effort to lift production of domestic crops and end chronic shortages, as well as to strengthen the weakened sugar sector, on which the island's economy is heavily dependent. Cuban agriculture has been hit hard by a reduction in the availability of inputs because the economy is strapped for hard currency to finance imports. This has been compounded by two bouts of bad weather earlier this year that led to flooded fields and heavy crop losses. The government's new strategy is based on allowing increased private participation in agriculture, with the establishment of new co-operative and individually-run farms. But these will still operate within the framework of a centrally-controlled economy. It has also announced that the impending sugar harvest will start earlier than normal, and will be shortened, to allow cane farms more time to plant for future harvests, and to give the industry a chance to recover from the lack of chemicals and machinery and the effects of the bad weather. A freak storm in March, which brought high winds and heavy rain, flattened and flooded thousands of acres of canes and reduced the sugar content of the plants that could be reaped. It also destroyed and blocked roads in farming areas and damaged several of the country's 157 sugar mills. Cuba's citrus industry also suffered, as did potato and fruit growers. The cost of the storms to the economy, including damage to roads, buildings and agriculture, was put by international aid agencies at between USDollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn. In early June the island's agriculture was again hit by heavy rains brought by a tropical depression. In the wake of shortages of locally-produced food caused by the bad weather, the Cuban government has said it will give some degree of administrative and financial independence to the new co-operative and individual farmers, who are being given state-owned land. The intention, said the government, was to increase the output of a range of agricultural products, including sugar, by giving farm workers an incentive to produce. Their earnings will be determined by the productivity of the co-operatives. The new co-operative farms will continue to be supervised by the state while exercising autonomy in day-to-day management. They will work the land for an indefinite period, will own and dispose of what they produce, and will have their own bank accounts. The changes, which the government says are 'innovative', are coming seven years after the sudden termination of another programme to encourage private farming and marketing of domestic food crops. The government said then that some private peasant farmers and distributors had become corrupt and too rich at the expense of consumers. This year's bad weather compounded already serious problems for the sugar industry. Mills had been running about 25 per cent behind target at the end of February, mainly because of the government's inability to import adequate fuel and replacement parts. Cane production and milling had also been set back by shortages of chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides, and spares and fuel for harvesters, trucks and tractors. The faltering economy has been dealt a body blow by the failure of this year's harvest. Production was 4.15m tonnes, 40 per cent less than last year and half the level reached in better years. The government was forced to cancel shipments to some buyers, further reducing foreign earnings. The government is basing its plans for a recovery on growing more cane, and is apparently expecting another poor harvest next year. Mr Nelson Torres, the sugar minister, has said the next harvest will begin and end early, making way for increased cultivation 'in order to have a much greater volume of cane for the next harvests'. The minister has exhorted workers in the sugar industry to be more efficient, and said the government was hoping that the next harvest would be bigger than the last. Analysts have said that the volume of cane that Cuba will produce for the next harvest, and the state of the mills, indicated higher output next year, but not more than 5.2m tonnes.

This is evident from a report, entitled  ""Comprehensive Analysis of the Situation in Russia and  Developments Forecast,"" drawn up by the Center for Social and  Strategic Studies and presented at a news-conference in Moscow  on Tuesday.    The report says that scientific research and high technology  development has shrunk by 73 percent over the last two years  while industry has been increasingly oriented on raw material  output. The percentage of fuel, energy, metal, and chemicals in  industrial production costs soared to 50 percent in 1993 from 30  percent in 1989-1991 whereas the share of machinery and consumer  goods dwindled from 44 percent to 28 percent.    ""Industrial decline is underway with an explicitly one-sided  trend toward raw material production,"" the report underlines.    The government's economic policy last year is described as  ""the continuation of reforms without macroeconomic  stabilization."" The cabinet's strategy to bridge the budget  deficit through reduced state expenditures proved ineffective.    Although efforts to keep the budget deficit within 10  percent  succeeded this year, in fact this gap has proved larger than the  officially announced deficiency since some profits and  liabilities, like foreign loans and payment of interest on state  debt, have been inaccurately declared.    Experts believe that there can be no talk of any national  development unless the ruling political elite consolidates  itself.    At the same time, they point to the problem of political  terror in Russia. In their opinion, last year's series of  murders of bankers was politically motivated.     "
0,FT943-15362 ,"FT943-15362 _AN-EGJAPADKFT 940709   FT  09 JUL 94 / Let's get down to business, comrade: As Russia's old system collapses, a dynamic market economy is taking its place      By DANIEL YERGIN and THANE GUSTAFSON   Ivan is one of the new Russian businessmen who seem to have come from nowhere. Six years ago, he was a special education teacher. Now he is owner or director of 20 companies, which range from insurance to manufacturing of clothes, furniture and china to trading and importing. It was the importing that interested the mafia. Ivan's offices are at the top of a worn-out office building. The water often goes off and hallways are dingy. But Ivan's own suite is a world of stylish, modern furniture. On the day the mafia called, six of the gangsters stayed downstairs, while five took the elevator up to his office. They knew that Ivan had received a shipment of cigarettes worth Dollars 200,000 from the west. It was on consignment, meaning that he had not yet paid for it. They wanted those cigarettes. To make sure Ivan knew they were serious, two of them ostentatiously put guns on the table. 'They're not mine,' said Ivan. 'I can't give them away.' The gangsters did not care. They wanted the goods. Ivan asked for time, excused himself and went into another office. He was shaking. He hurriedly called a friend who was an officer in the FSK, the successor to the KGB. An FSK squad arrived quickly: on the way up, they arrested the six men downstairs. They then met Ivan, who had not yet gone back to his own office, and put a recording device on him. Ivan returned to the room where the gangsters waited for his answer. They said their patience was not endless; they threatened him and his family. They described the different ways they had killed people. Ivan asked for more time. The mafia boss stood up to leave. He made it clear that he expected the matter to be resolved very soon. Some of his men remained, to keep up the pressure. Then, on a pre-arranged signal, Ivan said: 'There's no need for you to be here.' At that moment, the FSK men broke in with their guns drawn. They scooped up the guns on the table and ordered the gangsters up against the wall, frisked them, removing other guns, and then took them away in handcuffs. Recalling the scene a few weeks later, Ivan was still shaken: 'It looked like an American film.' That is one face of emerging Russian capitalism - a combination of the wild west, America's 19th century robber barons, and Chicago in the 1930s. But it is only one face of the new market economy that is developing in Russia much faster than is generally recognised. In our book Russia 2010, we try to offer a preliminary sketch of how Russian-style capitalism might look in the year 2010. It might bear more resemblance to Italian or Latin American capitalism (before privatisation) than the US or Japanese versions. But whatever its final shape, elements of Russian capitalism are already in place. Early in the next century, people may even be talking about 'a Russian economic miracle'. Russians are as surprised as anyone. 'The market is developing much more rapidly than I would have thought possible even a year ago,' said Evgenii Yasin, one of the chief economic advisers to President Boris Yeltsin. 'Unlike socialism,' Yasin added wryly, 'you don't have to 'build' capitalism. It builds itself.' Russia is certainly going through wrenching changes: industrial output continues to plummet; many workers are not receiving their salaries; and many enterprises are not being paid. Savings have been wiped out by inflation and well-trained professionals are today earning only the equivalent of Pounds 60 or Pounds 70 a month. A distinguished musicologist, for instance, now sells mineral water on the streets of Moscow. Meanwhile, people who would have been regarded as 'social parasites' in Soviet days drive around in Mercedes, with personal bodyguards. Crime is pervasive: by one estimate, a third of all bank employees are security guards. Yet what one sees does not match the dismal numbers. Colour is appearing on buildings and in shop windows, enlivening the drabness of even a year or two ago. The billboards extolling the achievements of Soviet communism have been replaced by signs advertising American candybars, Korean electronic goods, and Russian banks. The residential construction boom on the outskirts of Moscow and other cities is so strong that it has caused a shortage of bricks. And Moscow even has its own version of Wall Street - a long row of interconnected office buildings two miles from the Kremlin. 'The country is supposed to be in a deep economic crisis, but the traffic jams in Moscow get bigger and bigger,' a foreign diplomat commented sardonically. Which is the 'real' Russia - that of the great depression or the emerging market? The answer is both. Even while the old system continues to collapse, with perhaps the worst yet to come, a dynamic market economy is beginning to take its place. Will it ever be fully functioning? Boris Fedorov, the former Russian finance minister, answered that question only half facetiously: 'Why not? We already have a malfunctioning market economy.' No one has any idea of how big this market economy is. The statistics of the Great Russian Depression capture only the official, measurable economy. Industrial production should be declining, as the lop-sided military-industrial economy runs down. But there are no accessible numbers on the private economy. In the Soviet era, managers had every incentive to exaggerate their economic performance, to meet their targets. Today, the incentive is just the opposite - to minimise figures to avoid the taxman (whether from the government or the mafia) and to evade regulations. Visit Astrakhan, the caviar capital of the world, and ask how much caviar is being produced these days: 'Officially, 550 tons a year,' said a local caviar expert. And unofficially? 'Maybe twice that, maybe five times - who knows?' Beyond the visible and the anecdotal, there is some circumstantial evidence of the rapid growth of the private economy. Real incomes are growing by 10 per cent a year, and reported consumption levels have almost recovered to 1990 levels. At this point, Russian-style capitalism is capitalism at its rawest. It is, as some Russians say, the era of 'primitive accumulation of capital'. After all, you cannot have capitalism without capitalists. The country is caught in a great battle to gain control of the resources, property, and political power that are being set free by the collapse of the old order. 'Crime cannot be controlled,' said one deputy in the Duma, the new parliament, 'until the struggle for property is finished.' The distance Russia has to go to develop a modern market economy is highlighted when one considers the common features that underlie the many different 'brands' of capitalism around the world. One is a competitive price system; a second is a system of agreed-upon 'rules of the game'. The latter extend from general values, such as that the market should not be a corrupter, to specific laws and regulation. They also include norms - for instance, a dispute over a contract should not be settled by murder but by a court. And a market system is embedded in a legal, cultural, and institutional context that supports its workings. By these criteria, Russia has a long way to go on the road to a mature market system. This is what Russians mean when they say that what they have is 'a bazaar, not an economy'. A body of rules and laws is yet to be written. Even lawyers are in short supply and good independent judges are even more scarce. The concept of property, fundamental to a market system, is far from worked out. Moreover, things could go badly wrong over the next few years. Conflict between Russia and its newly-independent neighbours is an obvious risk; a severe unemployment crisis - promoted by the eventual collapse of the old military industrial enterprises - could provide fertile ground for demagogues and civil unrest. And if unchecked, crime could prevent development of the market, destroy the morale and ambition of entrepreneurs, and undermine the legitimacy of the state. Russians themselves, we have found, are fascinated, if also amused, by the very idea of writing a book called Russia 2010. They hardly have any framework for thinking about the future. Uncertainty and insecurity characterise their lives. Everything they took for granted has disappeared - economic security, the dictatorship of the Communist Party and the control of the KGB, the predictability of life and the delivery of food by the enterprise that employs them, the stupefying cant of Marxism, safety in the streets, a yearly holiday in the Crimea and the Soviet Union as a superpower. Thus, it is hard to find anyone who will describe themselves as optimistic. A distinguished academician, who is also deeply engaged in the private sector, is asked what he expects for the future. He replied: 'I think of the last line in a letter my grandfather wrote from Stalin's gulag: 'Hope for the best, and expect the worst'.' Yet it is remarkable how much has been accomplished in the brief time since communism collapsed. A driving force of change has been the voucher privatisation programme, celebrated last year in the hit song 'Wow Wow Voucher'. Anatoly Chubais, privatisation minister, said the objective of this hectic programme was to make the destruction of socialism 'irreversible'. However imperfect, it may well have worked. Most small shops and enterprises are now in private hands and an estimated 40 per cent of the workforce now works in the private economy. Over the next two years, the newly-elected Duma has the challenging job of privatising land, and writing the laws and creating the financial structures for a market system. A new phase of the market system begins this month as 'voucher privatisation' gives way to a system under which state property will be sold for cash. In short, despite all the dangers ahead, Russian capitalism is already a reality. But to understand the direction of Russian capitalism, one must look beyond the 'Red Barons' - the Soviet industrial managers turned businessmen - and seek out younger people, such as Ivan, who are part of a post-communist generation that will build the market society. Ivan never knew his father; his mother was a cleaner. He did poorly at school. When Gorbachev started to encourage private business, he decided to make weight-lifting equipment. His workshop was so low he could not stand fully upright; at night, he worked as a taxi driver to support himself. He borrowed metalworking equipment and small tools from factory workers. He began with seven employees - by the end of the first year, he had 50. He stayed in the weight-lifting equipment business for three years. 'It's difficult to be a boss,' he said. 'I believed in communism. I was educated in it. The feeling of comradeship was very important. But, as a boss, you've lost your chains. You have a feeling of responsibility for those who come to work for you.' Now the groups Ivan either heads or is involved with employ 3,000 people. 'The fashion is over for weight-lifting,' he said. 'The fashion today is to work with finance and money. I now work day and night. I start at seven in the morning and go to 11 at night.' He owns his own apartment and five cars, but he keeps them locked in garages to prevent theft. To explain how business works in Russia today, Ivan told this story: 'Two people meet. The First one says: 'You want to buy a cartload of sugar?' The second one replies: 'Yes, fine.' They agree on price. 'Then the first one goes to see if he can buy a cartload of sugar, and the second goes to see if he can find some money. 'Business here is a gamble. You can make money one day, and it can all go wrong the next. You've got to risk. The biggest lesson of business for me is that you have to defend and attack.' He had a specific meaning in mind. He opened his coat, to reveal a glimpse of something that looked like a gun.

This was a closed-door session held at the  Convention Center. The address came during a debate regarding  democracy in Latin America, which included a clear reference to  Cuba. Brazilian President Itamar Franco then stated that the  only way Latin American peoples can help is by joining efforts  in supporting Cuba and its reintegration into the OAS. This  motivated Fidel to speak and I believe it is important for all  our listeners throughout Cuba to listen to his words.    [Begin Castro recording] I want to -- since my country,  Cuba,  has been mentioned repeatedly by several of the speakers --  first of all give thanks to those who care about Cuba. I can  feel a sincerity in what they have said. This is why I have  applauded each one. I know that at times when I speak, some do  not applaud. That is fine. I respect that. I believe this is a  democratic thing and each has to do what they believe is  pertinent. I have applauded everyone, some more enthusiastically  than others. From everyone I have truly felt -- and I thank you  for it -- a concern about Cuba.    It caught my attention, however -- this is why I appreciate  so much President Itamar Franco's gesture -- that not a word has  been said about the unfair, criminal, and inhuman blockade which  for over 30 years has been imposed against Cuba; the largest  ever blockade in the history of a Latin American country with  which no dialogue is sought. What is sought is to smother Cuba  in blood and make it surrender by hunger. This is the reality.    I would have liked to hear, within that Latin American  spirit, some reference to this. I believe our people also  deserve commendation if we keep in mind the heroism, firmness,  and dignity with which they have resisted for over 30 years the  U.S. blockade and aggression. Later on, we were left alone.  Many, when left alone, surrender. Yet we have not surrendered.  We have continued fighting because we are aware that we are  defending the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the  peoples of Latin America. This is, precisely, what Marti wanted  with Cuba's independence.    It amazes me that not a word has been said to the effect  that  Cuba is the country which has advanced the most socially in the  history of this hemisphere. We have done so much that I believe  we have done more than what was possible. Not a single word has  been said, as we speak about the social crisis in this  hemisphere and so many closed schools, to the effect that our  country, subjected to a double blockade, has not closed a single  hospital, a single school. It has not abandoned anyone. Our  country, even under the most difficult conditions, has struggled  and resisted.    In a hemisphere, which as you know well, whatever our  current, present, or definitive -- as you will --  accomplishments may be, which please me to no end....[pauses] We  know, however, that this hemisphere where we all live has the  worst distribution in the whole wide world by far. I am talking  about our region, with exceptions, of course, in certain  countries. This is the region with the worst distribution of  national income in the world and where so much remains to be  done. Yet, not a single word is said about it.    It also surprises me that not a single word has been said  about the joint position which we should present at the  notorious Miami summit. This is very important, vital, and  looming close.    Finally, I would like to state that I respect your views. I  sincerely respect your thoughts, concepts, and ideas about  democracy. We should hold a summit to discuss what is democracy  and what is meant by people's participation; what does it mean  that millions of people die in this hemisphere every year from  disease and hunger, millions who could be saved. It is our duty  to think about all of this if we are democratic, if we are human.    We have our ideas and views on democracy and do not feel  ashamed of them. With these views we have resisted and struggled  for 35 years. I believe the blows we have endured during these  35 years -- we cannot forget history -- since we were first  blockaded, way before the declaration of the socialist character  of the Revolution, when we were blockaded and our sugar quota  was apportioned among all ....[pauses] Cuba was left practically  alone with the highly noble exception of Mexico which maintained  ties and relations with us. I respect everyone's views. I  believe that if we are to speak about democracy, we have to  speak of a multiplicity of views and opinions.

Castro presided over the final event  organized by the FAR General Staff for the EJT's Havana  division, which was created nine months ago.    After analyzing the work done by the EJT, Gen. Castro  praised  these forces doing farm work in Havana, describing them as the  pride of the country. In a brief statement during the final  meeting, he supported a profound restructuring of the Ministry  of Agriculture, which he said is the cause of inefficiency in  state farms. Bureaucracy, he stressed, destroyed state  agriculture. On this matter, he had words of praise for current  Agriculture Minister Alfredo Jordan and added that he is certain  Jordan will successfully carry out the task of bringing more  products to the market. The EJT is a group within the FAR  devoted to work in the agricultural and livestock sector, and  since its founding 21 years ago [as heard] has became the most  productive of the entire country.    [Editorial note: Mexico City NOTIMEX at 1840 GMT on 26 May  carries a report citing the remarks by Gen. Raul Castro, as  reported by Cuban daily GRANMA. Castro is cited as urging the  EJT members to implement ""new formulas"" to eliminate  shortcomings, negligence, red tape, and theft. He is also cited  as saying that enforcement measures will implemented ""within the  law.""]     "

A detailed document by the Permanent International Relations  Commission of the National Assembly of the People's Government  handed to this reporter explains key aspects of this  aggressiveness, which endangers our national peace and security.    The document states, among other things, Cuba is living  today  under a partial military blockade despite statements by  high-ranking U.S. political leaders who have ruled out the  possibility of a military intervention on the island.    In this regard, it notes the decision to recondition the Air  Force Base in Homestead, Florida, which was destroyed by  Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and which was scheduled to be shut down  in early 1993. The reconditioning of this installation adds to  the increase in the number of planes and activity at the Key  West Air and Naval Station, located only 90 miles from the Cuban  coasts, and to the deployment of some 60 warships off Cuba's  eastern coast under the pretense of the Haitian crisis.    U.S. warplanes flew a little more than 64,000 missions over  the Florida strait during the last three years. During the  first half of 1993 more than 5,600 missions were flown, some  only 60 km away from Cuban territory.    The Cuban parliament has reported U.S. military forces are  constantly conducting surveillance operations of all kinds all  over Cuba. It is a growing trend as can be seen during the  first 10 months of 1993, when 88 flights of this kind had  already taken place versus the 45 flights that took place in  1991.    Likewise, the maintenance of Guantanamo Naval Base is part  of  the political pressure against Cuba. More than 220 violations  and provocations against Cuban guards occurred between 1990 and  1993 from that enclave. In addition during the first half of  1993 alone a total of 168 ships of different types visited the  base, where six military exercises of various characteristics  were conducted.    To this dangerous military buildup we may add during this  same period the intentions of terrorists groups based in the  United States to attack Cuba. The leaders of some of these  groups have been arrested, but no judicial ruling regarding  these groups has been issued.    Other Aggressions    Less visible but still persistent tensions regarding Cuba  may  be found on the airwaves. Cuba is bombarded by 15 radio  stations with more than 200 hours a day of anti-Cuban  programming aimed ""at spreading fear and uncertainty, fanaticism  and insanity, and promoting unscrupulous and unethical  behaviors.""    U.S. federal agencies allocated in the last few years more  than $150 million for the promotion of these broadcasts, many of  which violate international conventions, misrepresent the truth,  and conduct other actions aimed at promoting everything from  subversion and disillusion to desertions every day.    This field, called ""migratory aggression,"" has been turned  into a ""subversive political component"" by U.S. presidents to  encourage the departure of illegal aliens, to create internal  difficulties in Cuba, and to ""encourage an international  campaign that can distort and hurt Cuba's image abroad.""    If Cubans constitute only .25 percent of the legal  immigrants  who arrived in U.S. territory during the last fiscal year and  2.04 percent of the illegal refugees, why is Cuban immigration  such a disproportionate issue with such enormous propaganda?    The use of this issue as a weapon to attempt to discredit  Cuba has been a constant element in the past three decades.  Even though Cuban authorities have allowed the freedom to  emigrate in the past few years, the obstacles, the whimsical  selective nature of the permits given, and the clear  discriminatory policy toward what Washington accepts as eligible  all preclude the normalization of the migratory movement.    Meanwhile, the outlook for the area is critical, and in this  regard the document mentions the existence of hundreds of  thousands of illegal Mexican aliens who are virtually suffering  conditions of slavery in the United States, not to mention the  thousands who are captured and deported as they attempt to enter  clandestinely into the country.    In view of this outlook, the Cuban legislators believe their  country has done everything possible to find a sensible and  civilized solution to the confrontation with the U.S.  Government, which is not limited to the economic, trade, and  financial blockade against the island for the past three decades.    That is why they believe the solution to the conflict does  not lie in permanently asking Cuba to make changes to its social  organization, rather, to ""promote external conditions so the  aspirations to improve the social model freely chosen by the  Cuban people can effectively take place.""    To achieve this the Cuban legislators say ""the United States  is the one that needs to be pressured by demanding a change to  its obsolete and irrational policy toward Cuba.""     "

This was a closed-door  session held at the Convention Center. The address came during a  debate regarding democracy in Latin America, which included a  clear reference to Cuba. Brazilian President Itamar Franco then  stated that the only way Latin American people can help is by  joining efforts to support Cuba and its reintegration to the  OAS. This motivated Fidel to speak and I believe it is important  for all our listeners throughout Cuba to listen to his words.    [Begin Castro recording] I want to -- since my country,  Cuba,  has been mentioned repeatedly by several of the speakers --  first of all give thanks to those who care about Cuba. I can  feel a sincerity in what they have said. This is why I have  applauded each one. I know that at times, when I speak, some do  not applaud. That is fine. I respect that. I believe this is a  democratic thing and each has to do what they believe is  pertinent. I have applauded everyone, some more enthusiastically  than others. From everyone I have truly felt -- and I thank you  for it -- a concern for Cuba.    It caught my attention, however -- this is why I appreciate  so much President Itamar Franco's gesture -- that not a word has  been said about the unfair, criminal, and inhuman blockade which  for over 30 years has been imposed against Cuba, the largest  ever blockade in the history of a Latin American country with  which no dialogue is sought. What is sought is to smother Cuba  in blood and make it surrender by hunger. This is the reality.    I would have liked to hear within that Latin American spirit  some reference to this. I believe our people also deserve  commendation if we keep in mind the heroism, firmness, and  dignity with which hey have resisted for over 30 years the U.S.  blockade and aggression. Later on, we were left alone. Many,  when left alone, surrender. Yet we have not surrendered. We have  continued fighting because we are aware that we are defending  the dignity, sovereignty, and independence of the peoples of  Latin America. This is, precisely, what Marti wanted with Cuba's  independence.    It amazes me that not a word has been said to the effect  that  Cuba is the country which has advanced the most, socially, in  the history of this hemisphere. We have done so much that I  believe we have done more than what was possible. Not a single  word has been said, as we speak about the social crisis in this  hemisphere and so many closed schools, to the effect that our  country, subjected to a double blockade, has not closed a single  hospital, a single school, has not abandoned anyone. Our  country, even under the most difficult conditions, has struggled  and resisted.    In a hemisphere, which as you know well, whatever our  current, present, or definitive -- as you will --  accomplishments may be, which please me to no end....[pauses ]  We know, however, that this hemisphere where we all live, has  the worst distribution in the whole wide world by far. I am  talking about our region, with exceptions, of course, in certain  countries. This is the region with the worst distribution of  national income in the world and where so much remains to be  done. Yet, not a single word is said about it.    It also surprises me that not a single word has been said  about the joint position which we should present at the  notorious Miami summit. This is very important, vital, and  looming close.    Finally, I would like to state that I respect your views. I  sincerely respect your thoughts, concepts, and ideas about  democracy. We should hold a summit to discuss what is democracy  and what is meant by people's participation; what does it mean  that millions of people die in this hemisphere every year from  disease and hunger, millions who could be saved. It is our duty  to think about all of this if we are democratic, if we are human.    We have our ideas and views on democracy and do not feel  ashamed of them. With these views, we have resisted and  struggled for 35 years. I believe the blows we have endured  during these 35 years -- we cannot forget history -- since we  were first blockaded, way before the declaration of the  socialist character of the Revolution, when we were blockaded  and our sugar quota was apportioned among all ....[pauses] Cuba  was left practically alone with the highly noble exception of  Mexico which maintained ties and relations with us. I respect  everyone's views. I believe that if we are to speak about  democracy, we have to speak of a multiplicity of views and  opinions. I ask that our views be respected in the same manner  that we respect yours. This said, I thank you once more for the  concern you have expressed regarding Cuba. Thank you very much.

0,FT923-3907 ,"FT923-3907 _AN-CIJB4AANFT 920910   FT  10 SEP 92 / Yeltsin delays long-awaited trip to Japan      By LEYLA BOULTON and STEVEN BUTLER      MOSCOW, TOKYO   PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin of Russia yesterday called off a long-awaited trip to Japan just four days before the visit was due to have started. Mr Yeltsin told Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday morning that he had to delay the talks because of various 'domestic problems'. A Japanese spokesman said Tokyo regretted the postponement of a meeting which could 'have marked a new step in relations'. Mr Yeltsin also postponed a visit to South Korea which was to have followed the Japanese trip. The 'postponement' of the visit may, on the face of it, have been inspired by a wish on Mr Yeltsin's part to avoid a failure to achieve progress in a bitter territorial dispute over the Kurile islands which has dogged the two nations since 1945. Tokyo is demanding the return of four small islands off the Japanese northern coast that were seized by Soviet troops at the end of the second world war. Japan has refused to consider large-scale economic aid to the Russians in the absence of substantial progress in negotiations over the islands. Mr Yeltsin has also been under pressure from nationalists at home demanding that Russia retains sovereignty over the territory. It was feared in Tokyo that if Mr Yeltsin were unable to make substantial concessions during the planned visit, relations between the two countries could deteriorate further. The assumption in Tokyo was that the visit was cancelled because of the intractability of the dispute. The Russians had accused the Japanese of inflexibility, but the Japanese government believed it had substantially softened its position earlier this year. Until May the Japanese official position was to demand immediate reversion of the islands to Japanese control, but this was changed to a demand that Russia merely recognise Japanese sovereignty over the islands, with details for reversion to be negotiated. A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said yesterday the issue was so politically sensitive that the Japanese cabinet could not survive if it extended large-scale aid to Russia without first solving the dispute. This position was made clear to the Russians during a recent visit to Moscow by Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister. The postponement of Mr Yeltsin's trip sends a signal to Japan that there are limits to how much Moscow can concede in its bid to win billions of dollars in economic assistance. But it could make a solution far more difficult. Dr Viktor Rosin, an expert at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, said the dispute with Japan could affect Russia's policy towards the rest of the world. The visit had offered Russia an opportunity to finally turn its back on its old-style foreign policy and confirm its 'active involvement in the world community'. This opportunity had been thrown away. Mr Yeltsin may also have given ammunition to his critics. Having scented blood on this issue, conservatives, joined by democrats turned ardent nationalists, would find other opportunities to demand changes in other areas of both foreign and domestic policy. A great economic opportunity for Russia may also be at risk. Although Russian leaders today have fewer illusions about the value of outside help, the task of switching to a market economy will be more difficult without substantial financial transfers from one of the few western powers with cash to spare. Japan also has a powerful voice in international gatherings, such as the Group of Seven, which is trying to co-ordinate assistance for Russian reforms, in particular a response to requests for a debt rescheduling.

Mettke, Hans Werner Kilz, and Fritjof Meyer in Moscow; date not  given: ""Ready for Any Struggle""]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Boris Nikolayevich, Russia has  worked for the benefit of the Serbs in the Balkans, and the  Serbs broke the agreements with your envoy. Do you feel cheated  by the Serbs now?    [Yeltsin] I do have this feeling. Russia, the United  States, and Germany have exerted their influence where they were  listened to -- the Americans on the Muslims, the Germans on the  Croats. We were the ones with the stronger influence on the  Serbs. In this way we jointly prevented a harsh militant  conflict.    [DER SPIEGEL] But the Serbs have attacked Gorazde again and  have not kept their promise.    [Yeltsin] I discussed the matter with Chancellor Helmut Kohl  and suggested to convene a summit. Russia, the United States,  the European Union, the United Nations, and the other sides  should sit down together at a table somewhere in Europe to sign  an agreement on a cease-fire and on peace after such an  agreement has been prepared by the foreign ministers. Last  night I had an extensive conversation with U.S. President Bill  Clinton.    [DER SPIEGEL] And the result was?    [Yeltsin] Air raids can only worsen the situation, the war  becomes endless. If we all exerted our influence as the  guarantors of peace and could look into the eyes of the Yugoslav  leaders, then a final agreement could be achieved.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you agree with Clinton or are there  differences now?    [Yeltsin] Our relations are close, we are good partners. It  is normal in the relations between two states that the positions  do not fully concur on all issues.    [DER SPIEGEL] Thus, you are against bombings?    [Yeltsin] We have the experience in our CIS countries that  any violence gives rise to counterviolence. The attempt to  defuse the situation and to come to an agreement is better.    [DER SPIEGEL] But you would like a UN mandate for the CIS  states?    [Yeltsin] The United Nations has refused to send its  peacekeeping forces to the CIS. Therefore, this remains our  task. The United Nations can just send observers, but we must  send the troops -- to Georgia, Ossetia, Moldova, Azerbaijan,  Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.    [DER SPIEGEL] What could the Germans do in the Balkans?  Should they also send soldiers?    [Yeltsin] We would welcome it very much if the Germans were  able to use their soldiers as peacekeeping forces, not only in  Yugoslavia.    [DER SPIEGEL] For that the FRG would have to amend its  constitution. Would you find it good if the Germans were freer  in sending troops?    [Yeltsin] I would consider this the right path. This year,  our army will finally withdraw from German territory. In  return, so to speak, the German Army could also be used together  with the UN peacekeeping forces in the CIS countries and thus  take over an important and noble mission. After all, we are all  Europeans.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why did you intervene in the Balkans -- to  show Russia in the role of the superpower, or did you want to  help your Slav brothers?    [Yeltsin] We let ourselves be guided by the final goal; we  are referring to the UN resolutions and the decision by the  Security Council.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is the NATO offer of a ""Partnership for Peace""  still acceptable to you?    [Yeltsin] It is a fair offer, but some things still have to  be clarified. We have a big army, just as NATO. We are willing  to sign a partnership agreement, but, at the same time, we also  want to negotiate an additional protocol with NATO about basic  issues. Two formerly hostile blocks now want to cooperate  militarily. This cannot happen completely without technical  problems. We have other weapons systems, which are very  different from those of NATO. Now they probably have to be  harmonized.    [DER SPIEGEL] Recently you have often complained that  Russia's size is not sufficiently respected in the world. Where  do you see discrimination against your country?    [Yeltsin] I can give you a long list. The Cocom Committee  [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] has  now been dissolved, but the Western countries immediately  established other committees, which are to regulate controls of  goods exports to the former socialist countries in a new way.  Why is Russia not represented in these committees? We were not  even invited to the preparations. This is unjust.    [DER SPIEGEL] A second example?    [Yeltsin] We are part of Europe, we have been a European  state for centuries, even though part of our territory is in  Asia. We have agreed with the European Union on signing an  economic agreement. For our accession we first have to develop  an economic model. However, for this purpose we would need a  cooperation agreement between the European Union and Russia. We  have not made progress in this matter for a year now.    [DER SPIEGEL] You and European Union Commission President  Jacques Delors signed a declaration in Brussels last December....    [Yeltsin] ....more and more conditions are put up that  clearly discriminate against Russia. We do not demand  preferential treatment, just the same rights as any other  European country, even though Russia is a superpower.    [DER SPIEGEL] The Council of Europe does not want to  accept Russia as a member because its democratic institutions  have not been consolidated. The seven industrial powers do not  want to have Russia in its G-7 club as long as the Russian  market economy is so little developed. What is the basis of  Russia's role as a superpower, apart from nuclear weapons?    [Yeltsin] I am for the complete destruction of nuclear  powers. A dream of mankind would be fulfilled if we entered the  21st century without nuclear powers. Russia can fully join in  that. Russia remains a superpower also without nuclear weapons.  Our greatness lies in tradition, in history, in our culture. I  do not want to offend the Americans, but their history goes back  only 200 years, while ours is millennia old.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does this justify the claim of being a  superpower?    [Yeltsin] There is our gigantic territory of 17 million  square kilometers, our population of 150 million. And then the  natural resources. Our country has everything that man needs  for life. Our natural gas resources of trillions of cubic  meters are sufficient of Russia and for all of Europe for a few  centuries.    [DER SPIEGEL] But the democratic institutions are still  underdeveloped.    [Yeltsin] Certainly, Russia has to live up to the  international standard there, too. It needs a mixed market  economy. man's rights and freedoms must be respected and  protected. This is the top priority of our Constitution.  However, the decisive elements for our weight and our greatness  are tradition, history, and culture.    [DER SPIEGEL] This weight is largely bearing down on your  neighbors in the CIS. Will Russia act as a power of order on  the territory of the former Soviet Union also without a UN  mandate?    [Yeltsin] This lies within the discretion of these states.  Georgia wants the United Nations with its peacekeeping forces to  bring about order in its conflict with Abkhazia. Russia is to  provide some of the blue-helmet soldiers. We would be willing  to do that. However, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali told me  that this has no chance -- the United Nations can, at best, send  observers and is grateful to Russia for its readiness to send  soldiers there. According to this model, Russia could also act  in other hot spots on the territory of the former Soviet Union.  If the CSCE, the United Nations, and NATO joined in, we would  simply have fewer problems.    [DER SPIEGEL] Many of the troops that have been withdrawn  from Germany, are now stationed in Kaliningrad, in the former  Koenigsberg. Why does Russia need such a powerful base there?  Who is threatening this region?    [Yeltsin] No one is threatening this region. There were  simply barracks vacant in Kaliningrad. With the help of the  German side, apartments for soldiers are now being build in  various places. Later on, some troops will be transferred from  Kaliningrad further to the east.    [DER SPIEGEL] You will come to Germany next month.  Potential investors will want to hear something about  guarantees -- against bureaucratic harassment, impounding,  arbitrary taxing, extortion of protection money. What can you  offer in this respect?    [Yeltsin] We have founded an insurance company, which is to  insure private investors against political risks with government  guarantees.    [DER SPIEGEL] Like the Hermes insurance company in Germany?    [Yeltsin] Exactly. We have studied the experiences of  Hermes and believe that we can use much of that. Of course,  there are no government guarantees against economic risks  anywhere in the world. Incompetent entrepreneurs will fall flat  on their faces in our country just as elsewhere. Political  risks, however, are to be compensated for. In Germany I will  explain this extensively to private investors in mid-May. They  must understand that they must not neglect the Russian market.  This market is uniquely interesting for them.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, production is still going down in  Russia and enormous subsidies are being paid to prevent mass  unemployment. What about your promise that the economy will  experience an upswing now?    [Yeltsin] I expect a stabilization this year. For two  months the inflation rate has been 8 to 10 percent and thus  considerably lower than last year. The production decline has  also slowed. The budget deficit is also lower than last year.  Armament production is deliberately being reduced. In other  fields of production we want to reach a normal level by the end  of the year.    [DER SPIEGEL] The country will become credit-worthy again?    [Yeltsin] A partial loan of $1.5 billion has just been  approved by the IMF. In 1995, we want to fulfill the conditions  for loans, too, so that we get further means from the G-7 --  perhaps then it will already be called G-8. This would  alleviate the situation in our national economy and contribute  to the stabilization of the ruble.    [DER SPIEGEL] Because they have economic problems, the  voters have defected in masses to the nationalist firebrand  [Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir] Zhirinovskiy. Do you  intend to continue floating above the political groups, or will  a presidential party soon be established?    [Yeltsin] The president is elected by all the people and is  responsible for every citizen, not just for the followers of his  own party. However, I can, of course, express more liking for  one party than for another or for Zhirinovskiy's party.    [DER SPIEGEL] Why is it not possible to form a coalition  against the chauvinist Zhirinovskiy? Is the agreement of all  groups on a national consensus regarding constitutional good  behavior supposed to be a substitute for that?    [Yeltsin] This is indeed intended. This agreement has great  political importance and we expect that its signing on 28 April  by the president, the government, the parliamentary chambers,  the political parties, and the regions can form the basis for a  consensus among the citizens in Russia.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you understand the concern of many people  after Zhirinovskiy's appearances in Western Europe, or do you  think that the Western reaction is exaggerated?    [Yeltsin] I think that the West greatly overestimates this  man.    [DER SPIEGEL] Is the impression incorrect that Zhirinovskiy  has a chance of becoming Russian president?    [Yeltsin] Completely incorrect.    [DER SPIEGEL] Among the radical democrats in Moscow the  terms ""autumn of the patriarchs"" and ""Yeltsin stagnation"" are  circulating. Are you tired of your office?    [Yeltsin] It is a tough job to be Russia's president in such  a period. In my new book ""On the Razor's Edge"" [as published] I  try to describe this. But courage does not desert me. I am  always eager for action, I am ready for any struggle.    [DER SPIEGEL] Also beyond 1996?    [Yeltsin] I have committed myself to not talking about this  issue.    [DER SPIEGEL] Committed yourself to whom?    [Yeltsin] The people from my team tried to persuade me for  some time to run again in 1996. I did not want to. Then we  agreed on a compromise: We will not talk about this issue for  two years. In 1996, the decision will depend on whether the  reforms in Russia cannot be reversed anymore. If I see that  things are improving in Russia, I can leave this office with a  clear conscience and a raised head. If the difficulties have  not yet been overcome, then everything has to be reconsidered,  depending on the situation. So far, I stick to my previous  decision. I expect that, in 1996, Russia will stand on firm  legs.    [DER SPIEGEL] Do you see younger people in Russia's  leadership, who can continue your policy and, at the same time,  have enough charisma?    [Yeltsin] I see many who want to do that.    [DER SPIEGEL] Someone like General Rutskoy cannot become  that anymore?    [Yeltsin] No, never. He is too narrow-minded. And since he  became a criminal, he has lost his political profile.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are you worried that a vacuum could develop?    [Yeltsin] Very much so. I am now looking for candidates who  can make a serious claim to the president's office in 1996. But  this will be extremely difficult. The people must get used to  someone and gain trust. This is not so easy.    [DER SPIEGEL] In your book you write that there are  situations in which one should actually have to apply a whip --  so that criminals, but also civil servants, stick to the laws.  What other means can be used to establish a rule-of-law state?    [Yeltsin] All civilized countries of the world have followed  the path of democracy, nothing must be invented anew. We have a  Constitution, which has been brought about through a democratic  referendum. We have elected our parliament democratically.  More than 57 percent of those eligible to vote have elected  their president. We have thrown the Communist ideology and the  totalitarian state overboard. These are steps on the path  toward democracy, even though we have not yet completed this  path.    [DER SPIEGEL] Very soon the last formerly Soviet troops will  leave the former GDR [German Democratic Republic]. German-  Russians relations thus gain a new quality.

Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 16 March reports that (Miguel  Marul), president of the Executive Committee of the People's  Government in the municipality of the Isle of Youth, has  departed for Italy, which maintains close relations with our  country and especially with the Isle of Youth. (Marul) said that  the objective of his trip is to establish cooperation agreements  and relations of friendship with Bologna and Capri.    Radio Reloj at 2034 GMT on 16 March reports that protocols  have been signed making sister cities of Matanzas and Leon,  Spain.    Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 16 March reports that a  group of 20 managers and experts from Canadian mining companies  has toured geologic and mining areas of Matanzas, Pinar del Rio,  Havana, Santiago de Cuba, Holguin, Camaguey, and Villa Clara  Provinces looking into investment potential. The tour falls  within the activities prior to the annual convention of Canadian  prospectors and was organized by the firm (Carib-Gold) and  Cuba's (Geominera S.A.). The president of (Carib-Gold) expressed  satisfaction with the results of the visit, as well as great  optimism, saying in English: ""I think it is inevitable we will  have more business with Cuba."" He added: ""Up to now we have had  only smaller companies that are willing to take higher risks and  invest in Cuba, but I think that this trip is showing there is  now an interest from some of the major international mining  companies."" Six Canadian mining companies are working in Cuba,  and another two will begin work in Villa Clara.    Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 17 March reports that the  Sergio  Perez Castillo fertilizer mixer plant in Holguin has been  70-percent repaired with the purpose of recovering the maximum  capacity of 500 tons daily. Current investments to recover  production in Holguin surpass 700,000 pesos.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports from Camaguey that bad  road conditions in the country have prompted national and  provincial experts to exchange ideas and experience in the use  of alternative materials in repaving and repairing roads. It  reported that Cuba has 14,000 km of paved roads, not counting  urban and perimeter areas, and that because the distribution of  asphalt has been reduced since 1989, Cuban crude oil is being  used in the asphalt mixture, with solid experience obtained in  Matanzas and Villa Clara.    Radio Rebelde adds that Cuba received almost 250,000  tourists  last year as a result of Cubanacan operations. This represents  almost 40 percent of the foreign tourists visiting the country.  These operations have brought some $96 million to the country,  although financial contributions by other tourist companies,  such as civil aviation, have increased this figure to $700  million. Cubanacan's manager said that tourism activity in 1994  will surely meet Cuba's goal of 30,000 rooms to shelter 1  million tourists, who would leave $1 billion in the country.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that Chinese  Ambassador  to Cuba Xu Yicong has delivered a donation of clothing and  school supplies for the municipalities of Arroyo Naranjo and  Playa. Pedro Chavez, president of the Havana Provincial  Assembly, and other local officials were present at the  ceremony. The Chinese ambassador said that this donation is a  contribution of the embassy personnel to the country's efforts  in these difficult times.    Radio Progreso at 1200 GMT on 17 March reports that the  breakdown of one of the generators of the Carlos Manuel de  Cespedes thermoelectric plant in Cienfuegos has caused blackouts  in the capital and other parts of the country, including some  circuits not usually affected because of the existence of food  processing plants or other establishments of priority  importance. Extreme efforts are being made in this plant to  restore the supply of electricity as soon as possible.    In the same newscast, Progreso reports that Sugar Industry  Minister Nelson Torres Perez has noted the importance of the  current stage for sugar production. Speaking on behalf of the  coordination and support group and of the commander in chief, he  stressed the crucial need to increase production and to defend  efficiency.    Progreso adds that workers of the petroleum drilling and  extraction company in the municipality of Cardenas in Matanzas  have promised to extract approximately 1 million tons of crude  oil this year. Engineer Marcos Aguilera, company director, said  they intend to produce 230,000 tons by the end of March, which  is 28,000 tons more than the current plan. Last year the company  produced 815,000 tons of crude, or 158,000 tons more than in  1992.    Radio Rebelde at 1000 GMT on 17 March reports that workers  of  the 1 de Mayo Industrial Gas Plant in Havana are working hard to  put the generator back into operation with a greater capacity to  stabilize the production of oxygen, nitrogen, argon, and  compressed air. The main fractionating line of 550 cubic meters  daily broke down at the end of last year. While repairs are  under way, workers are performing complete maintenance on the  plant.    In the same newscast, Rebelde reports that cane cutters from  the transport union in Havana Province have reached their  objective of cutting 1 million arrobas of cane in tribute to the  116th anniversary of the Baragua protest.

What prospects are there for the development of bilateral  Russian-Tajik relations?    [Samadov] We very quickly found with the Government of  Russia  an understanding of the problems that we have encountered in  1994. These problems ensue primarily from a combination of three  very complex processes: political transformations in the  Republic of Tajikistan connected with the adoption of the new  constitution; a referendum to determine the form of government;  the preparation of free elections with the participation of all  Tajiks, wherever they may be, and all Tajikistanis who  acknowledge the laws of the country. Having conducted a series  of intensive negotiations with the top leadership of the Russian  Government and with leading ministers, we leave with confidence  that the understanding that was reached will be realized in  specific mechanisms and concrete actions on both sides.    I would like to mention that our government has embarked on  the path of a broader dialogue with all structures of the  Russian state and Russian intellectuals. We are treating with  sufficient responsibility the task of realization in 1994 of the  intergovernmental agreement between Tajikistan and Russia.    A group of Russian specialists left for Tajikistan together  with me, and will help us look into the financial system, the  economy of the enterprises, and the economy of the regions.    It would seem to me that the task the government is setting,  which met with understanding at this stage, let us say, must be  accomplished. I would formulate this task as follows: the  unprecedented activity of Russian business circles, Russian  business, Russian politicians, and Russian scientists in  Tajikistan.    Tajikistan today is quite an intricate knot of very topical,  interesting problems and a fertile field of application for  foreign investments. But why should the share of Russian capital  not be more significant here? Why en route to the formation of  stock companies from the enterprises, which were once built on  the basis of Russian technology, can we not create new forms of  the organization of these works via the formation of  international stock companies?    [Sizov] You have emphasized repeatedly that a principal  cause  of the crisis situation of the national economy is the mass  exodus of highly skilled specialists from Tajikistan,  Russian-speaking specialists included. How do you intend to  resolve this problem?    [Samadov] I would like first of all to evaluate this problem  as such. Many Tajiks have left the republic also. If we are to  be objective, this has led in practice to the incapability of  many structures. Once, back in the phase of discussion of the  law on the official language in Tajikistan, I said that this  process could not be approached airily, with the emphasis on  national self-awareness and the need for its upsurge and  revival. It is impossible to enter the 21st century in isolation  from the world and without tackling such problems as, say,  information support in the sphere of new technology, research,  production, the organization of production, international  relations, and so forth. I believe that the failure to  understand many such circumstances led to this process  beginning. I believe that the political stability of Tajikistan  is the first and main condition of a return of the departed  specialists. Another problem: We need to solve in a new way and  fundamentally the question of their remuneration and the  protection of their interests in Tajikistan. And the government  is now tackling this problem.    [Sizov] Unless I am mistaken, there are now over 20 million  Tajiks in the world, and 5 million live in your republic, but  the republic is multinational. For example, over 1.5 million  Uzbeks live with you also. How are your relations shaping up  today with neighboring Uzbekistan?    [Samadov] From its first steps our government has managed to  direct these relations into the constructive channel of mutual  understanding. As far as the Tajik and Uzbek peoples are  concerned, I am sure that, considering the age-old historical  relations on the vast expanse of Central Asia, these relations  cannot be hostile, and all attempts to provoke an exacerbation  of these relations will be cut short.    [Sizov] In the course of the top-level Ashgabat meeting of  heads of state of the CIS the question of the peacekeeping  mission of Russia and Commonwealth countries on the Tajik-Afghan  border was discussed also. How might you now, two months on,  characterize the situation on the border and the role of the  peace-keeping force?    [Samadov] It is hard to exaggerate its role. It is truly a  very powerful stabilizing factor. I have to say a word of  gratitude primarily to the government, the top statesmen, and  the president of Russia for the attention they are giving a  resolution of this problem. We know that in the spring of 1994  certain forces will begin to muster on the other side for a more  large-scale penetration of the territory of Tajikistan. It is  not enough to say that we have the forces to resist. It is  essential to intensify the political dialogue, including with  representatives of the opposition who want peaceful development  in Tajikistan and a peaceful solution of the problems that have  risen to confront the republic. We need to start this as early  as possible, without waiting for some period of time and without  putting forward prior conditions, having included in this  process, of course, international organizations, primarily the  United Nations, and also, undoubtedly, Russia and the countries  of Central Asia. Our government is prepared to do everything  necessary for the start of this process.    [Sizov] Last winter, when the question of the possibility or  impossibility of dialogue with the forces of the opposition was  raised, the leadership of Tajikistan adopted a guarded attitude  toward this and held back even from such negotiations in the  long term. Do you believe that time is dictating different  conditions, and is a dialogue with those who truly are for the  democratic path of Tajikistan's development possible?    [Samadov] The last phrase is the key. The government is  prepared to negotiate with those who are for a democratic path  of the development of Tajikistan. These forces today call  themselves the opposition. Opposition to what? Some  personalities in the government? Their own state? The policy of  the government or the path for which this government is opting?  Here is a subject for negotiations. I repeat that we need  without any prior conditions to agree to facilitate by joint  efforts the complex political, economic, and social processes of  integration that are already occurring in Tajikistan in 1994.    [Sizov] As we all know, there is a major uranium deposit in  the north of Tajikistan, which enabled us formerly to create the  ""nuclear shield."" There have come to be reports in the news  media that Tajikistan would possibly be prepared to sell the  uranium raw material to countries of the Arab world, Iran has  been cited also. Do you not think that some people are pushing  Tajikistan into playing the ""uranium card""?    [Samadov] There are no people in our government or in  today's  leadership of the republic of Tajikistan, I believe, who suffer  from such a disease. I am convinced that the process of the sale  of the uranium, which is monitored by the appropriate  international organizations, produced on the territory of the  republic will be precisely as it has been thus far. I state that  all attempts to link Tajikistan with countries aspiring to  include it in the development of their uranium programs, other  than the countries with which we have a stable relationship in  this sphere, primarily Russia, are groundless. These attempts  have no political prospects.     "
0,FT944-9863 ,"FT944-9863 _AN-EKNDLABRFT 941114   FT  14 NOV 94 / Management: Jumping on the bandwagon   The system of management and economic teaching which Russia inherited from the Soviet Union was at once narrowly technical and specialist and highly disciplined. Managers were taught little other than their specific skill - but mathematical economists were taken to very high levels of proficiency and theoretical abstraction. Missing between these two was a holistic view of the economy and an all-round conception of management. A large number of organisations have appeared to address this gap in the market in the past three years - ranging from national institutes to 'schools for survival' organised in hotels and even private flats. Indeed, the skills required by today's business people are, as Igor Bunin, director of a think tank specialising in management issues, says: 'More to do with finding one's way around a human and bureaucratic jungle than with profit and loss accounting.' The big institutes - such as the Institute of the Economy, the Central Mathematical Institute, the Institute of the Economy of the World Socialist System and the Institute of Economics and Organisation of Industrial Production - used to dominate the academic scene. In the last years of communism, smaller think tanks sprang up, where the young men and women who staffed the first wave of reform thrashed out their ideas. At the same time, often with western assistance, business schools were established on the base of an existing university department. Italian institutions seem to have been first in the field: in 1989, the Bocconi University Business School of Milan in association with Leningrad University formed the Leningrad Management Institute (now the International Management Institute of St Petersburg); and the Nomisma Institute of Bologna founded Mirbis, the Moscow International Business School. According to research by the Judge Institute of Management Studies at Cambridge University, most of the world's big business schools now have links, run courses or have formed joint ventures with Russian counterparts: a group of US colleges has begun a consortium for teaching Russian executives. The Russian Academy of Sciences, reeling from the cuts in its budget and constitutionally unable to respond rapidly to change, has been so slow to react that, in September, the Economics Ministry together with the committee on higher education said it was by-passing academia to set up or extend a Higher Economic School and an Academy of Contemporary Economics - both assisted with grants from the European Union. Alexander Shokhin, then the deputy prime minister for economics, said that Russia must quickly get into the position of offering 'the same level of education in economics as other leading countries'. Professor Yevgeny Yasin, a presidential adviser on the economy and something of a doyen of reform, will be dean of the new academy. He says: 'The initiative that we academics and professors are starting is not for us and our generation; it is for the students of today and tomorrow.'   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.

They are striving to get the U.S. troops withdrawn from  Guantanamo and to preserve peace in Central America and  Caribbean region.    The Korean people rejoice as over their own over the  achievements gained by the fraternal Cuban people in their  struggle for the defence of the country, revolution and  socialism and for the independent development and prosperity of  the country and extend militant solidarity to them in their  righteous struggle.    They are happy to have such courageous and honest friends as  the Cuban people in Latin America.

The foreign minister said they have received assurances from  the Cuban Government that no reprisals will be taken against the  eight persons, including a woman and a 12-year-old child whose  parents are not in the group. Cuba reiterated to Chilean  authorities that it does not accept the forceful entry into  diplomatic missions as a form of pressure to obtain a visa to  leave the country, the foreign minister added.    Figueroa noted that Cuban President Fidel Castro and Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina assured them that once the people had  left the embassy, they could request whatever visas they wished.  Since it involves a consulate, Chile cannot grant them asylum,  rather ""humanitarian refuge,"" Figueroa said, noting that the  topic is being discussed simultaneously with the occupiers and  the Cuban Government.    Chile and Cuba severed diplomatic relations following the 11  September 1973 military coup and resumed ties at the consular  level as of 1991.    Figueroa explained that thus far, relations between the two  nations ""are adequate,"" and Chile is not demanding that  political changes occur on the island as a condition for the  establishment of diplomatic ties, but that it is studying the  situation. ""We have never established conditions at any time,""  the foreign minister stated, adding that his Cuban colleague  Roberto Robaina will visit Chile in August.

Consensus or not -- and right now not -- the issue promises to consume a lot of  discussion time at the seven-nation economic summit that opens in Houston  today.    There is a good, hard-nosed, self-interested argument for the West to offer  Moscow such things as managerial training and technical help to try to buttress  an economy whose inability to provide basic goods and services is fanning ever  greater discontent. The gist of that argument is that the West gains if a  reform-minded Gorbachev, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, can hold on to  power in the face of conservative resistance, and use that power to steer  Soviet resources and energies toward more productive and humane ends.    Gorbachev and his advisers know what has to be done. Spending on the military  and on heavy industry -- the two are often closely related -- must be severely  cut, with investment directed toward achieving greater efficiencies and  producing quality consumer goods. Decision-making must be decentralized, with  demand rather than command dictating economic choices.    Achieving these things would produce not only a less threatening Soviet Union,  but one that is far more ready to be integrated into the world economy and far  more likely to expand human freedoms even as it enlarges economic  opportunities.    The desirability of these objectives isn't in dispute. There are, though, hard  practical and political questions that have to be honestly faced. The main  practical question is whether Moscow is yet ready to put Western help to good  use; the answer for now, as even some of Gorbachev's economic advisers agree,  is that it's not. The key political question is whether Western leaders, or at  any rate a U.S. President, can responsibly propose putting scarce dollars into  a country that still spends about $15 billion a year subsidizing such clients  as Cuba and Syria, and that devotes one-fourth of its gross national product --  about four times what the United States spends -- to its military budget. The  answer to that is apparent.    Some European leaders talk about spending billions to help Gorbachev out. Far  better for now to think small, or at least smaller. Aid ought to be linked to  the reallocation of Soviet resources, and to progress in developing a true  market economy. That still leaves a lot of room for early help, including  targeted technical advice, small-scale agricultural, industrial and  environmental demonstration projects, food and other humanitarian aid programs.    The Europeans, of course, are free to do what they want individually; as  Secretary of State James A. Baker III has made clear, Washington won't object.  The Europeans might pick up some political influence by jumping in with aid  early, although by moving too fast they could also, of course, be inviting  major disappointments.    But Washington has scant room for maneuvering, especially given our deficit,  except to look at any Soviet aid program critically and cautiously. President  Bush shouldn't be embarrassed about expressing his well-founded doubts in  Houston. It's possible that our allies might even thank him someday for  steering them away from costly mistakes.

The Europeans, of course, are free to do what they want individually; as  Secretary of State James A. Baker III has made clear, Washington won't object.  The Europeans might pick up some political influence by jumping in with aid  early, although by moving too fast they could also, of course, be inviting  major disappointments.    But Washington has scant room for maneuvering, especially given our deficit,  except to look at any Soviet aid program critically and cautiously. President  Bush shouldn't be embarrassed about expressing his well-founded doubts in  Houston. It's possible that our allies might even thank him someday for  steering them away from costly mistakes.      Editorial    "

These  measures, which will begin to be implemented 1 June and continue  throughout the year, concur with one of the recent decisions  reached by the National Assembly, and they mark the beginning of  a phase during which interrelated measures that are part of a  larger process will be implemented. These measures should  result in the improvement of our internal finances and thereby  lay the foundations for other actions that will benefit the  country's economic stabilization and reorganization.    Although it has been said and repeated many times, it is  necessary to reiterate this once again: There is no alternative  to these measures and their implementation cannot be delayed any  longer. During the first quarter of the year, the excess of  currency increased by 591 million pesos. By the end of May, our  monetary liquidity will be approximately 12 billion pesos. Any  delay in facing this problem will only be against the vital  interests of the nation and the working people.    It is true that these increases represent new sacrifices  that  will affect all of us to some degree. This cannot be denied.  We have, however, faced sacrifices and hardships before, and  none would be worse than the ones we would have to face should  the current situation related to internal finances continue to  deteriorate. We should reflect on this seriously because it is  not a matter of applauding the measures. Nevertheless, we  should be able to understand them and realize that the country  has no other choice.    Higher prices and fees, particularly on cigarettes and  alcoholic beverages -- price increases that were widely debated  in the parliaments in the workplace -- are measures that can  give us the best results in the near future in terms of  generating revenues. According to forecasts from relevant state  organizations, their implementation should contribute by the  second half of the year to stop the increase of money in  circulation, which should begin to recede before the end of the  year. This would be an initial success and an encouraging step  on the path we must take.    A key factor that should be explained to all workers in the  country is that it is impossible under the current circumstances  to think that these increases in prices and fees can be  accompanied by a parallel and compensatory increase in salaries.  We would be deceiving ourselves if we tried to make a general  wage adjustment under current conditions. We must give real  value to current salaries instead of issuing more paper money,  which would only contribute to foster an endless vicious circle.  This can only be achieved by increasing productivity, expanding  the supply of goods and services, and gradually recovering the  purchasing power of the Cuban peso.    The first step should be reducing to acceptable limits the  internal financial imbalance. This, of course, does not  invalidate the specific measures now being implemented in  various parts of the country to encourage workers engaged in  vital economic activities, to identify those who contribute the  most, and to increase their real income through various means.    We must emphasize that, along with the strict measures, our  government has taken steps to protect the most vulnerable and  lowest income sectors. Even cigarettes, non-staple products  that are hazardous to people's health, have been protected as  much as possible for consumers who received fixed or controlled  quotas through the application of different and lower prices  than the ones that will prevail in the free market.    Another proposal that received broad support in the  parliaments in the workplace was the move to eliminate subsidies  in staple products obtained by ration cards and instead  subsidize the individuals and families that are the most needy.  In practice, the implementation of this proposal is turning out  to be a long and complex process. This means the state will  continue paying 365 million pesos a year to subsidize essential  goods whose price has not been adjusted. Products whose prices  will be increased do not represent an amount that cannot be paid  by the lower income groups.    Another concrete example concerns electricity fees. Fees  paid by those families that consume less than 100 kilowatts,  approximately 53 percent of all families, will not be raised.  The increase in electricity fees will be applied to the other  47 percent of the families, those with greater incomes because  they use 76 percent of the electricity supply assigned to the  residential sector. This measure's essential goal is to  encourage savings by spending less on fuel. In turn, it has  been noted that the new fees will not replace or override the  consumption plan or lead to the suspension of services for those  who time and again exceed this plan.    The increase in train [word indistinct] fees, which prompted  appropriate criticism, was wisely corrected while a 30 percent  bonus was established for workers and students who regularly use  this service. Some measures, such as the one aimed at  eliminating the $100 million peso annual subsidy to the workers'  soup kitchens, are economically significant. Meanwhile, other  measures, such as the fixed fees for water and sewage service,  and the increase in postal and telegraph services, although they  are far from making the institutions that supply these services  financially independent, will help the economy and will have a  [word indistinct] and educational effect.    It is important to point out that these increases in prices  and fees will contribute to one of today's most important goals  -- namely, the reduction of the fiscal deficit. Consequently,  the additional money collected will not, as a rule, remain for  the most part within the companies or institutions. Rather, it  will be included as part of the state's general budget as a  circulation tax. This will also create a more favorable  situation to progress toward the elimination of subsidies for  losses and to gradually do away with this phenomenon.    It can be added that, despite the additional charge this  represents for the family's economy and the harshness of the  crisis we are experiencing, Cuban workers with modest salaries,  thanks to the social policy of the revolution, spends less  proportionately in housing, electricity, transportation, and  basic staples than other Latin American workers.    Food supplies and other basic services supplied by the state  will represent at most, after this reform, 43 percent of the  minimum salary, while in Panama, the hemisphere's nation where  this proportion is the lowest, it rises to 56 percent.  [sentence as heard] In Cuba, more than 80 percent of the  families own their house and only 10-15 percent of salary is  paid as amortization. In the Latin American nation where this  indicator is lowest -- Honduras -- rent is not under $105 a  month for a modest two-room apartment. In the majority of the  nations, as a rule, housing will cost as much as 50-60 percent  of salaries. We must preserve and defend these gains and these  realities over and above any circumstantial impediment.    Decree Law 149 on illegal enrichment and now these  government  decisions confirm the willingness to progress in a serene and  decided manner toward the fulfillment of the policies outlined  by the National Assembly of the People's Government, as well as  the commitment to the full resolution of the problems we are  facing.    We are looking at an extremely significant measure imposed  on  the people with regard to prices and fees, and this measure must  be followed. When the time comes, other revisions must take  place in the categories of prices and fees that even apply to  the state itself. This is to stimulate greater efficiency and  to [word indistinct] subsequent government decisions with regard  to the [word indistinct] tax policy and other possible  alternatives included in the arsenal of measures that this  assembly approved.    In a flexible, intelligent manner, with the timely  information and due explanation to the people, this decisive  process will be implemented. We will not go half way. Our  workers and the labor unions currently involved in holding  meetings to achieve efficiency will undoubtedly unite around  this effort to achieve greater production at a lower cost and  with the best use of the scarce resources we have. This can be  achieved through debate that [word indistinct] encourages  comprehension and the firm support these decisions demand, the  top goal of which is to contribute to defend our nation's  independence and the revolutionary fatherland of the poor, by  the poor, and for the poor. It is once again time to act as  masters of our own destiny.     "

New Lubyanka Boss Gives KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA His First  Interview""]    [Text] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, whenever  the special services were mentioned in the past, people would  first recall the spies which our agents had caught. Now the  concept of ""economic security"" has entered the vocabulary. To  what extent is this area a priority for the Foreign  Counterintelligence Service [FCS]?    [Stepashin] Well, first, we have been catching spies and we  will continue to do so -- we are tasked with that function by  the statute on our service published 30 March in ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Incidentally, I wrote to Sergey  Aleksandrovich Filatov, the leader of the Presidential  Administration, asking him to remove the ""for official use""  classification from the document and have it published in the  press. People should know what we do.    We tackled economic security issues in the past as well, but  this applied more to security measures at defense enterprises,  nuclear power stations, and other strategic installations. All  that remains, but, at the same time, new areas have emerged. In  general, many departments should safeguard economic security, as  should the ""producers"" themselves -- the banks, say. We are  looking at our participation in this from the standpoint of  combating corruption in financial, lending, and banking  structures, other state and commercial organizations, and  various investment funds. Moreover, we are helping the Central  Bank of Russia to carry out credit and other operations, and  major enterprises to conclude contracts with foreign firms.    Economic security issues account for two of the FCS' five  basic directorates. To be blunt, it is quite an important force.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Doesn't it strike you that the threat  to our economy today comes not so much from abroad as from  inside the country -- a proposition which was raised quite  recently?    [Stepashin] Indeed, in the past the economic security issue  was interpreted one-sidedly -- that is, it was linked solely to  external factors. I am thinking of the restrictive policy of  the industrially developed states and the IMF, which placed bans  on lending to the USSR, on the supply of goods and advanced  technology, and so forth.    Domestic factors helping to undermine the economy were not  profoundly studied or were often simply hushed up. But their  destructive effect on all spheres of the national economy has  been far greater in scale and longer-term. Society has suffered  immense damage, for instance, from the denial on ideological  grounds of the existence of a corruption problem in the top  echelons of party and state power, or of the presence in the  country of a ramified black market system.    Today the impact of internal ""time bombs"" undermining the  economy has not only not been halted but is actually growing  stronger. Just take the problem of economic ties. In my view,  this is now the main destabilizing factor.    Needless to say, the main role in preventing these threats  is  played by the top organs of state power -- the government and  its structures -- since they are the people who shape economic  policy and define the mechanism for its implementation. As for  FCS subunits, we see our task -- along with those already  mentioned -- as being to ensure that top state administrative  organs have accurate and timely information on negative trends  in basic sectors and spheres of the national economy and on  emergencies, and to provide forecasts of the possible  consequences.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that the FCS is now  mainly just a forecasting and analysis body?    [Stepashin] No, of course not. Counterintelligence  operatives are above all men of action. And if the discussion  of our work to safeguard Russia's economic security were to  continue, I could mention a lot of specific cases. Because of  space constraints in your newspaper I will quote just a few of  the most typical.    In the course of the joint ""Trawl"" operation with organs of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Customs, and the  Prosecutor's Office, our territorial subunits managed to uncover  around 270 criminal structures specializing in the illegal  export of strategic raw materials and licensed products. In  total over the past year we have put a stop to more than 1,200  such illegal acts, giving rise to almost 300 criminal cases.  The illegal export from the Russian Federation of more than  636,000 tonnes of oil and oil products, 100,000-odd tonnes of  metals -- including 44,000 tonnes of nonferrous and rare-earth  metals -- as well as timber, lumber, and other products worth  around 150 billion rubles [R] in total has been prevented.    Federal security organs conducted the ""Barrier"" operation at  16 airports around the country and put a stop to the illegal  export from Russia by air of more than 400 kg of electronic  components containing gold, around 30 kg of gold and silver  bars, as well as 237 cutting tools with diamonds of up to two  carats worth R58 million.    As a result of the measures taken on the basis of  information  supplied by FCS organs more than 400 major disasters and the  preconditions for them were successfully prevented in 1993 --  including 54 at nuclear power generating installations.    Incidentally, a great many examples could be quoted of  Russian slackness, waste, and blatant stealing from the country.  And work in this area is terra incognita for our  counterintelligence agents.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that we are harming  ourselves and that the West is just helping us?    [Stepashin] Things are not that simple. Foreign firms,  exploiting the situation in our country, are striving to expand  scientific and technical links with Russia to their own  advantage. They are trying to organize an intensive outflow of  Russian scientific ideas, high technology, and advanced arms and  military equipment systems.    In the United States, France, Germany, Brazil, Israel,  China,  and South Korea these actions are supported at state level. We  know that the range of theoretical and practical scientific  results in Russia that are of interest to foreigners extends to  space and aviation equipment, biotechnology, new materials,  nuclear physics, laser equipment, metallurgy, and high-tech and  defense sectors of industry.    Information reaching the Russian FCS on this problem shows  that in the very near future our country could lose its leading  position in the development of basic and applied research, be  deprived of many scientific schools and highly qualified cadres,  and suffer considerable and essentially irreparable material  damage. Calculations done by specialists from the Russian  Federation Ministry of Science and Technology Policy using UN  methods show that the country loses around $300,000 for every  specialist that goes abroad. Russia could suffer potential  damage of around $20 billion annually through emigration.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, could you describe  the work of the Western special services to safeguard their  countries' economic security?    [Stepashin] The United States devotes a great deal of  attention to strengthening the activity of counterintelligence  organs in preserving and strengthening America's leading  position militarily and economically. In the Americans'  opinion, the strategic threats to U.S. interests persist under  present-day conditions. In this connection intelligence  community experts are pointing out that Russia and the other CIS  countries are still the priority targets for the special  services.    Moreover, insofar as we are aware, the intelligence  community  is fully tasked with the function of economic counterespionage  -- and the special services are being told to be ""more  aggressive"" when conducting counterintelligence operations.    According to the available information, the special services  of the East European countries are also becoming an important  tool in implementing their leaderships' ""eastern"" policy. Their  priority effort is concentrated on infiltrating leading  structures in the CIS states in order to obtain not only  economic but military and political information.    We know that special organs from the East European states  are in close contact with the NATO special services, which give  them financial, material, and technical support.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] According to calculations by  specialists, several tens of billions of dollars are taken out  of Russia every year. Can't this outflow of foreign exchange be  sealed off?    [Stepashin] Of course it can -- but not only and not so much  with the help of the special services. In this area we have to  work in conjunction with the tax service, the tax police, the  MVD, and the Customs. We plan to set up several such joint  groupings under the auspices of the Prosecutor's Office. But  this is not enough. Our administrative law and code of criminal  procedure have long become obsolete, and we are working under  the conditions of the former political and economic system. We  have plenty of material, but we cannot act on it. The facts we  have to hand are not being used for investigations -- much less  for instituting criminal proceedings and court cases.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about simply legalizing activity  that is currently deemed criminal? Maybe then our ""dealers""  would not send their dollars abroad?    [Stepashin] Far too much has been legalized as it is! And  money is going abroad because of the unstable political  situation. Many people are scared to invest their capital here  -- they fear for their future. Moreover, some of the radical  opposition is gripped with the idea of the expropriation of the  expropriators, and the experience of 1917 is not such ancient  history for them. Consequently, it is only when we have a normal  political atmosphere that we can talk about stopping the flight  of capital. Needless to say, I do not choose people who are  indifferent to the interests of our country and its people.  These people have always been with us, are with us, and always  will be -- and if they commit crimes they need to be combated,  using special service methods if necessary.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We talk so much about corruption!  You get the feeling that we are on top of it, when the opposite  is true....    [Stepashin] This phenomenon has been brought about primarily  by the current position in the economy and by the lack of  legislation on the civil service. We are discussing corruption,  but from the standpoint of the criminal code the subject of our  complaints essentially does not exist. We do not have any  clear-cut framework to guide civil servants*at all levels -- up  to and including government members -- about what they are  forbidden to do and what they are responsible for. That is why  people are lobbying for the most fantastic agreements.    Exploiting their important position, certain officials are  making approaches to foreign firms, selling them our  enterprises' products at considerably reduced prices, and taking  bribes in return. The most interesting point is that most  corrupt people do not think of themselves as such -- they claim  to be just entrepreneurs. We are currently investigating the  ""Neftalmazinvest"" Foundation. High-ranking officials from the  State Committee for the Management of State Property are  involved in this major affair.    There is a very alarming situation with oil. It is currently  monopolized by several structures. This strategic raw material  is going abroad without any controls. Ukraine has not paid  Russia for oil received throughout all of last year and the year  before, and it is still receiving oil. Who took how many bribes  for that? Why are products with different octane ratings  flowing through the same pipeline?    In other words, corruption now affects many of the most  important spheres -- privatization, the credit and financial  sphere, banking, investment and foreign economic activity....  According to available information, the degree to which the  economy has been affected by this ""bacillus"" is quite  considerable and is continuing to increase rapidly.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, be frank -- do you  believe your work will be successful (I am thinking of the fight  against corruption)?    [Stepashin] If everything depended on us alone.... Today  you can often hear voices claiming that the FCS should be  disbanded -- with one directorate being given to the Finance  Ministry, another to the Justice Ministry, and so forth. You  get the impression that people either don't know what the  Finance and Justice Ministries do, or they are deliberately  raising the question of scrapping the FCS.    This talk is coming up now that we have started active  work, particularly in opposing foreign stations. We now have  very serious approaches to a number of economic structures and  have once again gone on the attack. Certain newspapers  specialize directly in this. There are no prizes for guessing  that there are people who find counterintelligence a big problem  when it gets ""too close"" to them and their machinations.    And this is not just a question of the foreign ""agents of  influence"" to whom we often refer. Some of our  pseudocampaigners for democracy and justice are also attacking  the special services. And these actions are deliberate and by no  means the fruit of a sick fantasy run riot in the spring.    I would like to recall the words of Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin during our recent meeting -- Russia, the state, and the  president need a strong special service that can work  effectively in all areas.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But won't the FCS, in actively  dealing with economic security, leave other ""sections of the  front"" exposed?    [Stepashin] No, that is ruled out. Everyone does his own  job. For instance, this year we have already arrested British  and German spies, and we caught them ""clean"" -- in other words,  red-handed. The other day we also caught red-handed three  staffers from the North Korean Embassy attempting to buy  state-of-the-art technology, as well as a BND (FRG intelligence)  agent trying to recruit a Russian officer in the Western Group  of Forces. Of course, such results raise the morale of  counterintelligence officers and enhance their sense of their  own worth. Military counterintelligence has become more active.  We are recording many recruitment approaches from the German  special services to the contingent of Russian troops being  withdrawn from Germany.    Means have also now been taken to improve the work of our  information and analysis subunits. In the last two weeks alone  we have sent the president 25 analytical materials on a wide  range of security problems -- including ""hot"" spots, foreign  special services' aspirations, and economic issues....    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Can the reorganization of the special  service responsible for the state's security now be said to be  complete?    [Stepashin] I think so. The fundamental reform has been  completed, but we will be constantly improving our structure.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the renewed profile of the  Lubyanka now?    [Stepashin] We have gotten rid of certain militia functions  -- put it that way -- which are alien to the special service.  We have also lost the Border Guards and our investigative  subunits. We have somewhat reduced our central apparatus --  particularly our administrative apparatus -- and changed our  organizational and staffing structure. The FCS has become more  compact.    I should note that these reorganizations did not begin  solely  as a result of the president's edict -- they were a call of the  times. Back in September 1993 we independently started  reforming the Security Ministry. The Russian president then  received the first note from the Security Ministry Collegium, in  which we proposed a number of new approaches. These were  subsequently implemented in the 5 January 1994 presidential  edict setting up the Russian Federation FCS.    We have completely recertificated our staff -- from  operatives to the deputy director of the FCS. But we have not  carried out any kind of ""purge"" -- much less one for political  motives. Certain workers were dismissed for being  professionally unsuited to the job, while some have left for  reasons of age and other reasons. I think that what we are left  with are the best -- at least from the standpoint of  understanding the need to conscientiously serve the fatherland.  [Stepashin ends]    From the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA Dossier    Sergey Vadimovich Stepashin was born 2 March 1952. He is a  graduate of the USSR MVD Higher Political College and the V.I.  Lenin Military-Political Academy. He served in the Internal  Troops. He was Russian Federation Federal Security Agency  administration chief for St. Petersburg and Leningrad Oblast  from September 1991. In January 1992 he became Russian  Federation deputy and in September 1993 first deputy minister of  security. From 1990 through September 1993 he was a Russian  Federation people's deputy and headed the Russian Federation  Supreme Soviet Defense and Security Committee. He was appointed  Russian FCS director in March 1994. He is a lieutenant general  and a candidate of historical sciences.    He is married and has a son.     "

He also invited Peruvian businessmen to invest in Cuba  through mixed enterprises or joint ventures.    The proposal was made to Industry, Commerce, and Integration  Minister Liliana Canale during a working meeting in her office.    Robaina, who carried a list, proposed that some 200 products  be placed on the list of products that benefit from the partial  agreement that allows the importation of products with a zero  import tax.    Currently only about a dozen products do not pay import  taxes. This greatly restricts trade between Peru and Cuba.    Cuba thus would export medicine, rum, citrus fruit, and  sugar  cane, while Peru would export fish meal and minerals, among  other goods.    Robaina also proposed that a commercial mission visit Cuba  in  June. Peru has yet to answer the invitation.    The commercial mission would be headed by Minister Canale,  who would be accompanied by private businessmen who have  expressed interest in investing in Cuba, in the tourism field  especially.    After the meeting, Minister Canale said she is carefully  assessing the Cuban proposals in order to give an answer as soon  as possible.    She said contact will be made with the business sector to  reach a consensus regarding the products that could be imported.    She explained that the mechanism is similar to the one  upheld  by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association], through which  the continent's countries have reached similar agreements in the  region.    Canale said the purpose of the commercial mission's trip  would be to identify trade prospects between the two countries,  although she added that the trip's date has not been established  yet.    She then added that the Cuban foreign minister's visit has  awakened interest in investing in that country and that there  are businessmen who want to step up the exchange of experiences.    Canale said her ministry is willing to support every effort  designed to step up commercial relations with that Caribbean  island and added that the Cuban authorities' proposal is being  studied.    Regarding her possible trip, Minister Canale said she is  reviewing her agenda to determine whether or not she will be  able to travel to Cuba in the near future because she is very  willing to visit Fidel Castro's country.    Contact between the two countries will be maintained through  the respective foreign ministries, which will be kept informed  of the decisions made in the coming months.    When asked about the Cuban proposal, Confiep [National  Confederation of Private Business] President Arturo Woodman  answered immediately, saying he is in favor of tax exemptions.    He said it is up to the government to make a decision in  this  regard, but said he was in favor of the immediate implementation  of tax exemptions in order to step up trade between the two  countries.    He said it would be a good thing to increase trade between  the two countries because it would allow Peru to export fish  meal, proteins, and other products to that island.    Woodman said the issue is now in the government's hands,  which has to see about the legal aspects of eliminating import  taxes for some 200 products.    Foreign Minister Robaina voiced his satisfaction with the  results of his meeting with Minister Canale and said the results  will be noticed soon.    He said the upcoming visit of a Peruvian commercial  delegation to his country will help strengthen commercial ties  between the two countries.    After the meeting, the Cuban foreign minister held a series  of meetings with Peruvian political and social figures.    In the evening he attended a cultural event at the National  Museum, during which beautiful Cuban music was played. The  event also was attended by political and cultural  representatives.    After the event Robaina left the country to continue his  tour  of the continent in an attempt to tighten cooperation ties.     "

In statements to Cuban television, the member of the  Communist Party of Cuba [PCC] Politburo commented on the delays  in the production plans of several provinces.    Lage proceeded to cite the excessive humidity caused by  heavy  rains and the problems experienced in preparing the harvest as  being the main reasons for the delay.    In expressing his confidence that they will be able to grind  the quantity of sugar forecasted, Lage stressed that there is no  indication of exhaustion among the sector's leaders and workers  despite having been at work for more than 100 days.    During the past year, Cuba was only able to produce 4.2  million tons of sugar, an amount considerably lower than the 7  million tons the country was able to produce in previous years.    The sugar harvest will be rescheduled, a situation that had  been forecasted by experts, as a result of the beginning of  spring, a fall in productivity, and an increase in manufacturing  and equipment breakdowns after more than three months of  continuous activity at the agro-industrial installations.    Previously, Lage had indicated the economic need to grind  the  sugar as efficiently as possible and manufacture the entire  sugar committed, without neglecting to plant and clean the  thousands of hectares of land in preparation for next year's  harvest.

The agreement is scheduled to be signed by EU leaders with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin during a European summit on the  Greek island of Corfu on Friday and Saturday next week if two  last-minute hitches are overcome.    ""This means that President Yeltsin should be ready to come  to  Corfu next week to sign,"" the chairman of the European Union's  Council of Ministers, Theodoros Pangalos, said.    Officials here said that the ministers had reached an  ""essential political agreement"" to wrap up the accord, but that  two hitches remained.    The Netherlands said it was still waiting for confirmation  in  writing of a Russian assurance that two Dutch banks already  licensed to operate in Russia would be freely allowed to gather  Russian clients.    And the diplomats said there might not be time to translate  the agreement into the European Union's nine official languages  and Russian by the time of the summit.    In that case, a French official said, President Yeltsin  would  probably be invited to the Corfu summit to endorse a declaration  saying that the agreement was settled and would be signed later  when the translations were complete.    The sole outstanding problem of substance concerned the  European Union's insistence that five EU banks be exempted from  a Russian law restricting their right to attract Russian clients  in Russia.    Two of the banks are Dutch. A Dutch diplomat said the  Netherlands was not satisfied with a Russian assurance at the  weekend that the exemptions would be granted. ""We want it in  black and white,"" he said.    The partnership agreement, under negotiation for two years,  is a key part of Western attempts to bolster the Russian  economy. It offers Russia greater access to the EU market and  more political dialogue.    It also holds out the prospect of a Russia-European Union  free trade zone after 1997 if Moscow has made enough progress  towards a market economy by then.    Meanwhile, the European Union confirmed that it would sign a  similar partnership and cooperation agreement with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk on Tuesday.    Two accords will be signed -- an overall agreement which  faces a lengthy ratification process in Russia, all EU countries  and the European Parliament, and an interim economic pact which  will come into effect immediately.    In separate but related negotiations, the European Union is  also trying to persuade Ukraine to close down the dangerous  Chernobyl nuclear power station, the site of the world's worst  civilian nuclear accident in 1986.    The European Union has pledged to help mobilise Western  countries to pay the costs of closing down the plant, and partly  finance two new nuclear power stations to replace the Chernobyl  output.    But the two sides have not yet reached agreement on the cost  of the Chernobyl closed-down, or the share of the bill to be met  by the West.     "

I also believe that we have to be  fully convinced that the only way out of the special period is  the revolutionary, socialist, steadfast path we are undertaking.  This way out, of course, demands effort, work, and sacrifice.  However, that effort, work, and sacrifice are worthy. Comrade  Estruch [Deputy Luis Estruch Lacano] pointed out several  important things which serve to compare Cuba's situation at the  time of the triumph of the Revolution with the immense  transformation that has taken place, particularly, in comparison  with the reality of today's difficult moment.    I believe that our people have confirmed their commitment to  the ideals of socialism and their rejection of certain dogmatic  ideas being forced upon today's world, and in Cuba's case, from  abroad. Capitalism will not be Cuba's future because capitalism  was its painful and sad past. Our people will never return to  the past.    Listening to Estruch, I remembered certain elements which I  believe our people remember and understand. Our people are a  cultured, intelligent people, a well-educated people as result  of all that effort alluded to by Estruch and other comrades.  Since I agree with Estruch that part of this great battle for  the national economy -- to correct our finances and stimulate  the economy -- is also a political battle, it seems right to  refresh our memory with some information which clearly  illustrates the reality of that capitalist past, and also  illustrates -- and we can not forget this because the special  period irritates us, pains us, and causes daily difficulties for  everyone -- that a special period, a difficult and anguished  living, a true hell, was the life the immense majority of our  men and women knew for most of Cuba's history until 1959.    I have here certain points of reference, not produced by us,  by the revolutionary movement, but by unsuspected sources. This  document, this book, was not published by the Revolution but by  the Batista regime. It is the Population, Housing, and Electoral  Census of the Republic of Cuba of January 1953.    This other book was not published by Cuban revolutionaries  either. It is an official document of the U.S. Government from  that period aimed at U.S. investors and includes a study of the  Cuban economy conducted three years after the Batista census,  and has among other things certain criticisms of results of the  census.    In the study conducted by Batista's authorities, we see  certain data which portray Cuba, as a country difficult to  imagine for today's Cubans. The census partially covered the  issue of housing. There were, nationwide, 1,250,594 houses  ranging from the most luxurious mansions to the most modest  shacks of the most humble of our peasants. I will give some of  the data included in this report. Regarding construction, the  authorities classified it in a list beginning with masonry,  cement slab roof, and floors of a higher quality than plain  cement construction. The list continued down to a humble thatch  hut or something similar and earth floors.    In the Republic of Cuba, according to the 1953 census, 27.8  percent of the houses were masonry and cement construction and  32.2 percent were thatch and earth floors. Of course, in rural  areas, there were more than double the amount in this lower  category. However, in the urban areas, in our large cities, 10.2  percent of the houses, according to the 1953 census, had earth  floors and had no other material for roofs and walls than thatch.    The aqueduct reached only 35.2 percent of the houses and a  little more than half the urban houses. Sanitary service was  available to only 28 percent of the houses, including 32.8  percent of urban houses.    The same happens here. They do a classification ranging from  houses with indoor sanitary service to private latrines, and  communal latrines, and ending with the no sanitary service  category. Some 23.2 percent of the homes fell in this category.  Some 45.6 percent of all the homes in Cuba lacked baths or  shower facilities. Barely 48 percent of the homes had  electricity. However, 75.2 percent of the homes nationwide  lacked refrigerators, iceboxes, or any equipment to conserve  food, including 62.5 percent of the urban homes.    The U.S. Commerce Department study confirms that the  situation remained unchanged three years later. This is  regarding housing. Regarding education, the 1953 census reveals  that 23.6 percent of the population was illiterate.    With good reason, the U.S. Commerce Department study  criticizes the accuracy of the Batista census regarding this  aspect. First of all, it points out that the people who did the  census simply asked the people if they knew how to read and  write. Some 23.6 percent responded no. However, the American  researchers pointed out that more revealing data is found in the  census. Such as that illiteracy was much higher among 10- to  14-year-olds, which was 31.8 percent; that 31 percent of the  entire Cuban population had not had any formal education; and  that only 11 percent had gone beyond primary school education.  The Americans' conclusion was that true illiteracy was much  higher than that reflected in the official Cuban census and that  the republic was regressing given the extremely low school  attendance level. For example, of 2,459,730 youths, individuals  between 5 and 24 years of age, 1,619,535 -- about half -- did  not receive any type of education in Cuba in 1953. From this we  have to deduce that in any event, illiteracy would continue to  increase if we interpret correctly the information provided by  the Batista government.    In 1956, the Americans pointed out other important  characteristics, we can even call them manipulations, of the  1953 census. First of all, it was conducted in the month of  January, in the midst of the sugarcane harvest, at the moment of  the highest economic activity and thus the information on the  workers, the poor would be higher than at any other time of the  year. In addition, in the U.S. study -- Investment in Cuba,  Basic Information for U.S. Businessmen, Commerce Department,  Washington, 1956 -- the Americans point out that in that period,  the first half of the decade of the 1950's, certain Cuban  economic indicators had had their best performance in comparison  with the republican period preceding it, and that the year with  the highest per capita income, at the time, was 1952 -- the year  before the census.    Those who extol the advantages of capitalism, and try to  portray that system as every man's alternative, better not  harbor any dreams because this American document explains that  in 1952 Cuba attained a third of the per capita income of the  states in the southeastern United States. There is something  even more revealing, Cuba's best year in terms of per capita  income, the apex of our capitalist development according to  them, was equivalent to half the per capita income of  Mississippi in its worst year.    In other words, according to them, when Cuba attained its  highest point, it had reached half the level of the worst year  of the poorest and most backward state in the United States,  Mississippi.    What does this top year of capitalism reveal to us?  Batista's  census did not concern itself much -- and this was also pointed  out by the Commerce Department study -- with unemployment and  workers conditions. However, they missed certain indicators.  They, for example, found out the number of weeks worked by the  people covered by the census in 1952 -- the famous apex year of  capitalist development according to the Yankees. Some 36.8  percent of the Cuban labor force had worked every week in 1952,  and the great majority of those who had worked or looked for  jobs in that year of capitalist glory, 48.7 percent of the  workers, had not worked even 10 weeks.    We would have to ask if it was a pure coincidence of history  that at the time when the reality of our country was described  in this manner -- poverty-stricken, lugubrious, painful -- by  the Batista era census, Fidel Castro and a group of youths were  preparing to assault the Moncada Barracks and rekindle the  revolutionary movement of our people. Was it possible to  continue in that lamentable, painful state of the better period,  of the top development of capitalism in Cuba, when that was the  best it did for our people?    Could anyone be surprised if in 1956, when the Commerce  Department issued this study, Fidel Castro and his comrades were  preparing to land in our fatherland and restart the postponed  but never interrupted war of our people to put an end to that  hell capitalism brought for the majority of our people? Can  anyone think that this people could prefer that type of society  which reserved for the majority ignorance, lack of education,  poverty, and misery?    The 1956 study also covers other aspects of the economy  which  the Batista census had overlooked. In its analysis of our  countryside, it reveals that less than eight percent of the  farms occupied three fourths of the arable land in Cuba, and  that less than half of one percent of those farms controlled a  third of the arable lands. That is the phenomena of the  latifundia.    This explains other data, other realities, which other  entirely reliable reports also revealed at that time. I refer to  a third document. This study by the Catholic University  Association of Havana, which was not in any way a radical group,  was conducted in 1957, a year after the U.S. Commerce Department  study. They discovered, regarding the farmers' nutrition, that  the percentage that eat meat was four percent; fish, less than  one percent; eggs, 2.12 percent; milk, 11.22 percent; bread,  3.36 percent; cornmeal, 7 percent; vegetables, zero percent. The  Catholic group also researched the health conditions of our  farmers and found higher percentages than those I just mentioned  regarding food. Tuberculosis, 14 percent; typhus, 13 percent;  intestinal parasitism, 36 percent; and malaria, 31 percent,  among the people polled.    The highest percentage included in this document results  from  asking the peasants what they desire the most, what is most  important for them, what they need the most. Some 73.46 percent  responded with one word: Work.    Can anyone be surprised that our people were at this time,  as  the Catholic researchers were conducting this study, persevering  in the struggle in the mountains and savannas to jostle free  from that regime. Is that society really an alternative for  anyone? Was it or was it not a special period without escape,  hope, justice, or equality endured by those peasants demanding  work, peasants pained by tuberculosis or malnutrition. Was this  not a true hell into which the immense majority of our  population was born, lived, and endured until death? Our people  not only remember but also, because they are a knowledgeable,  informed people, they know that millions upon millions of people  in this world also endure special periods without equality,  justice, escape, or hope. True hells are being experienced by  the peoples in many parts of the world.    This U.S. magazine published by THE MIAMI HERALD features on  the front page an issue of growing concern in the United States:  what they call the homeless. People who as a result of  capitalist measures have found it impossible to continue paying  rent and have ended up on the streets, the only place available.  This young woman on the front page with her two small daughters  is not worried about her salary, taxes, or even the cost of food  or salaries. The sign states that she will work for food. She  offers her labor for food for herself and her two daughters.  Poor woman, she is not thinking about how to pay for school  uniforms for her daughters or their school breakfast or lunch.  There is no school for those girls, nor is there a job for this  woman. She is simply bartering her labor for food -- that is on  the front page.    The inside, features a man whose sign reads: I am 74 years  old and destitute. I am a homeless person but not a bum. I have  worked since I was 14 years old. This is typical in capitalism  where a man, after working for 63 years, has no other  alternative but to stand on a city corner and beg.    There is something else that is very interesting. The text  explains that in 1990, according to the U.S. Census Office,  there where 228,621 homeless people. Certain liberal U.S.  organizations, of course, say that this figure does not reflect  the reality and that there were many more. However, I prefer to  focus on another aspect of this issue. There were over 228,000  homeless in 1990. In 1993, the same source, the U.S. Census  Office, estimates there were 2 million homeless. In other words,  between 1990 and 1993, according to their official data, the  number of homeless -- people such as this old man, this young  woman, these girls -- has increased tenfold. This coincides with  these difficult years we Cubans call the special period. I ask  myself: Is there a special period in the United States? Is  anyone imposing a financial, economic, and commercial blockade  on that country? Have the U.S. main trading partners  disappeared? Have their markets collapsed? Has any madman, any  Torricelli in this world, come up with a law to prohibit and  obstruct trade with the United States? What explains that  instead of improving, there has been a tenfold increase in those  people experiencing the living conditions of a special period in  the United States?    I also have here THE MIAMI HERALD edition of 20 March, right  at the time we were in the workers assemblies discussing,  analyzing collectively, and seeking means and ways to confront  our difficulties. I want to give you the example of financial  measures implemented capitalist style.    One day, a real estate company or some landlord of an  apartment building in the United States decided there had to be  a rent increase to improve the margin of profit and make the  corporation more efficient. Was a workers assembly summoned?  Were the tenants asked how much they ought to or could afford to  pay?    This article describes how the measure was taken. It was  simply this. [Knocks three times on the table] One night --  states one of the two boys interviewed -- there was a knock on  the door and someone told mom that the apartment rent was -- it  most be an extremely modest place because it has been a long  time since you could find anything but a small room for this  amount I am going to say -- $295 a month. This was the rent this  humble working woman was paying. Someone implemented that  measure [three knocks] and told her: From now on the rent is  $325 and that is that.    She had no other choice, stated her son: Mom sat both of us  down and told us that we were going to sleep on the streets  because the rent had gone up.    Measures such as this one, by the thousands, are adopted by  capitalism everyday, and these are the consequences, this  picture. The boys showed the reporter their home. As you can see  it is the underside of a bridge in Miami where they spent last  winter.    The text of the article cites another interesting fact. Not  about the homeless in general, but about homeless children in  Florida in particular. The number of homeless children in the  state, according to a study by a Florida university, was 50,000  in 1993. This is three times the number of children in Florida  living on the streets. [as heard] Are these children or are they  not living in a totally unfair special period because it is not  the result of any external factor upon that society but the  intrinsic characteristics of that society which result in some  living in opulence and dissipation while many others are denied  the most essential rights.    Comrades, we face the challenge of being able to continue to  resist, struggle, and make whatever sacrifices necessary to  preserve a society incomparably superior to the one being forced  upon us by those trying to turn into a universally mandatory  dogma that truly abominable life style and forms of human  interaction that ought to have been abandoned in prehistory. We  have no other alternative but to save this revolution, this  socialist endeavor, to overcome the current difficult period  with a revolutionary spirit, the socialist way because the  alternative is that past reflected by the Batista era census, or  the Yankee study, or the Catholic University Association. That  past is the present of hundreds of millions of people in this  world, such as these Americans I have referred to.    Finally, I have another publication from Florida. There is  great interest abroad regarding what happens in Cuba, regarding  the result of our efforts, our struggle to overcome the special  period. There are people, those who benefited from the misery  and poverty of the majority of Cubans, those who never underwent  any special period yet imposed it on the majority of the people  in the past, who harbor dreams and believe the time will come  again when they can return, regain their privileges, and once  more impose on the majority of the people that past which shall  never return.    I have here a copy of the SOUTH FLORIDA magazine which  contains several articles in this regard. The man on the left is  a former landowner. In the article he describes his mansion, of  course, it had sanitary hook-ups, showers, electricity, and  everything else. The mansion was so luxurious that he now  complains that his backyard is no longer private [word play on a  nursery rhyme]. It is filled with children playing, playing  sports because his large mansion is today a large school. On top  of this, he complains that there are even black and mulatto  children among them, colored people that were not even allowed  on the streets of his neighborhoods during the era of the  Batista census. He explains their plans so that upon their  return, once the revolution is defeated according to their  dreams, that school will be turned into a private mansion once  again. The name of the article is: This land is my land.    The article on the left [as heard] -- those with a good  memory perhaps remember the Cuban Landowners Association which  grouped the owners of the sugar mills. They have a group named  the Cuban Landowners Association in Exile. In the article they  explain their plan. They plan to retake their mills, to return  the lands to the landowners, to once again place our peasants in  the conditions which the Catholic Association mentioned, to make  over 65 percent of the population hope for jobs.    We have to defend this project under the particularly  difficult conditions this country faces because, without a  shadow of a doubt, capitalism would mean a return to that past  we knew. However, it would be amplified by the hate, ire, and  fury which that minority would try to impose on our people, that  minority which today dreams of returning and was responsible for  making life for the majority of us nothing but a perpetual  special period without hope or end.    Of course, in the workers assemblies, in every meeting  held, and in this ANPP session the Cuban people are telling  those people: You shall not pass. [applause]    Recently, our people commemorated the 125th anniversary of  the Guaimaro Assembly, six months after the beginning of our  first war of independence, six months after the beginning of the  only Cuban revolution, the one begun by Cespedes and fulfilled  by Fidel Castro, the patriots, the revolutionaries meet in that  tiny town in Camaguey to find the indispensable patriotic  consensus, to unite ideas and wills, to organize the struggle  under the terrible and difficult circumstance faced by our  people from the beginning. The Cuban patriots and  revolutionaries met without relinquishing the machete, without  relinquishing the struggle against Spanish colonialism, and as  our people were also confronting -- as foretold by Cespedes --  the threat of the U.S. policy seeking to take Cuba over.  Cespedes said that was the hidden agenda of their policy.    The Cuban people were capable of overcoming differences and  putting, above all, the ideal of an independent and just  fatherland, a fatherland rooted in human solidarity and equality.    Today, 125 years later, the Cuban people have recreated  Guaimaro everywhere, have revived the spirit of our forefathers,  and have been able to reason, discuss, and examine frankly our  points of view to unite ideas and wills. We have not held  academic debates, but fraternal discussions, and collective  analysis in the midst of the struggle and on behalf of the  struggle.    May Guaimaro's spirit live eternally among us. May we be  capable of continuing, like Cespedes, Agramonte, and all the men  of that generation, who sacrificed everything, that ideal of  independence and justice. May we continue to develop our  collective wisdom with the combat spirit of the men of Guaimaro,  in the struggle and for the struggle.    I believe and am convinced that this is the required route  for every patriot, and the route we will follow, and through it  we will attain victory, despite everything, despite all the  difficulties and sacrifices we might have to endure. Thank You  very much. [applause]     "

I heard about you long ago, but we met only this winter,  bitter and formidable, when I came to Siberia, to your native  Krasnoyarsk. The center of Siberian industry was dying, like a  beached whale. And only your plant--it is hard to call it a  plant, it is a small civilization, a city within a city--was  continuing to live, struggle, breathe, and fight. We exchanged  our values, our ideology, for the first time then.    You are a technocrat. This is a rarity, a find, for the  patriotic movement. Members of the opposition are liberal arts  figures, philologists, legal scholars, and historians, as a  rule. You, though, are the bearer of immense production  engineering knowledge and organizational experience. You are  linked with modernity, with industry, with the idea of  technotronic development. Your activity in the Russian National  Assembly and proximity to the top opposition leaders have  created for you a firm reputation as a state absolutist and  Russian patriot.    You became a politician. You became a member of this hastily  formed institution of power--the Federation Council. You  essentially won the fight with Shumeyko for in order to  forestall you he had to accumulate all the influence of the  president and the prime minister backing him.    What do you, a Siberian, a plant director, an industrialist,  feel, having found yourself in this cauldron of new Moscow  politics? Your feelings from interaction with this environment?    [Romanov] I never previously felt myself to be a politician.  This is now the most dangerous period of my life. Military  pilots say: ""Watch out for them winging you during takeoff.""  They did not. Figuratively speaking, I am as yet gaining  cruising speed. Then it will be time for the plans which I  brought with me here and which I would like to embody via the  Federation Council. Decent people have been elected. I will  contribute to their philosophy the spirit of the  military-industrial complex.    When, prior to the vote on the candidates for the position  of  chairman of the Federation Council, I was asked whether I had  any experience of parliamentary business, I replied honestly  that I did not. I have now built up some such experience. It is  negative: The political forces with which I have come into  contact and the institutions I have entered are not all that  disposed to work for national unification. I mean by this the  mutual understanding and interaction of all who wish to survive  in Russia and make it great. Political persons and the conflicts  connected with them are ultimately transient. How many there  have been.... And if the country stands, has not crumbled, state  instincts are still, consequently, alive. It is simply that they  just cannot become policy and ideology.    Unification is occurring as yet merely within institutions  and parties and groups of politicians. Even recently the  patriots were sharply criticizing the State Duma for  amorphousness and conciliation. But the Duma, without even  touching on the subject of the amnesty, has shown that the most  diverse politicians are disposed to act together in strategic  areas. Were this unification to go beyond the framework of  parties and institutions, I would feel better in Moscow politics.    As far as my technocratic experience, as you put it, is  concerned, I met with many plant outfits in Krasnoyarsk and  heard one and the same thing everywhere: ""We have to work."" The  plants are buckling under the arrears, and wages have not been  paid for months--and people are working, they want to work. This  cannot be said of Moscow politicians.    A Russian engineer, I was forced to become a politician.    [Prokhanov] You speak about unification, the composition of  the efforts of the parties, the composition of the tendencies of  politicians, each of whom has his own vector, his own political  pace, his own experience of catastrophe or victory. I, and not  only myself, am tormented by one question. For three or four  years we patriots have been attempting to compose a party of  national interests, a patriotic party based on the national idea.    It cannot be said that these attempts appear absolutely  barren. Small political formations: the Russian Revival Party,  the Russian Party of Mikhail Korchagin, have been formed. The  Slav Assembly has been created. Among the most dynamic is  Russian National Unity. There was the attempt to create the  Russian National Assembly, in which you actively participated.  The National Salvation Front was squashed. All other attempts  are coming to naught. Everything is confined to a conference, a  congress, at which declarations are made, then organizational  apathy sets in, all movements come to a halt....    Why are we unsuccessful here? Is it not because unduly  blurred, unduly archaic political formulas such as  ""Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character"" or ""Russian solidarity""  are made the basis of them, these parties and their ideology?  Today's Russia is a multidimensional pulsating structure, in  which each region has its own version of the Russian idea.    In addition, the present Russia does not have a traditional  look. It is oriented toward the future. Perhaps none of these  pariahs has a future image, all their values are too tied to the  past, and they are unable to adapt tradition to history and  actual policy?    [Romanov] But in just the same way it has not been possible  to create a ""presidential"" party either. Comminution is a  feature of Russian politics. The communists are fragmented, like  the democrats also. What significance have all these Moscow  parties for the ordinary man? Go to the periphery, as they say  in Moscow, call in at a shop or a cowshed, and ask if only:  ""What is the Constitutional Court, who is on it?"" It is not  known. Even less is anything known about patriotic politicians.    I see as the solution for the patriots the creation of a  supra-party bloc based on the center parties with a negligible  tilt to the left, but under no circumstances to the right. The  leaders of parties and movements should step beyond party  ambitions, sit down at the table, and come to some agreement.  This supra-party bloc of politicians should go to the people  with an intelligible program of national salvation. I do not  believe that its success would depend on how far it operated  with outmoded ideologies and how it modernized the  ""Orthodoxy-autocracy-national character"" principle. It would  depend on whom it persuaded: the Moscow ""mass meeting"" or those  who have their hands on the levers of the economy and power.    Such a program is a latent need of both the opposition and  the authorities. I heard and read the president's speech in the  Federal Assembly. Even he, having become, according to the new  constitution, the head of state, is now uttering words  inconceivable from his mouth three or four months ago. He has  willy-nilly been forced to size up the situation in the country  and to construct his--albeit deficient, hypocritical--program in  conformity with it.    The president spoke in sufficient detail about what needs to  be done. But everyone knows this, as it is, I believe. Were an  opposition supra-party bloc to explain how it should be done, it  would have a chance to win.    The politicians who are a part of the bloc must necessarily  identify stages and arrange landmarks en route to the  goal--promise-landmarks. After all, Khrushchev's ""the present  generation of Soviet people will live under communism"" was not  fortuitous. It showed that these authorities understood the  importance of the possession, in your definition, Aleksandr  Andreyevich, of a future image, albeit ""incorrect."" They, the  politicians, must not be afraid to take on themselves--to the  extent of their influence--economic assignments also. Set them  six months ahead, say, providing them with resources....    [Prokhanov] I listened to the president's speech with a  double feeling, catching in his vocabulary all the words and  ideas that we patriots have over three years formulated and  offered society and for which we have acquired the title of  ""conservatives"" and ""red-browns."" He outlined distinctly, in  party and oblast party committee fashion, the contours of the  catastrophe that has struck Russia. He omitted just one thing:  who created the catastrophe. Or was it these ""red-browns"" who  brought the country to disintegration, the stoppage of the  plants, the exorbitant prices?    Each day on my way to work I pass the Frunzenskaya  Embankment, I see daily the enormous Buran--the Russian  spacecraft--reminiscent of a once beautiful, but now dead,  creature. I was at Baykonur when Buran, having accomplished an  unmanned space circuit, landed on the scorching pad. I remember  the exultant face of Oleg Baklanov, I remember my own  exultation: my state ruled in near-Earth space....    And now Buran has been trotted out posthumously as a  laughing-stock. What will be made from it: a bordello, a  restaurant, a public restroom? It is like spoils taken on the  field of battle from the vanquished USSR.    So let us be told who the author of this catastrophe is. Let  us be told that it was wrought by Gaydar and Yeltsin, Fedorov  and Shumeyko.    Two symptomatic blabbings have been agitating minds as of  late. On the eve of Clinton's visit the following political  formula appeared in the American press and was relayed to Russia  by CNN: ""America will have to choose between the shock therapy  of Gaydar, which, of course, would weaken Russia to the United  States' advantage, and a new, more moderate policy, which would  preserve Russian potential to some extent, but would protect  Russia against a social explosion which could sweep away the  supporters of reforms.""    And recently Gavriil Popov, the superdemocrat, published a  program perceived as an attempt to crawl from beneath the rubble  of the present political period. He acknowledges in this program  that Gaydar's shock therapy was thought up by the Americans to  destroy Russia's military-industrial complex.    This was said when our submarines stand fast at the piers,  when the missile and tank plants are at a standstill, and when  the test ranges are dying, military supertechnology is  disintegrating, and young intellectuals are going into commerce  and pimping. This was said by Popov, whose contribution to the  collapse was immense.    So why do you members of parliament not name publicly the  culprits of the catastrophe before embarking on the restoration  of Russia?    [Romanov] Why are we not delivering angry philippics against  the ""regime""? Well, we ourselves, the corps of directors, are to  blame for what has happened. And now we face the prospect of a  shutdown of production--not random, not partial, but total. This  would signify the collapse of the economy and statehood and  national catastrophe.    Yes, Gaydar and Fedorov have gone. Were we to shout curses  after them, we would have to back them up with action also. Stop  the plants? Trigger a directors' strike? What's the use....    Our real fault is that we are today, now, not saying, not  venturing to tell Chernomyrdin, Soskovets, and Gerashchenko:  ""Stop. Let's take a look. We acknowledge that on account of a  number of Russia's geographical and geopolitical circumstances a  market economy may be created even theoretically only in  European Russia, along the Trans-Siberian Railroad, at that. We  acknowledge that we need a transitional period, that we will not  crawl out of the present pit without emergency economic  measures. And for this reason the present inflationary drift,  when only the idle are not managing to shake money loose from  the cabinet, is intolerable. A realistic program of salvation  and reconstruction of the dying economy is needed.""    [Prokhanov] I know that you, Petr Vasilyevich, are working  on  a multitude of program documents. Could you not briefly give us  the essence of this transitional period and these emergency  measures and the methodology with which it is possible to halt  the catastrophe and undertake the plastic transformation of our  tormented economy into a new quality connected with development.    [Romanov] Russia has two paths, in my view.    The first is to ""pupate,"" to go into isolation, and to  tackle  all problems, technological and structural modernization  included, thanks only to our own internal resources, becoming a  strong national state. Russia should imbibe, figuratively  speaking, the umbilical cords, protruding from its body, of the  defunct empire, lines of communication, and infrastructure that  linked it only recently with the former Soviet republics. But  this would take, considering the scale of the present collapse,  60-70 years.    The second is to accept the role of ""raw material"" state  being imposed by the ""world community,"" making in this sense a  temporary concession. Russia would export raw material and  import technology and would one day once again become a strong,  but not isolated, national state, slowly once again assembling  the empire.    Unless a benign political miracle occurs, the actual  development of Russia will choose a path between these two not  all that optimistic options.    What emergency measures are possible in these contours?  Regardless of the forms of property, it is necessary to  administer in centralized fashion in conjunction with the  territories all the extractive sectors, power engineering,  transport, and foreign economic activity.    It is essential to introduce strict price control of the  economy via a lowering of outlays in the production sectors and  differentiated tax rates for brokerage, commercial, financial,  and banking services. A consolidated government contract by  sector is needed simultaneously. We would in this way  immediately be giving the Russian manufacturer priority. He  would henceforward know precisely what profit he would make in  production, and what, in commerce, and how much he would lose in  taxes.    All investment funds, banks, and other similar financial  institutions should be adroitly oriented toward investment in  efficient works with a necessary government guarantee in the  event of a failure to achieve the contemplated efficiency.    It does not need to be said that the activity of the State  Property Committee and the Antitrust Committee of the Russian  Federation would be suspended for the period of the emergency  measures.    It is essential to sharply limit, to ""suppress,"" imports of  consumer goods, primarily durables, if, of course, these  prohibitions do not entail the danger of starvation. Each bottle  of Italian mineral water on the Krasnoyarsk shelves means a  dollar not invested in the Russian economy. And investments have  declined in Russia by a factor of six or seven since 1991 as it  is. This, incidentally, is a special problem barely soluble  within the framework of emergency measures alone.    It is necessary also to establish sectoral wage  differentiation, movement beyond the framework of which should  entail severe penalties.    Finally, for the Russians coming to us from the near abroad  we need to create jobs in the agro-industrial zones which are  promising from the viewpoint of the market economy. The move  should, of course, be undertaken in planned fashion, with the  simultaneous closure of works that have no future.    [Prokhanov] This is akin to a plan for the restoration of  the  national economy after a war. It creates an ideological field,  toward which the people are predisposed. The people must  understand that they have been bombed to destruction. And that  we will have to restore the devastated cities and lines of  communication and also human relations by way of the injection  in the restoration of the surplus quantity of our own calories.    [Romanov] Yes, belt-tightening once again, for the umpteenth  time.... Agrarian problems were discussed recently in a  committee of the upper house of parliament. I said that no  government financial injections would in themselves save the  situation. We need a program of salvation of the agrarian  complex--as specific as possible, for a year or 18 months to two  years. And for the sake of it, this program, we would tighten  our belts. And the people would understand were there at least  some changes for the better in two years.    [Prokhanov] You have spoken about the creation of a national  political alliance, a congress of politicians, and have drawn  its boundaries, in which tremendous political potential is  condensed. It means, most likely, not only politicians and their  parties and allies but also vast social groups and classes. The  working class, peasantry, technical and liberal arts  intelligentsia, and even the new bourgeoisie to some extent. On  what kind of base do you conceive of the creation of this  alliance? On the basis of the State Duma or in the garb of a new  political super-organization?    [Romanov] We need to think sooner about ideology than about  organization and to find comprehensible, plastic slogans  explaining reality and outlining--once again I avail myself of  your term, Aleksandr Andreyevich--a future image, an image of  the near future.    After all, whatever one's attitude toward the Bolsheviks, it  has to be admitted that ideologically they operated very  dexterously in 1917. They did not say that they had appointed  Russia ""to set alight the fire of world revolution."" They said:  ""Peace to the peoples, the land to the peasants, the plants and  factories to the workers!""    We should be understood by all: from the nationally oriented  ""bourgeois"" to the retirees who are living by begging. The  ""bourgeois"" need to be told that if they begin to build national  industry, they will be exempted from taxes. And they do not need  to be told what this means. If, however, they start simply to  ""turn over money,"" the financial inspector will have them in his  clutches. And only this way, not the other way about. We will  offer retirees selective social programs. And so forth.    So if such a program is taken up, I am prepared on my  responsibility to formulate and put into practice what my city  and my sector need. Not debate, it is necessary, I repeat, to do  something and to know how to do it.    [Prokhanov] You are a general director. You should lead a  technocratic train into this political bloc. You have the  authority of a man and the subtle internal laws and tendencies  of the corps of directors. I have, I confess, long ceased to  understand what is happening in it....    [Romanov] The same as in the country.    [Prokhanov] In the good old days I knew this very stratum of  directors. I saw their tragedy, the smashing of the corps of  directors in Gorbachev's times. At first they came to elect  them, the directors, gave them over to be torn to pieces by the  mob....    [Romanov] Remember how Gorbachev on many occasions said in  public: Let's fall on the bureaucracy together, we, from above,  you, the people, from below?    [Prokhanov] Yes, this was the first blow at the base stratum  of the Soviet state. The directors then came to be persecuted,  and they were declared the ""principal conservatives"" and the  exponents of the ""communist conspiracy."" They were defamed as,  virtually, the ""second structure after the KGB impeding  perestroyka."" While having sustained heavy losses, the corps of  directors withstood these two blows, nonetheless.    Subsequently, against their wishes, the directors awoke one  day as multi-millionaires, virtually. The oblast property  committees appointed for them super-high salaries, and they were  permitted via easily obtainable licenses to engage in the  commercial exportation of products overseas.    [Romanov] But, despite this, the directors held the work  force together and prevented it disintegrating. Nor do they all  have such super-high salaries--in my circle, at least.    [Prokhanov] But as of late many of the directors whom I know  have had the constant feeling that this ""small social world"" at  the enterprises is on the verge of disintegration. The directors  are cringing beneath the sullen looks of the workers....    [Romanov] They are right to have this feeling, possibly.  After all, for the past eight years the authorities have done  everything to keep the directors out of politics and to ensure  that they not perceive their responsibility for the enterprise  on the scale of the association, the main administration, the  sector, or the economy as a whole and that they get used to  feeling that they are ""on their own.""    I remember Kremlin meetings under Gorbachev and Silayev.  Even  then we directors were speaking at the top of our voices about  the crisis, about how to get out of it. There was a great deal  of talk, but nothing was done. Subsequently various forces on a  multitude of occasions attempted to place the directors beneath  the most diverse political banners. Ultimately they threw up  their hands and concentrated on the problems of their own  enterprises. And it was at this moment that they ceased to be  for the workers representatives of the state at their  enterprise, and they have not yet become regular capitalist  bosses.    Nonetheless, you are right: The corps of directors is still  a  real force incorporating also an organized structure, possession  of the keys to technology, and a social infrastructure. And for  this reason the struggle for it will continue.    [Prokhanov] Volskiy's attempt to capture the affections of  the corps of directors, accumulate it in the Party of  Industrialists, and create a political battering-ram from the  directors is the best known. Against the background of  Tizyakov's aborted attempt, it appeared successful for some  time. Tizyakov was dislodged from politics after August 1991.  Volskiy evaporated in October 1993.    Quite recently Skokov held in your parts, Krasnoyarsk, a  congress of the Federation of Commodity Producers of Russia. I  saw him after this. He is a strong politician and a connoisseur  of the corps of directors, but he is by no means certain of the  success of his mission--the national consolidation of the  technocrats.    Is it possible, in your view, to consolidate the directors  politically and teach them to uphold the political interests of  their corporation, not only of the economic lobbies? And who  could do this? The directors have been rejecting one leader  after another....    [Romanov] Permit me to disagree: First of all, it is not a  question of leaders but of ideology. Only ideology drives the  army, only thanks to ideology do the lines of communication run,  only it consolidates the classes. But the directors cannot have  their own, ""directors'"" ideology. But there is formally no  official ideology either. It is not known whether statehood  itself exists or not.    It seems to me that we need only say the word, the main  word.  Pose the problems on whose resolution the corps of directors,  sober-minded government officers administering territories and  fearing a social explosion, and national entrepreneurs could  consolidate.    A mobilization plan is needed for the salvation of Russia.  And it is in it, in this plan, that an ""informal"" official  ideology, an official instinct, should be manifested. And I am  afraid that if in the coming weeks what I have attempted to  formulate is not stated publicly, this initiative will have been  intercepted.     "

A communique from the  Colombian health authorities says that Jorge Antelo Perez,  Cuba's first vice minister of public health, is heading a  delegation of seven physicians and epidemiologists who are in  Bogota for that purpose. The agreements signed in Havana in  January by Colombian Public Health Minister Juan Londono cover  aspects of, among other things: vaccinations, epidemiological  monitoring, primary health care, medications, tropical diseases,  hospital equipment maintenance, and training of human resources.    Cuba's work on the meningitis vaccine was analyzed during  the  meetings the Cuban delegation has had with Colombian Deputy  Public Health Minister (Eduardo Alvarado) and other Colombian  officials.    Cuba is going to sell vaccines to Colombia. The Cuban and  Colombian delegations have agreed to proceed to the acquisition  of vaccines against meningitis on the part of Colombia.

Our vice minister of public health, Jorge Antelo Perez, said  we stand ready to deliver the 2.5 million doses of hepatitis-B  vaccine agreed on during Colombian Public Health Minister Juan  Londono's visit to Havana. The representatives of the two  nations also made progress as regards the agreements having to  do with designing the expanded plan for immunizations in  Colombia over the next five years.

We can also say that with fewer resources, we have  begun classes and are trying hard to enhance the quality of  education, which we think is possible. We believe that a good  education does not depend on imports, currency, or raw  materials, but mostly on political willingness. We have this  because we have excellent teachers who are opposed to the  closing of any school, and who are willing to make all possible  efforts so the quality of education will be continually improved.    [Lopez] The schools in the interior involve a more difficult  process because there we need some resources, and the  agricultural polytechnic institutes are capable of achieving  them, the minister said.    [Gomez] Right now we have provinces that have attained  higher  levels of self-sufficiency in the fields, especially in  establishing plans to increase production of pork and milk. They  also managed to find rational solutions to water supply problems  when there is no electricity. Nevertheless, the schools have  been kept open because in each place, everything has been done  with intelligence and rationality. It is the third term here and  we must now develop our teaching activities under these  conditions. Experience has already been accrued and of course we  are willing to develop further.

In an annual report on worldwide drug production and  trafficking, the U.S. Government corroborates that Cuban  authorities continue placing top priority on their anti-drug  policy, and it also indicates that Cuba cooperated with the  Unites States in this area in 1993.    According to Washington's opinion on how the nations of the  world are meeting the commitments made at the 1988 UN Drug  Convention, the report contends Cuba is engaged in a struggle  against drugs, despite the island's problems of fuel shortages  and the lack of spare parts, all of which limit Cuba's capacity  to combat drugs.    Cuba is a signatory of the UN convention on this issue and  has signed bilateral agreements with many nations in the region  to fight the scourge of drug trafficking.    Also, in 1988 it declared its willingness to sign an  agreement of this type with the United States--an offer which up  until now has been ignored by Washington.    Cuban cooperation in this struggle includes the interception  of planes and ships in its airspace and territorial waters, as  well as the supply of information to U.S. services in charge of  confronting this problem.    The United States is the world's largest drug consumer, and  the report admits that although cocaine continues being the main  threat to U.S. drug users, the danger of the use of heroin is  growing at an alarming pace.

Speaking to local Phnom Penh reporters, Robaina said that  the  basic objective of his previous tours of Caribbean and African  countries, and his current tour of Asian countries, is to  explain the truth about what is being done in Cuba. In  developing our foreign policy, we need to explain to our friends  and to governments what we are doing in our country regarding  the economic transformation process in which we are engulfed,  Robaina said.    With these objectives, we could not ignore this region,  which  has achieved important economic results over the past few years.  Their experience can be useful to us, Robaina added.    The Cuban foreign minister told the press that Cuba is open  to foreign investments in the areas of petroleum, nickel,  agriculture, tourism, biotechnology, and the pharmaceutical  industry. He added that this process is difficult and complex  because it is done under the tremendous pressure of the blockade  imposed by Washington against Cuba for more than 30 years. There  is still implacable persecution of all those willing to  negotiate with Cuba. Today, of every 10 contacts we make, eight  are suspended because of such threats. But by no means will we  stop our direct contacts with various countries throughout the  world, he said.    Robaina in Phnom Penh stressed the success achieved despite  the economic, commercial, and financial blockade, and added: We  are neither hell nor heaven, but a beautiful island, which  defends its sovereignty, independence, and achievements.

A communique on the results of the visit notes  that it was a complete success.    At the meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and talks  with State Council Premier Li Peng, which were held in a  friendly, businesslike, and constructive atmosphere, there was  satisfaction that fruitful cooperation in the political,  economic, scientific- technical, cultural, military, and  law-protection spheres had been established.    During the Russian prime minister's four-day official visit,  seven intergovernmental documents were signed and willingness  was expressed to go on expanding and extending Russian-Chinese  cooperation in all directions. The parties confirmed their  commitment to the principles established in the joint  declaration on the basis of cooperation between Russia and China  signed during President Boris Yeltsin's visit to Beijing in  December 1992. They declared their resolve to move their good  neighborly and amicable interstate links into a new stage of  development.    The parties are firmly convinced that long-term and stable  relations of good neighborliness, friendship, and mutually  beneficial cooperation aimed at the 21st century meet the  fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples and are  an important factor for peace, stability, and development in the  Asia- Pacific Ocean region and the world as a whole.    The further development of Russian-Chinese cooperation in  trade and the economy and in science and technology occupied a  central place in the talks and the parties expressed their  intention to give this greater priority. Since cross-border and  interregional cooperation is becoming an essential, constituent  part of these relations, the desire was stressed for cooperation  in manufacturing and on joint investment projects at regional  level.    Russia and the People's Republic of China also intend to  develop military-technical links while observing both sides'  international obligations.    There was positive assessment of the Russian-Chinese talks  on  border questions and the mutual reduction in the Armed Forces  and confidence-building measures in the military sphere in the  border region. Compliance with the spirit and letter of the  agreement on the state border on its eastern part was  reaffirmed. The sides intend to continue their talks on  outstanding problems, and also to intensify preparations for the  agreement on the Russian-Chinese state border on its western  part.    The importance of reaching an early agreement on a mutual  reduction in Armed Forces and confidence-building measures in  the military sphere in the border region was noted at the talks.  It was felt mutually that the further reaffirmation at the  border between the two countries of an atmosphere of peace,  good-neighborliness, and cooperation not only contributes to a  deepening of mutual trust and mutual understanding in  Russian-Chinese inter-state relations, but also favors security  and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.    During the course of an exchange of opinions between  Chernomyrdin and the Chinese leadership on questions of the  socioeconomic changes in Russia and China, the usefulness of  mutual knowledge of the theory and practice of reforms and  exchange of experience, with due regard for the specific  characteristics of the two countries, in order to assist in  deepening an understanding of the situation in Russia and in  China, was noted.    The document notes the proximity or coincidence of the views  of the two countries on fundamental international problems and  their intention to strengthen their multitiered, constructive  cooperation in regional and world affairs, which is an important  factor for stability and security in Asia and for the overall  improvement of the situation in the world. The importance of  multilateral, economic cooperation in north-east Asia and in the  Asia-Pacific Ocean region was acknowledged.    The parties agreed to maintain and develop active dialogue  at  all levels including the highest as they believe that this is of  great significance for the further expansion of mutual  understanding and mutual trust and the uninterrupted development  of good-neighborly and amicable relations and mutually  advantageous cooperation between Russia and China.    On behalf of the Russian Government, Viktor Chernomyrdin  invited Premier Li Peng to make an official visit to Russia in  1995.     "

Japan and Russia have been working out the schedule for the  trip after Japanese Deputy Foreign Minister Hiroshi Fukuda and  his Russian counterpart Aleksandr Panov earlier this week agreed  on Hata's visit in March. Fukuda and Panov agreed during two  days of meetings in Moscow to promote political dialogue between  the two nations and continue talks on a long-standing  territorial dispute involving four Russian-held islands off  Hokkaido.    Conditions for Hata's visit were set after Yeltsin vowed  Thursday in an address to Parliament to continue efforts to  settle the territorial row with Japan and conclude a peace  treaty, the officials said.    Japan claims sovereignty over Etorofu, Kunashiri and  Shikotan  islands and the Habomai group of islets, which the former Soviet  Union seized at the end of World War II. The dispute has  prevented the two sides from concluding a peace treaty.    But analysts say Tokyo and Moscow are unlikely to achieve  any  major breakthrough on the territorial row during Hata's visit  because ultrarightists and conservatives, opposed to returning  the islands to Japan, dominate the new Russian Parliament.    During his visit, Hata may also meet Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and other leaders of Parliament, the  officials said.    Hata is expected to voice Japan's support for Russia's  reform  efforts and shift toward a market-oriented economy in his talks  with Russian leaders, they said.    He is also likely to discuss promoting personnel exchanges  between the two nations, they said.     "

On  this occasion, the drug destroyed was part of shipments lost by  international drug traffickers in their illegal operations near  the Cuban archipelago. This situation has, on different  occasions, even led to arrests, trials, and sanctions by local  courts.    In fact, the Cuban Government's organization of the fight  against drugs dates back many years and is even coordinated with  international organizations and other countries interested in  the topic.    Not even U.S. administrations, which Cuba has accused of  politicizing the issue and using it as a weapon in its  traditional conflict with the island, have been excluded from  the cooperation Havana has proposed and is implementing to deal  hard blows to drug traffickers.    A glance at the past reveals an interesting and important  balance regarding Cuba's war on drugs.    In 1992, for example, Cubans seized 1,647.91 kg of cocaine  and 2,000 kg of marijuana, captured three boats, and held 12  drug traffickers, who were remanded to the courts.    In June of that same year, a national commission to combat  drugs was created, comprised of representatives from the  Justice, Interior, Foreign Relations, and Public Health  Ministries, the Attorney General's Office, and General Customs.  An earlier UN report cited Cuba among the top 10 countries of  the continent in seizing cocaine and marijuana. An important  thing about Cuba is that it does not produce or consume drugs.    In January 1993, the courts sentenced five U.S. drug  traffickers for possession of drugs and illegal entry in Cuba,  following contacts with U.S. authorities and the exchange of  information on the matter. In May of last year, Cuban ovens  incinerated almost 200 kg of cocaine found in bags that had  drifted onto central Camaguey Province coasts as a result of  illegal operations conducted in nearby waters.    In June 1993, authorities burned another 400 kg of drugs  that  had also drifted here through the northern keys in Camaguey and  Ciego de Avila Provinces. In the same month, 2.5 tons  confiscated from different points in Cuba were incinerated.    Last November, 10 foreigners and Cubans were tried and  sentenced. They had been arrested when a specialized corps  dismantled an entire network of drug traffickers, who used the  island as a transshipment point for drugs sent from Colombia to  Germany.    In a declaration by Gerd Merrem, director of the UN program  for international control on drugs, the United Nations  recognized Cuba's participation in the international effort  against the drug scourge.    Merren praised the efficiency of Cuban authorities in  combating drug trafficking, and he mentioned that the developed  long-standing cooperation has left a deep mark because of the  sincerity and professionalism of experts devoted to this task.

This is a financial arrangement that combines the  payment of debts with investments through the direct injection  of fresh money, better known as the swap [preceding word in  English] sytem.    This system is being applied to three investment projects in  priority sectors in Cuba: tourism, cement, and petroleum, as  reported by the Mexican press.    Concerning tourism and cement, the contracts have already  been signed and are already operating. Approximately $50 million  of the Cuban debt to Mexico was paid through this contract. It  has to do with the Tuzpan Hotel in Varadero, where 50 percent of  the shares were purchased through this channel by the DSC group  from Guadalajara. The other is the Mariel Cement Plant, the  operator and trader of which is the Mexican cement company,  Cemex.    The Petroleum agreement will be signed in May, and according  to the magazine PROCESO, a letter of intent was already signed  between Mexpetrol [Mexican Petroleum Company] -- the principal  shareholder of which is the parastate company, Mexican Petroleum  -- and (Cubec), the Cuban distributor of crude oil.    This represents a joint investment of $200 million, to  modernize and expand the refinery in Cienfuegos, the largest in  our country. Cuba owes $310 million to Mexico. Through this  procedure, the Cuban Government will pay another $50 million and  will guarantee investment.    Mexico is the first country with which agreements of this  type have been signed, which, according to local analysts,  accords Mexico the status of a nation favored by the Cuban  Government.     "

One of the issues discussed was  actions against social phenomena that degrade moral values.  Female and male prostitution, streetwalkers, and pimping were  terms that gave rise to comments stressing the need for legal  support and repression to punish these activities closely tied  to tourism. The effectiveness of recent police operations to  preserve an orderly society were also acknowledged. On the other  hand, it was mentioned that the solution to the problem ought to  lie in prevention and in teaching the youth in school to  repudiate socially sanctionable behaviors.    In workshops being conducted in several provinces, students  are found to have a noncritical and, of course, tolerant  attitude due to a lack of information. This reaffirms that the  home must take on an increased level of involvement and  responsibility.    Among the issues discussed by the commission were community  efforts in youth recreation and praise for the accomplishments  attained by the People's Councils working closely with  political, cultural, and sports organizations. There are already  18 discotheques nationwide and several more will be opened this  year; there will also be a significant increase in youth clubs.    The care of people with mental problems was also discussed  and it was clear that even though the Cuban state, with scarce  resources right now, gives priority to these cases, the legal  responsibility for the mentally ill lies with the family, which  in certain cases relinquishes their care.    The plenum of the commission discussed very contemporary  issues which generally cause concern to the population. It was a  very up-to-date and down-to-earth plenum.     "

This dialogue, during which journalists who were awarded the  Jose Marti national journalism prize for 1993 participated, was  a continuation of the Revolutionary Armed Forces' [FAR] homage  to press workers begun at a recent meeting with Division Gen.  Ulises Rosales del Toro, head of the general staff.    In an event that lasted for more than seven hours at FAR  Ministry headquarters, the participants received detailed  information on improving the FAR, with the objective of adapting  its structures, systems, and activities to the nation's economic  possibilities.    The FAR minister spoke at length about these subjects and  explained in detail experiences and results obtained by the  FAR's regular troops, and especially the EJT [Youth Labor Army],  both in agricultural-livestock production earmarked for  self-sufficiency and that earmarked for the population.    Another aspect amply discussed by Army Gen. Raul Castro was  the process of perfecting the FAR's managerial system, in  operation for several years now, which is characterized by its  comprehensiveness.    In the name of those present, UPEC president Tubal Paez  called the meeting a great gift to the sector and reiterated all  journalists' commitment to remain, as has been the case up to  now, in the front line of combat in defense of the Revolution.  Paez affirmed that the FAR Ministry and the commander in chief  have, in Cuba's journalists, one of their principal weapons.     "

Lage, a 42-year-old pediatrician, recalls that Cuba grants  exit permits to whoever wants to travel and notes that ""no one  involved in this type of incident can leave the country."" The  only solution is for the refugees in the embassies ""to leave  with our guarantees that there will be no reprisals against  them,"" he added.    Lage, who is also one of the persons responsible for Cuban  economic reforms, defended the ""socialist model"" and the  ""fundamental"" role of a planned economy, but did not reject  ""openings to the private initiative"" or ""private work"" in  certain sectors. He noted Cuba's encouragement of tourism and  foreign investments (an example of which is the sale of 49  percent of the shares of the telephone company to a Mexican  enterprise) and its transformation of state farms into  cooperatives.    Regarding an eventual political change, Lage was blunt:  ""Cuba's problems are of an economic nature, and the solutions we  need are of an economic nature."" ""It is possible"" to improve  the political system, ""but not through elections aimed at  producing a multiparty system,"" he said.    Regarding speculation that some day he could succeed Fidel  Castro, he said: ""I do not believe I am the right person.""  ""Besides,"" he explained, ""here there is someone who is second in  command in the country's leadership; that is Raul Castro.  Castro's replacement is thus already known.""     "

By reaffirming its commitment to the trilateral Moscow agreement  on the Ukrainian nuclear weapons, Kiev secured Washington's  consent to the offer of 700 million dollars in American aid to  Ukraine and the extension of 400 million dollars in reserve  credit in the future. From the standpoint of Russian national  interests, however, it would be wrong to underestimate the  results of the summit. The latest meeting between B. Clinton and  L. Kravchuk, just as the Washington visits of the leaders of  Kazakhstan and Georgia, suggested that the United States is  competing vigorously with Russia for political and economic  influence in the post-Soviet zone.    Kiev as a Counterbalance    We know that in the first weeks after Clinton arrived in the  White House, he and his advisers were already making some effort  to reassess American-Ukrainian relations. Whereas the Bush  administration had conducted an uncompromising dialogue with  Ukraine, suggesting that economic and other aid to Kiev be  dependent on its renunciation of nuclear weapons and development  of relations with Russia, the Clinton team is employing much  more flexible tactics. According to the frank admission of U.S.  Deputy Secretary of State S. Talbott, ""we let our Ukrainian  friends know that we are striving for broader, deeper, more  meaningful, multidimensional relations with a view to our common  interests in the spheres of economics, politics, and security.""    It is precisely in this context that we must view the  congressional hearings on the state of U.S.-Ukrainian relations  at the end of June 1993, resulting in the elaboration of the  five fundamental principles of the Clinton administration's  ""Ukrainian"" policy:    ""1. A country in the center of Europe as large and as rich  in  resources as Ukraine should be playing a decisive role in  security matters in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE);    ""2. Ukrainian independence and sovereignty are important to  U.S. national interests;    ""3. Our relationship with Ukraine will not depend on our  relations with Russia;    ""4. In view of its history and geographic location, Ukraine  has legitimate security concerns;    ""5. We believe that Ukraine's own interests would be served  by the fulfillment of its commitments in line with the Lisbon  Protocol, its ratification of the START I Treaty, and its  affiliation with the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear  Weapons as a nuclear-free state.""    It appears that Washington is pursuing several goals at once  in its more active ""Ukrainian"" policy. First of all, it wants  the complete elimination of Ukraine's nuclear arsenal, with the  whole process under its own close supervision, because the state  of nuclear security in that former Soviet republic is a matter  of serious concern.    Second, it is striving for the more predictable development  of the still extremely complex political and economic situation  in Ukraine, primarily by discouraging the curtailment of reform  and preventing the country from sliding into chaos and splitting  into several states, which CIA analysts expect to occur in the  next two years. ""The problem consists less in how successful or  unsuccessful America's actions are than in the uncertainty of  Ukraine's own position. It proudly declares its independence,  but it does not have the necessary experience to cope with  genuine difficulties,"" the WASHINGTON POST remarked.    Third, from the standpoint of American geostrategic  interests, an independent Ukraine should serve as a strong  buffer zone between CEE and Western Europe and Russia. It is no  coincidence that Washington has had a generally positive  response to the idea of establishing various types of regional  bloc structures along the western borders of Russia under U.S.  and NATO control. Furthermore, Washington's own attempts to form  groups of states of its own design in the post-Soviet zone have  been accepted by all of the countries of the East European  region without exception, including Ukraine.    In pursuit of the fourth and final goal, Washington has  given  up its earlier temporizing stance on Ukraine and other former  Soviet republics, particularly Georgia and Kazakhstan, and now  wants to take the lead in formulating and conducting Western  policy toward the CIS and to limit Russia's geopolitical  potential considerably by making the breakup of the USSR  irreversible and keeping Russia from inheriting great-power  status. As S. Talbott, the ""generator"" of American policy on the  CIS and Baltic countries, categorically announced, ""we do not  agree that Russia has a sphere of influence allowing it to  behave in certain ways beyond its own borders with adverse  effects on the independence of these states.... We do not even  want to accept the implications of the term 'nearby foreign  countries.'""    Therefore, Ukraine is being assigned the role of a  counterbalance to possible Russian geostrategic and geoeconomic  ambitions, especially its hope of securing key positions for  itself in the post-Soviet zone. During the recent  American-Ukrainian summit, L. Kravchuk publicly agreed with this.    `We Need a Strong Ukraine'    Officials in Washington are not concealing the fact that the  ""Ukrainian card"" will be played primarily in the sphere of  military policy, where financial expenditures are not that  burdensome but are extremely effective. Above all, this  presupposes the offer of security guarantees to Kiev, with a  view to its national independence and territorial integrity. As  evidence of this, Ukraine was the first of the CIS countries to  be included in NATO's ""Partnership for Peace"" program.    In addition to this, the Clinton administration wants to  enhance its relations with Kiev with an extensive long-range  program of economic, scientific, and technical cooperation, with  a view to the impressive economic potential of Ukraine, which  accounts for around 20 percent of the GDP of the CIS countries.  In the opinion of several American politicians, during the  effort to strengthen Ukraine's economy, America should try to  lessen Kiev's dependence on Moscow by redirecting the Ukrainian  economy toward the West. According to Z. Brzezinski, who has  criticized the Democratic administration several times for  putting too much emphasis on Moscow and not paying enough  attention to Kiev, ""if we do not want the revival of the Russian  empire, we need a strong Ukraine.""    At this time the State Department is working on several  proposals to broaden economic aid to Ukraine and send a group of  highly professional experts to that country on the condition  that it take vigorous steps to decentralize its economy. There  is no question that the agreement signed at the  American-Ukrainian summit on the protection of foreign capital  investments in Ukraine will have a positive effect on the  development of trade and economic relations between the two  countries. Besides this, Kiev probably will get the promised  credits of 1.5 billion dollars from the IMF and the World Bank.    In view of the present disastrous state of the economy and  the mounting separatist feelings in Crimea and several eastern  oblasts, however, the Ukrainian leadership cannot put too much  hope in a strong influx of American investments or in the U.S.  offer to ""usher"" Ukraine into Western markets even if it does  conduct a harsh confrontational policy in relations with Russia  (which Ukrainian public opinion is unlikely to support).    Furthermore, Ukraine does not have much chance of joining  the  rapidly growing European Union or the ""Visegrad Group,"" for  which Kiev would be too ""unmanageable."" In other words, the  circle is closing, and it may be impossible to escape Moscow.    `The Hand of Moscow'    Irrespective of the wishes of the Ukrainian leadership, the  once prosperous former Soviet republic might have to rely on a  helping hand (in accordance with market conditions) only from  Russia in the near future. An economic policy with an  anti-Russian thrust would be futile and dangerous for Ukraine.  The roots of industrial cooperation are too deep, and its  dependence on Russian crude resources, especially gas, is too  strong.    This does not mean, however, that the RF Ministry of Foreign  Affairs can turn the pursuit of Russia's ""Ukrainian"" policy over  to Gazprom, which was so proficient in finding a solution to the  problem of Ukraine's debts for deliveries of Russian natural gas.    The fact is that playing the ""Ukrainian"" card, just as other  cards like the ""Georgian"" and ""Kazakhstani"" ones, could lead to  the dramatic reduction of Russia's geostrategic and geoeconomic  capabilities under some circumstances. It is in Moscow's  long-term interest to intensify integration processes within the  CIS, establish a single post-Soviet economic zone,  unconditionally give up the internationalization of problems  between Russia and Ukraine (Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet), and  support the social and economic structures in Ukraine with the  strongest affiliation with the Russian Federation. Finally, it  is time to consider more vigorous activity by Russian  transnational corporations. Russia's investment expansion  probably will produce perceptible economic advantages and  strengthen its influence in the nearby foreign countries.     "

The official said negotiations on the oil sales stalled  after  Cuba proposed to make its payments contingent on its sugar  sales, something that could represent problems for Colombia if  Cuba encounters problems in its sugar trade. Rendon said the  Colombian Government is demanding the oil sales be backed by  letters of credit from major international banks, something  Havana apparently has not considered.    The announcement on the sale of oil produced serious  protests  among Cubans exiles in Miami, whose most radical sectors have  proposed boycotting Colombian products exported to Florida.    Meanwhile, Colombian political sectors have asked the  Gaviria  administration to reconsider its diplomatic relations with Cuba  after the media disclosed the holding of a ""summit"" in Havana in  which several guerrilla leaders and a Catholic bishop allegedly  participated. According to media reports, it appears the  meeting took place between 23 and 28 January with the presumed  consent of Fidel Castro's government. This is why the Colombian  Government asked for an explanation of the matter in a  diplomatic note signed by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. The  Cuban Government denied that such a ""summit"" was ever held. In  turn, Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas said, ""we  have to believe"" Cuba, and he ruled out the possibility of  breaking relations.    Diplomatic relations between Santa Fe de Bogota and Havana  were reestablished in October after having been suspended for 12  years. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay (1978-82) broke off  relations after intelligence reports indicated Colombian  guerrillas had been trained in Cuba.     "

The request is likely to be followed by an application for full membership, officials in Caricom states say. But the request for observer status has not been received with enthusiasm by all community members, and there is some doubt that it will be granted. A decision is expected at the community's next summit in July. The Cubans have been encouraged by Caricom's decision to establish a joint commission with Havana to investigate areas of possible economic co-operation. Mr Ramon Sanchez Parodi, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, says Havana has also taken heart from its recent admission to the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, over the objections of Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands, two US Caribbean possessions. 'The Cubans do not speak the political language of Caricom members,' said Dame Eugenia Charles, premier of Dominica. 'They cannot just jump into bed with us. There must be a courting period.' Mr Sanchez said his government wanted to increase its limited economic ties with its Caribbean neighbours: 'There are now opportunities for Cuba to work with the rest of the Caribbean in tourism, trade and all economic matters.' 'There is also the prospect for collaboration in high-technology and biotechnology ventures, with firms in the private and public sectors. The US opposed Cuba's application to join the Caribbean Tourism Organisation, but the members supported it. Caricom will accept Cuba despite US pressures.'  The Financial Times   London Page 5  "

Few could have conjectured that Armenia would be  at war with Azerbaijan and the Dniester region with Moldova,  that the mojahedin would destroy Russian border posts, that war  would ruin and plunder prosperous Yugoslavia....    Today, we are on the threshold of yet another conflict,  which  in scale could surpass all of the others that we have seen thus  far. What is in question is Crimea.    It is said: ""If you want peace, prepare for war."" The people  in Crimea want peace very much. The tension is growing rapidly.  The noise of the engines of military vehicles can be heard  behind the reports of the first round of the presidential  elections in Crimea. Thirty-eight percent of the votes received  by Yuriy Meshkov, the leader of the Republican Party and a  supporter of Crimean independence, against 17 percent of the  votes for Nikolay Bagrov, the chairman of the Supreme Council of  Crimea, established the two candidates of the second round of  elections. In the second round on 30 January, Meshkov could  receive another 30 percent--the votes of other candidates who  came out for the actual secession of Crimea (in one or another  form) from the structure of Ukraine. But Ukraine does not plan  to give Crimea to anyone anywhere.    In this situation, an inevitable worsening has already  started, and it is dangerous, because it makes it possible for  various political forces to play the ""Crimean card"" for their  own interests. I picture the situation in Crimea sufficiently to  declare: The very first spilled blood will create a prolonged  conflict from which Russia will be unable to stand aside. The  marking off is already actually not from the ""center line,"" but  from the frontline.    The presidential elections have already given one important  result: The referendum of 1991, when a majority of Crimeans  expressed themselves for locating the peninsula in the structure  of Ukraine, has already passed into history.    The increase in pro-Russian attitudes is fully explained by  the well-known difficulties of the Ukrainian economy, the  coupon-ruble exchange rate, and also by a rejection of some of  the actions of Ukrainian authorities by an appreciable part of  the population of the peninsula. It is the increase in  pro-Russian attitudes that is making the worsening of relations  between Moscow and Kiev very probable and that is creating the  possibility of an acute political crisis in both Russia itself  and in Ukraine.    The actions of a politician depend on the conditions in  which  he is placed. As ""a candidate in independent"" Crimea, he will  inevitably be subjected to pressure on the part of Kiev. It  cannot be otherwise, because even President Kravchuk and the  Ukrainian Government will end up in their turn under the  pressure of nationalists who also have sufficient strength for  their own actions on the peninsula. But because each action  gives rise to a counteraction, the answer will be a further  increase in sympathy for Russia, right down to direct appeals  for ""reunification.""    Not one president who might be elected to this post will be  able to ignore the will of the people. Only a very mature  politician in this situation will be able to ""pass over a  blade,"" without tearing the status quo with one striking but  incorrect step. There are a lot of opportunities for such steps,  including those capable of directly influencing the situation in  Russia.    It is possible to let the situation go a little further and  simultaneously to appeal to President Yeltsin and to the State  Duma with a request to examine the question and accept Crimea  into the Russian structure. After the president most likely  answers ""No,"" the Duma will express itself somewhat differently,  and some parties will habitually deploy a detail of volunteers  to Crimea. When there is the smell of a big war with a nuclear  Ukraine (in fact) that is not badly armed overall (at the  expense of the Soviet Army), the president could be faced with  the choice: the Duma or war. And what is he supposed to choose?    It is reassuring that the leaders of Crimea and the leaders  of Russia understand all of this perfectly well. But under what  conditions will they operate? No kind of common sense and  political experience will withstand ""the pressure of interests""  that are reinforced by the demands of the voters.    Crimea is tied to Ukraine and to Russia with a thousand  invisible threads. It is necessary to be aware that there are  those for whom a conflict is advantageous. Someone is already  hoping to make money on the supplies of weapons and equipment,  to profit on food and medicine, to extract a triple price for  transporting refugees, and so on. All of this has already  happened in ""hot spots.""    Interests can be confronted only by other interests. Indeed,  it was only several years ago that no one believed that Georgia  would be at war with Abkhazia, but, after all, neither was it  believed there would be a unified Europe or that the Berlin Wall  would be destroyed. There is also a solution to the ""Crimean  question."" It is very complicated, but there cannot be a simple  solution here. The solution is not only for Crimea to go  halfway, but also for Russia as a whole. Rapprochement is the  only alternative to confrontation. The only alternative to  Russian-Ukrainian confrontation (if not because of Crimea,  another reason will be found) is a Russian-Ukrainian union.  First and foremost, an economic union. Its pluses are apparent  to many in Ukraine: Almost 90 percent of the oil and 70 percent  of the gas come from Russia, many Ukrainian goods are already  squeezed out of the Russian market (even Ukrainian sugar is more  expensive than Cuban sugar), and the rate of exchange of the  coupon to the ruble speaks for itself.    The economic union has a lot of supporters and opponents--in  both Russia and Ukraine. The ""opponents"" in Kiev talk about the  inevitable loss of independence in the event of a union. The  ""opponents"" in Russia--about Ukraine's sponging and the state  charity at the expense of the taxpayer....    There are very many different aspects to any form of  economic  cooperation (more so with a union). Actually, the Ukrainian  economy today is more seriously disorganized than the Russian  economy. However, very soon the inevitable sharp increase in the  rates of inflation in Russia (which have already started) are a  reminder that Ukraine, nonetheless, is a fraternal country and  that the ruble, nonetheless, is closer to the coupon than to the  dollar or to the mark. Given the increasing rates of inflation,  many will stop being frightened by ""subsidization"" of the  economies of the countries of the former USSR.    In any case, the variants of a possible development of  relations of Ukraine and Russia today lie between two extremes:  from confrontation all the way to military conflict and an  economic union with a unified monetary system, ""transparent""  borders, and so on. The question is what is more advantageous  and what responds to the interests of the parties more.  Yugoslavia received its experience, and even in a purely  economic sense does not speak in favor of war.    Under our conditions, it is not only the economy that  determines policy, but also vice versa. Life has shown that the  breakup of the country is capable of bringing political  dividends. The practical question rests on how to make an  economic union politically advantageous to its supporters. Up  until now, all of the technology of mutual relations in the CIS  proved its unsuitability. All of the countries of the  Commonwealth and the new abroad are at a very complicated stage:  Without new political technologies and operational developments,  all that will be left will be to discuss questions of  humanitarian assistance with the West.    Discussions about the fact that ""Russia is the first among  equals"" are simply not technological. Ideas are needed that  would set the beginning of an evolution in a new direction. The  balance of interests must show in precisely what direction. But  whatever this direction is--today it is a direction away from  the frontline.     "

At some time or another the  ANC will have to choose between its friends and the interests of  the people of South Africa.""    Violence Must be Stopped -- A second editorial on page-6 of  BEELD says: ""In South Africa there is the reality are  politicial leaders who at gatherings plead the cause of  tolerance and free political participation. There is, however,  a second reality of intimidation and violence on the ground  which is raging on unhindered and claiming more and more  victims. Only last week the ANC complained that the death of a  Nelspruit National Party organizer should be investigated in the  ANC. At Creighton in Natal 15 ANC supporters died in a  bloodbath. Civilized behavior has clearly become the first  victim of the relentless power struggle being waged in the  country. Political parties must know, though, that what is  being sown by their followers today will be reaped by all in the  months and years ahead.""     "

As the new Workers Parliament Assemblies (approximately  80,000 meetings in which workers study ways to reduce expenses,  increase income, achieve profitability, and mend finances) are  being held, the editorial writes, the workers who attend them  learn about terms such as efficiency, economy, and effectiveness.    The editorial encourages workers not to look for  macroeconomic solutions to national problems at those meetings,  rather, to concentrate on the internal problems of each center,  because this will allow for the reinstatement of the centers'  productive capabilities and the achievement of optimal  development.    ""We need to produce more of everything with current  resources  to be able to produce the many products we lack,"" the article  writes, adding it is vital for workers to concentrate on how to  reduce costs, to take advantage of production potentials, to  make the best use of raw materials, and to obtain quality  products and services.""    It is a matter of achieving economy, efficiency, and  effectiveness in all business and budgeted activities, be it in  the production of products or in services, it adds.    The Workers Parliament Assemblies are enhancing the  country's  true potential to overcome the severe economic crisis that  developed after the downfall of the socialist bloc and the  intensification of the U.S. blockade, the editorial stresses.    After attending those assemblies, Cubans know the  significance of budgets, costs, subsidies, profitability,  excessive circulation, income, expenses, prices, taxes, losses,  and profits to the island's future. Thus, the assemblies are an  excellent education mechanism for the union movement, it  comments.    The Cuban economy is showing a growing gap between the  monetary liquidity in the hands of the population and the offer  of goods and services, and that is why we need to decrease  substantially the budget deficit, the editorial emphasizes.

That is  their intent. They even included this in a document known as the  New South Africa Foreign Policy Charter.    In view of the fact that we have already attended the  inauguration and that certain talks have been held with cabinet  representatives, what are the prospects that this will become a  reality?    [Castro] Well, from the point of view of our relations with  Mandela, the ANC, we have more than diplomatic relations. We  have had close ties of brotherhood for many years. I believe we  are family. Regarding foreign relations we are not demanding  anything, or putting conditions; the closer our friendship with  a country, the less we ask to establish ties. We allow  circumstances and the appropriate moment to determine the  establishment of ties. In the special case of South Africa, at  this time, we could not make a definitive statement.    I have been received here like a brother, like a son.  However, we have not pressed the issue of formal ties. I believe  that perhaps tomorrow it will be brought up in the talks with  the foreign minister. Robertico [Robaina] has been talking with  the foreign minister. Tomorrow, I will again meet with Mandela.  Perhaps he will bring this up and ties will be immediately  established. However, we will not bring it up. We must bear in  mind what is good for them, and the appropriate moment to  formalize ties, rather than bringing it up as a demand or as a  request from us.    However, it seems inevitable that those ties will be  established quickly because there are few countries with whom we  have stronger ties -- kinship and fraternal ties.    Today I greeted almost every minister. I do not speak with  ministers of other countries. We talked like old relatives. I am  convinced all of them want the prompt establishment of ties; but  out of a basic sense of courtesy and respect, we should not  exert pressure. They can do it whenever they are ready.  Relations, de facto, are very strong between South Africa and  Cuba.    Now, it is a matter of formalities. That formality could be  fulfilled today, tomorrow, or the day after. Very soon.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, further on this issue but  on another aspect, independently of whenever the diplomatic ties  are established: In what fields do you believe that cooperation  could be developed the furthest in areas of common interest  between Cuba and South Africa?    [Castro] Whenever we speak with South Africans or South  African cadres, we discover great prospects. The first thing we  notice is in the spiritual sphere. When they talk with us, at  times, the things they say truly moved us. They express a  fondness for Cuba which leaves us really speechless. There is an  incredible bond of affection. I believe that few times has there  been such a great bond with any country. When we speak with them  and discuss their plans and ideas, given South Africa's  condition, on one hand they have great development and high  living standards; on the other hand, great social needs, for  example, enormous need for housing, public health, schooling,  and jobs. I was talking with the transportation people. I was  introduced to every minister today at the luncheon. I was told  they have many people who lack the means to move. I spoke with  the transportation minister who said he has a difficult task  ahead of him because means of transportation are inadequate even  though it is a developed country. South Africa is a developed  country. It has important technology, important industries; yet  it has a large population that for many years has lived under  apartheid and has a great stash of needs and dreams of a better  life.    Therefore, the government is faced with having to find  solutions to those problems. When you speak with the  transportation minister you find out about these needs. When you  speak with the housing minister, you find out about those great  needs. When you speak with the sports ministers, you find about  their dreams of developing sports. If you talk with the public  health minister, you see their dreams of improving their  people's health services; thus, the enormous social sphere on  which there are prospects for cooperation between both nations.  This would be beneficial both ways: cooperation from us based on  our experiences, as well as South African cooperation based on  their experiences, and technological development.    [Text] I also spoke with the education minister. They have  great education projects. In other words, all you need to do is  talk a while with each one of these cadres and ministers to  understand that there is a very broad field for cooperation  between Cuba and South Africa. This is undoubtedly the most  developed country in southern Africa.    You should see the road infrastructure. I was telling the  transportation minister: You may have a problem of not enough  means of transportation, but you have great roads. They have  good infrastructure in many areas. The problem is that the  wealth has not been distributed fairly. You find, next to a  superdeveloped world, let us say, an underdeveloped world.    With no other country, even in Latin America, are there such  prospects for cooperation as there are between South Africa and  Cuba, to the extent that we seriously work and study  possibilities and continue to develop that highly fraternal and  warm bond between our two peoples. I must add that we have taken  notice of the very respectful treatment extended to us by every  social sector, not only by ANC members but by the nonblack and  mixed blood sectors, as well. We have also been welcomed by the  white population. We have to keep in mind that this is a  multiracial nation with millions of people from diverse ethnic  backgrounds who have a vital need to cooperate among themselves.  Today, we saw this spirit of cooperation.    Everyone is saying, and justifiably, that the hardest part  begins now. Everyone knows that the hardest part follows the  period of change, of liberation. That is true. I do not think  his [Mandela's] task is easy. However, I believe that they have  developed a significant talent to find solutions. What we saw  today heightened our optimism regarding South Africa's future.  Although we cannot say that South Africa's problems are solved,  they have solved great problems. They have reached today, but I  think they are going to have to continue the struggle. There is  no doubt that Mandela is the man with all the qualifications to  lead this process. He has secured decisive support. I believe he  has to continue working to consolidate what has been achieved so  far and avoid divisiveness. A united country is essential. This  is what we most hope for, and we hope they attain it. Cuba will  be very proud to develop cooperation with South Africa.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, right now, in such a  convulsed world, what does Mandela's victory mean for the  progressive forces?    [Castro] I believe it is a great victory, a great victory of  the South African peoples, the African people, and all the  progressive forces in the world. It is a veritable example and  hope. I believe that South Africa is called upon to exert a  great and positive influence over the entire continent. It is a  renaissance, a revival, proof that great victories can be  achieved even after the disasters that have befallen the world  and that many things are still possible in a unipolar world.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, for many years, Cuba and  South Africa had great differences because of Angola. Did you  ever think then, or later, that you would be here today in the  former capital of apartheid?    [Castro] Well, there are two South Africas and two moments  in  history. For specific reasons, strong clashes took place at a  certain time in history. Now, however, there is a new South  Africa in which such clashes no longer exist -- only peace,  harmony, respect, and affection.    Your question dealing with Angola is very difficult to  answer. First of all, we had to save Angola and its  independence. We were in Angola for 15 years. From the beginning  of intervention by foreign forces in Angola, we gave it our  support -- for 15 years. So many things happened. We had a  strong presence, but it was not strong enough because we could  not, nor did it depend on us alone to, reach a solution to the  problem.    In Angola we fought with the greatest selflessness. The rest  was the responsibility of the Angolan people. We were not  Angola's only supporters. Nevertheless, we can say that we  helped, selflessly and with great loyalty. I would say that our  support was very efficient, and that Cuba's support was not only  efficient, but intelligent. We have no reason to regret anything  we did. Rather, we could say that several difficult times were  confronted -- difficult but not through our fault. Cuba  fulfilled its duty every step of the way. Cuba contributed to  the solution of the highly difficult problems that arose. I do  not want to criticize anyone. I believe today is not a day to  criticize. Perhaps history will record this.    This reminds me of what Jose Eduardo [dos Santos] said to  me during today's luncheon, the very heartfelt, friendly words  from the depths of his soul regarding the [words indistinct]  meaning of Cuba's support to the southern Africa nations of  Angola, Namibia, and South Africa. He pronounced truly moving  words. This is why, in the analysis of our conscience, we find  nothing to reproach.    In one of the most difficult periods, in the end, we had to  make very hard decisions; and we did so. They were the correct  decisions. The problem had to be solved. We could not afford to  be so weak that we had to endure foreign intervention and be  strong enough to solve the issues of foreign intervention. In  such cases, if you are weak, you may incur a great defeat; if  you are strong, you can spare many lives. This is the way it  happened in Angola. We accumulated such a potential that it was  possible to solve the conflict with a minimal loss of lives.  Those were decisions made by Cuba, alone and solely. History has  been distorted many times; but in 1975, when we decided to help  the Angolan people against foreign intervention, the decision  was Cuba's alone. At other times when we had to act in difficult  situations, the decisions were Cuba's alone; at times, it is sad  to say, in order to overcome mistakes made by others. I do not  want to say by whom. However, I am not going to blame the  Angolans; it was others.    We found we needed to act; even in the last, very difficult  situation, mistakes were made -- not our mistakes. That final  situation was decisive or Angola would have been lost, with all  the consequences and losses that would mean for the Angolan  people and ourselves. All this influenced the events that  afterward culminated in those negotiations by virtue of which  Namibia's independence was attained with the implementation of  Resolution 435.    I think this helped accelerate the process of the South  African struggle against apartheid. The main, essential, and  decisive merit belongs to the South African people. Our action  might have helped accelerate that process. This is how we see  it. This is a subject on which we have to be very careful. We  should not be the ones speaking about this, but others. The  South African and Angolan peoples have spoken of the selfless  and noble solidarity of Cuba with their countries. We lived  diverse moments which I believe shall be recorded in history as  they happened.    To date, I see the events and development of the situation  in  South Africa as something wonderful. Much depends on what  happens in South Africa, whether the country attains peace,  harmony, and unity. This is what all of us ought to struggle for  and contribute toward, so that the result of the efforts and  sacrifices of many create a country that can serve as a model to  the world on how to solve such complex problems as the ones  experienced here.    [Unidentified reporter] Commander, do you not believe that  this history is being written now? Today, Mandela referred to  the guests at the inauguration, you among them, and said, and I  quote: Not too long ago, we had to fight and in that struggle  many nations helped us, nations represented here today.    [Castro] I believe he said more: Nations which even spilled  their blood.    Yes, I was moved by that part of the speech. We owe a debt  to  history for the possibility of giving, offering, and reflecting  on the essence of everything that has happened in the last 18 or  19 years. It is now 1994 and this began in 1975. Actually, it  began before 1975 with our cooperation with the peoples of  Guinea-Bissau and Angola, who were fighting against Portuguese  colonialism. All in all, it began over 30 years ago.    The main part took place after 1975 when Cuba made a full  commitment, when the Revolution committed itself fully. We have  to point out that our Revolution played all its cards in that  struggle, and more than once. A defeat under those conditions  would have meant the end of the Cuban Revolution.    All this happened after 1975. We have to gather all that  information. We have not yet written the history of the Cuban  Revolution, but one of the most brilliant pages of the history  of the Cuban Revolution was its selfless cooperation and  solidarity with Africa. As someone once said, the leader of  Guinea-Bissau, I remember, Amilcar [Cabral] said: When we are  independent, Cape Verde and Cuba should become a federation.  That is what he said. By this, I mean to say that he had  extraordinary internationalist feelings. He is the one who said  that someday our dead from Angola would rise up to negate the  smear campaigns against Cuba by those who say that Cuba had  ulterior economic and material motives in Angola.    He said those unforgettable words. Amilcar's death was  truly sad. He was assassinated as other leaders have been. It  pains me that (Zamora Machel) was not present in this  celebration. It pains me that Oliver Tambo was not here today.  There were so many people who struggled and deserved to see a  day like today. It is painful to remember that they are no  longer with us. However, we have the consolation of knowing that  their work yielded fruit and is present in all these things we  are seeing.    Well, our history could not have been more selfless, more  supporting, more noble than that we have written in connection  with the peoples of Africa and other parts of the world. I  believe we have been steadfast toward our African heritage, our  cultural heritage, our blood lines; toward our principles of  solidarity with people struggling to gain their independence,  their freedom; toward our principles of commitment to just  causes in this world. We will never regret this. I believe  future generations will always remember this with pride.    However, we must assume full responsibility with history, by  ensuring that it gets written. It is about time to write down  history. Or others will -- and who knows what they would write?    [Unidentified reporter] We have witnessed the burial of  apartheid, yet everyone is filled with happiness and joy; we  experienced it this morning at the inauguration.    [Castro] We have witnessed the burial of apartheid and the  birth of freedom. What we witnessed today is beautiful in the  extreme. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity  among the South African people, among every sector, and every  ethnic group. You cannot imagine how much we wish right now that  this process continue developing in that direction.    There are many things remaining in this world to be buried,  however; and it seems the number of undertakers is on the  increase everywhere. We also saw this in Barbados [words  indistinct] irresponsibility which with the world's natural  resources and living conditions are being destroyed. The number  of undertakers of evil is on the increase, as well as the number  of midwives of good.     "

It is of little concern to a plant  director or a kolkhoz chairman that each new credit to his  economic unit extended at the expense of increasing the money  supply strengthens that same inflationary pressure. They are  forced to be more concerned about survival today than about the  coming day.    However, as I see it, when scientists with doctoral degrees  take the floor, as the esteemed V. Kulazhanko did in NARODNA  HAZETA on 17 November, they should not approach this issue so  superficially, or should at least approach it with greater  responsibility.    A professor in the area of economics should know that the  exchange rates of all monetary units are established in keeping  with their ""prices"" on the currency market. As a rule, a  currency exchange acts as such a market. Changes in demand and  supply of each specific currency on the exchange immediately  influence its exchange rate cost, which is registered by central  banks. This is an elementary norm of a market economy, even as  imperfect a market economy as ours.    In turn, demand and supply of currencies on the market  depend  on a number of factors, each of which is quite significant in  its own right.    In this instance, the status of the balance of payments of a  state on the whole and in regard to the principal partner  countries separately, understandably depending on the volume of  economic relations with them, ranks first. For Belarus, Russia  is now the key economic partner; it accounts for about  four-fifths of the total volume of trade. Trade with Western  countries is mainly dollar-denominated. That is why the  establishment of realistic exchange rates of the Belarusian  ruble against the Russian ruble and the dollar is of paramount  importance to the economy of the republic.    It is common knowledge that at present we buy considerably  more from Russia than we sell to it. Arrears in payments for  energy resources, oil and gas, appear particularly catastrophic.  The implementation of a state-to-state agreement in keeping with  which a large proportion of our export to Russia goes toward the  delivery of energy resources--a peculiar barter between  states--results in only a part of the ""live"" money participating  in the general commodity trade; in this segment, the demand for  Russian rubles exceeds their supply considerably. For example,  at the 3 November trading session, when the exchange rate of the  Russian ruble came to the mark of one to six Belarusian rubles,  an almost 10-fold surplus of demand over supply was registered.  A similar situation, although to a somewhat lesser degree, was  noted at the subsequent trading sessions of the Interbank  Currency Exchange. Perhaps Professor V. Kulazhanko will suggest  where and from whom the money needed may be obtained in a  civilized manner, through the use of market instruments?    At present, we are persistently suggesting to the government  to give up state-to-state barter in order to ensure the  availability of a greater money supply in real commodity trade  with Russia and thus alleviate the lack of correspondence  between the demand and supply of Russian and Belarusian rubles  in the currency market, as well as to concentrate in the  National Bank all foreign-exchange reserves, including the  Russian ruble, in order to possess the necessary instruments to  influence the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble.    It is also important to understand that no matter how  sizable  the gold and currency reserves of central banks are, they are  intended solely to neutralize the influence of transitory  fluctuations in demand and supply of a particular currency.  Artificially supporting the exchange rate at a high level with  the help of reserves is only possible for a very limited period  of time; it will not stabilize the exchange rate and will bring  about the complete loss of its reserves by the state. We should  add to this that the Interbank Currency Exchange is a sovereign  joint-stock company in which the National Bank has only 9  percent of the votes.    However, the main point is that, as the postwar experience  of  the world and also the current experience of Ukraine suggests,  the establishment of the exchange rate on the basis of comparing  domestic prices in the states in question, that is,  administratively, may only sweep the problem under the rug,  increase the outflow of foreign-exchange capital from the  country, and transplant [currency] exchange operations onto the  street. In Ukraine, the volumes of [currency] sales and exports  grew steadily between April and August of this year, when the  exchange rate of the karbovanets was determined by the results  of trading on the currency exchange. After the introduction of a  fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets, the volume of currency  sales on the exchange fell by a factor of 15, and  foreign-exchange proceeds from exports--by a factor of three. In  October of this year, the market exchange rate already was lower  than the fixed rate by a factor of six. Effective 2 November of  this year, exchange trading was suspended by an edict of the  president.    Therefore, the stabilization of the exchange rate of the  Belarusian ruble against the Russian ruble depends primarily on  reducing the deficits of the balances of trade and payments,  which now go into the hundreds of millions of rubles, to the  size of real external financing. The exchange rate of the  Belarusian ruble is doomed to fall further in the absence of  such a balance. In general terms, this calls for a substantial  reduction in energy consumption, the implementation of a firm  policy to reduce the energy and material effectiveness of  production. The growing domestic prices for imports (taking into  account the falling exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble) are  becoming the instrument that ensures reduction in energy  consumption. On the other hand, it is necessary to increase the  export of products to the Russian Federation that the  devaluation of the Belarusian ruble facilitates. Besides, for  the period of transition Belarus badly needs credit support from  the world community and the Russian Federation in order to cover  the deficit of the balance of payments (and therefore stabilize  the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble). In the absence of  external financing, the rate of decline in production may turn  into a free fall.    The budget and monetary-credit policy within the republic is  the second most important factor. In principle, a budget deficit  amounting to 5 or 6 percent of the domestic national product  appears to be a quite tolerable evil if this deficit is covered  by attracting to the budget funds from the money market without  increasing the total money supply. The trouble is that the  deficit is being financed through the emission of credit, i.e.,  putting into circulation money to which no goods correspond. For  as long as this practice continues, the Belarusian ruble is  doomed to losing value in the form of both inflation and a  decline in its exchange rate.    The monetary and credit policy that has been pursued this  year ensures a reduction in the rate of growth of credit  emission. In 1992, this rate exceeded 27 percent per month,  whereas in the first half of 1993 it amounted to 17 percent, and  in July through November it was less than 9 percent. For 1994, a  still firmer policy is being considered. Calculations indicated  that it is possible to ensure a rate of inflation below 10  percent per month and the stabilization of the exchange rate of  the Belarusian ruble if the growth of net assets of the National  Bank is restricted to no more than a factor of two.    Attaining these indicators is very complicated. First of  all,  a mechanism should be created to cover at least one-third of the  budget deficit by issuing and selling government securities.  Also, it is necessary to create a mechanism of financial  self-support for each economic entity that operates normally.  The availability of working capital is the foundation of all  production. An economy that does not have its own monetary funds  that are adequate to repeat each new production cycle, that is,  to cover the permanent irreducible balances of raw and other  materials, unfinished products, and finished output, will  continuously experience great financial difficulties. An  analysis indicates that in the environment of inflation, the  financial standing of many enterprises, sovkhozes, and kolkhozes  is distorted. In reality, a number of economic units that are  technically considered profitable are potentially bankrupt if  the loss of internal working capital is taken into account. In  such economic units, accounts payable, mainly short-term bank  credit, cover between 50 and 100 percent of the minimum working  assets.    This problem needs to be solved. It is impermissible to use  short-term credit resources of banks, which boost inflation, to  replace the working capital of economic entities. Short-term  bank credit may and should be obtained only to accumulate  temporary or seasonal reserves and expenditures. This norm  should become law for our commercial banks that serve the  economy.    Hence the conclusion: It is necessary to focus the attention  of owners and managers of economic entities, and all organs of  government and power on ways to ensure the preservation of  proprietary working capital and its growth rather than on  ""shaking loose"" credit at banks. Only through creating a  mechanism for the self-financing of permanent irreducible  reserves and costs at each enterprise is it possible to  ameliorate finance and the economy, and to stabilize the  Belarusian ruble.    Bank credit should be expensive, somewhat above the level of  inflation. Term rates on bank deposits and holdings should be  set no lower than the level of inflation.    There is no other way to ameliorate our economy and its  financial and monetary-credit system.    The development of effective devices for overcoming the  crisis can hardly be expected if we are afraid to acknowledge  reality. Since July 1992, national currencies have been  operating de facto in the noncash circulation of all states  which previously belonged to the USSR. Since July 1993,  following the introduction of new banknotes of the 1993 issue by  the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, a fully sovereign  national monetary system based on the noncash Belarusian ruble  and the banknotes of the National Bank also emerged in Belarus.  Now is the beginning of December; all types of payments in the  territory of the republic are made solely in Belarusian rubles  (settlement bills), but we are still debating whose currency we  use: Russian or Belarusian. Arguments put forth by the opponents  of acknowledging reality are simply not serious. Do assertions  merit attention to the effect that it is necessary to postpone  the recognition of Belarusian bills until a program is worked  out that supports their stable operation, gold and currency  reserves are formed, and the level of labor remunerations,  retirement benefits, scholarships, prices, and so on is revised?    The genuine essence of the problem is found in the fact that  the Belarusian ruble that really exists is a weak currency. Its  depreciation has been caused by the economic crisis and the  growth of the deficit in the balance of payments. Whether our  parliament recognizes this ruble as parallel tender of not, the  National Bank and the government should and will take a set of  measures to increase the stability of precisely this functioning  monetary unit. The recognition is necessary first of all in  order to grasp that our budget, subsidy, credit,  foreign-exchange, and other policies should proceed from the  fact that our own monetary system and our own currency exist,  which need attention, merchandise equivalents, and protection.    The recognition of the Belarusian ruble as the national  currency for the period of transition would lead, for example,  People's Deputy Prakapovich to grasp the fact that financing  housing construction by means of credit emission, i.e., by  putting into circulation money to which no goods correspond,  financing that may destroy our economy, is one of the main  causes of inflation, the depreciation of the Belarusian ruble,  and a hidden inflationary tax on the entire population of the  republic. The housing problem should be solved by way of  increasing the proportion of the accumulation fund in the  national income at the expense of reducing the consumption fund,  at the expense of a strict economy and savings regimen for each  developer, and at the expense of real credit resources which  would be the equivalent of the temporarily free accumulation  fund--but not through credit emission.    An attempt by some analysts, including the already mentioned  Professor V. Kulazhanko, to tie the fall of the exchange rate of  the Belarusian ruble to prices and real wages in Belarus and  Russia is likewise surprising. Incidentally, why not in Germany  or Japan? As has already been said, the monetary systems of  Belarus and Russia have actually been separated for a long time  and have functioned independently.    The economic crisis whose peak we are approaching is  manifested primarily in the monetary and credit system; the  crisis of the monetary and credit system is merely the result  but not the cause of the acute economic crisis. The incorrect  interpretation of cause and effect brings about an exaggeration  of the role of monetary policy, banking, and credit in  ameliorating the sick economy. During a period of transition  from a monopolized, administrative economy which is based on  state property and a large number of operating enterprises, no  scientifically substantiated monetary policy is capable of  effecting reconstruction in the national economy, of making  structural changes, boosting production, ensuring privatization,  the development of private business, and competition, and  augmenting the merchandise equivalent of the monetary unit  through the means of production, property, land, and securities.  In the environment of belated reforms, an excessively strict  monetary policy may only facilitate a precipitous fall in  production and a drop in the standard of living of the populace,  and bring about a social explosion.    At the same time, it is an axiom that it is not possible to  ameliorate the economy on a market basis without resolving acute  issues in the financial, budgetary, and monetary-credit systems  and without first of all reducing the level of inflation to 5-8  percent a month.

Well-known Russian business executive and entrepeneur and  parliament member Aleksandr Titkin is sure that Belarus's  foreign economic policy will remain unchanged as long as the  republic's government is headed by common-sensed Vyacheslav  Kebich.    Although Titkin could not foresee what would happen if  Kebich  were to be forced out of his job, he hopes that common sense  will carry the day in the Belarusian government. Titkin said  Belarus is less subject to nationalist passions than many of its  neighbors.    Titkin expressed the opinion that the merging of the  Belarusian and Russian economies should be carried out  carefully, without haste, in order to shield the Russian economy  from additional problems. In particular, he said it is  essential for Russia to avoid handing out hidden subsidies to  its western neighbor, and to avoid pressure from the  ""Belarusian"" roubles on the internal Russian market (in case the  two states' monetary systems are merged).    ""I even think it would be better if the Belarusian ""rabbit""  notes remained in circulation for the initial stage, until we  come to complete agreement on tax, pricing, and tariff policy"",  Titkin announced.    45-year old Titkin was head of a financial investment  company, Russian investment technologies, until the December 12  elections. As deputy in the federation council, he has begun to  work on the finances committee, which is responsible for the  budget, financial, currency, credit and tax policy, monetary  emission, and customs regulations.

The Cuban foreign minister thus disclosed to Uruguayan  representatives the fact that ""the time was not ripe"" to  institute political changes in his country ""due to a still  prevalent foreign pressure,"" an obviously allusion to the trade  boycott imposed by the United States on the island's communist  regime.    Furthermore, Robaina commented on the alleged violations of  human rights in his country, noting that ""the only argument  those who are waging a human rights campaign against Cuba can  cling to (sic) is the issue of political liberties and party  affiliation.""    The Cuban foreign minister has therefore openly paraded his  lack of familiarity with current democratic thinking, according  to which his remarks sound, if nothing else, surprising.    Indeed, his mere admission that the U.S. trade boycott is  used as the underlying reason for the Cuban regime's systematic  refusal to open the gates of freedom of expression in Cuba  constitutes the clearest acknowledgment of the essentially  arbitrary nature of the Cuban dictatorial regime.    Havana has cunningly devised a well-orchestrated attempt to  present the U.S. boycott as a ""blockade,"" an ""embargo,"" or a  kind of ""sanitary cordon"" that is virtually driving Cuba to  famine. It should be clearly asserted that this is not the  case. The United States has imposed a trade boycott on Cuba,  thus severing all U.S. trade relations with this island. In the  eyes of any stalwart supporter of Castro's regime, this ought to  be simply a welcome gesture of consistency on the part of the  United States. Not in vain has Castroism been preaching to the  hemisphere, for nearly 40 years, about the most drastic rupture  possible with the United States.    What is still more serious, however, is the attempt by Fidel  Castro and his followers to construe this international  political reality as the cause for their adamant refusal to  allow Cubans to have access to democracy. This means, in the  strictest sense of the word, that Cuban citizens are truly  hostages to the communist regime.    Within this context, Minister Robaina's utterances  concerning  the campaign denouncing human rights violations -- which can  ""only cling to"" (sic) the systematic contempt for political  freedom, including freedom of association -- are even more  revealing.    It is obvious that the Cuban diplomat brushes aside this  area  of public liberty as insignificant, and we have reason to  believe that the regime he represents shares his views. In  fact, it would be very interesting to listen to the commentaries  of such a eulogist of Castroism, for whom the name of General  Pinochet in Chile is, for example, anathema. He ought to  explain right now, and clearly, what makes this repression  desirable in Havana and yet revolting in other parts of the  Americas.    This explanation will surely not be forthcoming for a long  time, because even though Castroist leaders and their sidekicks  are not familiar with democratic values, they really know the  dark side of the system they represent. Otherwise, Minister  Robaina's efforts in Montevideo to express his wish to see a  reality in Cuba which ""in the not too distant future would  involve living together under a multiparty system in that  country"" would become incomprehensible. These remarks are  particularly auspicious in that they were uttered by a  government official who until very recently labelled multiparty  systems as ""multi-rubbish.""    Despite the praiseworthy attempts by the young Cuban foreign  minister to present his country's political regime in the light  of the promised economic changes -- or at least to concede the  clearly critical situation in Cuba -- his remarks are neither  convincing nor timely at a point when the island is facing a  shodown on its path toward freedom.    For all the persuasuve attempts to disguise its actual  makeup, the Cuban dictatorship is a reality that has outlived  its useful life and is doomed to end up in the dusty attic where  the sad ideology that once inspired it is already languishing.

He will conclude his term in August, after almost five  years as head of the Colombian Government. This man has carried  out social security plans, enforced efficient strategies in the  struggle against the drug cartels, and sponsored an active  foreign policy that put the country in a leading position at the  continental level. Colombia comprises -- along with Venezuela  and Mexico -- the active Group of Three.    Gaviria's role undoubtedly resulted in his appointment as  OAS  secretary general, replacing Joao Baena Soares at the end of his  term. Colombian citizens breathed easier with Gaviria because  he virtually dismantled the dangerous Medellin Cartel and  carried out other actions to improve public safety. His  government also adopted important decisions in the foreign  policy sector, including the decision to restore diplomatic  relations with Cuba in October 1993.    Bilateral relations have increased since then. Four  Colombian ministers have travelled to the island and a similar  number of Cuban officials have visited Santa Fe de Bogota in  less than eight months. The exchange in the trade and technical  sectors and the search for investments in Havana have played a  prominent role. Innumerable Colombian foreign trade delegations  and businessmen have visited socialist Cuba. The two countries  have participated in scientific and technological projects and  carried out important negotiations in the pharmaceutical and  metalworks industries and in the agricultural and perishable  consumer goods sectors.    Colombia received Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on  12 December, meeting President Gaviria, Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin, and numerous businessmen during his three-day official  visit. He also established the groundwork for creating a  binational commission. Carlos Lage, Council of Ministers vice  president, and Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez arrived in  Santa Fe de Bogota after that first official Cuban visit to  Colombia. Colombian Health Minister Juan Carlos Londono and  Energy and Mines Minister Guido Nule also visited Havana.    An unpleasant incident occurred in the interim: A newspaper  in Santa Fe de Bogota tried to present Cuba as a sponsor of a  guerrilla summit in Havana. The anti-Cuban campaign coincided  with the announcement that Colombia would sell Cuba  15,000-20,000 barrels of oil. The incident was finally cleared  up, the newspaper apologized to Cuba, the case was closed, and  the rhythm of relations resumed.    Ernesto Melendez, minister for foreign relations and  economic  cooperation, arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota, while the Colombian  agriculture minister arrived in Havana. Foreign Minister Noemi  Sanin also visited the Cuban capital, meeting President Fidel  Castro and other high-ranking leaders.    Incidentally, Fidel Castro's upcoming visit to Cartagena de  Indias to attend the fourth Ibero-American summit will be the  second time that Castro has visited Colombia as head of state,  the first being in August 1993 after he attended President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's inauguration in Bolivia.

Cuban and South African Foreign Ministers Roberto Robaina  and  Alfred Nzo formalized a protocol that establishes a new stage in  relations between Pretoria and Havana today. The two governments  had no diplomatic relations to date because of our government  and people's rejection of the now-dismantled racist system of  apartheid.    Less than 48 hours after becoming president, Nelson Mandela,  leader of the African National Congress [ANC], raised the  relations of friendship and solidarity that have existed for  years between Cuba and the formerly proscribed ANC to the  government level.    During his visit to Pretoria, Castro said there have been  moments of strong confrontations in past bilateral relations  between Cuba and South Africa. Castro recalled Cuba's  internationalist position against the policy of apartheid  against the majority black populations of South Africa, Namibia,  and Angola -- a policy now overcome -- adding that there is now  a new South Africa, where there is peace, respect, and affection  toward Cuba.    Today, Fidel Castro, heading the Cuban delegation, will  conclude his first official and friendly visit to South Africa,  a visit that began on 9 May to attend the inauguration of Nelson  Mandela, the first black president of a country that has left  behind more than three centuries of racial discrimination now.

Isabel Allende,  acting foreign minister of Cuba, says there has been no progress  in relations, even during President Clinton's era. Allende is  critical of the United States for politicizing Cuban  immigration, saying that Cuba has launched a program seeking to  expand Cuba's foreign political relations. Antti Halinen met  the acting Cuban foreign minister in Havana.    [Halinen] No progress can be seen in the relations between  the United States and Cuba, says acting Foreign Minister Isabel  Allende very curtly. We waited to see what the Clinton  administration would do, but reality remains precisely the same,  only the political form is slightly softer, Allende says. She  refers to Clinton's recent meeting with some Cubans of Miami at  which the president promised to continue the trade and economic  embargo against Cuba. Progress has not been made in other  sectors either, even though Cuba has announced that it is  prepared to normalize its relations with the United States. But  if one wants to normalize relations, one cannot, of course,  maintain a trade embargo, Allende points out.    Allende accuses the United States of manipulating and  politicizing Cuba's emigrant and refugee affairs, which has not  happened to any other Latin American country. On the basis of  the treaty of 1984, the United States could grant as many as  20,000 visas to Cubans a year. According to Allende, just over  1,000 Cubans were granted a visa last year. Allende says the  United States is using the matter to its political advantage.  Visa applications are rejected, but at the same time the  country receives all those who have left Cuba illegally. The  Haitians' boats are turned back, but Cuban ferry people are  granted a residence permit immediately. In Allende's view, much  is spoken and written about these Cubans in Europe too, unlike  for instance the Mexicans, the so-called wet backs, who seek to  enter the United States illegally. The name wet back comes from  the fact that when crossing the border river, the Mexicans get  wet.    According to acting Foreign Minister Allende, the Cuban  Government is prepared to improve relations between Cubans, but  it presupposes one thing from its interlocutors: Opposition to  the U.S. anti-Cuban policy and recognition of Cuba's  sovereignty. At a recent meeting in Havana, some tangible  results were achieved but it is still difficult to get close,  Allende admits.    She cites an example. A Cuban lawyer, who attended the  meeting, a U.S. citizen and member of the Democratic Party, at  the final meeting thanked Fidel Castro for the conference and  kissed him on the cheek. Back home in Miami, abuse and murder  threats awaited the lawyer and her children, and the lawyer's  car was smashed to pieces.    [Announcer] The acting Cuban Foreign Minister Isabel Allende  is not the famous Chilean writer, nor is she the daughter of the  former president of Chile, with whom she is often confused on  account of her name.

Cuban diplomatic sources denied Canada had expelled Adolfo  Martin and Orlando Brito, two officials of the Cuban Consulate  in Montreal, as Cuban dissidents Pedro Martori and Antonio Tang  reported in Montreal. Martori and Tang, who represent  Miami-based radical dissident groups told the Canadian media  that Canada had expelled Consul Martin and Vice Consul Brito.

Political sources told NOTIMEX the report on the expulsion  ""is related to the expansion of economic relations between  Canada and Cuba,"" and, in particular, to the investments  Canadian mining and hotel companies and other sectors are making  in the Caribbean island.    Cuban solidarity groups stated the Cuban exiles in Canada,  linked to radical groups in the United States, are ""upset"" over  the Havana initiative of beginning this month a dialogue with  sectors of the Cuban exile community. ""Alpha 66"" -- a  Miami-based dissident group -- ""continues to issue communiques,  stating it will attack Canadian tourists who go to Cuba. It is  a sign of their powerlessness regarding the dialogue"" between  Havana and the Miami community, a Cuban source affirmed.    Canadian Government circles, which supported the idea of a  dialogue between Havana and the exiled community, admit Cuban  opposition groups are ""very resentful"" of the good relations  that exist between Canadian businesses and Cuba. The expulsion  story was a recent reaction by radical Cuban exiles aimed at  adversely affecting business contacts between Cuba and Canada.    In April 1993, Tang and Florencio Aspillaga Lombard --  another Cuban exile living in Miami -- told DIARIO LAS AMERICAS  of Miami that Ottawa had suspended the firm Rapitel  Communications S.I.'s permission to operate in Cuba. The  statement made by Tang and Aspillaga Lombard about this company,  which sells telephone communications service with Cuba, also  turned out to be false. Canadian analysts said the report was  aimed at eliminating telephone service between Canada and Cuba,  which serves as a bridge for numerous Cubans living in the  United States.    According to the sources that were consulted, another reason  for the ""charge"" made by Martori and Tang was a result of the  support given in Canada to the ""Cuban friendship caravan,"" an  initiative to send humanitarian aid to the island. The caravan  left various Canadian cities on 20 February destined for Mexico  from where caravan members will sail to Cuba. The caravan will  pass through various U.S. cities and will join the efforts made  by the ""Pastors for Peace,"" who for the third consecutive year  will send humanitarian aid to Cuba and will confront the  economic blockade imposed on Cuba by Washington three decades  ago.

0,FT943-5841 ,"FT943-5841 _AN-EIECYAGIFT 940901   FT  01 SEP 94 / Castro may go to war, says report      By REUTER      WASHINGTON   President Fidel Castro may opt for war with the US if he is backed into a corner, said a study prepared for the Pentagon and released yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The study by Rand, a California research organisation, was completed last spring and anticipated the anti-government demonstrations and refugee exodus of recent weeks. It said Mr Castro was unlikely to accept a forced resignation because it would tarnish his place in history. 'Castro is not likely to give up power voluntarily; and if cornered he might fight to the death,' said the report, paid for by the office of Mr William Perry, defence secretary. 'With his regime at the point of unravelling, Castro might try to engineer a final military reckoning with the US in a Gotterdammerung-type scenario that could leave Cuba destroyed but would confirm his legacy as Latin America's staunchest anti-imperialist,' it said. Such an outcome, the study insisted, 'conforms not only to the value that Castro places on struggle, intransigence, and defiance, but also the way he and past Cuban leaders have exalted the acts of death and martyrdom on behalf of the nation.' The Cuban leader might seek a clash over the Florida Straits, which separate Florida and Cuba by 90 miles, or over Guantanamo Bay, the US naval base on Cuba's southeast shore. His grip on power remained firm, with the Communist party apparatus, military and security organs 'largely in the hands of hardline officers', the report said. Clinton administration officials have said they are not committed to ousting Mr Castro. Instead, they have tightened a 31-year-old US trade embargo against Cuba to force him towards meaningful economic and political reforms. The Rand report concluded that such reforms were highly unlikely while Mr Castro remained in power.   Countries:-  CUZ  Cuba, Caribbean.     USZ  United States of America.

Ya. Lemeshev, chairman of the  Environmental Committee of the State Duma of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly, by V. Mikhaylov; place and date not  given: ""Health of the People Is of Paramount Importance""]    [Text]    Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, first of all I  would like to congratulate you with assumption of your new post  and your selection as chairman of the State Duma Environmental  Committee. Even though many currently believe that environmental  issues are not of the greatest importance in today's life, that  there certainly are more important matters. Do you agree with  that?    Lemeshev: I am firmly convinced that revival of  Russia and of the Russian people, which is talked about by one  and all today, is impossible without resolution of ecological  problems. This is determined by the fact that in itself the  ecological situation in the country is simply catastrophic,  which is understood by all and which requires no explanation.  Today, in fact, we are talking about survival. Look at the  demographic aspect. There exists an absolutely despondent  situation--in essence ethnic Russians are dying out. Scientific  research conducted by authoritative scientists, including  American and Japanese scientists, indicates that now 40 percent  of the children are born already sick. What will happen to them  in adult life? Two-thirds of all the diseases today are  associated with the unfavorable state of the environment. In  Russia this is more pronounced than in the West.    First of all pollution of the environment in cities with  populations of over one million is alarming. Water quality  there, as a rule, is poor (it is generally poor everywhere in  our country), food contains pesticides, nitrites, and various  biological additives. At the same time, what is of interest is  that this applies not so much to domestically produced goods as  to those that are imported. Advertising, propaganda, and  attractive packaging, and we are still susceptible to all of  that, do their job. Developed countries frequently sell us  whatever is not in demand at home. By the way, many of the  western countries have rigid environmental protection laws.    In my opinion we must concentrate specifically on improving  the health of our people. That is a priority task. Yes,  biodiversity, problems of protected territories--that is  important, that is good, but the most important factor is the  health of the people.    Mikhaylov: But all this requires money and, I am  assuming, quite a lot of it. Where is it coming from? At whose  expense? There is so much talk about the poverty of the state  treasury and the incredible deficit of the state budget. You, as  a member of the State Duma, must take into account the  conditions of our reality. Is all that you talk about so  convincingly realistic from the financial viewpoint?    Lemeshev: As an economist, I am quite distrubed by  the currently widespread view that since the economy is in a  state of crisis, it is impossible to deal with environmental  problems in the given period. After it improves, then we will  concern ourselves with ecology to the fullest extent. What is  most lamentable is that this, in my opinion, harmful concept is  finding a response among the people. That is understandable: the  people are barely surviving and, as it is said, never mind the  butter when survival is at stake. That is basically wrong.  Without the resolution of environmental problems we will never  improve the economy--that is my profound conviction.    Here is a vivid example. Under conditions involving  environmental pollution people become ill more seriously and  frequently which, in turn, affects the efficiency of production.  Does that affect the national economy or not? Colossal sums are  needed for treatment, purchase of medications and building of  hospitals--doesn't that place a burden on the economy? Only  totally myopic people are failing to see this.    All right, let us take the production of fabrics as an  example. Not just water but pure water is needed in order for  the fabric to be of good quality. Would it not be cheaper to  avoid polluting the water to start with rather than spend huge  amounts of money later on its purification? Understand that it  is impossible to separate economy and ecology--it is a single  metasystem. I would like to mention something else: there are no  ecological problems of one or another country and the resolution  of ecological problems is impossible within the framework of a  single country. Let us say, the Scandinavian countries have made  considerable progress in the resolution of environmental  problems, but 90 percent of the environmental pollutants come to  them from other countries.    Mikhaylov: That is only a general overview of the  task. In your opinion how and with what practical steps should  your committee start its work? Which draft laws do you believe  are of primary importance in the sphere of environmental  protection?    Lemeshev: I do not want to start complaining about  the lack of facilities right off but at present 15 deputies and  as many office workers have only two small rooms, there are no  typewriters, computers, or technical means and equipment for  accounting, planning, and analysis of operations. I do not know  how we will be able to work.    As far as legislative work of the committee is concerned I  believe that preparation of a draft law on ecological disaster  zones is a matter of overriding importance. True, it is today  possible to designate all of Russia as an ecological disaster  zone, but there are some areas that are worse off such as, for  instance, the Chernobyl disaster zone, regions with a  concentration of chemical and petrochemical production and  places where hydrocarbon raw materials are extracted in the  northern part of Russia which constitutes a severe blow to areas  inhabited by minority people. A law dealing with ecological  studies by experts, not at the agency level as it is now, but at  the federal state level, with widespread participation of the  public, is highly necessary. Only then will we be able to bar  projects which destroy nature and man himself.    Is legislation on drinking water not important, is it not  necessary to create supplements to the Criminal Code dealing  with responsibility for ecological crimes? So there is a whole  lot of work to be done.    Mikhaylov: Mikhail Yakovlevich, looking through  the list of the members of your committee I noticed its  considerable diversity: it includes members from the Russian  Choice, communists, DPR [Democratic Party of Russia] members,  and you yourself represent the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia]. Does it seem to you that such political discord can  interfere with the normal lawmaking acctivities of the  committee? Moreover it is necessary to establish constructive  relations with the Russian Federation Ministry of Environmental  Protection and Natural Resources.    Lemeshev: As far as the latter is concerned I feel  rather optimistically inasmuch as the minister himself, Viktor  Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan, is a member of our committee and, at  least for the present, we have a mutual understanding with  respect to all of the issues. Even though I am familiar by  hearsay with an impartial polemic between Danilov-Danilyan and  Aleksey Vladimirovich Yablokov, chairman of the Russian  Federation Interagency Commission on Environmental Safety, which  developed on the pages of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, I feel  uncomfortable when disputes develop between such highly  respected people. It is simply the scourge of our Russian  intelligentsia. We must reject agency, political, and  professional ambitions where the common good is concerned. We  must alter our psychology. I view the work of our committee with  hope because I feel convinced that the task concerning  preservation of the environment is capable of unifying people  with highly divergent political views.

The decision was simultaneously announced in the Canadian  capital by Foreign Minister Andre Ouellet and in Havana by  Christine Stewart, minister of state for Latin America and  Africa, who today concludes a two-day visit to the island.    While Stewart was meeting a full agenda of interviews with  ranking Cuban Government officials, in Ottawa, Foreign Minister  Ouellet announced the resumption of official economic aid to the  Caribbean island.    ""The Cold War is over. The time has come to turn a new page""  in relations with Cuba, Ouellet said in reference to the  resumption of aid, which was suspended in 1978 when Cuba  provided military aid to Angola in response to South Africa's  aggression.    Despite that decision, ties between the two states continued  to develop, and they were expanded in 1989 when the two  countries decided to undertake a political dialogue with an  exchange of official visits.    According to the announcement, Canada will grant Cuba  $360,000 to feed the children this year and $720,000 in 1995.    Last night, Stewart inaugurated an international  businessmen's conference on business opportunities in Cuba. The  conference, which was sponsored by the magazine THE ECONOMIST,  was attended by more than 120 executives from Canadian, British,  U.S., European, and Latin American firms.    Earlier, Stewart had discussed the development of bilateral  relations, particularly economic relations, with Cuban Vice  President Carlos Lage and other ranking officials, including  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina; National Assembly President  Ricardo Alarcon; Ernesto Melendez, minister president of the  State Committee for Economic Cooperation; and Jose Luis  Rodriguez, minister president of the State Committee for  Finance. A source from the Canadian delegation also confirmed  to PRENSA LATINA that the minister of state also held a special  meeting with President Fidel Castro.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Eduardo del Rey, spokesman  for the Canadian Foreign Ministry and a member of Stewart's  entourage, stressed: ""This is an important moment in the  relationship between Cuba and Canada,"" which is based on  ""frequent and honest dialogue."" Rey added that the goal of  Stewart's visit is to broaden those ties and promote Canadian  investments.    At the inauguration of the businessmen's conference, Stewart  said her government supports increased investments in Cuba, not  only because it will contribute to Cuba's development, but also  because Canada will benefit.    Stewart expressed the Canadian authorities' resolve to  encourage an even greater flow of capital to the island, where  Canada currently carries considerable weight in foreign  investments in the mining sector. Canada does not only exploit  traditional nickel deposits, but it also has recently been  involved in prospecting for gold, lead, and copper, as well as  exploring for oil deposits. Furthermore, Canada is the leading  source of tourists to the island, where every year more than  120,000 Canadians enjoy their vacations.     "
0,FT923-7462 ,"FT923-7462 _AN-CHTAOAB3FT 920818   FT  18 AUG 92 / Business Law: Need to rethink Russian reform      By WILLIAM LEE   One year after the failed Moscow coup, western attitudes towards reform in Russia under President Boris Yeltsin are changing. At first, emphasis was placed on 'shock' economic reforms advocated by the International Monetary Fund and on the efficiency of Korean, Taiwanese and German economic reform models, as if these models were relevant. The need for massive western aid was justified by suggesting that the fate of democracy in Russia (and other former Communist bloc countries) would ultimately be determined on the economic front. The advocates of the IMF approach - rapid introduction of mass privatisation and liberalisation of the entire economy - believed that it was necessary to push through unpopular economic measures. The Russian dissenters - parliamentarians and the old-line Soviet industrial elite - said that the IMF's prescriptions were too simplistic. They pointed out that it took centuries to develop the western capitalist economies. And their research showed that there were strong non-market elements such as subsidies and protectionist tariff barriers involved in growth in Korea and Taiwan, for example. They also argued that successful western (and Asian) economies are mixed and pluralistic. There are large public sectors, unions, pressure groups and so on that do not yet exist in Russia. The elite's criticisms were, to a large extent, valid, and since spring this year they have succeeded in slowing down the reforms pressed on President Yeltsin by the IMF. Convertibility of the rouble has been deferred; the industrial elite has returned to positions of ministerial power and to the Russian central bank; energy price liberalisation has been postponed; and new credits have been approved for Russian industry - increasing the budget deficit and aggravating inflationary pressures. There is even talk in Moscow of a change of government before the end of September. The Group of Seven leading industrial nations and the IMF are now reconsidering their approach to Russia. Their reported consideration of increased direct financial aid from western governments fails to take into account the emerging view that the success of economic reform in Russia (and elsewhere in eastern Europe) may depend on constitutional and political reform. Many Russians have concluded that Russia's economic reforms (and those of the other CIS republics) cannot succeed without strong government. This means strong governments in each of the republics and, more importantly, a strong co-ordinating central government in Moscow. Former President Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to put together an almost US-style federalism was correct. Perestroika - intended to strengthen Soviet central authority through elimination of inefficient Communist party political control and the introduction of local autonomy - was and is the only right answer to the realities of the ex-Soviet Union. Recent efforts to prepare the Soviet auto industry for privatisation support a federal approach. There are tens of car and truck plants spread across a number of republics and organised in a mutually dependent system. A car or truck cannot be assembled in Moscow without parts from other plants. Privatisation is impossible as long as plant managers do not work together. Furthermore, the auto industry is simply too big to be privatised right away. Yet, there is a great deal of modern equipment, a large and expanding internal market and good prospects for increased exports. In the auto industry - as in others - central governmental assistance to maintain the output of the principal plants, credit to permit acquisition of important spare parts and transitional tariff protection are necessary. This needs to be co-ordinated from the centre. Russia cannot move forwards on the basis of economic guidance alone. Yet, until now, the G7 nations have turned over the whole of the Russian problem to the IMF. This has been a mistake. The IMF has no answer to the present situation in Russia. The G7 countries need to provide another kind of advice - to move towards a form of 'political conditionality' in the Russian situation. This would mean encouraging strong government as a prerequisite to financial and other assistance. The west should not operate competing embassies and offices in each of the republics of the CIS - accepting as a fait accompli the complete collapse of the Soviet Union as a political entity. On the contrary it should be pressing Russia and the other republics to study and adapt relevant political models - ranging from the Swiss cantonal system through the Canadian and EC confederations to the US federal model. Without something like the US constitution's commerce clause - establishing federal supremacy in matters involving interstate commercial relations - the ex-Soviet Union's economy will suffer badly. It is a single economy and must be treated as such by the political system. If a 'commerce clause' approach is not adopted, economic chaos, civil war and eventual intervention by the military may be the result. Therefore, at this stage in Russia's transition from communism, political and constitutional reform should receive a higher priority than it has to date. What are the implications of all this for the west? First, the impulse to react by seeking to increase direct economic aid should be resisted by the G7. The problem in Russia (and elsewhere in eastern Europe) is not money. Investments and foreign assistance would largely be wasted under current conditions. Moreover, there is a danger that the present Russian government is placing too much confidence in foreign economic counsel. If the results are a failure - as is likely without necessary constitutional and political change  -Russia will be disillusioned and bitter. Already Russian leaders such as Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi have expressed a desire to go it alone. Western governments need to listen to these voices. Second, as President Yeltsin enters a period of maximum danger - not unlike that which preceded Mr Gorbachev's downfall - the G7 leadership should not be reluctant to support the creation of a strong federal government in Moscow, even at the risk of further deviation from the IMF's usual nostrums. The west should begin to give advice on possible legal and constitutional reforms before it is too late. Such advice should not be given through the IMF. A new forum needs to be created. The G7 should encourage the Russians themselves to recruit a small multinational group of pragmatic political advisers to work with the Russian presidency, the Russian Supreme Soviet and the leadership of other ex-Soviet republics to bring forward new possibilities for creation of a federal constitutional and legal system in the former Soviet Union.

The three legislators absent were Broad Front (leftist  coalition) Deputy Francisco Rodriguez Camusso; committee  chairman Oscar Magurno of the Colorado Party of former president  and new presidential candidate Julio Maria Sanguinetti; and  Colorado Party Deputy Daniel Garcia Pintos.    Among the deputies who attended the meeting, Hector Lezcano,  of the Christian Democratic Party, said he told Robaina that the  Cuban Government should ""embark on a democratic opening program  leading, in the near future, to the establishment of a  multiparty system in the country.""    Committee member and Colorado Party Deputy Guillermo  Stirling  said he attended the meeting because ""talking is the best way to  show leftist and right-wing radicals which is the best path.""    Robaina answered that Cuba respects human rights, does not  have political prisoners, and the government is willing to  preserve the essential characteristics of what was achieved  during the 34-year period that started on the date of the  revolution.    Robaina admitted that the economic inefficiencies of the  Cuban system have forced them to open their market to foreign  investments, adding that economic changes on the island  ""continue day by day,"" and that today 100 companies already have  investments in Cuba.    It was known that President Lacalle asked Robaina today  about  the debt of $33 million the Cuban Government has owed to  Uruguayan entrepreneurs since 1986.    The Cuban foreign minister said that his country does not  have the cash to pay back that debt, adding that Cuba could  cancel the debt with pharmaceutical and sanitary products.    Robaina will be received today by his Uruguayan counterpart  Sergio Abreu. The Uruguayan foreign minister has also publicly  mentioned that he intends to remind Robaina about the need to  repay the debt.    Robaina will stay in Montevideo until tomorrow, and will  then  visit Ecuador, Peru, Paraguay, and Argentina within the  framework of his government's ""Latin American offensive."" This  initiative seeks to obtain regional countries' support against  the U.S. ""blockade"" and private investments in the island.    The Cuban foreign minister's youth and dynamism has prompted  various communication centers to consider him as ""President  Fidel Castro's probable successor.""     "

A Cuban  delegation led by Carlos Lage -- the regime's number three --  has been in Madrid since Monday [28 March] in order, according  to Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, to discuss ""the measures  which will serve to transform that system, liberalize the  economy, and surmount the crisis situation.""    State Finance Committee Chairman Lage is accompanied by  State  Council Vice President Jose Luis Rodriguez. Their main  interlocutor in Madrid has been former Economy Minister Carlos  Solchaga, who is supervising a team of experts comprising Bank  of Spain officials and Argentaria executives, who are advising  Cuba.    The two Cuban officials also met Tuesday with Gonzalez and  with Economy Minister Pedro Solbes. Yesterday, they met in turn  with Foreign Minister Javier Solana and with European Commission  Vice President Manuel Marin, and, before returning to Havana,  they have a meeting arranged today with Trade Minister Javier  Gomez Navarro.    At a joint press conference with Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev, Gonzalez did not analyze in detail the differences  between the Cubans and their advisers on the path which the  regime should take. However, he explained that the Spanish side  ""insists that the measures should be internally consistent.""  ""They should not be disconnected from each other in such a way  that the system is inconsistent."" One of the Cubans'  interlocutors specified that Lage, who is in effect Fidel  Castro's prime minister, has not set himself overall economic  aims steps to be taken accordingly, in accordance with a  detailed timetable [sentence as published]. ""They are tending to  undertake uncoordinated initiatives in order to alleviate the  situation,"" the same source added.    The new measures submitted by Lage to his hosts include, for  instance, the introduction of taxation in a country devoid of  taxes, and a greater opening up of the island to the outside  world by facilitating air and telephone communications.  According to Gonzalez, ""greater freedom of movement outward and  into the island itself"" will be granted. He also wishes to  encourage the setting up of small- and medium-sized enterprises.  Some initial liberalizing measures were put into practice last  summer. The liberalization process is being conducted very  slowly. ""On the Cuban side, they are trying to do this with the  least social cost,"" Gonzalez explained. ""They are concerned  about the rate of the reform,"" he added.    The [Spanish] prime minister expressed once more yesterday  his desire for the economic reform to bring about political  change eventually. ""A free economy calls for a society with a  greater degree of freedom,"" he emphasized, although he  acknowledged that there are exceptions such as Franco's Spain  and, more recently, General Pinochet's Chile.    Nevertheless, he highlighted ""signs of interest"" on the part  of the Cuban regime, such as the meeting which Robaina will hold  in April with part of the moderate opposition. However, Lage  did not announce any political change to his interlocutors.    For his part, Solana offered his services to the Cuban  number  three in order to inform U.S Secretary of State Warren  Christopher of the economic changes which Cuba intends to set  under way.     "

During practically all of 1993 the rate of the growth of  cash  substantially exceeded the rate of growth of the money supply as  a whole. According to data from the Central Bank of Russia, the  amount of cash in circulation (the monetary aggregate MO)  increased 7.9 times (from 1.7 to 13.3 trillion rubles) during  the past year whereas the money supply as a whole (the aggregate  M2) grew only 5.1 times (from R7.1 to R36.7 trillion).    The indicated inequality in growth rates has led to a  substantial increase in the share of cash in the money supply  (see graphic)--from 23.5 percent as of 1 January 1993 to 36.2  percent as of 1 January 1994.         FIGURE      ""All other things being equal,"" the growth of the share of  cash is evidence by itself of an increase in the shortage of  money and of the increasing severity of financial policy, since  cash, which primarily services the needs of the population, is  the most difficult to contract and the least elastic aggregate  of the money supply.    Moreover, the growth of the share of cash in the money  supply  almost always means its involvement in the servicing of  production turnover. This takes place, as a rule, again in  periods of increasing severity of financial policy as a result  of the squeezing out of working capital from non-cash turnover  into cash turnover.    The growth of the share of cash in the money supply also is  evidence of the reduction of the possibility of the state to  influence actually occuring economic processes. The increasing  severity of the state's financial policy thus leads to the  accelerated liberalization of the economy from under state  control (in the absolute majority of cases being replaced, as we  can see, by criminal control).    The following comparison is important for evaluating the  scale of the degree of involvement of cash in the servicing of  production turnover: the Central Bank claims that R13.3 trillion  in cash was in circulation in the territory of Russia as of 1  January 1994. Practically simultaneously with this the State  Committee for Statistics reports that only a total of R7.8  trillion (not counting the money in commercial organizations)  was in the hands of the population on the indicated date.    The difference--R5.5 trillion (41 percent of all  cash)--represents the working capital of juridical bodies and  constitutes almost two-thirds of the funds in the current  accounts of enterprises and organizations (R8.5 trillion as of 1  January 1994). We can be certain that only an insignificant  portion of this money is being legally used as working  capital--if only because nobody has abolished the enforceable  enactments published in the 1992 ""cash crisis"" period and  significantly restricting the legal use of cash as working  capital.    Today's economic practice is evidence of the fact that the  use of cash as working capital practically eliminates state  control over the operations being carried out. Taking this into  account the data derived indicate that 39.3 percent of the  entire turnover of the economy of Russia is in essence not under  the control of the state. One can easily disregard the  uncertainty arising due to the presence of funds intended for  wages in the cashier's offices of enterprises in the first place  because, as of 1 January, all that one can pay the workers, as a  rule, already has been paid and, secondly, because the magnitude  cited can be considered only as the lower limit of the share of  the turnover not under the control of the state. These are two  reasons for this.    The calculations derived take into account only the ruble  component of working capital whereas a significant portion of  many of the most dynamically developing markets, for example  motor vehicles and housing, are being serviced only by foreign  currency.    The most efficient directions of economic activity, where  money turns over more rapidly and, consequently, succeeds in  servicing a greater volume of operations than on the average for  the national economy, are escaping from under the control of the  state first of all.    The fact that as of 1 January 1993 the lower limit of the  sector of the economy not under the control of the state,  calculated on the basis of an analogous method, was at the level  of 20 percent of the turnover merits attention. Consequently,  the relative share and, correspondingly, the significance of the  ""shadow"" Russian economy has at least doubled during the past  year.     "

Today's address is an  extraordinary event in my life and in my political career. It  is the first time that the new Russian parliament is to hear the  president's address.    Russia begins to chart its policy in a new way. Writing this  address was not an easy task. The difficulty was because I  wanted to put too many things into it. We need to accomplish  still more. Therefore, it is important not to dissipate our  efforts and concentrate everything--our resources, political  will, intellectual potential, and the people's enormous desire  to live better--on the key areas in order to achieve the results  together.    This is why not only the present situation but also the  ideas  for the future proposed by you--including those put forward  during the election campaign--are reflected in this address.    Regrettably, in 1993 a lot of energy was expended on tough  political confrontation. Extreme measures could not be avoided,  either. But we prevented civil war. People could see for  themselves that there would be no winners in an irreconcilable  struggle. It can have only one result--the destruction of  Russia. The time of internecine strife has expired completely  for Russia.    There were successes and profound disappointments on the  path  of reforms. But if you ask me today if I would start these  difficult changes again, the answer will be unequivocally yes.  Both then and now I am convinced that there was no other path.  In January 1992 we were forced to start something we could not  avoid.    We are gradually learning lessons during every month of our  lives. It is impossible to transform a country like Russia in  one attempt. What is needed is a flexible, long-term,  anticipatory policy that takes into account Russia's  peculiarities, the national character, and changes in the public  interests and moods--the mentality of the people of  Russia--which for decades was being molded in a different  direction.    In the last few months we have come to understand better one  important truth: In order to achieve success, we need to bring  into play tremendous and so far almost unused reserves--the  reserves of cooperation in constructive work. This is an  indisputable requirement for all of us, for those who have  entered parliament, for those who are prepared to share the  responsibility for Russia's destiny.    Let us be realistic and let us acknowledge that a part of  the  opposition still wants to take revenge by force. On both sides  there are those blinded by the need to take revenge on their  ideological opponents. However, hatred and the thirst for  vengeance can only worsen Russia's serious illness.    I want to say another thing: Social accord is not  forgiveness for all. Compassion is compassion only when it does  not contravene the law and moral standards. There is a  foundation for accord in Russia today: the  Constitution--adopted by a popular vote. Let us ask ourselves:  Is there another, more solid foundation? There is not.    No one party, no one movement, no one group of  intellectuals,  no one politician or statesman has the same degree of support  today as the Constitution. It won the votes of people of the  most varied convictions and outlooks. Having lost faith in many  things, they nonetheless went to the polling stations and gave  to the state a law that is binding, above all, on those who are  in power.    Our country is experiencing today one of the most complex  moments of its history; however, Russia did not begin with Peter  the Great or the October Revolution of 1917. It does not end  with the collapse of the communist superpower. The empire that  not long ago intimidated all of mankind while suppressing real  life for the Russian people and all of its other peoples is no  more.    The Russian state, however, has still not taken a worthy  place in the world community. We no longer have the state that  acted as a strict supervisor and ruthless judge toward its  subjects. We should also acknowledge, however, that there is  still the absence of a fully democratic and lawful state in  Russia.    Most people are constantly worried about what tomorrow will  bring, about the future of their children and their elderly  parents. But the authorities, both in the center and in the  regions, seem not to notice the rapid stratification of society.  One has to act responsibly and acknowledge that we are  underestimating all the dangers this stratification brings.    I am not calling for a return to universal egalitarianism in  poverty, to the notorious dispossession of the kulaks. But in  this matter, in this extremely fine matter so painful for  society, one should not allow the process to be totally  spontaneous and uncontrolled.    We are painfully learning that a bureaucratic and  self-devouring economy, in which 10 people are doing what one  person can normally do, has no future. But so far we do not  have a normal market economy either. It is those who cheat and  use violence who are at ease. The honest, enterprising people  who are not afraid of working and taking risks find it extremely  difficult today to start their own business and grow.    All these are today's realities, however hard it is to admit  it. True, our country has greater freedom, but this is not  enough. Our task is to ensure that Russia has greater justice,  security, and confidence in today and tomorrow. We have already  seen that it is impossible to build Russia properly at the will  of some manager, party, or individual. The time has come for a  new political style of trust and constructive cooperation,  mutual understanding, and agreed action. The time has come for  a nationwide action that can unite efforts of all of us. We  have such an action. It is the strengthening of statehood, the  strengthening of the Russian state. Let's acknowledge at last:  As long as we have a weak state, there is no basic law and  order in the country. All residents of the country and all  peoples of Russia are interested in a stable and strong state  because all of us, irrespective of our nationality or place of  residence, need civil peace and not interethnic conflicts. All  parties and political movements and all factions of the State  Duma should be interested in strengthening the state. It is  only in a sound and strong state that they can count on an  honest implementation of the interests of their supporters.    Our closest neighbors have a vested interest in the Russian  state being stable and strong, for it is precisely a strong  Russia that is the most reliable and realistic guarantor of  stability for the whole territory of the former USSR.    The world community also needs a strong Russia; otherwise,  it  will be a permanent source of threat to security and to mankind.  A strong and vigorous state is a most important condition for  the continuation of transformations in our country. A healthy  and civilized market will not gain a firm foothold without such  a state; nor will democracy reveal its true worth or the great  Russian culture and morality be reborn. The strengthening of  our state is an indisputable goal that can and should unite all  Russian people in this dramatic period the country is going  through.    The strengthening of the state is a task for us all. It will  make it possible for the president, the Federal Assembly, the  government, and the constituent parts of the Federation to all  channel their energy for the good of Russia.    We began this work many times over the past few years;  however, until now it had no legal basis to underpin it and was  carried out in a chaotic and inconsistent manner. The state, in  its current configuration, fails to cope with its most important  functions. This pertains, above all, to safeguarding order and  the rights and safety of citizens.    The country is being engulfed by crime. To this day, the  existing state structures are permeated by a spirit of  irresponsibility and arbitrariness. Life in our country is  still bound up in innumerable petty restrictions and  limitations. The work of both central and local authorities  suffers from much confusion and incompetence. The army of  bureaucrats is rapidly growing. In a situation of heightened  financial tension, the federal authorities, with amazing ease,  are spending vast sums of money on themselves. This growing  appetite is doing more to undermine the state's reputation than  any mistakes or miscalculations. This is not to mention the  taxpayers' pocket: It is their money that supports all of us.    All this testifies to the fact that a new alienation between  the authorities and the everyday needs of the people is  appearing and has appeared. If bureaucracy previously stood  between them and the nomenkatura caste, then today money must be  included as well.    It is precisely the disgrace of corruption that is  increasingly often the gulf preventing a solution to many  issues. This is what I was speaking of: the grave illness of  Russian statehood. The task to unite us today--the president,  parliament, and government--is to stop these destructive  processes. We do not have to create anything. We have only one  effective medicine and that is to strengthen the state on the  basis of the Constitution.    This will produce a result if we work together. We need a  common program of state reforms in the Russian Federation. Its  strategic aims are:    First, the state authorities should work not for themselves  but for the precisely identified and formulated interests of  Russia and its citizens. This means a shift away from the  policy of impulsive reactions toward a strategy of considered  anticipatory actions.    Second, power should be effective. This means the desire and  ability to finish off what has been started and to assess very  toughly any possible shortcomings in the decisions made.  Judicial reform occupies an important place here. A strong  third estate does not weaken but, on the contrary, strengthens  the other estates. I attach particular importance to the  Constitutional Court, which should objectively interpret the  Constitution. Local self-government needs to be developed and  provided with legislation. In this connection, perhaps there  could be joint consideration of the timing of elections.  Serious attention needs to be paid to reform in the army, to  regulating the state border regime, and much more.    Third, an end must be put to the apparatus free-for-all, in  which any sensible decision or initiative is stifled in the  death grip of the apparatus. The method is known: the clear  regulation of functions and responsibilities. Unfortunately,  this is absent thus far.    Fourth, power must become open and understandable for  people.  This means that dialogue needs to be developed, the formation of  a civic society needs to be promoted, and we should not cut  ourselves off from the mass media, but rather help them to  pursue the policy of constantly removing state control from the  press--although, there needs to be moderation here as well, of  course.    The television channel that, via the Orbita system,  preserves  the integrity of the Russian information zone and encompasses  the near abroad and European countries, should have the state as  its proprietor.    A strong state is essential, above all, to combat crime.  This is the most important issue of the year. In this respect,  our cooperation is especially necessary. The public awaits from  the Federal Assembly laws on which the state can rely to defend  their safety and tranquillity. I think that it is correct to  combine two ideas here. The first is to continue preparation of  new criminal legislation. The current legislation is hopelessly  out of date, and it is increasingly difficult for the  law-enforcement agencies to use it to oppose criminality. The  second is to adopt laws designed to resolve urgent issues of  providing the law-enforcement agencies with the essential  statutory documents.    Rapid drafting and adoption by parliament of a law on  extraordinary measures to suppress crime should be the first  move in this direction. Russians will accept such a decision  with understanding. The law-enforcement system is also ready  for its implementation. Our mutual task in this area is not to  sink into a state of affairs in which extraordinary emergency  measures are again becoming institutionalized. We should not  allow any infringement of citizens' rights. We should give  necessary powers to the law-enforcement agencies. We should  also mobilize all the state and public institutions for fighting  crime and clearly define their tasks and their responsibilities.    Tired of waiting in vain for the federal legislative acts,  authorities in a number of regions have already started  implementing similar measures themselves. By doing this, they  have succeeded not only in putting criminal situation securely  under control, but also in improving it.    We have no right to economize on ensuring a secure  environment for our people in the present day situation.  However, we should finance only the clearly-defined areas and  programs aimed at fighting crime. A number of these have  already been drawn up and adopted. Together with long-term,  wide-scale measures, it is urgently important to implement  measures to combat street violence. Organized crime needs  special attention. Today its aim is to strangle the country.  Only by joint, decisive, and consistent actions will it be  possible to protect Russia from it. Specialists have been  suggesting such actions for a long time.    One of those measures are enshrined in law is to allow  law-enforcement bodies to use the potential amassed in the last  few years to launch sustained blows on organized crime and  corruption.    For all the people of Russia, strengthening the state has an  additional profound meaning. We are talking about preserving  the country. Russia is too dear to us to even think about its  disintegration. Unity cannot be ensured by force or deceit. It  cannot be preserved by setting some peoples against others. A  path of federalism is a path toward truly strengthening Russia.  It is clearly outlined in the Constitution. This does not  mean, however, that a federation has already been built.    The delimitation of powers and property between the federal  authorities and the constituent parts of the federation is  proceeding extremely slowly. During this year, this matter must  be sorted out.    Another no less important task is to build the vertical  structure of federal power in Russia. It is in the interests of  the federation that regions are granted maximum opportunities in  governing, but the functions retained by the federal authorities  must be performed in a coordinated manner throughout the  country--be it the system of national security, in the power  engineering complex, in the communications network, in the  information network, and so on.    It is the task of the year to surmount the clear injustice  with regard to regional benefits and privileges. Standard  criteria for the extension of benefits from the federal taxes  and credits are needed as the very air we breathe -- the clearer  they are, the less abuses there will be.    Interethnic conflicts, both within the country and near its  borders, pose a real threat to the stability of the Russian  Federation. Such conflicts are the result of previous  injustices and mutual grievances. Internecine strife and the  number of such conflicts grow day by day, hour by hour -- and  the longer this goes on, the more complicated it becomes to find  a way out and to heal the new and deep wounds.    Our country is more interested than anyone else in  eliminating interethnic conflicts. For as long as Russia feels  that it is a frontline state, there will be neither peace nor  prosperity in Russia. Practice has shown that apart from  Russia, no one is ready to take upon themselves the heavy burden  of peacemaking in this area of the world. Hence, our country's  role is all the more important and responsible.    Time is inexorably moving on. It is already 50 years ago  that one of the most monstrous crimes of the Stalinist regime  was committed -- repressions against whole peoples.  Deportations added shameful pages to our country's history.    On behalf of the Russian Federation, the successor of the  former Soviet Union, as head of state, I apologize to all the  citizens of Russia and their families who suffered from the  deportations. It is our civic duty to eradicate the  consequences of those terrible events. This difficult and  delicate work should unite and not divide, us. It should bring  people together and not breed further strife.    It is our duty to make 1994 a year of undivided attention to  the problems of the people of Russian origin who are living in  neighboring states. We have at our disposal a great number of  facts that are clear proof that our compatriots are being  subjected to discrimination. It is Russia's obligation to  strive -- not in words, but in deeds -- to ensure that such  practices are stopped. If one is talking about an infringement  of the lawful rights of the Russian people, it is not the  exclusively internal affair of one country or another, but it is  our own, state, national affair. I ask -- I even demand -- of  all branches of Russian state power that they follow this  principle rigorously.    I would also like to speak about our compatriots who are  returning to Russia from the new neighboring states to their  permanent homes. For the present they are not the children but  the stepchildren of Russia. There is no let-up in the flood of  settlers and refugees, but this means that one must no longer  accept the fact that no one takes their problems seriously or  carries true state responsibility. This is an immense problem.  A special program has already been worked out, and it will be  submitted by the government for endorsement by the Federal  Assembly. But in order for it to be implemented, what is  necessary is a pooling of our efforts and a concentration of  means.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma: We have learned from our own experience that we  will not overcome the economic crisis or ensure the genuine  market order or make the economic situation predictable or  create prerequisites for the economic growth without a strong,  able state.    I know that after the December elections and changes in the  government, people both in Russia and abroad became worried  about the country's future economic course. I want to dispel  these worries. As long as I remain the president I will defend  and maintain the policy of economic transformations. In 1994 a  continuation of the economic reform will be one of the most  important directions of Russia's domestic policy.    Some important elements of market relations have already  emerged, such as economic freedom, the right to own property,  and working markets of goods and services. However, it is too  early to say that the Russian economy lives by laws of the  market. Now we have a combination of new market trends, which  are still weak, and of old command levers. The system of  administration and distribution has not disappeared without  trace: It has reshaped itself. Bureaucrats who used to deliver  plans and allocate funding have now entered the market and are  now distributing and often even trading in centralized credits,  export quotas, and licenses.    There is a continuing and strengthening trend toward  lobbying. Reform of the economic mechanism is proceeding very  unevenly.    The result is well-known; the crisis is abating slowly.  Output is continuing to fall, viable enterprises are closing  down, the country is tormented by inflation, and tension in  society is consistently high. The greatest mistake that could  be made today is to offer the public false alternatives: the  previous state-run command economy, or the so-called pure market  that is absolutely independent of the state. Both options are  ruinous for Russia and for the Russian economy.    The task is to find a sensible correlation between the speed  of reform and the realistic social price to be paid for it, to  enlist the powerful but as yet poorly used reserves within the  reforms, and to seek the optimum form of state involvement in  economic processes.    The past two years have shown that not only reform incurs a  social price. Still greater damage is being done by an economic  mechanism that is long overdue for change. It is time to  establish an effective state regulation that is compatible with  market mechanisms. This is one of the most important threads of  the current phase of the reforms.    The state should treat the state sector of the economy as an  owner, otherwise the confusion will not be overcome and the  squandering of the state sector by certain economic managers  will not be halted. The policy toward liberalization of exports  needs to be continued while, at the same time, state control  over the export of strategic raw materials and energy resources  from the country needs to be toughened.    It is vital that the government strengthen currency controls  and sanctions against offenders who are illegally concealing  currency resources abroad. Legislation needs to be changed.  Standards designed for an economy of centralized planning and  financial autonomy [khozraschet] are of no use now. Russia  needs an up-to-date and effective civil code. Its general  section has already been prepared, but I would ask the  government--which is conducting this work--to take account of  the provisions of presidential decrees, primarily those  concerning the economy. I intend to send the draft civil code,  as a whole, for examination by the Federal Assembly this year.    The year 1994 should be the year of the start of real  structural reorganization of the Russian economy. Russia should  only produce what is required by the individual, state, or world  market. The country should stop producing products nobody  needs. Of course, this is a very complex and costly task. It  cannot be solved in a short period of time, and especially, by  bans. This does not mean, however, that one should keep  avoiding it. Can it be that the government is still not  convinced that the absence of structural policy will bring about  structural degradation? It is already happening. We are  gradually losing modern technological infrastructure and most  valuable productions--first and foremost, hi-tech productions.  We are lagging behind not only world achievements, but we are  already lagging behind ourselves. The principle that says that  those will survive who can survive is ruinous. It is not those  who produce the best-quality output with the consumer in mind  who currently survive in Russia, but those who enjoy the most  perks and privileges, those who enjoy the authorities'  protection, and those capable of beating money out of the  government. If this tendency continues, the Russian economy can  and will become a market-based economy, but it will be primitive  and inefficient at the same time. It is high time the  government decide on structural priorities and act proceeding  from this.    Is there anything that prevents us from clearly defining  the membership of a group of producers which are of strategic  and great social importance to Russia, producers which are  highly competitive in the world markets? Specialists estimate  that this kind of group would not account for more than 10  percent of what is produced in Russia. It is precisely such  producers that must be given normal state support over the next  few years, while others should find this support substantially  cut within specific limits.    It is time to define what output is needed by the state and  in what volume. I have here in mind defense orders, too.  Directors of major enterprises have repeatedly put the same  request to me: to influence the government, so that the  government may let it be clearly understood to them whether or  not to produce this or that kind of output. It is just a yes or  a no. A yes means that financial obligations taken upon oneself  are fulfilled; a no means that no impediments are placed in the  way of the process of conversion.    A demonopolization of production in Russia is a most  important reserve of reforms. You cannot have normal economy  while one enterprise dictates to others its own conditions, just  because it happens to be the only one of its kind, producing its  particular line of goods. Monopolism in Russia took decades to  take shape. It was, in fact, a state policy, costing gigantic  sums and resources. Demonopolization will, likewise, require  tremendous effort and time. It must be started in real terms.    Investment policy can also be implemented during reform.  There is talk of an investment crisis and a lack of state money  to support industry, yet vast sums are being pumped into  selected sectors and enterprises. Meanwhile, as before, there  is no real investment activity. Order can be imposed only on  the basis of a clear investment policy, the role of which is  greatly magnified in conditions of crisis, inflation, and the  state's highly restricted financial possibilities.    It is high time for the government to establish a single  procedure for the granting of state support and to strictly  monitor how such support is used.    We hear endless talk about inflation being incompatible with  the process of investment. With so much talk, there is almost  no time to form the necessary institutions and structures to  develop legislation in this sphere. Little practical work is  being done to create real conditions for attracting foreign  investments. This is the criticism I hear at every meeting with  foreign businessmen, be it in America, in England, in Japan, in  China, or elsewhere.    At the same time it is obvious that as long as our own  entrepreneurs do not start to invest in Russia's economy,  foreign partners will refrain from making major investments.    The Russian state has to be consistent in defending the  interests of Russian companies in the domestic and world markets.    There are other reserves. After the completion of the  voucher stage, privatization has to be taken resolutely into a  new mode. It should attract investors, both Russian and  foreign. This year the privatization should give the economy  much more than before.    The year 1994 should become the year in which the state  gives  real support to the producers. In a system like this, any  honest enterprise or entrepreneur can only die a painful death.  It is impossible to live honestly. Nor is it possible to  collect all that is due to the state. Last year, the budget  revenue was to have been between 24 and 25 trillion rubles, but  in actual fact it amounted to 17 trillion. That's what high  taxes have achieved. The system of taxation should become  simpler, easier to understand and, most importantly, stable --  at least in the next couple of years.    In 1994, it is time to embark on drastic changes in state  support for the agricultural sector. Rather than meeting all  the demands from the sector, the main principle should be a real  reform of its economic mechanism, above all ensuring the right  of private ownership of land.    The country has been living for a long time in the  conditions  of constantly high inflation. Until the inflation is curbed,  the crisis cannot be overcome.    Any actions by the federal authorities in the area of  economic policy must undergo an inflation safety test. The  maximum allowed level of inflation must not be exceeded. This  demand will be ensured also by the constitutional powers of the  president. The economic reform is never painless. Its social  cost is significant. We should focus on poverty, on striking  inequality, and employment. They cause the greatest concern.  The president, the Federal Assembly, and the government should  constantly keep in mind hardships experienced by workers of  enterprises coming to a standstill--who may become unemployed  tomorrow--the poverty experienced by many scientists and staffs  of higher educational establishments--which makes unbearable the  lives of many young families--and also difficulties experienced  by a significant proportion of farmers.    Millions of people in our country are living below the  poverty line. It is unacceptable to adopt for implementation  state programs that cause a further decline of essential  standards of living. However, we have such programs.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma, everything I am describing is part and parcel of  tense, day-to-day work that should now be seriously addressed.  There is vast room for action here for ministers, deputies, and  staff of the apparatus--for everyone, in a word. If we really  come to grips with it, then all political discord, offenses, and  empty disagreements will be forgotten. Everyone will benefit  from this, and primarily Russia. The main thing is not to stop  and not to waste time.    In strengthening the Russian state, we should all pay  particular attention to culture, science, and education. These  are vital conditions for our country's progress. One has to  admit with bitterness that this area has become a disaster zone  today. Without strong state support, spiritual freedom turns  into the destruction of talent and into intellectual poverty.  It is time to admit that culture will not survive without the  state actively participating in its future. It is the state  that should preserve the common cultural heritage in all its  wealth and diversity, and it is the state that should provide a  specific program for the development of the multinational  Russian culture.    Yes, there is an acute shortage of funds today; however, the  state should pursue the kind of policy that would make the  spiritual sphere one that powerfully attracts financial and  material resources. In 1994, this sphere should become a zone  with most-favored status. Federal, regional, and local  authorities, and any entrepreneur should receive real incentives  to providing active backing for this. I support setting in  motion a system for capital to flow into culture, education,  science, and health care and, let me add, ecology. Not only we  will benefit from this. Above all, it will be our descendants  and the Russia of the future that will benefit.    To continue reform of Russian foreign policy is one of the  guidelines for strengthening Russia. Over the latest period, it  is not only Russia that has changed beyond recognition. The  whole world has become more complex and unpredictable.  Consistent promotion of Russia's national interests is the main  task of our foreign policy. Openness and cooperation are prime  means for achieving it. But if required to protect the state's  legitimate interests, Russia has a right to act firmly and tough  when it is really necessary. Until recently our foreign policy  lacked initiative and creative approach. Russia's prominent  peacemaking initiative in the Bosnian conflict has been an  exception, regrettably, so far. Meanwhile, the present-day  world needs a novel look at the global problems and goals of the  21st century, and Russia is capable of generating new major  original ideas.    We like to repeat that it is a great country, and this is a  fact, indeed. So let us always maintain this lofty standard in  our foreign political thinking as well. We have clear  priorities in international policy--the most important being the  prevention of a new global war, either cold or hot. It is for  this purpose precisely that we are coming out unequivocally in  favor of strengthening the regime of non-proliferation of  weapons of mass destruction and the latest military  technologies. We share this principle as one that is mandatory  for all--not only for Russia, as some people would like to  believe.    In 1994, we have to put an end to the vicious practice of  unilateral concessions. This also relates, inter alia, to the  defense budget. One should not forget the fact that defense  expenditures are something totally different from expenditure on  war.    These resources are being used to finance a major part of  our science sector, these resources are being used to build  housing for homeless officers' families, these resources are  being used to provide for our children serving in the armed  forces.    There must be order in international arms trade. The most  important condition for this is observance of Russia's  commercial interests. They have suffered considerably in recent  years.    We are for being realistic when dealing with the problems of  European security and we are for the Partnership for Peace, open  to all states of great Europe without any exceptions.    However, while respecting the sovereign rights of states and  organizations, Russia is against the expansion of NATO through  some or other countries of the European continent without Russia  itself. This is a path toward new threats to Europe and the  world. Russia is not a guest in Europe, but an equal  participant in the community of Europe, interested in its  prosperity -- and it is this premise that we will proceed from.    We are for developing partnership with both West and East.  But for us, partnership is not an exchange of niceties during  negotiations but real cooperation and interaction, in all  spheres from high politics to friendly social contact between  people of different countries, in all spheres at state and  national level, at the level of enterprises, companies,  organizations, and individual citizens. The obstacles to such  wide-ranging partnership should be removed as soon as possible.    Russia did not take part in the race to be the first to  leave  the USSR and to become the most independent state. Now many are  gradually being cured of the euphoria of being able to swim in  the raging sea at will. We are returning to one another within  the framework of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia  is for the strengthening of the Commonwealth, above all through  the establishment of an economic union, a common CIS market, and  the establishment of a system of collective security and the  strengthening of guarantees of human rights.    However, there exist factors which it is always essential to  take into consideration. Integration should not damage Russia  itself, nor should it be effected at the cost of our forces and  resources, material and financial alike, being stretched to  breaking point. This would only entail new disappointments and  it would not bring our states closer, but pull them apart from  each other.    Russia's foreign policy will be strong and effective if  interaction between various state bodies in its implementation  is secured as something tangible. I address this request, in  equal measure, to the relevant departments of the executive  authority and to the Federal Assembly -- we have one country and  it will only gain from this kind of interaction.    Esteemed members of the Federation Council and deputies of  the State Duma, I regard it as essential to spell out the most  essential things, on which concern, including my concern, will  be focused this year.    First: Law and order must gain a firm foothold. We are not  just talking of adopting high quality laws; we must also aim at  their implementation. Without that, it will not be possible to  put an end to official abuses, nor will it be possible to ensure  guarantees for people's legitimate rights.    Two: the fight against crime. We won't make life more  peaceful for the people of Russia if we confine ourselves to  emergency half-measures. We need a complex of legislative,  economic, organizational, and social measures. To fight crime,  one has to change conditions in society and in the state as a  whole.    Three: the economy. I intend to resolutely continue and  develop the reform started in 1992, using its reserves to the  maximum, fully keeping in mind the price that has to be paid on  this path.    Four: concern for the country's spiritual future. The  current state of culture, science, and education is, as I have  already mentioned, extremely alarming. This year an upturn  should be ensured in these spheres.    Five: Support for the regions and territories and the  protection of their interests. Much has already been said on  this matter. I can add that last year the drafting of the  principle of a new regional strategy in Russia began. This year  the strategy will be actively implemented. It is on this basis  we shall be able really to ensure the unity and integrity of  Russia.    Six: the future of Russians in the near abroad. This  problem requires constant and painstaking work, combining  firmness with delicacy, being consistent and reacting precisely  to the changing situation. I believe it is my duty to defend  the prosperity and dignity of our fellow countrymen wherever  they may live.    Seven: stepping up Russian foreign policy. Here the  qualitative parameters of equal partnership are coming to the  forefront. The key area is strengthening the Commonwealth of  Independent States.    We have established normal relations with the majority of  world states and have joined the main international  organizations. Now the main thing is, proceeding from national  interests, to make the potential of these ties fully effective  in Europe, in America, in the Asia-Pacific region and in other  areas.    Russia has the opportunity for beginning a qualitatively new  stage of its development. The period of total destructive  processes of the previous system is ending. We are laying the  economic, legal, and social foundations of a new Russian  society. Having received your proposals in response to my  message, I am addressing you with a specific plan of my actions  to put it into practice.    I know that there are those among you who doubt whether we  will be able to cope with these tasks, given the spiritual and  ideological discord that reigns in society and in our hearts  today. But we must provide an answer to this question together  -- not in tedious and fruitless debates but in real  collaboration. Only in common work will we be able to overcome  mutual suspicion and bring back trust in one another. Only by  common work will we be able, once and for all, to push back from  Russia the threat of confrontation and to achieve stable civic  accord. Only in common work will we be able to tear through the  black shroud of uncertainty and restore spiritual balance and  find ourselves in the new conditions.    Russian citizens expect cooperation from us. I am confident  they will support us because they want security on the streets  and in their homes; they will support us because they want  Russia to be peaceful and prosperous. I hope that in a year we  will all be able to look those who elected us in the eye and  say: Things were difficult for us, but we did in the space of  this year all we could, and it is not in vain that we lived  during these past 12 months.    For my own part I will do all I can toward this end. Thank  you for your attention.     "

The  extremely tentative hints of economic liberalization and the  rigidity of the regime in the political arena are not actually  enough to justify opening up a dialogue with Europe, or the  broadening of economic relations. The substance of the message  from the Europeans is that Cuba must do more, at least as far as  economic reforms are concerned, if it wants to emerge from its  isolation. Nevertheless, in this interview with CORRIERE DELLA  SERA, Alarcon does not appear to be dramatizing the situation.    [Bonanni] Mr. Chairman, why Europe?    [Alarcon] Because after the collapse of the USSR, Europe  became even more important for our economic interests.  Traditionally, i.e., before the revolution, the United States  was virtually our exclusive market. Afterwards, our partners  were the Soviet Union and the other socialist countries. Now,  with the disappearance of the USSR, there is no doubt that our  interest is centered on Europe and Latin America.    [Bonanni] Does that mean that, notwithstanding any informal  contacts, you are not expecting the United States to lift its  embargo in the short term?    [Alarcon] I would like to point out that we do not have  secret contacts with Washington. Moreover, I do not believe  that the situation can be unblocked quickly: at least within  Clinton's term. Logically speaking, now that the Cold War is  over, and now that the East-West antagonism is over, relations  between the United States and Cuba would improve. Yet, the  opposite has happened. The American blockade has been  reinforced. In Washington there are those who believed that,  following the disappearance of the USSR, the economic problems  would lead to the collapse of the Cuban revolution. Yet, we  have successfully resisted for four years. Obviously the  situation is difficult and the problems are serious. However, as  long as we hold out, the American strategy will prove to be  unsustainable. There are already American companies which are  looking worriedly at our new economic contacts with Europe and  Latin America.    [Bonanni] Even your relations with Cuban refugees seem to  have improved.    [Alarcon] Yes. Even though we are not expecting an  improvement in relations with the United States, it must be  acknowledged that something is changing. After 12 years of very  tough conservative politics, there is an administration in  Washington today that has contacts with more moderate sectors of  the Cuban immigrants. The Cuban far right, which dictated  Reagan's and Bush's policy, was linked too much to the  Republicans and it is now starting to lose influence.    [Bonanni] America is changing. What about Cuba? To what  extent are you interested in the Chinese model?    [Alarcon] We are studying it with great interest, as well as  the Vietnamese model. They too are developing countries that  are following the socialist path. However, there are major  economic and cultural differences. The Chinese rationalization  efforts cannot be applied to us: They have a large market,  great natural resources, an enormous population, and an ancient  tradition of entrepreneurship. In any case, the time of models  is over. Everyone must find their own road.    [Bonanni] How do you respond to the European pressure for  political and economic reform?    [Alarcon] I would not talk in terms of pressure. Generally  speaking, the Europeans understand that Cuba is in a tough  situation. It must adapt to a changing world. However, I  believe that our pragmatic approach is convincing. We are the  ones who suffered the most from the collapse of the Soviet  Union, but today we are also the most stable country of the  former socialist world. The euphoria of the capitalist world  following the events in Eastern Europe is now calming down and  making room for worries about the dangers arising from political  instability. The economic operators have understood this. They  know that in Cuba we have an educated and prepared population,  and that there is no risk of political instability. Thus,  despite the American pressure, they are beginning to invest.  After resisting for four years, I hope that our situation can  change for the better.     "
0,FT943-69 ,"FT943-69 _AN-EI3DUAG6FT 940930   FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance (1): Although the present global economic recovery appears to be well on course, it is impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. Worries, such as inflation and unemployment, still abound      By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor   The good news is that the global economy is growing well. But except in the newly industrialising countries of east Asia, few people seem to feel it. Although world output this year is likely to grow faster than at any time since 1989, the recovery from the slow growth and recession of the early 1990s is fraught with uncertainty. Fast and far-reaching changes are everywhere - in international relations, domestic politics, economics and business - unsettling policymakers, entrepreneurs and employees in developed and developing countries alike. A year ago, few commentators in the industrialised world would have bet on there now being a robust upturn in the United States, a well-established recovery in the UK, a strong bounce back from recession in Germany and the first signs of Japan pulling out of its worst economic downturn since the second world war. Outside the industrialised world - defined as the 25 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - the overall picture is even better. A number of developing nations have emerged as the engines of global growth in this decade. The International Monetary Fund has forecast that the developing economies as a group should grow at about twice the rate of the industrialised countries this year and next. New economic powers are emerging that should give the world economy an added boost as it heads into the next millenium. Latin America, although not without problems, has largely pulled free of the debt crisis that made the 1980s that region's 'lost decade'. China may be struggling to control inflation and runaway growth. But it is likely future historians will declare that country's emergence as one of the world's economic power houses to be the economic event of this decade. Economically, the world still stands to reap some benefits from the end of the cold war. One consequence - peace and a democratically-elected government in South Africa - could, with luck and good judgment, open up new vistas of prosperity for that country and the continent as a whole. Events over the past 12 months have made it possible to think of peace and economic co-operation among the countries of the Middle East for the first time since the second world war. But it is impossible to look to the future with unqualified optimism. The collapse of communism has brought problems as well as promise. Worries abound. The present global upswing is proving anything but comfortable. Inflation is a case in point. It appears broadly under control, in spite of a surge in commodity prices. Subdued inflation holds out the hope that growth can be sustained. Yet financial markets are sceptical and thrown into turmoil at the slightest hint of rising prices. While 'tiger' economies such as Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan continue to attract foreign investment and climb up the league tables of international competitiveness, other developing countries continue to be plagued by corruption, famine and civil war. There is the still unresolved problem of unemployment - a tragedy for some 35m people in the industrial countries and countless millions elsewhere. For many in work, there is constant and unsettling change at the workplace as companies restructure and strive to become more efficient. This turmoil in the world of work reflects two forces over which governments and individuals have very little control: globalisation and technological change. The world is shrinking daily as the costs of computing power and telecommunications fall. The multimedia revolution, harnessing the computer, telephone and television, is generating new products and services such as the Internet, which may be the precursor of the much-trumpeted global information superhighways. Multimedia could prove to be as significant in the development of mankind as the harnessing of steam and the development of the railways in the 19th century or the exploitation and spread of electric power in the early years of this century. But new competitors are emerging at a bewildering speed to challenge established companies and ways of conducting business. In a world where knowledge is increasingly perceived as the key to prosperity, giant industrial and commercial corporations can quickly become dinosaurs. The decline of IBM, once a synonym for the world computer industry, is symptomatic of the acceleration of change. In today's world, problem industries are just as likely to be high-tech as they are to be smokestack. Symbolising and promoting the frenetic development of the global economy are the financial markets. The liberalisation of capital markets around the globe and the falling cost of telecommunications have greatly increased their turnover and volatility and their capacity to sway events. A few years ago, an article such as this would have focused almost immediately on the role of governments and economic policymakers as initiators of change. Today, policymakers are lucky if they can avoid being overwhelmed by events. Technological and geopolitical changes have turned many of them into bit players on the world economic stage. Take the case of Alan Greenspan, the powerful chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. True, he caught financial markets on the hop with his decision to nudge short-term US interest rates upwards by a quarter percentage point in February. But what was supposed to be a prudent, well-signalled pre-emptive move that would demonstrate that the US monetary authorities were well in control of the domestic economy had unforeseen consequences. It ushered in months of market instability as bond investors and marketmakers jostled to restructure their holdings with as little loss as possible. The upshot has been an upwards movement of long-term interest rates of far greater significance for the world economy than Mr Greenspan's initial and subsequent monetary tightenings. Because they process the many billions of dollars worth of investments flowing across national borders each day, the markets have become the police, judge and jury of the world economy - a worrying thought given that they tend to view events and policies through the distorting lenses of fear and greed. The collapse of communism - symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall five years ago - was hailed by many as marking the victory of free market liberalism. For Francis Fukuyama, a US academic, it even signified the end of history. Today we know better. Instead of ending history, the end of communism and the cold war merely opened a new chapter, giving rise to new tensions as well as new opportunities. This summer's migration of boat people from Cuba to the US in search of a better life was an example of the forces unleashed by the ending of the old balance of power. The trade dispute pursued with such zeal by the Clinton administration against Japan over Japan's supposedly excessive trade surplus shows how friends can fall out when the common enemy has disappeared. The end of the cold war may yet exacerbate rivalries between the established and newly-industrialing countries by adding a new dimension to the process of globalisation. Globalisation has been one of the more significant developments in the industrialised world over the past 15 years. Driven by the desire of companies to produce and sell goods and services in more markets, it has led to the spread of corporate operations across borders through international investment, trade and collaboration for purposes such as product development, production, sourcing and marketing. According to the OECD, globalisation has entailed 'a turbulent process of birth and death of firms, the rise and fall of whole sectors of activity and the re-allocation of production within, as well as between, regions and countries'. As many as one in 10 jobs a year have been destroyed by this process. But it has also created employment on a similar scale. It is because globalisation has so far taken place mainly within the group of industrialised countries that the destruction and creation of jobs on this scale has been socially and politically acceptable. According to this year's World Investment Report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad), multinational companies employ nearly 10 per cent of paid non-farm jobs worldwide. But nearly a fifth of non-farm jobs in the industrialised countries are provided by multinationals. This may not be the case in the future. The fax machine, for example, already allows professionals in India to do routine architectural or audit work for clients in Britain at a fraction of the cost of UK-based companies. Prof Fritz Scharpf of Germany's Max Planck Institute has pointed out that the end of the Soviet Empire and the disappearance of the rival ideology to capitalism has made it safer for companies to invest in low-cost countries without fear of expropriation. Only a small number of developing states have so far emerged to challenge the industrialised economies. According to International Economy, a US magazine, Clinton administration officials have identified a 'big 10' particularly promising developing countries that are growing about twice as fast as the rest of the world. In about five years, South Korea, greater China (including Hong Kong and Taiwan), Indonesia, India, South Africa, Turkey, Poland, Mexico, Brazil and Argentina will together account for about the same share of world imports as either Japan or the European Union, they believe. If true, that should be good news for the industrial countries. It should mean more opportunities for their exporters. But, relative to the rest of the world, such changes would reinforce the slow but steady diminution of the industrialised countries' economic strength that has underpinned their status and influence: and this despite their undisputed domination of certain key areas of production such as computers, aircraft and - still - automobiles. IMF figures show that growth in the developing countries (excluding former communist states making the difficult transition to market-based economies) has only once fallen below 4 per cent in the past eight years. Growth in the industrial world has only once risen above 4 per cent in the same period. In June, the OECD upgraded its growth forecasts for its member countries to 2.6 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent in 1995. Although such growth would be a marked improvement on performance in the early 1990s, it will be insufficient on its own to deal with the OECD countries' economic problems and especially with unemployment. At the OECD's annual ministerial meeting in June and at July's Group of Seven summit in Naples, the industrialised countries resolved to embrace innovation and adapt. They agreed to reject protection, encourage enterprise, pursue deregulation and make their labour markets more flexible. As evidence of their determination to tackle unemployment, the OECD countries this summer adopted a report with about 60 specific recommendations to expand job opportunities. These will be used by OECD member states to fashion tailor-made policy programmes with the help of the Paris-based organisation. But the last decade of the 20th century is proving a difficult time for democratically-elected governments in the developed world. No class or group of workers is escaping the effects of structural change. The swollen budget deficits that are the legacy of recession and too many years of rewarding political support with social largesse remain to be tackled. In managing change, ministers and officials have to take unpopular decisions. For that reason, governments often agree to change and then have difficulties implementing it. One example is the Uruguay Round of trade liberalising measures which, after having been signed with great fanfare in Marrakesh, Morocco, in April, still awaits full ratification. For years the developed countries have promised to cut farm subsidies, recognising correctly that they hurt their own taxpayers and consumers and rob poorer developing nations of a comparative advantage. Yet in its latest annual review of farm policies and trade, the OECD estimated that combined transfers to agriculture from consumers and tax payers in its member countries fell by less than 1 per cent to just over USDollars 335bn last year compared with 1992. However, it would be wrong to paint too gloomy a picture of the industrialised world's prospects. The sharp drop of 376,000 in Britain's unemployment since December 1992 could be a sign that labour market reforms, along the lines advocated by the OECD, can be effective. The fall in UK joblessness has been unusually early in the cycle. Germany's stronger than expected upturn this year has confounded those critics who argued that its industries were inflexible and its working practices sclerotic. For the past 30 years, the US has shown itself to be an engine of job creation with the result that unemployment stands at about 6 per cent compared with around 11 per cent in the European Union. But the US surge in employment has not been matched by growth in wages. Between 1978 and 1993 average US real wages stagnated. As the US labour market shows, the economy of the industrialised world is a complex mix of good and bad. The same is true of the developing world where conditions vary greatly from country to country. There are the successes of the rapidly growing east Asian and Latin American economies which have embraced market-based economic policies - often more enthusiastically than the big industrialised economies. On the other hand, resource-rich Russia and the Ukraine are still struggling with the cultural, political and administrative problems of moving from command economy systems to market-based economies. The tribal slaughter in Rwanda, the boat people trying to leave Cuba and Haiti and the conflicts that have brought untold misery in former Soviet republics such as Georgia and Tajikistan are just examples from the many parts of the world which lack the most basic conditions for creating economic well being. Such regional crises are a reminder of how far we are from a 'new world order'. There are also plenty of global problems that governments have been slow to address. This month's UN conference on population and development in Cairo was the first to tackle the subject for a decade. Economic policymakers have yet to consider an international approach to migration although economic factors are usually the cause of people moving from their homes. Often, it seems, the first response of the industrialised countries to the complexities of the global economy has been regional. It was easier for the US administration to negotiate and win Congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada than it has been to negotiate and obtain backing for the Uruguay Round. Hopes of regional integration continue to cast their spell in the European Union. The 12 months of calm in the European exchange rate mechanism, following its crises of 1992 and 1993 have revived the prospects for Economic and Monetary Union. Nonetheless, in this, the 50th anniversary year of the Bretton Woods agreements setting up the IMF and World Bank, policymakers have realised that they cannot ignore the interdepence of their countries or the international institutions that helped shape the world economy since the second world war. The leaders of the G7 countries have agreed that next year's economic summit in Halifax, Nova Scotia, should review the institutions of global co-operation as a first step towards making global economic management fit better with the realities of the post-cold war world. This, said President Clinton, was 'a commitment to discuss in Halifax what we want the world to look like 20 years from now'. This is a potentially bold move. It may lead to nothing given the strength of national interests. But in view of the doubts surrounding the present economic recovery, world leaders would stand charged with gross neglect if they did not strive to improve the outlook for growth by strengthening economic co-operation.

0,FT941-12004 ,"FT941-12004 _AN-EBBDOABSFT 940201   FT  01 FEB 94 / IMF in Moscow visit: Western delegation fails to raise loan hopes      By LEYLA BOULTON      MOSCOW   A mission from the International Monetary Fund flew into Moscow yesterday amid fading prospects of quickly unblocking a new Dollars 1.5bn loan and of forging a new type of IMF support package for Russia. Despite announcing that the new government planned to use 'non-monetary' methods to fight inflation, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, has still talked of continuing market reform and of expecting western financial support for his efforts. He was expected, however, to be out of Moscow for most of this week. 'It's very difficult to tell what will happen, whether the delegation will spend most of its time visiting museums or whether we will find a new language of mutual understanding,' said one western official. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the new economics minister, has called on the IMF to help the government draw up a budget for 1994, and to help it design industrial and social security policies. The IMF has been berated by Professor Jeffrey Sachs for not providing enough money when the radical reformers he used to advise were still in power. It is now anxious to 'show the flag' so that it is not accused of indifference and a lack of understanding of Russian problems. However, it has clearly left its most powerful shareholders - the world's seven richest nations who make up the G7 - to decide whether it should abandon demands for progress on Russia's inflation and budget deficits as a condition for financial support. 'What will we give Russia in March if we give the Dollars 1.5bn now?' asked a western official, referring to the second tranche of a special loan designed to help countries move from communism to capitalism - which Mr Chernomyrdin wanted to receive this month. 'We seem to have to give Russia money periodically. It's like breathing. Now they're going to say they have to pay the bills left behind by Gaidar and Fyodorov (the radicals attacked for not honouring spending commitments made by the state in order to keep down inflation),' he said. 'The injection of money into the economy will create a sense of normalcy but then there will be new inflation and they will tighten up again. It depends on how deeply they breathe. If they are very careful, the same person who does the expiring will also do the inspiring.' But the western official added that the IMF and the G7 seemed happy to agree on a 'wait and see approach' until the new government's reform policies became clearer. He pointed out that the G7 was expected to discuss Russia in detail at the end of February.   Countries:-  RUZ  Russia, East Europe.   Industries:-  P9311 Finance, Taxation, and Monetary Policy.

Women of Russia speak in their program merely about a  strengthening of the ""international authority of Russia and the  development of equal mutually profitable cooperation with the  CIS countries and other foreign states in the interests of  stability, peace, and security.""    The PRES has a more extensive program, but it also is very  general and abstract. While advocating a union of the peoples of  the former USSR and East Europe which gravitate toward one  another and the development within the framework of the CIS of  ""confederative relations,"" the PRES at the same time believes  that Russia's foreign policy should be that of a ""great world  power"" and that the country should rely on its own efforts and  proceed from its own national interests. It is hard to raise any  objection to such assertions. But are the goals that have been  formulated realistic and attainable in the foreseeable future?  Hardly.    According to the DPR's program, ""foreign policy should  support the realization of our economic interests,"" and  ""Russia's political influence should be directed toward a  strengthening of the positions of our enterprises on overseas  markets, increased exports, the lifting of discriminatory  barriers, and a strengthening of trade and economic relations.""  Like all the other parties and blocs, the DPR did not overlook  the problem of the CIS. Travkin's party puts the building of  integration relations within the framework of the Commonwealth  in the first circle of its interests. And this is as far as it  all goes. Which, objectively, is little enough for so notable a  party in Russian political life as the DPR. Little enough, but  still more than with the Agrarian Party, in whose program a  foreign policy section is lacking altogether.    When interpreting the foreign policy sections of the above  blocs, several questions involuntarily arise. What position will  they hold in parliament, for example, during the discussion and,  particularly, during the adoption of decisions on foreign policy  matters? Or will they not be chess figures that are manipulated  in their own interests by stronger rivals or leaders? These and  similar questions are far from far-fetched, particularly if the  overall alignment of forces in the future parliament is  considered. And it is such that the end result could be  influenced appreciably by the fluctuations of even small blocs  or factions, not to mention their joint appearance on someone or  other's side.    In offering the electorate its program the Russia's Choice  bloc clearly proceeded from the foreign policy doctrine of  Russia published back in spring of this year. This coincidence  is not fortuitous, of course. If only because if was from this  bloc that Andrey Kozyrev, the present head of Russia's Foreign  Ministry, ran for deputy.    Although new points appeared in the Russia's Choice foreign  policy platform--policy in respect to the ""near abroad"" is  clearer and more detailed, for example--on the whole, the  overall thrust of the doctrine remains unchanged. But however  much we would like as soon as possible to become affiliated to  the liberal-democratic world and to resemble it, this will not  happen in the foreseeable future. Not because the path leading  here is long and thorny, but mainly because the particular  features of Russia and the mentality of its people (NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA has well-foundedly addressed this subject repeatedly) do  not permit this. If we proceed from this, the overall policy of  Russia's Choice, including its foreign policy course, is wrong  and must for this reason inevitably go bankrupt. Judging by the  events of 1993, the final months particularly, the results of  the Duma elections included, resistance to this policy has been  growing constantly and assuming new, increasingly serious forms.  In the new parliament this resistance will be great and will  intensify rapidly, including in the foreign policy sphere. A  serious struggle under conditions where no force is clearly  preponderant will enable some populist, in fact, dangerous  extremist figures, representatives of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] in particular, to attract some  deputies and a part of society that is even bigger than prior to  the elections.    The foreign policy doctrine of the LDPR is the direct  opposite of all the others. Its main feature is aggressiveness,  more, unconcealed bellicosity, which is atypical of all the  other programs. This needs no proof.    Although the foreign policy part of the program of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation is not as extensive or  developed as with Russia's Choice, the LDPR, and YABLoko  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc], it exists, nonetheless. But  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has simply been  unable to abandon the class approach or the ideological  blinders. This is manifested if only in the evaluation of the  most important factors that characterize today's international  relations. And at the same time, however, a renunciation of the  overemphasis on ideology characteristic, in particular, of the  Soviet period and the at times unjustified geopolitical  pretensions connected with it is considered an essential element  of Russia's foreign policy.    The foreign policy part of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  bloc  would seem to be the one which is most balanced and appropriate  to domestic and international conditions. It is evident  throughout that it was written by an experienced and competent  hand.    A special section of the program is devoted to relations  within the framework of the CIS, which is entirely justified.  Declaring that this sphere is the priority of Russian foreign  policy, YABLoko goes on to note that the purpose of the bloc is  the ""all-around (economic, cultural, defense) integration of the  former Union republics exclusively on a voluntary basis.""    YABLoko's program has not lost sight of any in any way  important direction of foreign policy. While rightly observing  that ""the foreign policy of the new Russia should be as  pragmatic as possible,"" YABLoko emphasizes attention to the fact  that ""Russia's geopolitical position requires Russian foreign  policy's equivalent attention to Europe, the United States,  Central and South Asia, and the Far East."" The program  formulates precisely the principles of the country's foreign  policy and its goals and priority and long-term tasks. The  particular efforts of Russian diplomacy, YABLoko believes,  should be geared to the molding of foreign policy support for  the economic transformations in the country and the promotion of  Russian goods and services on foreign markets and the  integration of our economy in the world economy on an equal,  mutually beneficial basis.    Within the framework of its overall strategy YABLoko  advocates partnership with the West, but on the basis of a sober  balance of the interests and possibilities of both sides. ""Our  interests,"" the program says, in part, ""largely coincide. The  current differences determined by the specifics of geopolitical  interests and national and cultural traditions are natural and  are not of an antagonistic nature. They can and should be  overcome exclusively by way of political consultations, with an  explanation and defense of our particular position.""    Russia is entering, if it has not already entered, a  qualitatively new period of its development, which will  undoubtedly make a strong impression on its foreign policy. In  the new situation there is a very great probability that it is  foreign policy that will be the object of fierce and  uncompromising struggle between the parliamentary blocs or their  captive.    The tremendous difference in the programs of the election  blocs will contribute to this to a considerable extent and will  hardly disappear with time. The contrary, rather, an  uncompromising struggle in parliament, for which many deputies  are already attuned, will harden the adversaries even more.     "

This will be the first high-level contact between Havana and  the government of Phnom Penh which was elected last year under  UN auspices.    The Cuban minister will meet with his Cambodian counterpart,  Norodom Sirivuth, who will welcome him officially at the capital  city airport of Pochentong.

Sirivuth will attend to the visiting delegation in his  capacity as acting head of government in the absence of Prime  Ministers Norodom Ranarith and Hun Sen, who are abroad.    Robaina will also be greeted during a special audience with  Chea Sim, the acting head of state and president of the National  Assembly, who has for the past months represented Sihanouk, who  is receiving medical treatment in China.    Before heading for Phnom Penh, the head of Cuban diplomacy  visited Indonesia, where he started his tour, Laos, and Myanmar  [Burma], and he made a stopover in Thailand's capital, Bangkok.    His next destinations are India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.    Robaina told PRENSA LATINA that Cuba has found new  possibilities for exchanges and communication with the countries  that he visited. He added that the hosts voiced their interest  and desire to negotiate with Havana in the areas of health,  biotechnology, and sports, among others.    In his opinion, Cuba must study the economic explosion  experienced by this region and determine what is most applicable  to its own situation.    The most important aspect of this tour, Robaina pointed out,  is the degree of understanding and the opportunities we have  found to explain the true reality of the Cuban project.     "
0,FT941-2604 ,"FT941-2604 _AN-ECTARADLFT 940319   FT  19 MAR 94 / Beware the sickly Russian bear: Should the west spoon-feed its old adversary; should it 'cuddle up to Yeltsin'? Or should it treat Russia as a serious country with its own serious national interests?      By JOHN LLOYD   A surprising question confronts the western powers. Should they fear Russia? The west, it seems, has come to believe that Russia is no longer a menace - after Mikhail Gorbachev opened it up and Boris Yeltsin introduced democracy. Rocky, volatile, impoverished, it may be, but not dangerous; no longer an adversary. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, western politicians have been asking how to use aid to encourage Russia to be friendly, democratic and market-orientated. However, in the US the debate has moved to an older question: whether the Russian bear, reborn after communism, should be feared as much as tamed. The elections in December did most to re-open the question. The party which achieved by far the largest number of votes in the State Duma was Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democrats, who believe that Russia should at least re-conquer the space formerly occupied by the Soviet Union. Alexei Mitrofanov, 'shadow foreign minister' for the LDP, says that 'we consider the ex-Soviet republics as integral parts of Russia, and our idea is to restore them to the previous (Russian imperial) status. Not separate countries - and not even something like the Soviet republics. There will be for example no Ukraine - but provinces, as Kiev province, Donetsk province and so on - only local administration, all connected to Moscow.' The oddly named Liberal Democrats are not the only Russians to hold such view. The powerful Russian Communist party and many other groups inside and outside the parliament have also founded their popular appeal on the aggressive reassertion of Russian power in the 'near abroad' - the revealing appellation for the former Soviet states. They are the inheritors of a massive wave of popular revulsion against the arrogance of the west, the impoverishment of Russia and, most of all, the sudden estrangement of more than 25m Russians living in the 'near abroad' from a shrunken motherland. They are prey to theories of conspiratorial domination and control whose defining points can appear to be plausibly anchored in reality. Alexander Prokhanov, whose weekly 'DEN' was the bible of the nationalist movements and which has appeared again in a new guise after being banned, is the most talented of these theorists. He says: 'It's quite simple. The US is exercising its dictatorship over the domestic and foreign policies of Russia, over her cultural and ideological policies. So Russia's foreign policy in all regions of the world must match the national interests of the US in these regions. 'America's policy towards the geopolitical space known as the Soviet Union amounted to seeking its dismemberment and undermining Russia's potential, then keeping this potential at a safe level for America. In these aims (President Boris) Yeltsin and (Foreign Minister Andrei) Kozyrev have been accomplices.' These are not the voices of executive power in Moscow, but they are the voices of influence and of a powerful strand of popular protest. Both before the December elections and more obviously after, the executive power has shifted to accommodate the nationalist revival. Kozyrev has moved furthest: from the too-uncritical westerniser he was when he came to office at the end of 1991, he has become a nationalist statesman. He is not afraid of out-flanking Zhirinovsky on the need to keep the Kaliningrad enclave Russian. He has been threatening on Ukraine and has allowed it to be thought he wanted Russian troops to remain in the Baltics indefinitely. In more considered public voice, an article he wrote a week ago in the daily Izvestiya underscored that 'Russia is doomed to be a great power' with interests which conflicted with those of the west - but that these conflicts could be managed peacefully as conflicts between friendly states everywhere. The devils lie in the details of what it means to be a great power. For Andrannik Migranyan, one of President Yeltsin's most publicly visible advisors, Russia 'is a big power, economically stronger than any of its former republics'. In relation to the 'near abroad', he points out that Russia has a very serious interest: the Russians living outside the Federation; it needs accesses and routes to the Baltic and other seas through former republics; it needs to ensure security. 'All of these factors demand that Russia become a core for the reintegration of this space. Without this (reintegration) we can get many clashes, fights and wars - and we already have them.' Thus Migranyan suggests at the pressure Russia can bring to bear on the surrounding countries now struggling to establish viable statehoods. Economically, Russia dominates all but the lucky few which have substantial resources, such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. It has proposed a rouble zone to bind together again states whose links remain strong: but as the squeeze upon economies gets tighter, the criteria for entry also become tighter. Last week, the governor of the Central Bank of Belarus - the Slav state which has sued for an economic union with Russia once more - said that Russia wanted complete submission to central economic and financial policy. Belarus is so prostrate and so politically inert that Russia may get it. If so, it will be a template for other economies - and the prize would be Ukraine, whose economy is in full collapse. Militarily, Russia has bases in every one of the former Soviet states except Lithuania and Azerbaijan (and it is likely to get its bases back in the latter before long). Armies have 'kept the peace' in Georgia, Armenia, Moldova and Tajikistan - sometimes using, as Sergei Karaganov, a presidential advisor on foreign policy, wrily admits, 'nineteenth century methods'. In Georgia, the Russian army was decisive in first destabilising, then (when he had come to heel) underpinning, the position of Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of state; in Tajikistan, the regime would fall without it; in Moldova, the 14th army's presence protects the interests of the majority Russian speakers on the left bank of the River Dnestr and effectively divides the country into two. Especially in Moldova and Georgia, where Yeltsin gave assurances which the army later ignored, it seems as though the army is conducting its own foreign policy. Politically, the great wave of nationalism which swept through the Soviet Union between 1989 and 1992 has all but exhausted itself - except in Russia. Non-Russian nationalism in the other republics was also anti-Russian nationalism. So the Russian democrats were unable to cement alliances with nationalists in those other republics. Nationalism is now replaced with exhaustion in many states (the Baltics are an exception: they remain strongly independent and in the case of Latvia and Estonia, strongly anti-Russian). The support for nationalist politicians has declined everywhere, including in Ukraine. The new state elites have been unable, some unwilling, to develop the attributes of statehood. There is some force to the comment of Sergei Stankevich, one of the leaders of the centrist Party of Reconciliation and Accord, that 'it is their choice to come to us, not ours. We simply open our doors to our neighbours: you cannot interpret this as imperial behaviour'. But that is precisely how an increasingly influential swathe of western elite opinion is interpreting it. Henry Kissinger, the former US Secretary of State in articles and speeches; former National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski in a widely quoted article published in Foreign Affairs; the influential columnist William Safire; the former head of the US National Security Agency General William Odom - all of these are actively propagandising against (as they represent it) a US-led, western policy of putting Russia first, cuddling up to Yeltsin, letting down the East Europeans and other former Soviets, and pretending there is a partnership. In New York, Dr Kissinger says: 'We are dealing with Russia not as though it were a serious country with its own serious national interests, but as some kind of mental basket case that we have to massage, that we have to be very careful to manoeuvre step by step into some vague relationship of 'friendship' with the west. 'Russia is acting in the traditional Russian manner, which has always had the element of dominating the erstwhile republics of the former Soviet Union. From that point of view, it is imperialist.' The cause around which those who oppose the policy of the west have gathered is that of the expansion of Nato. Under the 'Partnership for Peace' proposal put forward by President Bill Clinton in Brussels in January, all the former Communist states would be eligible to participate in the Partnership at whatever level suited them. For the Poles, the Balts, the Czechs and the Hungarians, it was a slap in the face - a clear indication that the west favoured Russian interests over theirs. They have powerful allies in the west, among them Mr Brzezinski. In Washington, he said: 'I think that if we were to expand Nato eastwards and Nato were to offer Russia a treaty of alliance; if we were to balance aid to Russia with more aid for the non-Russian states, we might succeed in creating a geo-political context that would be relatively stable and would mitigate some of the dangers (of Russian expansionism). This would help the Russian democrats by bringing the west closer to Russia; if we don't do it now, when would we do it? Is a political vaccuum in the heart of Europe in the interests of Russia?' This potentially damaging attack has drawn blood, and a response. On Monday, the US Defence Secretary William Perry took on Kissinger, Brzezinski and others when he said the current policy included views of Russia both as a rival and a partner. This was 'lost on our critics of constructive engagement. They say we have chosen to make Russia a partner when we should be making them a rival. And I say that is a false dichotomy.' The debate can only be inconclusive: for it depends on factors which are unknowable. Migranyan, the presidential advisor, believes Russia is 'in no sense a democracy: it is passing through a time of authoritarianism from which it might emerge into a democracy'. Professor Peter Reddaway of the US Institute for Peace, one of the most consistently pessimistic of the prominent commentators on Russia, points to the criminalisation of the economy and warns of a turning away from reform. It is certain that we are facing a country which will remain an enigma - if no longer enclosed in a dogma. It is undergoing a loss of empire of the kind Britain and France sustained in the 20th century, with an adoption of democracy which took most of the western states centuries to achieve, plus an opening to markets for which the culture was wholly unprepared. It should not be forgotten how intense this process is.

Russia is the  joker in the European balance of forces. Formerly, in the Cold  War, it was Russia's power that burdened Europe; now it is its  weakness and inner conflicts. However, no matter whether it is  strong or weak -- Russia was and remains a factor of uncertainty.    Ironically, the West had an easier time in the past. No  matter whether politics was marked by containment or detente --  its huge military potential made the Soviet Union the enemy, and  every alliance planning was oriented by it. In the course of  its history, NATO has wracked its brain over many other problems  -- the pranks played by Charles de Gaulle or the dictatorship of  the Greek colonels. However, what remained at the end of the  day was always the same -- the classical problem of the balance.  How to deter the Soviet Union or how to defend oneself against  it if deterrence were to fail?    The problem now is that the Soviet Union has committed  suicide and abandoned communism, is experimenting with the  market economy and democracy, withdraws its troops from Germany  1,500 km to the East, and removes approximately 2,000 warheads  from its nuclear arsenals every year? Every reasonable person  must want to see this process completed smoothly and end happily.    However, the harvest is not yet saved; there are still a lot  of ill weeds in the furrows. One problem is the chauvinists who  believe the country is surrounded by old and new enemies  intending to trouble and humiliate the country. Another problem  is the classical symptoms of a society that is caught between  the past and the future -- attempted coups and the growing gap  between profiteers and losers of the change. One seed that is  not bearing fruit is the economic reform. The production  decrease of 25 percent that was reported recently shows a  declining economic sector. ""Weimar-Russia""? The idea no longer  is as absurd as it was two or three years ago.    The West does not have the power and ability to modernize  Russia from outside. In foreign policy, a dilemma has developed  for the West that was dramatized by Grachev's appearance at the  NATO meeting. Russia has insisted on a special role on the  European stage, which, at a closer look, shows fatal parallels  with the attitude of the old Soviet Union. During the Cold War,  Moscow always claimed a veto on the West's security policy. At  first, Moscow did not want the West Germans to be rearmed, then  it did not want NATO to be equipped with intermediate-range  missiles. Today, the alliance cannot bomb Bosnia without  specific permission from Moscow or take those Eastern European  countries under its wings that wish to associate with NATO.    ""Special status"" is the magic formula used by Grachev and  Yeltsin when they talk with NATO. Even if Grachev after an  unexpected turn suddenly accepts the ""Partnership for Peace""  program ""without any condition,"" Moscow wants to be ""more equal""  than the Eastern Europeans, and behind this is the old claim to  the guaranteed role of big power. NATO will have to consider  this carefully if it wants to remain a functioning alliance and  does not want to leave the new democracies on the other side of  the Elbe river in a drafty ""Central Europe.""    Cooperate with Russia, protect Yeltsin against his  troublemakers at home? Yes, in any case. Open the door for  Russia to the G-7 club of the rich industrial nations? Logic  seems to forbid this because it would be tantamount to taking in  the bankrupt into the group of creditors. Channel Moscow into  NATO past the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians? That would mean  degrading those who are worthy of protection and privileging the  country they fear.    What basically holds true is this: Diplomacy can and even  must cover up dilemmas by all sorts of compromise formulas; its  principle is the ""both...and"" formula. But in the end, there is  still the threatening ""either...or"" principle. If Russia does  in fact become a NATO member, this will be the end of the  alliance. It may still be called ""NATO,"" but it would be  nothing but a mini-CSCE, a rather noncommittal association open  to all sides and incapable of making tough decisions.    In Brussels, the Americans and the British have apparently  held their own against the Germans and Spaniards who wanted to  give the Russians (""a big power,"" according to German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe) more shining epaulets. This is better  for NATO and better for the Eastern Central Europeans who are  Germany's direct neighbors and do not need any discrimination  for the benefit of Moscow. There are other means to satisfy  Russia's status requirements, and the alliance does not have to  give up its old identity. There are enough problems for Russia  to demonstrate its role as a responsible big power -- in Bosnia  or in the struggle against the spreading of weapons of mass  destruction. Binding Russia by all sorts of measures is a  long-term dictate of every Western policy. However, Russia's  unpredictability and potential strength make the country not  only a partner but also a certain risk in the wake of the Cold  War.     "

We are here with  Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who is playing a tennis  match teamed up with Dr. Miguel Silva against Ambassador Alberto  Casas and Counselor Ricardo Avila. Are you winning, Mr.  President?    [Menem] We were at deuce, so we will have to continue to  play.    [De La Rosa] Mr. President, regarding the surprise speech by  Cuban President Fidel Castro at the convention center yesterday  afternoon, as well as the subsequent remark he made as he was  riding in a car -- something to the effect of: We are divided --  what is your opinion on this?    [Menem] I would say there are different concepts of  democracy. One is the one understood by free countries in which  the people elect their representatives. There are no barriers,  no penalties, and no prohibitions on leaving one's territory or  on stating one's opinion -- places in which there are no  political prisons, persecution, or torture.    The other form of democracy is that which Commander Fidel  Castro understands. He gets angry, speaks out melodramatically  regarding the situation in Cuba, and I say this with all respect  due to the commander. Only one thing is to blame for the crisis  Cuba is facing, and it is this: As long as Cuba does not live  in democracy, and as long as it does not return to a way of life  common to other countries in America and in the world, it will  be very difficult for our positions to agree.    I have been a victim of the tyranny of a dictatorship. I was  virtually an outlaw in my own country for 25 years. I spent  five years in prison. I know what it is like to be tortured,  what the punishment cells entail. I know that my companions  suffered greatly during the years when the killings occurred.  Nobody can tell me or teach me anything about that, not even  the commander, who was never in prison.    Moreover, there is no indication that the situation in Cuba  will change. This is something that is entirely up to him.  This is why I do not see any sense in the melodrama he is  making of the Cuban situation, blaming it on the U.S. blockade  imposed solely, I would say, by the United States. Other  countries are trading and, in fact, bringing capital into Cuba.  The measures and controls are so strict, however, that they  discourage any type of investment. This is the truth.    [De La Rosa] President Menem, this melodrama that you speak  of by Fidel Castro, couldn't it complicate things for Latin  American integration?    [Menem] No, no, no. I am familiar with integration processes  in other parts of the world in which countries that disagree  with circumstances that prevail in a region or on a continent  cannot integrate with the other nations of the region. They do  not enter into the free zone until their plans and proposals  change. If we live in a democracy, one has to follow the steps  of the majority -- not only the majority at the state level, but  also the majority at the level of the people.    [De La Rosa] Commander Castro noted that he was hurt  yesterday afternoon by a lack of solidarity from the Latin  American countries against the U.S.-imposed blockade against the  island.    [Menem] I do not believe it is a lack of solidarity. I  reiterate that many countries of the world are commercializing  and taking their production to Cuba, as well as working with  Cuba over these past few years. For instance, in 1974 the  Argentine Republic under the presidency of General Peron broke  the U.S. blockade and assisted Cuba with resources, products,  and foodstuffs to the point that ever since then, and subsequent  to the many contributions that were made, Cuba owes Argentina  more than $1 billion. The commander, should then speak of this  reality, which we Argentines know of very well.    [De La Rosa] Are the Ibero-American countries divided then,  as the Cuban president stated informally?    [Menem] I do not think they are divided, just the opposite.  We are all asking Commander Castro to give respite to the Cuban  people -- to leave them in a position to exercise their rights.  We are speaking of the defense of human rights. We are  speaking of life. We are speaking of liberty. Obviously these  things are nonexistent in Cuba.    [De La Rosa] President Menem, thank you for suspending your  tennis match to give an interview to Caracol Network. Dario, do  you have any questions?    [Arizmendi] Yes, of course. We are pleased to greet  President Carlos Saul Menem again, after interviewing him  exactly one year ago for Colombian television. Mr. President,  if the Cuban president does not change his position regarding  the concept of democracy, as it is understood in Western terms,  is there a possibility that he will not be invited to future  summits?    [Menem] No, no. The commander is always going to be invited.  Now, Dario, I do not understand the distinction that you just  made -- Western style democracy. I believe there is only one  democracy. Everyone participates in that democracy. Democracy  is created when people elect their representatives and when the  representatives govern for the people. There is only one kind  of democracy, and not the kind maintained by Fidel Castro. It  so happens that not too many years ago Chilean President  Pinochet said his dictatorship was a democratic one. In other  words, there are different concepts of democracy, but there is  only one kind of democracy.    [Arizmendi] President Menem, you have been, perhaps, one of  the most principled presidents, and your attitude regarding all  types of dictatorship has been well-known to the public for some  time. When you meet Cuban President Fidel Castro, how do you  greet one another? Is there any kind of warmth or cordiality, or  is there distance between you?    [Menem] No, there is cordiality, and there is fluid  dialogue,  but we do not speak of politics or anything related. We were  talking yesterday about the place where I was born, what we do  there, what my family's activities are, whether my family has  vineyards, and if my family makes wine. I explained several  things to him regarding my hometown in a province in the  northwestern region of the Argentine Republic. We did not  broach politics at all. Those things have to be discussed  publicly. They have to be treated as we have been treating them  since the Guadalajara summit. The commander also, publicly, has  referred to his form and style of government, and his references  are common to those of any dictatorship, or at least any kind of  government outside democracy.

The barge was sighted in La Socapa area, before exiting  Santiago de Cuba Bay, and was pursued by border guard troops for  50 minutes in an effort to make them give up their illegal  plans. At Daiquiri Beach, members of the border guard and  workers of the Navegacion Caribe enterprise boarded the barge  without firearms, engaged in a man-to-man struggle, and managed  to subdue the fugitives. This is how the chief of the operation,  Lieutenant Colonel Lesmes Leal Lescay, described it:    [Begin Leal Lescay recording] During the struggle, the only  injuries the six men sustained were blows; three of our comrades  also sustained minor blows, some requiring four or five  stitches. We were able to subdue the men without using firearms,  in compliance with the guidelines issued by the minister of the  Interior and the provincial and border guard chiefs.    Throughout, we guaranteed that nothing would happen to the  three women and two children. I took care of that, and once we  had them, we were able to control the men and guarantee that  nothing would happen to the women and children at any time.

Right now  in Panama City we are hearing rumors that there has been an  attack on Cuban President Fidel Castro. What is being said in  Cuba at this very moment?    [(Zardales)] We are surprised by this information. We have  no knowledge of such an attack. We have not even heard that  President Castro is sick, which is another rumor I hear is going  around.    The president of Cuba has not appeared in public in these  past few days because there has been no need for it. No  activity has been held in which he has had to participate. His  brother has been seen in public at events to mark the  anniversary of the Bay of Pigs victory. That is why rumors  started that he was victim of an attack or a stroke. The truth  is that we have no official or unofficial information on this.  To be honest with you, we have not even heard street rumors  about this.    [Reporter] In other words, Mr. (Zardales), nothing is being  said about this in Cuba.    [(Zardales)] No, not really. I have just come in from the  street. I was reporting from the city, and I have no  information on this. Before receiving your call, I talked with  comrades here at the radio station and no one has information on  this.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), what do you think prompted the  international version on what might be happening to Fidel Castro?    [(Zardales)] I think it is wishful thinking on the part of  some people. Many people would like to see something happen to  him. I believe these people are trying to create a bizarre  perception of our country in advance of the upcoming emigre  meeting in Havana. The meeting will be attended by Cubans who  live in several countries -- in the United States, Europe, Latin  America, and even Australia.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you have said Fidel Castro has  not  been seen in public for the past few days. When was the last  time he was seen in public?    [(Zardales)] The truth is that I cannot remember. I cannot  remember. I know it was a few days ago, however; there are no  indications that he is sick. Similar rumors were spread in the  past when he was not seen in public. I imagine he has a lot of  work to do. I believe he is involved with the upcoming meeting  in Havana, and this must be keeping him pretty busy. We are  hoping it will be a successful meeting -- a meeting of  rapprochement with the Cuban community living abroad. We are  all Cubans and have the right to discuss the political and  social future of our country.    [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you are a reporter. Are there any  rumors that Castro is sick? Has an official announcement been  made about some kind of illness he may have, perhaps heart  disease?    [(Zardales)] All he is suffering from is having excellent  health. If we are going to talk of illness, we can talk about  old age. Old age is something natural for all of us. However,  I do not think he is ill. He enjoys good health.    We saw him recently. He is a man who keeps himself  physically strong. He enjoys sports. He will jump into the  water and take a swim at any time of the day, even in the early  morning hours. He also plays basketball. He keeps himself  physically strong. We honestly have not heard that he is ill.    [Reporter] In conclusion Mr. (Zardales), has an official  announcement been released regarding the international rumors  that Castro is ill? Do you know of this?    [(Zardales)] No, no, no. I have heard nothing of this. I am  just arriving. I have not read today's news releases, but I  have seen nothing about this. As I said earlier, I believe such  rumors begin every time he is not seen in public for two or  three days. I also believe that these rumors are being spread  in light of the upcoming meeting with Cubans living abroad, or  with representatives of the Cubans living abroad.    [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. (Isidro Zardales), Radio Havana  Cuba editor in chief.     "

The 11th plenary session of the Cuba-Mexico Entrepreneurial  Committee [Comite Empresarial Cuba-Mexico], which began meeting  on Monday in the El Nacional Hotel in Havana, presented in its  opening session a conference on NAFTA (Mexico-United  States-Canada) and similar agreements signed by Mexico with  Chile and Costa Rica, as well as similar future agreements to be  signed by Mexico with four other Central American countries.    Melendez said the process of openness that has begun in Cuba  could expedite its participation in free trade agreements. He  warned that because of current trends toward a global economy,  no country can survive in isolation.    In reply to a question by Julio Garcia Olivera,  representative of the Gaviota Tourist Corporation, on how NAFTA  will affect bilateral trade, Melendez explained his country's  commitments to the United States and Canada do not affect trade  with Cuba.    He warned, however, that competition could be a factor,  because Cuban products would compete in terms of prices and  tariffs with similar Canadian or U.S. products, which have the  advantage of not paying import duties to enter the Mexican  market.    On the other hand, Cuban merchandise would be barred from  being reexported to the United States, especially merchandise  blacklisted by the U.S. blockade, due to the certificate of  origin required for all merchandise involved in the trilateral  trade pact.    The entrepreneurial committee continues its sessions today  and will end the sessions on Thursday. Forty Cuban businessmen  and 37 Mexican businessmen will attend this meeting.     "
0,FT934-894 ,"FT934-894 _AN-DLVCCADNFT 931222   FT  22 DEC 93 / Double trouble, toil and struggle: Ukraine's nuclear weapons and its collapsing economy are worrying for the west      By EDWARD MORTIMER   In the latest of a series of attempts to convince Russia and the west of its good faith, Ukraine announced on Monday that 17 of the 46 SS-24 strategic nuclear missiles on its territory had been deactivated, by moving the warheads away from the launchers. The move may go some way towards allaying anxieties in the west about the prospect of a Russo-Ukrainian conflict, heightened by the electoral success of Russian nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who wants to restore Russian rule throughout the former Soviet Union. One Ukrainian parliamentarian has argued that Ukraine should try to secure operational control of the nuclear missiles on its territory, 'to confront the threat to its security posed by Zhirinovsky's new-found strength'. Russia has conducted a vigorous diplomatic campaign on the nuclear issue, claiming that the weapons based in Ukraine are not being properly serviced or maintained, and that there is a grave risk of an accident if they are not handed over soon. 'Ukraine is deceiving us all . . . and we are so helpless that we cannot deal with this evil,' President Boris Yeltsin was quoted as telling US Vice-President Al Gore last week. Western policymakers have grown increasingly worried about Ukraine's apparent reluctance to implement the Lisbon protocol, signed last year, under which it pledged to transfer the remaining nuclear weapons on its territory to Russia, and to join the nuclear non-proliferation treaty as a non-nuclear state. Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, warned recently that Ukraine would get little or no US aid until it dismantled the weapons, while Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister and current president of the EU Council, said it was 'unthinkable' for Ukraine to join Nato's planned Partnership for Peace so long as it had not fulfilled its disarmament commitments. But while some Ukrainian deputies have talked loosely of the weapons' value as a deterrent against Russian aggression, defence experts realise that any Ukrainian nuclear force would be vulnerable to a Russian pre-emptive strike. Nor do they believe it would be easy for Ukraine to gain operational command and control from Russia. 'The specialists who maintain and service the weapons are Ukrainian,' says Serhiy Pirozhkov, director of Ukraine's National Institute of Strategic Studies, 'but the black or red suitcase - whichever it is - remains in Moscow.' Anton Bouteiko, foreign policy adviser to President Leonid Kravchuk, insists that full compliance with the Lisbon protocol depends on three conditions: technical and financial help with dismantling the missiles; compensation for their value; and guarantees that Ukraine's security would not be jeopardised by its non-nuclear status. The west has been trying to meet Ukraine's concerns on all three points. Several well-placed western observers in Kiev are convinced that the importance of the nuclear issue has been exaggerated, and that the true danger to Ukraine's independence lies in its own government's mismanagement of the economy. Industrial output fell by 20 per cent in 1992, and probably as much again in 1993. Inflation is running at about 70 per cent a month - or, as economy minister Roman Shpek prefers to put it: 'The total price index this year is 37.8 times higher than last.' The long-promised national currency, the hryvnia, has yet to be introduced; meanwhile Ukrainian workers are paid in coupons which last week were trading at more than 30,000 to the US dollar - or, even more tellingly, at 27 to the Russian rouble, with which it started at par two years ago. Despite monthly increases in wages and pensions, incomes cannot keep pace with prices, and few Ukrainians can afford more than the barest necessities unless they have access to hard currency. Most families survive on fruit and vegetables from their dachas (country cottages), having gone out after work every evening last summer to pick the beetles off their potatoes by hand; and many, even in large towns, keep a goat for milk and cheese. Thus a sophisticated industrial economy, which once manufactured many of the components and guidance systems for the very missiles now in dispute, has all but reverted to subsistence farming under the impact of hyperinflation, aggravated by energy shortages. Ukraine imports virtually all its energy from Russia, which has gradually raised the price of its oil and gas exports to world market levels. Ukraine has failed either to prepare for or adjust to the change. Its oil refineries, which used to re-export refined products to Russia, are closing down for lack of input, while gasoline is smuggled across the frontier in trucks. Ukraine no longer has surplus electricity, and has therefore had drastically to cut its exports to central Europe, potentially a precious source of foreign exchange. Conservation measures are haphazard and panicky - many Kiev apartments were virtually unheated during November's severe cold spell, and universities have been told to extend their Christmas holiday until early February. President Kravchuk recently called in foreign ambassadors and tried to convince them that his latest 'economic reform', involving cuts in industrial and energy subsidies and credit creation, with faster privatisation, is more serious than its seven predecessors. All previous attempts have been sabotaged by increases in wages and pensions to compensate for price rises, and by credits to help companies stave off bankruptcy and unemployment. 'We have a law on bankruptcy, but unfortunately we don't have a single bankrupt,' says Mr Shpek. Ironically, many Ukrainians voted for independence in 1991 not out of any firm sense of national identity - though 11m of the 52m inhabitants define themselves as Russian - but in the belief that they would be economically better off. Mr Kravchuk's avoidance of painful economic measures which might shatter this fragile consensus has resulted in a situation in which, by every economic indicator, Ukraine is now worse off than Russia. Not surprisingly, a lobby of politicians and industrialists has emerged in the mainly Russian-speaking east of the country, advocating closer economic ties with Russia, with which Ukraine still does 90 per cent of its trade. At the same time, groups in various regions have started calling for greater local autonomy. Politically most sensitive is the Crimea, which was only made part of Ukraine in 1956, and which many Russians regard as rightfully part of Russia. So far Ukraine has been remarkably free of the ethnic violence which has plagued other ex-Soviet republics. But while some Ukrainian nationalists proclaim their willingness to 'eat grass' for the sake of independence, it seems unlikely that many Russians are ready for that degree of self-sacrifice. If the economy continues to deteriorate, different ethnic groups will see their interests as divergent; and if violence does break out, a local Russian leader, in Crimea or elsewhere, will sooner or later call on Russia for help. After the 1917 revolution, Ukraine, like the states of Transcaucasia, had a brief fling of independence followed by reabsorption into the Russian empire under the new guise of a Soviet republic. This time round a similar pattern has been set, notably in Georgia and Azerbaijan: local conflicts have been exploited by locally based Russian forces to reimpose de facto Russian control while maintaining formal independence. Should the same happen in Ukraine - a country that includes Europe's geographical centre, and shares borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania - it would, in the words of Markian Bilynskyj, the British-born research director at a Ukrainian think-tank, be the result of 'a succession of bad policy choices which look inevitable to the analyst after the fact; a case of self-destruction or suicide, with Russia only too eager to play the role of Dr Kevorkian (the US practitioner of euthanasia)'. Ukrainian nationalists advocate greater economic independence from Russia and closer ties with western Europe. Yet few grasp that only much bolder reforms would make that orientation realistic.

Does the country indeed face financial  collapse in the next few months, as certain foreign observers  and also some Ukrainian politicians claim?    [Kravchuk] The situation is grave, even very grave. There  is inflation, the crisis in industry, the slump in  production.... This is all true, so to speak. I will mention a  few of what I see as the main reasons for our economy's plight.    When Ukraine was part of the USSR, the main emphasis was  placed on the development of heavy industry -- mining,  metallurgy, the chemical industry.... That is, on sectors that  do not directly benefit people but consume the bulk of energy.  And when the prices of energy sources quintupled for us in the  last 18 months, this was naturally bound to affect the entire  national economic system. On top of that there are the problems  with the financial and banking system. After all, it  essentially never existed here. The Ukrainian national bank was  just a subsidiary of the USSR bank.    Another factor has certainly been the cadres problem. Cadres  have proved unprepared to swiftly restructure our entire economy  as an autonomous, independent system. Not with a view to  isolation, but with a view to being able to resolve by our own  efforts the qualitatively new tasks facing us as a sovereign  state.    [Prokopchuk] Isn't this the explanation of the lurches,  uncertainty over the choice of path, and sabotage of the  transformations on the part of the old management apparatus,  which has barely been renewed at all?    [Kravchuk] I would not speak of sabotage as such. That is  an exaggeration. But the inconsistency of our actions on the  road to the market is clear. And the replacement of three  governments is confirmation of that. We are now on our fourth.  All the previous ones quit under pressure of the situation, on  the initiative of the Supreme Council. This rapid replacement  of governments is also not a good thing and has also had an  adverse effect.    The main miscalculation has been the attempt to combine the  principles of the administrative-edict economy and the market  economy. Seeing that the switch to market relations is not  proceeding as rapidly as we would like, our managers have clung  to familiar levers. Nothing sensible has come of this. And  only now, in my view, is the government adopting the correct  course -- an anti-inflationary, market course. But with  mandatory control on the part of the state. Since at present  property largely remains in state hands.    In short, there are shifts. Over 20,000 enterprises --  small, medium, and large -- will be privatized this year.    [Prokopchuk] But Western specialists' forecasts are not so  rosy. It is openly being said that the Ukrainian economy will  inevitably collapse and that Ukraine is doomed as an independent  state. Do you share this view?    [Kravchuk] I want to answer your question with another -- To  whose advantage is it for Ukraine to be independent, who  generally wants this? There had long been balance in the world  and in Europe, and tested and proven ties in the economy and  politics had been established. Then all of a sudden the  geopolitical situation changes sharply. Along with other new  states, Ukraine appears on the map of the world -- a sizable  country possessing nuclear weapons, a country with a decent  industrial potential and fertile soil. Today it is experiencing  difficulties and economic crisis. But it is capable of becoming  rich. Calculations show that if normal agricultural production  and processing are organized, Ukraine can provide not only  itself but also other countries with piles of foodstuffs. Tell  me, who benefits by this? So hundreds of complex questions  arise.    Our neighbors also have political interests -- access to  Europe, access to the sea, access to Crimea.... That is, a  whole system of views emerges which as I see it boil down to the  fact that today a great many people are interested in ensuring  that Ukraine does not make it as an independent state. There is  the foreign policy factor of press from both East and West.    [Prokopchuk] What about domestic political forces?    [Kravchuk] Naturally, there are also domestic forces that do  not want Ukraine to make it as a sovereign state. Some are  angry with the authorities, whom they describe as partyocratic  and communist. There are the national-patriots. They are angry  with Kravchuk and others. But, in opposing the president, they  are essentially opposing their own people. Although they pay a  lot of lipservice to the people's interests.    There are also forces openly oriented toward the interests  of  other states. Admittedly, many people allude only to Russia,  believing that ""Ukrainian"" interests predominate there.  However, I do not share that view. Russia naturally has more  ""Ukrainian"" interests than other countries, and there is still a  very great deal of work to be done to harmonize the interests of  Ukraine and Russia. But to claim that Russia alone is an  opponent of our interests, as many people try to make out, is a  mistake. We simply have not yet found the key to resolving  questions with Russia. That is my profound conviction.    In short, both domestic and external factors are extremely  complex, and we will have to make great efforts to avoid  provoking grave confrontations. But I think that thanks to our  consistency and flexibility, thanks to the fact that we have  sought and have found compromises, we have managed to retain  good relations with our neighbors and retain good friends  abroad. Thanks to our considered actions in resolving internal  political problems, in particular interethnic problems, and  thanks to our people's wisdom we have not evoked confrontations  inside our state, although some people badly want this. We live  in peace. And this is the most important point.    [Prokopchuk] Now let us touch on purely economic problems.  How was it possible to repay half the debt to Russia?    [Kravchuk] First, we began to make savings and we reduced  consumption. Second, we began to make real repayments,  realizing that you cannot live in debt. Now, if we manage to  solve the problem of compensation for nuclear weapons and  succeed in resolving other questions, in particular the question  of the Black Sea Fleet, I think we will cope with the problem of  debts to Russia.    Debts are not the most important thing today. Every state  has them. No one makes a tragedy out of this. A debt can  always be repaid, there is the basis and prospect for this. The  most important thing is to learn to work in the new conditions  and to create competitive output and technologies which will  make it possible to integrate intensively with the world economy  and the economy of the Commonwealth countries.    [Prokopchuk] What is the situation regarding payment for the  transit of Russian freight on Ukrainian railroads and Russian  gas and oil? There are rumors that Russia has already been  given all Ukrainian compressor stations and other pipeline  facilities as a contribution toward repaying the debts.    [Kravchuk] Those are just rumors. They play into the hands  of those who are interested in robbing the state. The question  of transit was raised by our acting Prime Minister Y.  Zvyahilskyy during talks in Moscow ahead of the Ashgabat meeting.    Solutions were found. Russia reduced gas prices, and we  reduced transit prices accordingly. The same happened with  Turkmenistan.    [Prokopchuk] Private capital and big investors who would  help fill the empty shelves and remove social tension are not  shunning Ukraine only because of the political instability.  They are deterred by the absence of guarantees regarding the  export of their share of the profits and the absence of a law on  land assigning to the owners of an enterprise the land on which  it stands.... Ukraine, bankers claim, is dying for want of  investment.    [Kravchuk] We adopted foreign economic laws back when I was  chairman of the Supreme Council. At that time we had our laws  assessed by experts in a number of countries with a developed  market economy. But when one of our governments received the  right to issue decrees, it slightly rejigged these laws. A  number of important provisions that were to investors' advantage  were removed.    We are now rectifying this situation. At any rate, today our  foreign economic laws are no worse than those operating in other  countries. They give the right to unimpeded evacuation of  profits, properly defend the investor's capital, and provide him  with guarantees and tax breaks. But our presentation of these  laws is painfully low-key and useless.    Another point. If we had a convertible national currency  and if we managed to curb inflation, investors would be keener  to come here. That is, today the laws are not the problem.    [Prokopchuk] Many people believe that the slump in  production  in Ukraine and therefore the decline in the population's living  standard result from the severing of economic ties with Russia.  But former Vice Premier B. Pinzenik claims that this is not the  cause but the effect of the fact ""that we have artificially  blocked the way to the Russian market with quotas, licenses,  duties, and taxes and, now we have lost this market, have  nothing with which to purchase Russian energy sources."" What is  your view?    [Kravchuk] What happened happened. But now we have removed  many of the ""barriers."" But it cannot be said that the  ""barriers"" were erected only by Ukraine. When Russia first sent  us the list of its goods liable to export duties and the list  ran, I think, to over 2,000 items, I said: What kind of ""free  trade"" is this? (Incidentally, our list of goods for which  special export procedures were introduced at that time consisted  of only 300 items.) Why did the Russians not lift the ban on  free trade in their oil, gas, and timber?    Moreover, who was the first to start to erect borders  between  Ukraine and Russia, who was the first to adopt that decision?  Russia. But I bear no grudge. Every state has to defend itself  and its interests. I am merely in favor of ensuring that there  is no distortion or lack of objectivity. And that mutual  interests are taken into account and everything is resolved on  businesslike, partner principles.    Why is the European Community prospering? Because there if  citrus fruit prices in Italy and Spain are at a given level,  they are the same in France as well, and if somebody wants to  change something, they assemble for a general council for a  mutually respectful review of quotas, taxes, and duties.    But what happens over here? Russia introduces its own  prices, its own wages without consulting with anybody.... We  cannot do this because we are in different leagues. Russia has  a positive balance, it has colossal natural resources, and it  can permit itself things that neither we nor other CIS countries  can permit ourselves.    The upshot is that, given the low purchasing power of our  population and the low prices compared with those in Russia, a  flood of Ukrainian foodstuffs, anything that can be transported  and carried, poured into Russia. Our stores and depots were  stripped bare. So we were forced at the end of the year to  double or triple food prices in order to halt the plundering of  the country. Today you can buy a ticket to Moscow or other  Russian cities without any problem -- the flood of peddlers  exploiting this ""equal, mutually advantageous"" cooperation, the  ""consideration"" of mutual interests, and the operation of the  ""unified regulatory system"" has dried up.    This mechanism does not exist; there is only talk about it.  Just why do those who shove microphones at Ukrainian citizens at  markets in Bryansk and Smolensk not tell the truth about the  reasons for these pilgrimages but only screen the ""unadorned,""  strictly personal (and ""correct,"" of course) viewpoint of their  interviewee?    [Prokopchuk] Leonid Makarovich, why in your view has the  ruble zone not worked out? And what is your prediction for the  future of the CIS?    [Kravchuk] I said from the very beginning that there would  be no ruble zone. Because we have the wrong view of the ruble  zone and how it should be understood. In history there have  been dollar pools, sterling zones.... But then each of the  states belonging to the said zone had its own currency and  aligned it with the main currency. The dollar, for example.  But what did we want from the ruble zone? A single ruble --  the same for all the states? That is not a ruble zone, but a  ruble state.    Russia must not be blamed here; I would have acted the same  way as the Central Bank of Russia. If I print the money (and  this is the greatest asset) I also have to track the money  supply, the correctness of mutual settlements, prices. If this  is not done Russia will die, it will be overtaken by stronger  inflation than we have. To live in different states and set  your own prices, wages, and taxes while all using the same ruble  is unrealistic. I talked about this in Moscow when we were  discussing the problem of the Economic Union. At the time many  people took exception to what I said. But within a month we had  confirmation of what I was asserting. Russia has ultimately  forced out of its zone almost all those who nurtured hopes of  finding a home in this zone. And Russia is right. It is  pursuing primarily its own interests and attending to the  stability of its own monetary system, the prevention of  inflation, and the strengthening of its own economy. And this is  natural. This is how we, and others, would act. Charity begins  at home.    As for the fate of the CIS, we are witnessing, as I have  already said, the improvement of our Commonwealth's structure.  It is hard to predict today what the specific directions of  this improvement will be, but the fact that the Commonwealth is  necessary is beyond doubt. There are two main strands: The  member countries' common problems must be solved within a CIS  framework, while questions of relations between individual  states must be resolved on a bilateral basis. These two strands  were indeed in evidence during the meetings and talks in  Ashgabat.    Can the Commonwealth, in the long term, become the same kind  of association of states as the European Union? Maybe, but it  will take time. The internal complexities in every CIS member  country are a brake on the processes of the broader and more  active improvement of the CIS itself. But in the long term, I  repeat, we can achieve the same kind of union as the EEC.    [Prokopchuk] If it isn't a secret, how are the Massandra  accords on the Black Sea Fleet and other issues being  implemented?    [Kravchuk] There is movement. First and foremost in  understanding the other side. I proceed on the basis that we  have already adopted three documents relating to the Fleet --  the Yalta, Dagomys, and Massandra accords. When we were  adopting them we moved first forward and then backward. In any  event, taking these documents as a whole, they can serve as the  starting point for steps forward. It was this that I suggested  to President B. Yeltsin. But the Russian side is seeking to use  only the Massandra document. And does not wish to take account  of the two previous documents, which nobody has rescinded. On  the one side you have a protocol of intent, on the other --  signed agreements.    You cannot pick and choose only the things which you find  advantageous and convenient to yourself. It is necessary to  examine everything as a package, on the basis of mutual  acceptability, not to exploit the situation and some short-term  advantages; it is necessary to take the long-term view.    If today some people think that a change of borders is  possible, they are deeply mistaken. Agreement on something  specific is indeed possible -- there have been examples of this  in history. But times need to be different for this. It is  necessary to follow only the path of discussion, the path of  accords. To try to resolve something by force means to unleash  conflict. Incidentally, it's not all as simple in the Crimea as  people sometimes like to suggest.    [Prokopchuk] Incidentally, it is 340 years since the  Pereyaslavl Assembly [which voted for Ukrainian union with  Muscovy].    [Kravchuk] Yes, we lived together for 340 years and now we  cannot resolve the problems which have built up and  accumulated.... I believe that we will have closer ties than  before, natural ties, not diktat -- older and younger brothers,  dominant and subordinate peoples. We will cooperate as equal  partners. We must move toward this kind of relationship calmly,  smoothly, handsomely, with the understanding that we are Slav  peoples and are ordained to live together, side by side,  forever. The only thing is that today no stupidities must be  committed. By Russia or Ukraine. People must not state that  Ukraine as such does not exist, and Ukrainian independence is in  general a ""historical mistake.""    Nor do I share the other side's statements that all the  difficulties which we have come up against today are ""Russian  intrigues,"" that it has been the ""dirty Muscovites"" [""moskali""]  who have been strangling us all his time.... For some reason  some people are very keen to cause trouble between us. This is  why it is necessary not to commit stupidities or ignore today's  realities.    [Prokopchuk] By ratifying START I and the Lisbon Protocol  with a number of substantial provisos did Ukraine not doom  itself to a further, tighter credit blockade and uncompromising  political pressure from the United States and other nuclear  states?    [Kravchuk] The Supreme Council decree includes provisos  which are perfectly normal and natural, as they say. Yes,  Ukraine is entitled to compensation for its nuclear weapons,  Ukraine must have reliable guarantees of its security, Ukraine  needs assistance to eliminate its nuclear weapons.    But the fact that the Supreme Council did not vote to join  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty is a major mistake by our  parliament. I have said and will continue to say this, I will  insist that the only correct path for us is to join the treaty.  We cannot change the already adopted course toward nuclear-free  status. You can build any illusions you like, even about  creating our own nuclear industry, but they are only illusions.  It is clear to everyone that we do not need the weapons we  inherited from the USSR. And nobody will ever use them.    Everybody knows that, even if such an insane idea was to  come into somebody's head, it is practically impossible today  for Ukraine to launch the missiles. Any of these 176 missiles  can be launched only on orders from Moscow. This is clear to  everyone, but nevertheless attempts continue to be made to turn  us into a bogeyman.    In signing the trilateral statement and the annex to it in  Moscow on 14 January, Ukraine won a political, economic, and  human victory. The United States, Russia, and the entire world  community shared it with us. Nobody will now say that Ukraine  is standing still on the nuclear disarmament road. The road to  START II and even START III is now open. Mankind has gained  real hope of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons.    There is something else I also wish to stress. Most of the  demands formulated in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's provisos  relating to ratification of the START I treaty were met. In the  documents which were signed the United States and Russia stated  that they respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and  independence, that is, they are becoming guarantors of our  security. After acceding to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty  -- and I am confident that our parliament will now adopt such a  decision -- Ukraine will be safeguarded against nuclear attack.  And, equally importantly, we will receive compensation for the  uranium in the strategic missile warheads which will be sent to  Russia, plus financial, scientific, and technical assistance in  eliminating our nuclear weapons.    As for the part of your question relating to a tougher  credit  blockade, in December there was indeed a real threat of  isolation. But now broad political and economic cooperation  prospects are opening up for us.    [Prokopchuk] And a final, purely personal point, Leonid  Makarovich, if you will permit me. Since you also became head  of government there has been an obvious increase in your  workload. Do you manage to carve out time for your family and  grandchildren? And in general what is your life like outside  work?    [Kravchuk] My grandson Andrey is 13 and as tall as me; he's  an early developer. And my granddaughter Mashenka is six.  She's so sweet and interesting. When they are with me it's the  only time I get completely away from all the worries and  problems. You have to answer their endless questions, you see.  When we get involved in their games I myself also become like a  child. I can play hide-and-seek with my eyes blindfolded; when  they crawl around on their knees, I crawl around on my knees;  when they jump, I jump. Those are the times I really relax....     "
0,FT942-3721 ,"FT942-3721 _AN-EFND1AA9FT 940614   FT  14 JUN 94 / Cuba close to telecoms sale      By TED BARDACKE   Grupo Domos, a Mexico-based holding company, is close to finalising a deal to buy 49 per cent of Emtelcuba, Cuba's telephone monopoly, for about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn). This would be Cuba's first important privatisation since the 1959 revolution and would be in the context of rapidly growing business between Mexico and Cuba. The deal is likely to include a concession to operate the telephone system in Cuba and an ambitious modernisation plan. The length of the concession and its price are still being negotiated. Company officials said the deal was being discussed yesterday during a one-day visit to Havana by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico. He is being accompanied on his trip by Mr Javier Garza Calderon, leader of Grupo Domos and a member of the wealthy Garza family of Monterrey in Mexico, which has interests in such industrial giants as Visa, Femsa and Bancomer. Mr Garza Calderon was a bidder for Telmex when the Mexican government privatised its telephone monopoly in 1990. He did not win on that occasion but has maintained his group's interest in telecommunications, until recently operating cellular-phone services in northern Mexico. The Cuban telephone system that Domos would purchase is even more antiquated that the Mexican network it once tried to buy. Fewer than five in every 100 people in Cuba have telephone lines and as many as half of those lines are not functioning at any one time. However, Domos is betting that negotiations between Cuban and US officials will open a lucrative long-distance calls market between the two countries beyond the current limit of 300 calls per day. Even with the limit, those and other international calls generate hard-currency income of an estimated Dollars 2m per month for Cuban Telecommunications. Other Mexican companies are operating in Cuba, in tourism, textiles, cement, cellular-phones and oil exploration, among other areas.   Companies:-  Grupo Domos International.     Emtelcuba.

In statements to PRENSA LATINA, Rafael Hernandez, department  head for the Center for American Studies, said the presentation  and discussion of a draft bill by a group of congressmen headed  by Representative Charles Rangel is important because this will  enable Washington to measure the political cost of its policy  toward Cuba.    Hernandez added that whether or not the repeal is approved,  this discussion shows there is political interest in ending the  blockade against Cuba both within and outside the U.S. Congress .    Hernandez explained that even within the U.S. Administration  itself there are groups that have different ideas on the  subject, and he stressed that because a group within Congress  has adopted this position, greater support could be given to  those arguing in favor of normalizing relations with Havana.    All this makes the U.S. national outlook more complex and  varied, especially on the official governmental level, he said.    Writer and journalist Nicanor Leon Cotayo argued that what  is  taking place in Congress is symbolic of the growing U.S.  awareness of the need to review the blockade policy.    He recalled that Rangel's proposal is not the only one,  noting that others have tried to introduce modifications on bans  preventing U.S. citizens from traveling to Cuba and that there  have been calls for making current limits on medicinal exports  more flexible.    Leon Cotayo said one cannot disregard an increasingly  growing  sentiment among important sectors of U.S. society regarding this  issue.    Leon Cotayo also mentioned the importance of the debate as a  message to the White House -- a message that indicates the  blockade strategy is increasingly being questioned in the United  States.    The Cuban writer described the congressional discussions  that  began the previous day as being significant in terms of the  process of growing opposition to the blockade, which is felt in  the heart of U.S. society.    This makes one think, he concluded, that even if the lifting  of the embargo is not around the corner, we see on the other  hand that it is not so far away.    Evelio Barrios, vice director for the Center for American  Studies, said it is impossible for the U.S. Government to  continue to ignore the political cost the blockade has on its  international image.    He said: What is most important is that this will permit the  assessment of a new consensus being created within Congress on  the issue, even though I do not expect any changes in the  official position in the immediate future.    Barrios also recalled that two UN votes favorable to Cuba  opposed Washington's punitive measures, that editorials in  influential U.S. newspapers have been critical of the blockade,  and that several prominent people have denounced the blockade.    Moreover, the United States sees the serious international  problems it has caused itself by implementing the Torricelli Law  and by trying to destroy Cuba's economy.     "

In his first reply, Fidel said he does not believe  there were substantial differences between the summit in  Cartagena de Indias and the previous ones held in Guadalajara,  Madrid, and Salvador de Bahia.    [Castro] ""I believe that there have been (?advances) in all  of them, and that altogether, they are positive. They have  improved. One is never satisfied with everything discussed at  the summit, or everything that is said. The mere fact that the  summits are held constitutes an important historical step in  Latin America. As I was explaining today to solidarity groups,  it is the first time in history that [words indistinct]. There  have been several summits, this was the fourth. These meetings  have been consolidated and have been institutionalized. These  Latin American summits have been institutionalized. Each one  has [words indistinct] and each one ends with specific  agreements, has promoted specific actions, but they have a  general [word indistinct]. I believe that a [words indistinct]  among Latin American leaders has been created, with greater  understanding, a greater spirit of cooperation reflected in the  various activities of Latin American countries in favor of  [words indistinct].    ``We should not analyze the summits only by what they  achieve, but for what they promote. They have helped promote  things. In my opinion, these summits are so important that they  have triggered the Miami Summit. Our northern neighbors got  worried [words indistinct] specific results in subregional  integration organizations. Therefore, they decided to call a  summit; we still do not know if it will be an annual summit. Of  course, you know what the exclusions are [words indistinct] they  know that even though the summit is in Miami, I would go [words  indistinct] I believe this is a cowardly exclusion, which  reflects the [words indistinct] because it is an opportunity, we  cannot deny it, of creating a Latin America [words indistinct]  the presumed owners of this hemisphere. I hope there will be  enough enthusiasm -- and there is always [word indistinct] and  enough courage -- and there are always courageous men -- to  mention some truths in that summit. I hope that the interests of  Latin America and the Caribbean, which are many, are defended.''    Fidel Castro also pointed out that having given intensity  to social development issues is one of the modest contributions  Cuba made to the Ibero-American summits.    [Castro] ""[Word indistinct] we have made a strong effort to  raise the summits' spirits and to give meaning to them. I  believe the Cuban delegation has no reason to be (?ashamed) of  these statements, and [words indistinct], especially at this  summit because we are looking at the so-called Miami Summit. We  already started discussing the Miami Summit. We believe these  summits have created awareness. Integration awareness is one  such issue created by these summits. We should measure the  success of the summits by the number of tangible issues, not by  the awareness they have created, the rapprochement they have  generated, or the contacts achieved by the Latin American  rulers. [Words indistinct] of the Cuban contribution; Cuba has  made a modest contribution. You were asking about the summits'  contribution to Cuba. I can tell you they have contributed to  fighting Cuban isolation, to creating awareness of the blockade,  to giving a lesson to the United States, and to [words  indistinct] Cuba's expulsion. Cuba recently improved its  relations with the rest of Latin America; Cuba has encountered a  more propitious climate for economic relations and trade.""    As for the Miami hemispheric summit, the Cuban president was  asked what issues the Latin America should stress there.    [Castro] ""We must promote the defense of sovereignty and the  principle of nonintervention in Latin America. In addition,  those pretexts used to intervene in Latin America's domestic  affairs, such as drug trafficking, must no longer be used to  violate the Latin American countries' sovereignties. We must  change armies into police bodies. In other words, there is a  number of economic and political issues that should be stressed  at the Miami summit. I was thinking that if the United States  indeed wants to have more mature relations and if it wants to  close its military bases in Latin America, it should not forget  the Guantanamo base; the United States should comply with the  agreements signed to remove all military bases in Panama and in  any other country. There are security, political, and economic  problems that must be discussed at this summit. I would say  there is a world to be discussed there.    ``I urge the Latin American countries to discuss these  issues  at the so-called Miami Summit. I know very brave Latin American  and Caribbean politicians. I met them at these Ibero-American  summits; they are valuable and capable people. I hope they will  bring these issues up at the Miami Summit. The slogans that  were uttered from decade to decade and from century to century  were just lies and more lies.''    To this effect, the top Cuban leader pointed out the United  States continues to be the biggest obstacle to Latin American  integration.    [Castro] ""The United States wants to disintegrate us,  because  it opposes true Latin American integration. It wants the  countries to move forward on their own. [Words indistinct]  toward integration, the United States is promoting bilateral  integration among the many Latin American countries. The same  thing that happened with the foreign debt, when it opposed  holding negotiations with an integrated Latin America, is  happening now. The United States refuses to let Latin America  integrate; it wants to sign agreements with individual countries  to meet its own interests, thus preventing a true American union  from forming. One thing, however, is what the United States  wants, and another is what Latin Americans are doing on their  own: promoting their own bilateral agreements.    ``Mexico is promoting bilateral free trade agreements with  different countries. It already did that with Chile. Although  Mexico is a NAFTA member, Mexico also just signed a free trade  agreement with Venezuela and Colombia, the Group of Three. They  say the ideas of free trade and Latin American integration are  slowly making headway.''    Cuban reporters were not an exception and also asked Castro  about the guayabera shirt he wore in Cartagena, generating such  great surprise and suspicion.    [Castro] ""The tale of the guayabera has been quite a tale.  [Words indistinct] some people disagreed, I mean some of the  security people. (?A girl) asked why I took off my uniform.  No, I continue to wear my uniform deep inside, [words  indistinct] but I am already used to those boots [words  indistinct] the first day I wore the slacks [words indistinct]  and yesterday I also (?wore it) so she could tell me I was  wearing the uniform [words indistinct], and that I was wearing a  guayabera and slacks as uniform [words indistinct] navy blue  plants and a guayabera, but I kept the boots.

In essence, the VOA stated that President Fidel Castro had  extended an invitation to exiled Cubans throughout the world and  that the only condition set on attending the conference was  loyalty to the Revolution.    Even though the VOA transmissions are aimed at Latin America  and the Caribbean and practically all the rest of the world, it  is imperative to state the following: The VOA's report is  flagrantly false. First: The summons was not made on behalf of  Comrade Fidel but on behalf of the Revolutionary government and  the Cuban organizations. Second: Nowhere in the text of the call  are Cuban exiles mentioned, but persons and organizations who  are representative of Cuban emigration. Third: It is a flagrant  and miserable lie to state that the only condition demanded by  the Cuban authorities to attend the conference was loyalty to  our Revolution.    The summons states the determination of the Cuban  authorities  and people to advance toward normalization of relations with  those residents abroad who, constituting a majority of emigres,  are not relinquishing their ties with the country. They do not  condition them on personal and political aspirations or group  interests. That is something very different from what the VOA  stated.    Cuba is not making a call for a political dialogue, even  though the summons has, of course, a certain political  connotation. The Cuban proposal is based on humanist principles.  As for the rest, the VOA can be sure that the conference will be  held and that it will not be a dialogue of the deaf, but a  dialogue between men and women of good will.     "

Dealing with new members in the former Soviet Union seeking to make the transition from central planning to the market economy has posed a challenge different both in type and in size from the kinds of problems the two Washington-based institutions have been accustomed to. At the same time, the rich industrialised countries have all, to varying degrees, been going through periods of fiscal penury which in the richest of them, the US, has been acute and lasting. As a result, they have looked increasingly to the IMF and the World Bank to handle the financing questions raised by Russia and the other former Soviet republics. In their different ways, both institutions have made cultural leaps to adjust to the problem. For the IMF, the adjustment took the form of the Systemic Transformation Facility (STF), a temporary loan fund designed to help countries with the balance of payments difficulties arising from their move to trade at market prices, enabling them to bridge the gap until they could get their economies in shape to qualify for funding from a normal IMF standby facility. Although IMF officials insist that the STF is conditional on a coherent economic adjustment strategy, and deny that they were simply responding to pressure from the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, it is clear that G7 officials had been urging the Fund to loosen its conditionality in order to help Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president. 'This is not a situation where aid can be delayed until every 'i' is dotted and every 't' is crossed,' a US Treasury official said earlier this year in discussing the STF. For the World Bank, the answer to easing Russia and its neighbouring republics into the market economy came in the form of the rehabilitation loan, a Dollars 600m facility designed basically to secure needed imports. A second Dollars 1.5bn drawing on the IMF's STF is under negotiation, as is a second rehabilitation loan from the World Bank. Russia's relations with both institutions, however, have been strained since the Russian central bank's controversial move in July to cancel all pre-1993 roubles. In many ways, the rehabilitation loan represents the same sort of leap for the World Bank as the STF does for the IMF - profound cultural changes in institutions that are often accused of being culturally hermetic. In both cases, the institution has had to loosen or alter some of its traditional lending principles, and runs the risk of criticism from other customer countries in the developing world that it is giving preferential treatment to Russia. Such criticism has, in fact, been curiously muted. In the World Bank's case, this is at least partly because Russia does not compete for the concessional funds of the International Development Association, although some of the poorer republics, along with Balkan countries such as Albania and Macedonia, may qualify for IDA soft loans. In addition, the World Bank's finances are strong enough - in spite of having to make a Dollars 610m loan loss provision last year, mainly to cover its exposure in Yugoslavia - that it can absorb some additional risk in its lending to Russia without cutting back on loans elsewhere. In the case of the IMF, however, some developing countries are starting to worry that the increased concentration on Russia could hinder the renewal of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility, a concessional loan fund for poorer countries, when it expires later this year. But the IMF escapes the public criticism that awaits its sister institution, largely because it does not lend for individual projects and so does not attract the attention of the vocal environmentalist groups who closely monitor the World Bank's lending for dams and power stations in the developing world. Both institutions remain gloriously lacking in cost consciousness, but the World Bank has at least cracked down on first class air travel, while IMF staffers complain bitterly that they are now allowed only the cheapest first class fare on any route - usually obliging them to fly with the national airline of the country with which they are negotiating - and can no longer keep the frequent flyer miles they accumulate for their personal use. The World Bank, meanwhile, has this year undertaken a sincere if still much criticised effort to improve its effectiveness and increase its transparency. Responding in part to prodding from the US Congress, the Bank has agreed new standards for disclosing its documents to the public and for setting up a form of appeals process. At the same time, it has taken a set of initiatives in response to an internal report showing an alarming decline in the quality of its loan portfolio; these measures, it is hoped, will shift the culture of the Bank away from one which rewards managers for generating loan volume and towards a greater emphasis on following projects through to their completion. 'Central to the plan is the commitment to make the management of projects under implementation as important as making new loans. Only sound, on the ground results - the development impact of projects - are true measures of the bank's contribution to sustainable development,' said Mr Ernest Stern, one of the World Bank's managing directors. Outsiders can detect little of such self-scrutiny at the IMF, even though the organisation has at times seemed to be in search of a role since the debt crisis faded. But perhaps the greatest self-scrutiny should be exercised by the richer shareholders of the IMF and the World Bank, who have increasingly shirked their own share of the burden of handling the world's economic problems in countries such as Russia and its fellow republics in the former Soviet Union. The demand for the IMF and the World Bank to take up the slack seems likely to grow for many years to come, in areas such as Vietnam, Palestine and South Africa.

Alarcon spoke after a ceremony commemorating the anniversary  of the first Cuban Constitution, which was signed in this town  during the independence war against Spain. The ceremony was a  celebration of the origins of the Cuban nationality.    At Constitution Plaza in Guaimaro, some 500 km from Havana,  Alarcon stressed the similarity between the current struggle of  the Cuban people to maintain their social project and the ideals  of the founding fathers who established the motherland.    Alarcon asserted that amid the difficulties Cuba is facing,  the effort to perfect the Cuban socialist program is still  pursued in difficult and unpredictable times.    Alarcon recalled that from the very beginning of Cuba's  struggle to gain its independence from Spain the island was  threatened by the ambitions of the United States, the same  country that is now trying to smother the social system that was  able to fulfill the dreams of the founding fathers.    He pointed out that following the historic principles of  Cuban legislation, Cuban deputies will examine on 1 May the  serious economic and financial problems of the island to seek  viable solutions to improve the current situation.    Alarcon underscored that the constituent assembly of  Guaimaro  made provisions to guarantee the equality of Cuba as a nation  and that of all Cuban citizens among themselves to achieve the  national ideal: the homeland, ""the same one that we defend  today on an island besieged as in the past century.""    Education Minister Luis Ignacio Gomez; Julian Rizo Alvarez,  first secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in Camaguey; and  Camaguey Mayor Evis Blas Gonzalez also attended the ceremony.     "

The group is currently in Havana to attend a  conference organized by the Foreign Ministry.    Luis Mendez, an investor living in New York, told PRENSA  LATINA that rejection of U.S. policy toward Cuba and support for  the conference continue to grow within the Cuban community  living abroad. This is a growing movement, even among those who  would never have spoken of any sort of change in relations with  the country two years ago.    Mendez left Cuba almost 30 years ago. He said a positive  result from this conference could lead to more talks with Cubans  living abroad. He added that it could also influence the  evolution of future relations with Washington.    The investor contended that many U.S. firms are interested  in  investing in Cuba, but the current restrictions set up by the  blockade disallow such activity.    He condemned the fact that after signing a letter of intent  he was not allowed to transfer funds to the Caribbean island.  The money was destined for family relief, but the U.S.  Government did not give its approval.    Mariana Gaston, a member of the Antonio Maceo Brigade in New  York, also believed the meeting to be a first step toward  continued conversations. Gaston was also a participant in the  talks held between Cuban emigrants and the government in 1978.    She highlighted the government's interest in seeking the  historically significant normalization of ties with the Cuban  community abroad that might resolve the worries or needs of that  portion of the Cuban family.    She pointed out the improved facilities for travelling to  the  island for family reunification, the solution of communication  problems, and the improvement of migratory regulations in  general as examples of that intention.    She added that some of those living abroad try to mobilize  the sometimes intimidated voices of those who want normal  relations, despite the threats of terrorism.    Such mobilization must have an impact on the U.S.  Government,  she concluded, from the President to Congress to local  authorities, demanding that the United States change its  outdated policy toward Cuba.    Vicente Dopico, another emigrant and a member of the Cuban  Change organization in the United States, said the very fact  that Cuba has called the meeting, which begins tomorrow, proves  the Cuban Government's intentions regarding its relations with  the emigrant community. I believe the meeting will have positive  results, although we all realize that some things may not be  attained immediately, he explained.    Dopico affirmed that the conference in Havana and the  presence of groups within the United States that defend this  type of relationship between the two parties, demonstrates the  possibility of a future.    This future means the normalization of a nation with more  than 1 million of its citizens living abroad. This feeling is  always growing among those who agree with the need to establish  a stable bond and a relationship of mutual respect for the good  of the country, he concluded.     "

Cuban President Fidel Castro accompanied the Mexican  president to the Protocol House of the Cuban Government where  Salinas rested a few minutes before beginning his meeting with  his host. Prior to this, at the Jose Marti International  Airport, Salinas reviewed a Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces  honor guard.    Salinas also did something unexpected. He walked to where a  group of people were standing behind the security line and  personally greeted them. The Cuban and Mexican national anthems  were played during the official welcome ceremony at the airport.  Salinas stood with his arms down while President Castro saluted  with his right hand.    The presidents left the airport in a limousine adorned with  the Cuban flag on the right side and the Mexican flag on the  left. The limousine drove down the main runway from where a  huge placard with Salinas' face could be seen as well as other  placards reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples  of Cuba and Mexico, and Welcome, President Salinas de Gortari.    All along the route to the Protocol House were placards  reading: Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of Marti  and Juarez, and Long Live the Unbreakable Friendship between  Mexico and Cuba. Cuban radio stations carried live coverage of  the Mexican president's arrival in Cuba and his arrival at the  Cuban Government House. Here, the two presidents met privately.  At the end of the meeting, Castro hosted a lunch for the  Mexican president. After lunch, the two presidents met again to  discuss the many topics on the bilateral agenda.    According to statements by Castro during an interview, the  most important subject discussed was attracting Mexican capital  to Cuba. While at the Protocol House, Castro told the press his  country's foremost relations with the hemisphere are precisely  with Mexico.    During the meeting with the Mexican press, Castro also  talked  about the situation in Chiapas, the blockade Cuba is  experiencing, the recent incidents in Mexico, and his life.  Castro said the incidents that have occurred in Mexico saddened  and pained him.    [Begin recording] [Navarro Cuevas] I have seen with concern  and pain the problems Mexico has experienced, Fidel Castro,  president of the Councils of State and Ministers, said.  Interviewed shortly before the arrival of Mexican President  Salinas, Castro said he would not be a realist if he were to say  all is rose-colored in Mexico, especially in light of the  situation it is experiencing. The Cuban leader explained,  however, Mexico is not an isolated case; he said similar things  are happening in other countries as a result of the lost decade  [decada perdida]. Regarding Chiapas State, Castro said:    [Castro] You have asked me a very difficult question. Why?  Because it is a question that concerns Mexican domestic affairs,  and I am not the one to analyze those things. I do believe,  however, [words indistinct] social problems and conflicts, but  the situation is not only a Mexican situation; it is a situation  that affects the whole hemisphere. [Words indistinct] the  famous lost decade [words indistinct] problems. For example,  [words indistinct] per capita is the same as 16 years ago.  [Words indistinct] many social and economic problems that have  accumulated. I would say those are factors that cause an [word  indistinct] imbalance and create problems as the ones we see in  Chiapas.    [Navarro Cuevas] Regarding the U.S. economic blockade  against  Cuba, a blockade that has lasted more than 30 years, Castro said  it is the oldest blockade in history and it has been confronted  by the longest resistance. He said investments are slowly  returning to Cuba and are being consolidated on the island.  Castro said if he were born again, he would do the same all over  again, only better. Castro also said he would love to live more  than 100 years. When asked if he hoped to do more in his life,  Castro said he has been commander for more than 30 years. He  said this title was given to him in Mexico.    In conclusion, the president of the Councils of State and  Ministers said he is not a neoliberal and he would not talk  about that because some of the countries that will attend the  fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia,  would not like it, and those countries are his friends.

The power  interruption plan has shut down electrical power for 6-8 hours a  day over the past few months, increasing to 10 hours on  weekends. These power interruptions have caused complaining and  irritation among the population.    The state Union of Electrical Transmissions and Distribution  Enterprises [UETDE] today reported that the annoying ""blackouts""  will continue for the next few months because of generator  breakdowns at many electrical power plants. Such breakdowns  diminish the generating capacity of the national electrical  system. The enterprise said the scarcity of fuel at the 10  October Plant, located in Nuevitas about 600 km east of Havana,  is ""temporary."" A lack of fuel prompted the plant to operate at  a reduced capacity 26 through 31 March. The UETDE, however,  noted that this ""low generating capacity"" will continue over the  next few days, including the weekend; therefore, the schedule of  power outages will continue to be adjusted. The regular outage  schedule, which is adjusted according to the conditions within  each of the 14 provinces, has been in effect for the past three  years in an effort to conserve fuel.    Cuba's electrical power plants are being maintained with  national petroleum, which is very heavy and has a high sulfur  content. This causes frequent breakdowns and repairs. Up to  1989, Cuba received some 13 million tons of oil annually from  the former Soviet Union in exchange for sugar. The suspension of  the Soviet crude supply triggered a partial standstill in Cuban  industry and transportation, as well as a significant weakening  of the national power system. According to unofficial figures,  Cuba currently receives less than 6 million tons of oil annually  at international market prices. Most of this oil comes through  intermediaries, which also increases prices.     "

According to Shevardnadze,  the president of a great neighboring friendly state is coming to  independent Georgia, and anyone who thinks differently is  divorced from real politics and real life. ""We will not allow  anyone to wreck this visit,"" the Georgian leader stressed.    The worried tone of Shevardnadze's statement is  understandable -- both the parliamentary and nonparliamentary  opposition are taking a negative view of the visit and of Russia  in general, primarily owing to Moscow's stance during the  Abkhazian war. However, most of Georgia's inhabitants do see  Russia as the sole guarantor of a stabilization of the extremely  grave economic and political situation within Georgia itself.    There is an extremely simple explanation for this rapid  metamorphosis in Georgian public thinking: The people have been  enraged by poverty and rampant banditry. Hopelessness and lack  of confidence in the future are making Joe Public look for a  miracle. And Boris Yeltsin must appear as a miracle worker to a  Georgian audience.    The reason for Yeltsin's visit to Georgia is to sign the  long-awaited treaty on friendship and cooperation between the  two countries. Georgia has already signed similar treaties with  all its closest neighbors. The delay in signing the  Russian-Georgian treaty is due primarily to the war in Abkhazia,  during which, in Tbilisi's opinion, Russia has espoused an  extremely equivocal position by generally backing the  separatists. But Shevardnadze and his immediate entourage  always tried to attribute this to the fact that a powerful war  party was at work within the Russian political establishment.  The reference being to the former Supreme Soviet and the former  vice president [Rutskoy], who once promised to muster aircraft  and bomb Tbilisi. Since they quit the political arena, people  here have begun to think that the situation is propitious for  Georgia.    A key question in the coming Russian-Georgian meeting will  undoubtedly be the settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia. And  the Georgian side's main irreducible demand is for the refugees,  of whom there are over 200,000, to be brought back. In  accordance with the talks held in Geneva, the first group of  refugees is to return to Abkhazia 10 February. In the main they  are residents of the border Galskiy Rayon.    Abkhazian leaders have voiced their opinion of Yeltsin's  upcoming visit to Tbilisi. Sokrat Dzhindzholiya, one of  Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba's closest comrades in arms,  said that this visit means that Russia is giving Georgia carte  blanche for military revenge. Dzhindzholiya gave assurances  that the Russians have given the Georgian Army a large quantity  of military hardware, including modern ground-attack aircraft  and fighters. In the opinion of the Abkhazians, the delay in  deploying Russian Armed Forces under UN auspices in the conflict  zone is also an alarming factor. ""Abkhazia has never trusted  the United Nations, and now Russia too is losing our trust,""  Dzhindzholiya stressed.    The question of Georgia's joining the ruble zone will  undoubtedly be broached during the talks in Tbilisi. At any  rate the official press and television have long been preparing  the public for this step. Strictly speaking, this propaganda  softening-up process is directed not so much at ordinary  mortals, who amid the soaring inflation of the local coupon have  long been prepared for their government to take these steps, but  at the political opposition, which sees this as a loss of  independence. ""Understandably, if it joins the ruble zone  Georgia will be unable to implement its own finance and credit  policy and will be entirely dependent on the Russian Central  Bank. Also understandably, Russia can have no economic grounds  for allowing a country with such a ravaged economy as Georgia  into its currency zone. So, the idea is purely political and  pursues a single objective -- to restore the former empire in  one way or another,"" Revaz Shavishvili, chairman of the Georgian  monitoring agency [kontrolnaya palata], said.    The shadow of the broken Soviet Union is increasingly  alarming Georgian oppositionists. That is precisely the light  in which the opposition views the Georgian leader's moves toward  rapprochement.    The Georgian leader responds to the opposition's attacks  with  his customary confidence, but not without a dash of populism.  Shevardnadze feels fairly confident since former Georgian  president Zviad Gamsakhurdia quit the scene once and for all.  He is aware that he has the outward support of a population  exhausted by economic and political adversities for the policy  of close rapprochement with Russia. In response to the  countless accusations that he is promoting the revival of the  empire in a new form, Shevardnadze said that his policy of  rapprochement with Russia is designed to ensure that the empire  is never reborn. Only political aesthetes can assess the  novelty of these statements in Georgia today and, since they are  few and far between, Shevardnadze is simply taken on trust.    Meanwhile preparations are well and truly under way in the  Georgian capital to receive the eminent visitor. The ""Green""  party has decided to clear the garbage that has accumulated over  several alarming months from the city's central streets. The  police are temporarily removing the concrete slabs along the  highway from the airport, and real Georgian wines and cognacs  are being taken to the state dacha where the Russian president  will be staying.

After two  days of discussions on the most burning economic problems, the  special session of the National Assembly of the People's  Government [ANPP] drafted guidelines that will allow the  government to immediately adopt tangible measures against  economic imbalances and domestic speculators.    The ANPP's final resolution calls on the state to exert  strict control over its expenditures and to oversee its public  resources systematically. Figures from the Ministry of Finance  and Prices reveal Cuba has a budget deficit of 4.2 billion pesos  (official exchange rate is one peso per dollar).    The parliament voiced its ""flat-out opposition to the  unscrupulous activities of those who have become wealthy or who  are trying to become wealthy at the expense of the majority.""  The ANPP instructed the government to take steps, even  exceptional steps, to eradicate such activities. To that  effect, President Fidel Castro forewarned of the confiscation of  ill-gotten money and illegally acquired properties.    Parliament President Ricardo Alarcon, in one of his speeches  considered by many observers as bearing an impressive  ideological message, recalled the fate of the island being  forged in Miami. He said wealthy emigrants and large  landowners, whose properties were confiscated by the revolution  in 1959, are promoting a return to Cuba to reclaim their  properties and privileges.    In addition, there is another fact that discourages the  adoption of neoliberal shock therapy in Cuba, namely, social  deterioration triggered by such therapy in developing countries  where it has been applied.    According to official opinions, social inequities being  prompted by the economic reforms implemented in Cuba is a minor  setback when compared to the consequences of the neoliberal  policies imposed by such international financial organizations  as the IMF and the World Bank.    On the other hand, the measures proposed by the Cuban  legislature protect the fundamental achievement of providing  free health care and education without failing to acknowledge  that the island is becoming part of a world controlled by  multinational corporations and by a market economy.    The adjustments proposed include price increases on selected  goods and services, as well as the gradual implementation of a  new and integral tax system that will offer lower-income sectors  the greatest possible protection. The parliament also asked the  government to study the possibility of changing the currency to  complement the measures in due time.    The ANPP's final resolution states that the measures ""will  lead to the progressive surmounting of current adversities."" To  achieve this, the parliament exhorted the people to ""intensify  their daily efforts.""    Some participants of the special session believe the final  results will restore fiscal and financial order, which had been  neglected during decades of integration into the economic system  of former socialist countries. At the same time, the results  will yield greater trust in foreign investments.    In short, although the fall of the Soviet Union made the  island lose three-fourths of its trade and its main source of  foreign aid, most deputies and economists believe the current  independent development will be more advantageous in the long  run.

The presentation of the draft strategy for the  development of Siberia was attended by Sergey Shakhray and Yuriy  Skokov, which, in view of the ambitions of these politicians, is  very significant.    The initial premise of the MASS concept is that, instead of  evolving in keeping with the laws of the market, the economic,  military-industrial, and scientific complexes of Siberia were  formed by the party and state apparatus. Actually, in the  opinion of the authors of the draft, it was precisely owing to  the natural and geostrategic resources of the region that the  Soviet Union became a world power. However, the peculiarity of  Siberia is such, says the draft, that Gaydar's monetarism does  not fly there because of the ""impossibility of rapid and  bloodless reintegration of the Siberian regions into the  national economy."" The authors believe that by persisting in  continuing the present course, the Center will ""finish off"" the  economy of the Urals, Siberia, and the Far East, which will  become the target of claims by pan-Islamists, Chinacentrists,  and the G-7. A change in the map of the country--such is the  price, in the opinion of ""Siberian Agreement"" analysts, Russia  may pay for reformist extremism.    Active interference by the state in the process of  transformations is needed in order to avoid a catastrophe. Under  the conditions of the region, the need for a firm steering hand  is amplified by the fact that it is necessary to maintain the  viability of the fuel and energy complex and at the same time  restructure it by accurately adjusting prices; to prevent the  disintegration of transportation systems and a break with the  European section of Russia; and to support single-industry  production in the ""off-limits"" cities of Siberia which  originally were not adapted to market competition. The same  applies to the scientific and educational complex of the region.    The developers of the MASS are convinced that Moscow would  be  making a fundamental mistake if it failed to take into account  the peculiarities of Siberians, for whom ""the meaning of life  should be set forth on a noneconomic, geostrategic plane. The  population of Siberia will be able to endure the forthcoming  privation only having grasped its global mission. Only after the  population is rallied around the noneconomic and economic  concepts of development of Siberia will it become possible to  offer to it economic studies in the hope that they will not be  tacitly ignored by the majority.""    Previously, the regional associations of Russia have,  without  further ado, asked for or demanded money from the government,  emphasizing the idea of republics from time to time. Experts on  the mentality of Siberians and world trends from ""Siberian  Agreement"" were the first to use the trump card of geopolitics:  ""At present, financing comes from Moscow, but the geostrategic  resources of Siberia are no less significant. It is necessary to  preserve Siberia--the Achilles heel of Russia--and to deprive  everyone of an opportunity to make Siberia the location of  Russia's political fiasco.""    The MASS concept offers no proof of the necessary  degradation  of the region as a result of reforms. The provided statistics of  the growth of the death rate and fall in the birth rate and the  proportion of able-bodied population cover the period from 1979  to 1992 and, one would think, are not directly related to  monetarism. Under Gorbachev, the energy of regional leaders was  dispersed in the struggle for material quotas and was restricted  by the mechanism of coercion by directive, too. At present money  is the most important issue, and industries and regions fight  for it. This is precisely why monetarism has been proclaimed to  be the greatest evil. The concept does not in any way expand on  this term itself; it appears as the same kind of an ideological  cliche as imperialism once was. In essence, the MASS offers the  authorities in the capital city some kind of division of labor  by way of its draft for the development of Siberia: Moscow will  retain the geostrategic resources of the region, and the region  will be assigned, on a permanent basis, various allotments,  licenses, quotas, and other restrictions on economic and  commercial activity, the right to build over parcels of land, to  open production facilities and bank branches, to grant tax  relief, and so on.    Therefore, the same material and financial content appears  in  a new packaging. Siberian politicians of the latest crop want to  lay their hands on territorial resources in order to firmly take  power and become full-fledged partners of foreign companies and  national private capital in investment projects. The intentions  of the real authors of the concept--people who might be wrong  but who sincerely feel for Siberia--notwithstanding, the draft  will be used by the local management elite in its own interests.    As they haggle with Moscow, the local authorities proclaim  the creation of an ""economic mechanism for the revival of the  economy of Siberia under the aegis of the 'Siberian Agreement'  Interregional Association."" However, one would think that the  MASS carries the genetic imprint of the old bureaucratic system,  being the flesh and blood of administrative socialism. While  furiously criticizing Moscow on account of Gaydar's monetarism,  the new elite is ready at the same time to hide out under the  wing of the Center, fearing the rapid development of private  capital in Siberia. However, the latter is already strong enough  to hold its own but for now lacks the potential to solve the  global problems of the region.     "

At the very least, he said, the  rotation will make it far more difficult to determine the pace of the Cuban  withdrawal.    Moreover, he said, the Cubans have sought permission to station some of the  forces in the nearby African nations of Mozambique, Congo, Ghana, Ethiopia and  Sao Tome and Principe. He said that Mozambique, Congo and Sao Tome and Principe  ""have already refused."" But he said the response of Ghana and Ethiopia is not  yet clear.

SCHANCHE, Times Staff Writer      HAVANA      Fidel Castro's sharp rejection of Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program  of reforms has irritated members of the Soviet community here, but they have  adopted a policy of courteous patience, confident that Cuba will eventually  adopt similar reforms, according to Soviet citizens with long experience in  Cuba who say they are expressing Moscow's view.    ""We are convinced that as time goes by, Cuba will have to realize these  (reform) measures, but we don't think it is appropriate to force them,"" said  one of three Cuba-based Soviets who agreed to a rare private interview on  condition that their words be ""taken in the context of Cuban, Soviet and  American friendship"" and that they remain unidentified. ""We have to have  patience.""    Soviet economic aid to Cuba, now running at a rate of about $5 billion a year,  will continue as it has, they said. But they cautioned that there is growing  impatience with Cuba's inefficient waste of the money under its rigidly  ideological, centrally planned system. They implied that at least some  improvements are urgent, not only because the Soviets can ill-afford to waste  aid money at a time when resources are scarce at home, but because the Soviet  enterprises upon which Cuba depends to buy its goods are now becoming  autonomous and competitive and Havana will face a tougher task in dealing with  them.      Some Things Will Change    ""We are not satisfied with the efficiency of Cuban industry and agriculture,""  said one. ""We are helping Cuba. We will continue to help. But we now have to  search for more effective forms of our economic help. The nature of it won't  change, but some methods of our relations will have to change.""    Castro has become increasingly critical of Gorbachev's program of perestroika,  or restructuring, in speeches during the past six months, dismissing them last  July as ""methods that reek of capitalism."" In December, he criticized Moscow by  warning of ""difficulties that may come from the camp of our own friends."" On  Jan. 1, he provocatively contrasted his self-proclaimed ideological purity with  Gorbachev's new openness by proclaiming ""Marxism-Leninism or death.""    Some diplomats here have seen Castro's caustic criticisms as portents of a  major split between the two countries whose special relationship dates back to  mid-1960 and has cost the Soviets, by Washington estimates, at least  $40-billion in economic aid. Some experts estimate that Soviet aid makes up  almost 30% of the Cuban gross national product.      Rupture Not Expected    But the Soviets who were interviewed said that a significant rupture is not in  the cards. ""We have maintained good political and economic relations for 30  years, and these relations are going to be maintained,"" one said.    Three major Western embassies here agreed that such a break is highly unlikely  in the foreseeable future.    ""There are sores there, call them micro-cracks,"" said one diplomat, ""but both  countries have too large a stake in preserving their relationship to let it  slip away. They'll work it out.""    One European diplomat cited evidence in two recent Castro speeches suggesting  that a modus vivendi may already have been established that permits the Cuban  leader to continue his relatively harmless criticism of Soviet domestic policy  in the name of ideological purity but that forbids him to criticize the  Kremlin's foreign policy as he did in speeches last July and again on Dec. 5.      Critical Remarks    The diplomat pointed especially to the December speech in which Castro derided  Gorbachev's peace policies by railing against a peace between the powerful --  the United States and Soviet Union -- that allows ""war with the small  revolutionary, socialist or simply independent countries of the Third World.""  It was the same speech in which Castro warned of ""difficulties . . . from the  camp of our own friends.""    ""I think Moscow jerked his chain for that,"" said the diplomat, who cited as  evidence a sharply contrasting Castro speech last Wednesday in which the Cuban  leader extolled Soviet peace policies and Gorbachev's policy of detente. ""That  sounded like abject rectification,"" the diplomat said.    ""It irritates them when he implies that the Soviets with their perestroika  aren't true to Communist principles, but they can live with that. But when he  talks about the peace of the rich and says keep an eye on the camp of our  friends, that's going against the grain of Soviet foreign policy, and they  won't permit it.""      Could Lose Leverage    Another diplomat underscored Castro's growing sense of insecurity in the face  of the new Soviet policy of detente with the United States. ""He has to get in  the flow of U.S.-Soviet relations or lose his leverage with Moscow,"" he said,  adding that Cuba's agreement to withdraw its troops from Angola demonstrated  that Castro recognizes increasing pressures from both East and West against  such regional conflicts.    Whatever the difficulties over foreign policy, most experts here, including the  Soviets who were interviewed, agree that Castro's economic difficulties and his  economic relations with the Soviets are the most overriding.    ""Cuban economic life is mainly dependent on our economic relations,"" said one  of the local Soviets. ""The exchange of products with us represents 75% of total  Cuban trade. . . . Cuba has to trade with other countries. It isn't good when  all of the foreign trade is with one partner.""      Sympathy, Not Anger    According to the Soviet source, Moscow feels more sympathy than anger over  Cuba's predicament in the face of Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union.    ""We've lived with this (Communist) system for 70 years and Cuba for only 30,""  he said. ""Historically, they began with a sort of semi-colonial economy. They  didn't have the base of trained specialists nor the conditions to organize  efficiently. Now, the same things that are being criticized in the Soviet Union  are what is happening here. We've been teaching them how to work all this time,  and now we're telling them that it isn't efficient. Yet we ourselves do not yet  have the results of perestroika. Sometimes it's difficult to tell who is bad,  the students or the teachers.""    But he said the new Soviet economic approach, which includes borrowing  productive ideas from the West, will inevitably be adopted by Cuba and other  socialist countries when it proves itself. ""What is required is that other  countries adapt themselves to our new economy,"" he said. ""In the light of our  new approach, we don't see any problem if one country criticizes the other or  thinks the other way.      'Time Will Show'    ""Fidel doesn't agree with us, and we don't agree with him,"" he added. ""If he  criticizes the perestroika process, we don't want to answer that in public  discussion now. Time will show.""    Significantly, the Soviet source said that Soviet advisers here are now  studying what many Washington policy planners will recognize as a particularly  capitalist idea for Cuban industrial development.    ""We're working on the question of producing shoes and clothing from our own  materials here with Cuban workers,"" he said.

Robaina was invited to visit the city of Atlanta by Turner  Broadcasting Corporation [TBS], the consortium that operates  CNN. The corporation invited Robaina to take part in the seminar  it organizes annually. The seminar is attended by  representatives of clients worldwide.    This information was confirmed to PRENSA LATINA by Cuban  Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso, who explained that  Robaina had planned to speak about the situation in his country.  Alfonso noted that the list of guests included UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev.    The journalistic event began on 1 May. Robaina should have  traveled on 29 April. Because of this, he requested the visa  from the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba 25 [word indistinct]  earlier. TBS executives also contacted the U.S. State Department  about this matter.    Alfonso said, however, time went by without news on the  granting of any visa, and on 28 April, faced with the  impossibility of travel caused by the delay and a lack of  explanation from Washington, the Cuban Foreign Ministry had to  withdraw its passports from the U.S. Interests Section.    Curiously, the spokesman noted, the next day, in Washington,  the U.S. Secret Service went to the Cuban Interests Section  inquiring about bilateral cooperation to guarantee Robaina's  personal security during his stay in U.S. territory.    There was never any answer to the visa request and no  information was given to Cuba regarding a situation that  prevented the Cuban foreign minister from attending a meeting to  which he had been invited.    Alfonso said the U.S. Government's position represents a  continuation of a policy through which it denies the principles  of freedom of expression it claims to defend.     "

During these visits,  he learned about the measures adopted in that province to make  up for the delays in sugar production.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] A great effort is being  made here concerning sugar cane production, because we have to  fulfill, the country has to meet a goal; this province,  specifically, is behind schedule, and this plan, which is behind  schedule, must be recovered. It does have the possibility of  overcoming the delay. [end recording]    On a different occasion of his visit, Machado Ventura  praised  the working spirit of the people of Ciego de Avila, not only  during the harvest period but also in all other agricultural  activities despite the severe limitations imposed by the special  period.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] There is optimism despite  the current conditions, and in general I can tell you that the  effort being made by the people is admirable. [end recording]    According to Machado Ventura, this effort is the best  greeting they can convery on international workers' day.    [Begin Machado Ventura recording] This year, as has been  explained, workers' day will be observed in each workplace by  carrying out the main tasks, those which are essential. This has  begun, because the workers are not waiting for 1 May to do so.  This does not mean that the commemoration will take place on  that day alone. I think that 1 May must be celebrated every day  in the area of production and under the current circumstances.  [end recording]    Machado Ventura concluded by stressing the significance for  the country of sugar production in this province. For this  reason the fulfillment of the harvest objectives is the major  challenge for the people of Ciego de Avila, and is the response  the nation expects of this province.     "

R. Nixon's recent  meeting with leaders of the Russian opposition is a perfectly  natural event, in my view. The sounding-out of post-Yeltsin  Russia is beginning.    For the Western perception of the situation that has taken  shape in Russia since the December elections there is no precise  divide between those whom we at home have become accustomed to  considering political antagonists. Yeltsin and Zyuganov,  Chernomyrdin and Kozyrev, and, finally, Zhirinovskiy--they are  all for the Western mind primarily ""Russians,"" and only then  ""democrats,"" ""communists,"" or ""fascists."" Such, if you will, is  the Western aberration with our idee fixe of ""national  reconciliation""--such ""reconciliation"" emerged for the West,  apparently, even before it did for ourselves. Is, in fact, the  difference between Yeltsin and Zyuganov that great, for that  matter, if the first is increasingly beginning to incline toward  national-state ideas, wiring for sound what was just recently  being proposed by the opposition?    The strong constitutional authority of the president has  today neither an organizational nor conceptual pillar within the  democratic camp. The government is beginning to play according  to the rules of the opposition. This means that sooner or later  the winner will be whoever produces political know-how, not the  one who ""consumes"" it, stamping decisions in accordance with  another's ""license.""    The main know-how today is the party. What in political  science is called ""organizational authority"" affording an  opportunity to initiate, introduce, and polish decisions adopted  at government level.    Organizational authority is lacking, incidentally, not only  with Yeltsin but also Zhirinovskiy. This brings them unusually  close together, despite all their differences and  noncomparability. The political style of both is ""one-man  theater"" and the constant pedaling of the personality factor.  But it is not the personality but the party-organizational  factor that is becoming most important today. And the fact that  all more or less important politicians have suddenly hurled  themselves into the creation of their ""own parties"" is further  confirmation of this.    Who disposes of real organizational authority in Russia  today? Gennadiy Zyuganov's party. As of the present this is not  only the largest but also the most structured party, having  inherited from the CPSU a sizable personnel and financial base.  It has a renewed national-communist ideology, one of the  strongest factions in the Duma, and, according to certain  information, good connections in the elite groups. In terms of  type this is a power party, proposing the traditional  techniques of a solution of the managerial crisis in the base  sectors of the economy (and it is the crisis of management which  is determining for the so-called ""economic crisis""). In an  alliance with the agrarian-industrial lobby and also in a  potential alliance with the center and democratic-patriotic  forces Zyuganov's party has a chance of becoming a serious  political factor in the country, despite all the unpopularity of  its ideology.    Is the West ready for a serious dialogue with Russia's  communists? Strictly speaking, for Western conservatives the  communist establishment has always been an object of close  attention primarily as a traditional component of the Russian  political elite. More, since the clamorous Fuehrer-type  escapades of Zhirinovskiy, who shocked Europe with the imaginary  threat of ""Russian fascism,"" G. Zyuganov's balanced position  might appear the most acceptable version of Russian revanchism.  The West is looking in Russia for ""righteousness"" as some  standard of what is to be expected from Russia in the immediate  future. Neither Yeltsin nor Zhirinovskiy nor anyone else  manifestly cut it as yet as ""righteous."" Only national  communism, directly or indirectly influencing all the other  currents in Russian politics, may be the ""new righteous"" today.    Russia has approached in earnest the phase of  ""postdemocratic  stagnation,"" and one has the impression that the West has waived  Russia's reforms goodbye. The main concern of Western  politicians are not qualitative transformations within Russia  but, rather, the geopolitical controllability of the new Russian  revanchism.    Were not Brezhnev's stagnation of the mid-1970's and the  suppression of the dissident movement not ultimately the result  of a kind of ""deal"" between Russian and Western conservatives?  It is worth remembering that the first phase of that  ""stagnation"" pertained to the time of detente, and only after  the USSR had invaded Afghanistan did the Western community  return to the policy of the cold war. I see no grounds for  believing that something similar might not be repeated today.  The entire history of Russia's relations with the Western  community indicates that its principal determining factor is  Russia's geopolitical predictability, not the fate of Russian  reforms and not the human rights situation. At the present time  Russia is too weak for expansionist activity outside of the  former USSR.    An era of conciliation, a time of geopolitical deals are  beginning. I have always been struck by Americans'  punctiliousness with regard to the formal procedures of  democracy. During his January visit to Moscow Bill Clinton  observed that the results of the December elections and the  democratically elected parliament were no less important to him  than the popularly elected President Yeltsin.    Strictly speaking, he could have said something similar in  1933 in respect to the democratically elected Reichstag and the  new German chancellor.     "

President Salinas de Gortari noted that one of the most  significant results of the official visit to Cuba was the  confirmation of a telephone project. Salinas made the  announcement during a news conference following a meeting with  President Fidel Castro, within the agenda drawn up for his short  stay in the Cuban capital.    On Monday, Domos Internacional, a private Mexican  consortium,  and the Cuban Ministry of Communications signed a ""general  agreement"" to pave the way for a $1.5 billion investment to  modernize the Cuban telephone system. The final details of the  plan have yet to be established.    General Silvano Colas Sanchez, the Cuban minister of  communications, disclosed that it calls for the creation of a  partnership in which the Cuban State will own 51 percent of the  company's shares and Mexican investors will control 49 percent.  The investment will be made in two parts and part of the  Mexican portion will be in the form of a trade-off of Cuba's  debt, also known as swaps. This project could very well  represent the single largest foreign investment project in Cuba.  Its main goal is to modernize and expand the Caribbean island  nation's current telephone network and provide all other related  services.    President Salinas de Gortari said that during his interview  with Castro, he discussed other Mexican private sector plans for  investing in the textile and glass industries. Salinas de  Gortari spent six hours in Cuba and then flew on to the  Colombian port city of Cartagena de Indias, where he was  scheduled to sign a free trade agreement with the Group of Three  [G-3]. The Mexican president will sign the agreement with  Presidents Cesar Gaviria of Colombia and Rafael Caldera of  Venezuela, the other two nations that make up the G-3. The  leaders expect the agreement to enter into effect on 1 January  1995.     "

Our military chiefs must manage economic information. They  must know the price of sweet potatoes (domestic tuber) as well  as the price of a bullet, FAR Minister Army General Raul Castro  said during a visit to military installations yesterday.    The local media's report on the visit highlighted the  defense  minister's interest in reinforcing the troops' combat capability  and their participation in economic activities geared mainly  toward increasing food production.    Gen. Raul Castro himself recently explained to members of  the  Communist Party of Cuba's Central Committee, of which he is  second secretary, the efforts made by the FAR to increase  training levels despite a major expense reduction.    On that occasion he detailed how the Cuban military had  greatly increased its food supplies by producing its own food  and how it had even rendered important services to the country's  economy, primarily through a special corps called Youth Labor  Army (EJT).    Although the traditional U.S. hostility against the Cuban  revolution forces the FAR to use great discretion in its  expenditures, last year the armed institution reduced its budget  by 600 million pesos -- equivalent to dollars at the official  exchange rate, according to official reports issued last week.    Cuba is going through an adverse economic situation  following  the collapse of socialism in the former Soviet Union and the  East European countries as the island conducted 85 percent of  its foreign trade under equal conditions with those areas.    Those nations, especially the former USSR, were the FAR's  main suppliers of weapons, ammunition, and other articles.    Despite the situation, FAR sent thousands of its members to  perform agriculture tasks in the fertile plains south of Havana  last summer. Also, approximately 6,000 EJT soldiers have been  permanently assigned to tend crops in that same region since  last October.     "

On the first occasion, an AP wire dispatch reported on 7  March 1991 that Washington ""stated today in an official report  the antidrug campaign initiated by Cuba almost two years ago in  its territorial waters and airspace has aided in reducing  narcotrafficking in the Caribbean.""    The State Department report, always cited by AP, admitted  that in 1990 ""the Cuban Government continued to maintain its  policy of denying Cuban airspace and territory to the (narco)  traffickers, and there was broad evidence of its efforts begun  in mid-1989 which curbed drug trafficking.""    Later, on 12 April 1993, a NOTIMEX wire dispatch reported:    ""A U.S. State Department report published earlier this month  recognizes Cuba's cooperation in controlling drug trafficking in  1992.""    ""The Cuban Government continues to give a high profile to  its  antidrug policy, part of which has been substantiated by  actions, the U.S. branch report stated.""    Now, on Monday, the Spanish news agency EFE announced from  Washington that a U.S. State Department report on international  narcotrafficking stated the Cuban Government continues to grant  priority to its antidrug policy and that in 1993 it cooperated  with the United States, ""the largest drug consumer in the world.""    That same document admitted that in the past five years,  heroin consumption increased in the United States. The document  noted that due to this, heroin narcotrafficking in Latin America  has been diversified.    According to the U.S. State Department, of all the threats  entailed in drug trafficking the greatest is its unlimited  capability to corrupt institutions, among other things, because  only the value of the drugs confiscated in the United States is  superior to the gross internal product (GIP) of many countries  of the hemisphere.    Amid this assessment, the U.S. Government added in the  report  published this week that Cuba signed the UN 1988 Drug Convention  and ""is working to fulfill many of the convention's objectives.""    Interestingly enough, the U.S. State Department assessment  finds somehow that Cuba's antidrug-trafficking efforts may  possibly have not been more extensive because of the blockade  imposed by the White House on the island more than three decades  ago.    In this sense, the official analysis notes that the scarcity  of fuel and essential spare parts limits the Cuban Government's  ability to intercept drug traffickers.    As known--it has been generally promoted by the extreme  rightist sectors of Miami and other Conservative groups in the  United States--one of the campaigns used insistently against  Cuba internationally has been to link it with narcotrafficking.    This is the third report issued by the U.S. State Department  on the topic since 1991 in which objectivity prevails above any  distorting propaganda. The report offers a highly valuable tool  to anyone who seeks to assess the seriousness of arguments used  by Cuba at the time that it has to explain its actions or refute  those who professionally attempt around the clock to distort its  present situation.

During a conversation with Mexican legislators visiting the  Caribbean island -- a conversation to which PRENSA LATINA had  access -- the foreign minister said this fact is the first  achievement of the preparations now under way for the meeting  scheduled for April.    We are reaching out a hand and a bridge to those who want to  maintain normal relations with our country, and those who say  they have nothing to talk to us about have excluded themselves,  he added.    Answering questions from the visitors, Robaina said the idea  behind the conference is to speak to people who are living  abroad for different reasons, and he noted that family ties  cannot be broken because of ideological positions.    Among the opportunities presented by the conference, the  minister noted possible academic exchanges, the possible  granting of scholarships to emigrants wishing to study in Cuba,  and the editing of publications for Cubans living abroad.    Robaina also said paperwork for entering and leaving Cuba  could be facilitated, because ""the time has come to change rigid  rules"" that have always been prompted by the aggressive attitude  of certain sectors now trying to exert pressure once again to  discourage attendance at the conference.    We believe normal relations with Cuban emigrants constitute  one of the elements that can help change U.S. Government policy  so that the pressure from those inciting violence against Cuba  will cease to exist, as well as the pressure exerted on those  who are opposed to the hysteria, he noted.    Robaina said different conditions exist today, and this is  why the emigrants have already said they want to attend the  conference and talk about a future of acceptable ties with their  country of origin.

When questioned on this issue, Alarcon told PRENSA LATINA: I  think these have facilitated reaching a consensus on certain  actions of a national character that must be taken, and, with  this goal in mind, identifying solutions in each work center.    Since the end of January, the CTC has been holding  assemblies  in its more than 80,000 rank and file organizations so the  workers may express their opinions and make proposals on facing  up to Cuba's serious financial woes.    Official figures indicate that more than 10 billion pesos --  equal to the same amount in dollars at the official exchange  rate -- in excess cash and a fiscal deficit of more than 4.2  billion are factors that have turned into major destabilizers of  the Cuban economy. The economy is facing its most difficult  moment in the past 30 years.    In practical terms, the president of the National Assembly  said the consultation process has allowed thousands of specific  measures to emerge while other ideas are currently being applied  in many parts of the Island.    Meanwhile, Ross stressed that the process has surpassed the  labor leaders' expectations given the depth of the workers  suggestions and the proposals to solve the problems.    He indicated that there was a high rate of attendance at the  assemblies, more than 86 percent. He explained that important  solutions have already been adopted to specifically solve the  companies' finances, thanks to their own workers' initiative.    Ross added that the matters of national character are being  analyzed and collected to be handed over to the government's and  parliament's highest levels for consideration.    All suggestions will be taken into account, from those that  counted in the opinion of the majority to those that were  proposed by a single worker, he noted.    The National Assembly has slated for this year one special  session to analyze the situation of internal finances and to  adopt measures to correct these. These measures, according to  legislators and government, are not removed from the principles  of social justice currently in force in Cuba.     "

I see a very solid and strong future for the revolution,  considering the support of the great majority of our people and  the great deal of optimism that exists, to continue to confront  difficulties, PCC Central Committee member Jorge Lezcano told  PRENSA LATINA.    Lezcano, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, explained  that  although the same basic economic factors that created conditions  in 1993 will continue this year, the country will have a few  more advantages and opportunities.    According to Lezcano, we have the experience of having  confronted and overcome a year as difficult as 1993, we know  what to do to confront the problems that arise, and we have  become better organized in facing the special period. I believe  all of this will work in our favor, he underlined.    The Special Period in Times of Peace is the name given to  the  measures Cuba has had to adopt to confront the consequences  prompted by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the  former Soviet Union -- nations with which Cuba sustained 85  percent of its trade.    In addition to the abrupt loss of its main trading partners,  the island has had to confront the hardening of the U.S.  blockade, which has been in effect for more than 30 years.    Meanwhile, Lezcano said, there are other factors that will  differentiate the situation between both 12-month periods, and  he recalled that the prolonged electricity cuts and the  paralysis of the factories in the capital city and the rest of  the country had started in 1993.    We have started January 1994 with all factories operating,  albeit with limitations, but nevertheless operating and with  less stringent electricity cuts scheduled than in 1993, he noted.    According to Lezcano, this year should also yield the  expected positive results, especially in terms of savings and  the optimal use of resources because of the new system of state  land cultivation called Basic Cooperative Production Units  (UBPC).    The new system establishes that plots are given to the  associates in usufruct for an indefinite amount of time. They  also receive soft loans to acquire working equipment and are the  owners of the crops they produce. It is estimated that those  measures will propitiate a food production increase, he added.    The UBPC's started operating last October and currently  exist  in almost all the former state farms.    The party leader also pointed out that one of the positive  factors expected for this year is an improved sugarcane harvest.  Last year, the harvest yielded 4.2 million tons of sugar -- the  lowest since 1963.    Lezcano pointed to favorable elements in the international  sphere and, among others, he mentioned the considerable decrease  in oil prices, which will help the country because it imports  almost all the fuel it uses.    For these reasons, among others, he maintained, we assert  that, although there will be difficulties and problems, the work  perspectives for our people and for the revolution are somewhat  better than they were in 1993. This leeway allows us more  possibilities to get ahead.     "

Nendiandua]    [Text] Havana, 9 Jun (PL) -- A high-ranking Foreign  Ministry official said here today Mexican President Carlos  Salinas de Gortari's upcoming visit to Cuba exhibits his  country's political resolve to strengthen bilateral relations  and project them toward the future.    In an interview granted to PRENSA LATINA, Deputy Foreign  Minister Jorge Bolanos said Salinas' visit will focus on  political issues, especially during the talks he will hold with  Cuban President Fidel Castro to analyze the broad range of  historical ties between the two nations.    Citing the importance of the visit by the Mexican head of  state, Bolanos emphasized this meeting will take place amid a  U.S. effort to toughen policies of siege against Cuba, policies  which recall previous administrations.    U.S. Representative Robert Torricelli's recent visit to  Mexico and Washington's fruitless efforts to direct the latest  OAS meeting in Brazil against Cuba are some of these policies.    The high-ranking official, who has been a diplomat for more  than 30 years, also said the White House is planning to hold a  hemispheric summit in Miami in December, a summit that excludes  Cuba, making it, therefore, an anti-Cuban summit.    Bolanos said the delegations of the two governments will  discuss the wide assortment of political, economic, commercial,  and cultural relations and scientific and technical  collaboration during the high profile talks they will hold.    He believes new ideas and initiatives that will help broaden  bilateral ties and project them toward the future will emerge  from the talks between the Mexican and Cuban presidents.    The deputy foreign minister also said the two chiefs of  state  will have the opportunity to exchange opinions on the agenda and  role of the Ibero-American Summit to be held in Cartagena de  Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June.    President Salinas will arrive in this capital on 13 June at  1500 GMT (Universal Time Coordinator) and will leave for  Colombia the same day at 2130 GMT.     "

Politburo members of the ruling Communist Party of Cuba  (PCC)  have felt the recession will bottom out in the middle of the  year, but they urged the people to work more efficiently and  save the scant available resources.    ""Cuba has the perspective of recovery, and the current and  next sugarcane harvests will be decisive in this endeavor,""  Carlos Lage, Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers  secretary, has stated during a meeting with leaders of the sugar  sector. According to the strategy of the current economic  reforms, only the sugarcane harvest will provide the necessary  resources to come out of the ""special period in peacetime,"" as  the crisis and the measures to alleviate it are called.    During the past season of its main industry, Cuba registered  the lowest production in three decades (4.2 million tons),  something President Fidel Castro has publicly called a disaster.  According to Lage, the 1994 to 1995 harvest will be greater  than this year's. Castro estimated in late December that the  current harvest will be a few hundred tons greater than the 1992  to 1993 harvest.    Since the disappearance of the Socialist Bloc and the Soviet  Union earlier this decade, Cuba has been going through a  profound crisis, with shortages of food, fuel, medicine,  transportation, and other basic consumer goods. Havana has  blamed the heightened U.S. economic and commercial embargo as  the other cause of its woes.    The last session of the National Assembly has indicated that  the surplus of money in circulation--estimated at more than 12  billion pesos--and the budget deficit of approximately 4.2  billion pesos constitute the two crucial problems to be resolved  immediately. In government books, the Cuban peso is at par with  the U.S. dollar, but in the flourishing black market the dollar  sells from between 70 to 80 pesos. The surplus of money in  circulation has led to a greater drop in efficiency,  productivity, discipline, and interest in work.    According to an official report, during 1993 almost 40  percent of the disciplinary measures applied against workers  were prompted by unjustified absences and an interruption of  working hours, something that has been compounded by  ""negligence, disobedience, and borderline criminal conducts.""  With the state coffers almost without hard currency, without  international sources of credit, the alarming government  statistics also show that only 31 percent of the state  enterprises are profitable.    ""During the second half a favorable change must be  noticeable  in the improvement of internal finances,"" and the amount of fuel  will be greater, Politburo member Jorge Lezcano has stated.  Cuba will exchange 1.5 million tons of sugar for 4 million tons  of oil, according to an agreement signed with Russia. Lezcano  has said there are greater possibilities of moving ahead in  1994, although he admitted that in essence the same economic  programs of 1993 will be maintained. These programs caused a  deterioration in the people's lives.    Meanwhile, the Cuban Workers Federation (CTC) is apparently  going to claim the responsibility for the new economic  adjustment measures that have a high social cost, which the  assembly will adopt to improve internal finances. The CTC is  holding meetings at labor centers where speakers have suggested  actions to reactive the shaky economy.    The sale of ""bonds for the fatherland"" (without interest),  ceasing gratuities and subsidies, taxes, higher electricity  rates, and the confiscation of wealth obtained ""in an illicit  manner"" are some of the proposals. Economists say the true  solution to the money surplus in the hands of the people is to  increase production and offer industrial, farming, and service  goods.    ""This process of consultation will make it possible to bring  a consensus to the next meeting of the National Assembly,"" CTC  Secretary General Pedro Ross has said on state-owned television.  Analysts feel the government expects that out of these meetings  will come the major guidelines of the adjustment program, which  includes a reduction of the bloated state apparatus and  inevitable quota of greater unemployment.    Government officials recognize the priority of some of the  proposals but say the achievements of the Cuban socialist  system, such as in the health field and free education, will be  maintained at any rate. The new measures will give continuity  to the reform package begun in August 1993 by the government  passing a law that will allow the free circulation of foreign  currency, allowing self- employment and creating cooperatives  for inefficient state farming.

This is  the first blot on the record of this leader with the reputation  of being moderate and sensible, who defends himself by saying  that ""when you speak of democracy in central Asia, in  Kazakhstan, it cannot be compared with France, Spain, or other  countries. If we are speaking of European standards, it must  also be said how many years it took to achieve them. It must be  borne in mind that women in the United States did not have the  right to vote until the beginning of this century. But these  states have 200 years of history, and France, Spain, and Britain  have thousands. We have only been independent for two years.  We are heading for democracy and the market economy step by  step. If we try to turn the democratic cart too quickly, we  will be in danger of overturning it.""    [Serbeto] The economic reform and privatization are proving  very difficult in Russia. Has Kazakhstan used the lessons of  this Russian experience in order to design its own model?    [Nazarbayev] After many centuries of totalitarian rule,  people are accustomed to collective methods of leadership and  production, and so, from the psychological viewpoint, it is very  difficult suddenly to accept private ownership. But, despite  everything, we are prepared to hand over part of Kazakhstan's  resources to the country's population. We are conducting not a  chaotic privatization but one under the regulating control of  the government, which is accelerating the privatization process,  since it is very difficult from the grassroots. In agriculture,  we are not yet considering the total privatization of land,  although this is our medium-term aim.    [Serbeto] Are you in favor of the so-called ""shock therapy,""  or of delaying radical decisions to the utmost in order to  preserve social peace?    [Nazarbayev] We started with ""shock therapy"" when we decided  to liberalize all prices, but we must be very vigilant because  the process could go wrong at any time. The monetarist  prescriptions against inflation are not sufficient in  themselves. In the West, they must realize that they reached  this situation after many years of evolution. For instance, in  Spain Franco left everything ready, but we had no Franco.    [Serbeto] What is Kazakhstan's nuclear policy?    [Nazarbayev] Kazakhstan is fulfilling its pledges for the  elimination of nuclear weapons. We were the first CIS state to  ratify START I and the Lisbon protocol. The only delays were  due to the fact that we were trying to secure guarantees that  this is our lawful property and that we will be compensated for  the cost of the enriched uranium in our nuclear warheads.    [Serbeto] The presence in this country of a large population  group of Russian origin is viewed as a factor of instability.  To what extent do you believe that this is a grave danger to  coexistence?    [Nazarbayev] It would be incorrect to say that this problem  does not exist. Some Russian politicians wish to use this for  their own ends, but we will not accept this in Kazakhstan,  because the Russians of Kazakhstan are our citizens. It cannot  be said that human rights are violated here, but if anybody  believes this, we invite all UN delegations to check this. In  my opinion, people's main concerns are a result of the  disintegration of the USSR. The fall of a great empire is  always painful, and so it has always been throughout history. I  know that Yeltsin and Kozyrev are very experienced people, but  these politicians should have thought about the Russians left  outside Russia when they signed the Slav treaty which dissolved  the USSR.    [Serbeto] Why do you not accept the proposal for granting  the Russians dual nationality?    [Nazarbayev] Just imagine if the Russians, who are 32  percent of the population, had two passports in their pockets.  They would have one foot in Russia and the other here. That  would destabilize the situation in Kazakhstan. Why do they say  nothing in Russia about the violation of the rights of the  non-Russians living in Russia? A million Kazakhs live in  Russia. Have they opened any Kazakh school in Russia? In  Kazakhstan, 65 percent of schools operate in Russian, and last  year 78 percent of the students starting high school did so in  Russian. Some 75 percent of the news media are in Russian. All  the state bodies use Russian, and I myself am speaking to you in  Russian. Can any other CIS state say that it respects  linguistic minorities as we do? We will resolve all the  problems of the Russian-speaking Kazakhs, because this is an  internal problem of ours -- not that of any other country.  Nobody can concern themselves about the Russians better than us,  and we want no assistance from Russia.    [Serbeto] Russia is trying to attract other CIS states into  its military and economic sphere of influence. Have you noted  this trend with respect to Kazakhstan?    [Nazarbayev] Nobody knows what Russia wants. They lack a  policy in this respect. It would be better to ask the Russians  what they want. We are a sovereign country and are not  dependent on Russia for either oil, coal, or food. Since we  introduced our currency, we have been living completely  independently, and Russia has understood this. We have oil,  gas, wolfram, gold, diamonds, and uranium. Russia's relations  with Ukraine and Belarus cannot be compared with those it  maintains with Kazakhstan.     "

In an address to the National Assembly, which is holding a  special session today to decide what measures will be adopted,  Fidel said: ""I do not think it would be worthwhile to do  nothing, to stop halfway, because it would be a disaster if the  measures we adopt are insufficient.""    ""We are far from having a full idea of the problem; not even  the comrades with a better education have it, although we have  certainly made progress,"" the Cuban leader added.    Castro referred to the series of proposals presented this  morning by Finance Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, who outlined  the need to create a tax system, reduce some subsidies and  benefits, increase prices for nonessential products, and create  a convertible currency, among other things.    Castro added: ""Everyone is prepared to find solutions, but  no one wants to pay taxes on their salary or to have even a cent  cut from their salary. Everyone wants a solution but they want  solutions without having to take these types of measures.""    Castro termed the country's current economic situation as a  ""cancer"" characterized by over 11 billion pesos in circulating  money, which has virtually nullified the purchasing power of the  national currency, and a 1993 public deficit of 4.2 billion  pesos.    ""A human policy of solidarity with the people that neglects  no one involves a surplus of circulating money -- which is  tolerable for some time -- but, within the special period, the  time has come to solve the problem, and that is not so easy,""  Fidel Castro said.    He insisted that it is necessary to carefully decide what  must be done so the situation does not reoccur. He said that it  is necessary to ""get to the root of the problem,"" otherwise ""it  would be a tremendous waste of time.""

The Ukrainian leader believes, though,  that the development of all-round relations with the Baltics  aggravates both objective and subjective factors.    In an interview with the popular Lithuanian newspaper  LIETUVOS RYTAS Kravchuk described as an objective problem the  painful transformations in the economy in the republic. As a  result of such transformations, believes the president, it is  difficult to maintain long-standing contacts among the  republics. Kravchuk believes as subjective factors the passive  attitude of the regions, enterprises and the governments.    Kravchuk believes that the situation may start improving  following the meeting between the presidents and he invited the  head of the Lithuanian state Algirdas Brazauskas to visit  Ukraine at any time suitable for him. He is also prepared to  visit Lithuania.    Asked by the newspaper to comment on the Lithuanian official  statement to enter NATO, the Ukrainian president has favoured  the initiatives ""Partnership for Peace"" and added that Ukraine  would not object against Lithuania's entry to NATO, since we do  not see in it any discomfort or strategic threat.    Kravchuk said that neither the United States nor Russia are  interested to expand NATO. He explained his view by the fact  that today large states, like the United States and Russia want  to have zones of influence. Russia, believes the Ukrainian  leader, attempts to retain in its sphere of influence former  Soviet republics and the countries of the central and eastern  Europe. He said that the methods to ensure the influence  contradict those universally acknowledged.    The Ukrainian president has said that in principle he does  not approve the division along these lines and added that large  and small states should be equal partners. If so, we can rely  on stability and lasting peace, and neighbourly relations, said  Kravchuk.     "

In an interview, Vilatela explained that the negotiation  would take place through the issuance of swaps (debt bonds) so  that Mexican businessmen can purchase Cuban enterprises' assets.  The Bancomext director, who is accompanying Mexican President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari during his state visit, said the  solution to the island's debt with Mexico will be through  refinancing the debt. He pointed out that the appropriate  institutions in both countries must reach an agreement on  refinancing the debt and bond issuance.    Up until the end of 1993, Cuba's debt with Mexico was $313.4  million, of which $192.7 million was already overdue. The Cuban  debt was refinanced in 1982, 1986, 1989, and 1991, which was the  last time. The last refinancing of the debt was declared  unfulfilled six months later because of Cuba's economic problems  and because the mechanism that was established refinanced the  debt for only four years.    Luis German Carcoba, president of the Mexican Business  Coordinating Council, confirmed the decision to invest in Cuba  and added that textile and soft drink projects, among others,  are already being implemented. Carcoba, who is also  accompanying the Mexican president on his six-hour tour to this  nation, said, however, that in the meeting held by the  presidents and the trade delegations of Mexico and Cuba, no  specific agreements are expected.    The Mexican businesses that plan to make investments in Cuba  are Grupo Infra de Gases y Equipos, Industrias Unidas de  Telefonia de Larga Distancia, and Buffete Industrial, with  modernization projects for 20 hotels in this city.    Also participating were Cemex, which has a cement plant  here;  Domeq, which will negotiate the importation of Cuban rum to  Mexico; Telecomunicaciones Internacionales de Mexico, founder of  Cubacel; Incorporacion Internacional Comercial, which exports  Mexican beer; and Grupo Dsc, which is a hotel business.

0,FT943-1401 ,"FT943-1401 _AN-EIYAEABJFT 940924   FT  24 SEP 94 / The high-wire act continues: Boris Yeltsin will need all the balance and ballast he can muster if Russia is to exploit the first signs of recovery      By JOHN LLOYD   The drums roll, the curtains (no longer made of iron) part and . . . out of Russia comes President Boris Yeltsin, walking on a tightrope. Russia is a great country for high-wire artists, real and metaphorical. Mr Yeltsin, in Britain this weekend and the US next week, is in that tradition. He will feel at home with John Major and Bill Clinton: he is as unpopular as they are, probably more so. Mr Yeltsin leads a sullen country, many of whose people feel abused playthings of corrupt or ineffective politicians, rapacious bureaucrats and criminals. Yet at the same time he presides over signs of revival in parts of the economy: Russia is finally showing that it might realise the promise it has long held out. Mr Yeltsin's unpopularity is, of course, a price any politician in his job would have to pay, though he may have increased it through erratic behaviour and increasing remoteness. And the atmosphere in Russia does seem to have changed in the year since the countdown began to the violent confrontation at Moscow's parliamentary White House. On Tuesday, Mr Yeltsin returned from a five-week holiday at his Black Sea dacha - punctuated only by a trip to Germany to observe the withdrawal of Russian troops - to find an altogether cooler political climate. It is too soon, however, to stop worrying about the course of events in Russia. The hot autumn promised by the opposition may yet arrive. Almost every opinion poll shows a turning away from democrats and growing or sustained approval of nationalist and communist themes, if not parties and individuals. Polling of the electorate in the Moscow suburban constituency of Khimki for a by-election next month shows an electorate whose main complaints are the number of immigrants in their area, the ubiquity of the conspicuously rich and the ineffectiveness of the government. The opposition has promised to bring down the government in parliament - which re-opens next week - and may use the debate on the budget to do so. Leaders of harder-line opposition parties have been in conclave. While they evidently cannot agree a common presidential candidate against Mr Yeltsin, they nevertheless have in former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi a passably charismatic figure round whom they could cluster. Mr Rutskoi and his comrades have little more to offer on the economy than statist controls, a war on crime and credits for all. But their policies do not have to be coherent to prove popular, if they mount a strong campaign. As if recognising this, Mr William Perry, the US defence secretary, sounded a caution earlier this week. He said the Pentagon's nuclear posture review had concluded there was a 'small but real danger that reform in Russia might fail and a new government might arise hostile to the United States, still armed with 25,000 nuclear weapons'. Mr Perry seems to mean what he says: the danger is real but it is seen as small - and official Washington will stress to Mr Yeltsin how pleased it is with US-Russian military co-operation, with joint approaches to Bosnia and the Middle East, and with the progress of economic reform and the evident stability in Moscow. Nevertheless, Mr Perry's speech shows how much he thinks there is still to be done - and this will be much of the content of the talks between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Clinton. The US thinks Russia is lagging in reducing its nuclear weaponry, and that it is lax in guarding it. It will propose that Russia stops making plutonium, builds a new storage facility for the fissile material taken from dismantled weapons, and makes a better count of the weapons it has. Mr Clinton will promise to work on Congress to maintain the 'Nunn-Lugar' funds  -around Dollars 200m put up to aid nuclear arms reduction - as long as the Russians show willingness to use them. Russia, however, is resentful of western suspicions. It is also itself suspicious of a Nato, which lacks the constraining presence of the Warsaw Pact at the end of its gun sights, and is giving a broader welcome than Russia would like to its former central European allies. Mr Yeltsin is likely to use his UN General Assembly speech on Monday to call for a reduction in arsenals other than the superpowers' - which means those of the UK and France. He will raise, with both Mr Major and Mr Clinton, the view that the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe is a better vehicle for security than Nato. But Russian suspicions run deep. Mr Yevgeny Primakov, head of the Federal Intelligence Service (the former first directory of the KGB), argues the military, political and economic re-unification of the former Soviet states (except the Baltics) is now inevitable - and is the only way to safeguard the independence and democratic character of their new regimes. If, says Mr Primakov, the west acts as if this is a neo-imperialist thrust, the danger is both sides will retreat into laagers like those of the cold war. This danger is the greater, says the country's top spy, because the west sees it as in its interests to have a weak and divided space where once the Soviet Union existed - not understanding that a new, non-coercive union is the only guarantee of its security. Russian politicians are conscious of their diminished world role and thus are more insistent in demanding that their 'sphere of influence' be respected. They are glad the US is trying to set Haiti to rights because they argue that their own backyard - Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Tajikistan - needs the similar robust policing. The trouble for the west lies in learning to distinguish between robust policing and undermining. Ukraine, the other major state of the former Soviet Union, hovers between two possible courses. It could choose a reformist course which would strengthen its real independence. Or it could try to throw itself on the mercy of a Russia which keeps it supplied with cheap energy and provides markets for its low-quality goods. Russian politicians are increasingl their efforts to conclude comprehensive treaties with Ukraine on a range of issues - including the disputed Black Sea Fleet - while the smaller country stalls, knowing it will deal from a weak hand. Similarly, Russia responded to the signing this week of an Dollars 8bn contract between Azerbaijan and a group of major western oil companies by challenging Azerbaijan's right to dispose of the contents of its continental shelf. Its challenge may or may not be pushed to the extent of scuppering the deal. Mr Major will want to raise the issue, since BP is the lead contractor - as will Mr Clinton. Underlying everything, as always, is the economy. Russia's economy looks in better shape than it has since independence. Inflation was down to a monthly rate of 4 per cent in August and the government is holding the budget deficit within the 10 per cent of GDP set by the International Monetary Fund. Better, investment really is coming into Russia - in two forms. First, the sheer rock-bottom prices which Russian assets commanded when they were pulled out of state control are proving increasingly attractive to portfolio investors. Even if many of the shares are worthless, investors have concluded that others, especially in the energy sector, utilities and telecoms, are among the world's best bargains. Mr Sergei Alexashenko, the deputy finance minister, estimates that at least Dollars 200m a month is now coming in. Second, increasing numbers of large, mainly US companies are setting up production bases, including: Caterpillar, which is undertaking two joint ventures with Russia's biggest engineering companies, Zil and Uralmash; Polaroid, which has seen sales soar as the instant picture craze catches on; and Bayer, which has just started making Aspirin in Moscow. Increasingly, the conventional wisdom is that the reforms are irreversible and that, even if the road is rocky, fortunes can still be made with nerve and patience. For the government the next stage of reforms - if the IMF and the World Bank put up the Dollars 10bn the Russians want - is to balance budget expenditure and move to stabilise the currency early next year. The gleam in its eye is of genuinely low inflation in 1995, with the beginnings of a strong, broadly-based recovery by the end of the year and rapid growth by 1996, when elections are due. By that time privatisation of state assets will be all but complete, and it is not wholly utopian to believe that Russia could end the millennium as one of the world's faster growing economies. The delivery of western support to make this vision reality will form part of Mr Yeltsin's discussions in Washington next week, and will be discussed at the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank. So the conventional wisdom may be right, and becomes more likely to be so with every day that the situation remains stable. But it is not certain. Secretary Perry's 'small but real' risk reflects the increasingly resentful section of the populace which feels left aside. The government has stayed within the limits agreed with the IMF by slashing expenditure on everything, including on commitments like wages. Huge areas of Russian public life - health, social security, law and order, education - are starved of funds, and the bodies responsible for these areas reduced to patching things together, taking bribes or just giving up. Great Soviet institutions have become ruined hulks. Moscow State University's classrooms crumble; many of its curricula are unchanged since Communist times; its teachers are materially poor - but its students, or some of them, desperately strive for an education. The Bolshoi Theatre opened its new season on Thursday night with Tchaikovsky's Queen of Spades. The production was antiquated; the costumes less than gorgeous; a huge row raged backstage about money - and the singing was miraculous. Will Russia make it? Probably, in its own rickety, brilliant, arrogant fashion. Mr Yeltsin must seek to explain that way to his bemused friends, and hope they stick with him on the rocky road yet awhile.

I believe the end of the embargo is neither in sight nor in  the future, as the most pessimistic might think.    The rejection of this ineffective and hostile posture toward  Cuba has increased considerably. Concurrently, this U.S.  position meets the determined resistance of important forces  both in and outside government circles.    Summing up the opinions of the increasingly large number of  those who oppose the embargo, the Miami newspaper the NEW HERALD  reported on 7 March: ""From religious and humanitarian  organizations to conservative editors and from civil rights  groups to business managers the various groups that criticize  the commercial embargo say it is a Cold War relic that harms  U.S. business or contributes to poverty on the island.""    To this must be added the beginning of the embargo debates  in  the House of Representatives. Apart from the final results, the  internal pressure has reached a point where, in addition to many  expressions of international repudiation, two UN resolutions  have been issued on the issue.    To all this could be added the powerful movement the  organization Pastors for Peace coordinates in the United States  against the embargo. An increasing number of U.S. church people  are participating in this crusade, which picks up followers in  other countries and Europe as well.    The fact the most influential U.S. newspapers, including THE  WALL STREET JOURNAL, have criticized the embargo as the best way  to deal with Cuba is another very meaningful indication of the  trend which will prevail gradually and ""step by step"" [previous  three words in English] in the United States.    If, with the lifting of the blockade against Vietnam, the  realism and levelheadedness of U.S. businessmen has managed to  do away with the dogmatism and anachronism of a group of  officials and legislators, I believe, concerning Cuba's, they  would not be too far away from playing a significant role.    That is, of course, if they are not forced to arrive too  late  to an event where businessmen from the American and European  continents, among other areas, are already operating legally in  places open to them.    All which has been said up to here must still confront tough  opponents, which include, among other elements, electoral  interests which, in their attempt to win the 1996 elections in  Florida, have tied the Cuban policy to the dictates of the  extreme rightist sectors in Miami; a Congress that faces  elections in November and is extremely cautious of its actions;  and even an overloaded official agenda which has not made the  Cuban issue a priority.    To this we have to add, as an ingredient we cannot possibly  ignore, the complicated situation triggered by the so-called  White Water scandal in the current Democratic administration.    In my opinion, boosted by the most rightist sector of the  U.S. political and business scenario with which President  William Clinton has had disagreements since last year, this  process will tend to favor, at least for the time being, those  in Washington who advocate a conservative government position.

This information has been  confirmed.    According to the information, drilling was conducted as deep  as 3,240 meters, and petroleum with better quality than that  found at the Varadero resort site was discovered at a depth of  approximately 2,500 meters.    The exploration activity is being carried out under the  terms  of a risk contract with the state Cuba Petroleum (Cupet) firm,  which controls oil-related business in the country and maintains  risk contracts with several foreign firms.    The information released by the Canadian firms and confirmed  by sources in Cuba's oil sector also notes that the well drilled  could produce about 3,750 barrels of oil a day. Drilling has  been stopped, however, to allow nearby areas to be surveyed to  evaluate the magnitude of the deposit.    According to specialists, the crude oil found is superior in  quality to the oil found in Varadero, which averages between 10  and 11 degrees API and has a high sulphur content. The oil  discovered in the Cardenas area has less sulphur and, therefore,  it will be less difficult to refine.    Petroleum exploration in Cuba is divided into 33 sectors, 11  of which were offered in bids in Calgary, Canada, and London in  February 1993.    Since 1990, Cuba has set up risk contracts with the French  Total firm and the European Petroleum firm to explore and  exploit crude oil in the island's territorial waters.    Foreign firms exploring for oil in the country are operating  under risk contracts that grant a maximum term of 25 years (four  of them corresponding to the exploration phase) and guarantee  that the firms will be able to freely utilize their agreed upon  quota of crude oil.    In this sense, Juan Fleites Melo, director of the Cuban  marketing firm Cupet, S.A., recently stated that foreign  companies will be able to sell part of the petroleum in the  country at international market prices if they so decide. Also,  no export taxes are being considered for those who decide to  sell the product overseas.    According to the provisions of this kind of contract, the  foreign sector supplies all of the capital investment and  technical means for oil exploration in an established area and  agrees to leave without any compensation if no oil is discovered.    According to experts from the Cuban Basic Industry Ministry,  seismic studies show very interesting results, particularly in  the sector located south of Ciego de Avila and Sancti Spiritus  as well as in the marine areas where the Swedish firm Taurus  operates.    Structures known as reef-like formations in oil geological  terms have been found in this area. These structures are  considered very favorable for petroleum deposits.    Information available in the foreign companies' zone of  operation not only reveals the possibility of finding heavy  crude (90 percent of the total extracted in the country at  present), but also light crude.    Last year, domestic oil production reached 1.2 million tons.  Oil production for this year is estimated at 1.3 million tons.  This oil is used in the generation of electricity and the  production of nickel and glass, as well as in other sectors.     "

The delegation stopped at  Colombia Municipality where Raul and his companions talked with  Manuel Quesada, first secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba  [PCC]. First, the good news: The sugar harvest is progressing at  101 percent of the plan and 40 percent of the production plan  has been completed. The Colombia Mill, which has meet every  production plan in the last 20 years, expects to do so again.  The mill is engaged in the sugar recovery program and to this  end will contribute the 16 recently created Basic Cooperative  Production Units, in addition to the state farm managed by the  Youth Labor Army [EJT], which has increased the yield of its  sugarfields by 10,000 arrobas per caballeria, and the Leningrad  Farming Cooperative with its 112 caballerias.    During a visit to cattle ranches, Raul points out the  negative aspect of extensive marabu weeds, saying that a  solution has to be found so that the 25,000 head of cattle yield  more milk and meat. [Politburo member Alfredo] Jordan explains  that a nationwide machete campaign is being waged against marabu  with the double goal of preserving the pastures and collecting  kitchen firewood for workers' dining halls and homes.    The report on defense is very encouraging. Colombia was the  first municipality of the Eastern Army area to achieve Ready for  Defense in the Second Phase status and its 17 defense zones are  attaining higher levels of readiness.    In Jobabo, we meet with Norge Rodriguez, first secretary of  the PCC. We proceed directly to the pride of the locals: the  Loma Alta state farm. This farm has 200 workers mobilized for  two years from the municipality -- population 50,000 -- and the  provincial capital. The 60 narrow-furrow caballerias of plantain  yielded 253,000 quintals in 1993. This year they expect to  surpass the 300,000 mark. The production of this, another state  farm, and eight farming cooperatives is enough to distribute 40  pounds of vegetables per capita a month to every person in the  municipality. The goal is to attain 1 million tubers,  vegetables, and grains in 1995 to meet the people's needs and  help supply the provincial capital.    Rodriguez, proud of the accomplishments of the municipality,  shows us the local wine factory which produced 189,000 bottles  in 1993 and plans to produce 300,000 in 1994. He spoke with  enthusiasm of the local food production and its highly diverse  service facilities.    On the outskirts of Las Tunas City is something new: modest  minidairy farms -- perfect to supply milk for children and the  elderly of nearby communities. There are 45 of these farms on  the periphery of the city. Horse-drawn carts distribute the milk  early in the morning. Housewives boil the milk as was customary  before the widespread implementation of centralized  pasteurization. Raul congratulated Misael Enamorado, first  secretary of Las Tunas Municipality, for this accomplishment,  trusting that shortly the other five communities will have their  own minidairy farms.    Windmills are becoming a common feature in the profile of  Las  Tunas City. The goal is to supply water, without using  electricity, to the organic gardens of various sizes appearing  in empty lots in the city. Because of the lack of resources to  build every windmill needed, locals have made use of  old-fashioned wells to draw water and irrigate the gardens by  hand. These lots provide fresh vegetables and direct sales to  the neighbors at standard prices. The vendor estimates the  weight, since they lack scales. This is a practical  antibureaucratic measure by the masses and for the masses.    In light of this fact, as well as the minidairy farms and  other efforts, Raul states with delight that this is a blow to  bureaucracy which is sometimes removed from reality and the  interests of the masses; a bureaucracy may be well-intentioned  but capable of destroying a revolution, as has unfortunately  already happened in other countries. Raul stressed that this is  not a fatalist statement because in the case of Cuba we are  lucky to have a commander in chief like Fidel, a sworn enemy of  bureaucracy and more aware than anyone else of the masses'  morale, hopes, and needs, and who trusts more than anyone else  the revolutionary spirit of his people. There is no sign of  disenchantment in Raul as he recalls some of the mistakes made  in agriculture. He affirms with optimism that the only positive  aspect of errors is the possibility of learning from them to  avoid repeating them.    Raul is accompanied by Central Committee members Julian  Lopez, first secretary of the PCC in Las Tunas, and Vilma Espin,  president of the Federation of Cuban Women, among others.     "

He said Robaina's visit will be part of a tour that the  Cuban  foreign minister will make of Southern Cone countries in the  next few months, adding that the invitation ""entails nothing  special"" within the relations between the two nations.    Chile and Cuba broke diplomatic relations in 1973.  Consular-level relations were reestablished in 1990 at the end  of the military regime of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990,  following the election of Patricio Aylwin (1990-1994) as Chilean  president).    Insulza said the Chilean Government considers an exchange of  opinions with the Cuban foreign minister on the Cuban situation  and the political situation in the hemisphere will be ""very  useful.""    He added that there is no specific agenda for Robaina's  visit, but he emphasized, among other topics, the commercial  blockade and the sidelining of Cuba from the inter-American  system, a situation that has impeded official contacts with the  Caribbean country, [would be discussed].    Other sources reported that the agenda will also include the  signing of a bilateral cooperation agreement that Chilean  officials announced last week, when Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa reiterated that the reestablishment of  diplomatic relations is not a short-term objective of the  Chilean Government.    Concerning relations, Insulza said that even though some  events in Cuba -- like the dialogue with exiles and the most  recent economic measures -- are regarded as positive, the  political regime continues ""to pose substantive obstacles"" to  the reestablishment of relations.    ""We have no diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the decision  to reestablish them should be made by the president (Eduardo  Frei),"" Insulza said.    He added that the Chilean foreign policy ""seeks to maintain  relations with all countries,"" but this calls for ""a political  evaluation,"" because there must be a ""consensus"" among all  sectors ""with due consideration for the interests of the nation.""

While attending a meeting of the Pan American Sports  Organization in Mar del Plata, 400 km from the capital, Ramon  Fernandez said the U.S. State Department has threatened those  businessmen who intend to trade with Cuba.    After saying the blockade applied by Washington against the  island for more than three decades was criminal, the vice  president of the Council of Ministers said that despite U.S.  pressure, the number of potential investors in Cuba is on the  increase.    In statements to PRENSA LATINA and an Argentine television  station, Fernandez noted there has been an increase of  partnerships with foreign firms in the areas of tourism,  petroleum exploration, and others.    Regarding a recent UN resolution on alleged human rights  violations on the island, Fernandez explained the resolution  resulted from a ""political vendetta"" by the United States, which  cannot forgive us for Cuba's example to the rest of Latin  America.    The Cuban leader discussed the progress made by his country  in the area of human rights. He described the functioning of  participative democracy in Cuba and affirmed that the people  play an active role in the current ongoing process.    Also, Fernandez cited the existence of important rights in  Cuba, such as the right to have access to health facilities,  education, food, social security, and assistance. He cited  statistics that showed the island in a favorable light when  compared to the most developed countries.    Since the victory of the revolution in 1959, there has not  been one single missing or tortured person in Cuba, Fernandez  emphasized.    When questioned about relations between Havana and Latin  America, Fernandez said these ties were broad-based, and he  insisted on the need to work toward regional integration.    Cuba, he concluded, is seeking to strengthen everything that  unites the region and to overcome insignificant issues that  separate us.     "

Where do we begin?    [Sexto] Well, Rodriguez just pointed out to me, so I will  begin, that an invitation has been extended for a dialogue. I  take this invitation as an effort by our country to build a  bridge for the Cuban community abroad. This is not the first  time that our country has tried to build a bridge. We recall  that Cuba also tried to establish a bridge for Cuban exiles in  1978. Cuba tried to maturely understand their situation. It  tried to give to that community its value and role within our  history, within our set of problems, and within our then current  situation.    [Roque] And that strengthens the idea of a family reunion.    [Sexto] Indeed. Cuba has also tried to reunite the Cuban  family. It has sought a reunion, which is one of the essential  causes for maintenance of the migration level in our country.  That is, since the first years of the Revolution, there has been  a migratory chain of relatives. This has been one of the causes  of a continuous emigration over the past years. The Revolution  has tried to resolve this problem of distance and separation of  family members. Everyone must remember that this was attempted  in 1978, and if not premature, I believe there were neither  objective or subjective conditions to make this dream come true.    [Roque] What we are certain about is that the Cuban  Government has always favored reunion of the Cuban family. It  has always been said that there were not the conditions here for  receiving many of those people who wished to be reunited with  their relatives. But the willingness, the idea that this  existed, has always been on the negotiating table. At least I  think willingness existed in 1978.    [Rodriguez] I also think that in a way, the Cuban family has  always been a hostage of the Cuban-U.S. conflict and policy.    [Roque] Well, that is another subject we are going to  discuss  later.    [Rodriguez] Well, yes, it is another problem, but this idea  of being hostage to a policy, namely the U.S. hostile policy  toward Cuba, represents a wall, a curtain, a barrier against  family reunion, because the United States has used the migration  issue as a spearhead against the Revolution. Undoubtedly, when a  relative of yours is on the opposite side of the idea you  defend, or the cause you defend, a disruption takes place within  the family. But today I think we are reuniting many families  divided for political reasons, families that have adopted  different political stances after being separated. But this is  not happening for the first time now, during this revolutionary  period. It also happened during the Spanish period. There were  families, well, Creoles of Spanish descent, who broke from one  another because they defended different positions.    Later, during the era of the Republic -- or during the  pseudo- republic as we call that period of successive  governments of representative democracy -- many families were  also broken up for political reasons. I think the time has come  to end this political disruption in family relations because  with greater respect within families, with greater respect for  the ideas each might hold, without humiliation or offense, the  families with varying points of view can be reunited.    [Sexto] I believe, Osvaldo, that except for the people who  could have left the country for true political reasons, the rest  of our exiled people have misinterpreted that policy or have had  a mistaken idea about it. That is, Cuban exile is eminently  economic. The Cuban exile who goes to the United States, the  principal immigration center of America and the world, obviously  seeks to improve his well-being. But to migrate to that country,  he is forced to adopt a different stance, because as you have  just said, the emigrants have been hostages of the U.S. policy  against the Cuban Revolution. The United States has politicized  immigration because right now the best means of going to the  United States is by assuming a political stance against the  Cuban Revolution. For instance, today it is very difficult to  obtain a legal visa to enter the United States from Cuba. It is  very difficult for you to be granted a visa to legally settle  down in the United States. However, if you get there on a  bicycle, on a raft, or a barge, you are immediately and  automatically admitted into the United States because you are  considered a political refugee.    [Rodriguez] I would like to give you a little example of  this. Not long ago I heard a casette tape, sent by a boy who had  to migrate from one country to another until he reached the  United States. But in the United States he had to make remarks  against Cuba to be admitted. He sent this casette to his  relatives, expressing regret that he made those remarks. He  said: If my friends who know my way of thinking had heard my  remarks, they would definitely think that I am a dishonest man.    [Roque] Friends, we are discussing the invitation for a  dialogue with the exile community from 22 to 24 April in Havana.  I think we can discuss the ideas currently prevalent among  Cubans and the exile community on this conference.    [Rodriguez] I believe there are some who think this step is  being taken because of a crisis situation in the country. I have  heard some clear statements in this regard: that this decision  was made because the country is in crisis. I do not believe the  crisis has anything to do with the reunion, with the  normalization of relations. In fact, the possibility of  normalization had been much discussed before the crisis.    Moreover, as Sexto just said, talks with the community in  the  United States, and with the entire community abroad, began in  1978. These talks were aborted because of the enemy's  activities. My opinion is that we should not expect this  community to help us economically, although it could happen. But  the objective is not for it to help us economically. I think the  normalization of relations with Cuban exiles is a human right, a  right of the family. If I am a Cuban who decided for any reason  to migrate to another country, I must be respected as a Cuban,  just as I must respect my country's government and the decision  of the majority of the people. It is that respect that is being  sought. But I think the invitation read by the foreign minister  is very clear. There will be no talks about this or another  political system. The discussion will deal with the civilian and  legal situation of the exiles. This must be made very clear  because the invitation itself is clear in this respect. I think  it will be broadly discussed soon.    [Sexto] I do not think Cuba will be talking with the  political exile community. Cuba will speak to the economic exile  community. The economic exile community is a world phenomenon.  This is what we are talking about. We must clearly note the  difference between a political and an economic exile. Of course  the political exiles will not be present at that conference  because the political community is an organization which leaves  the country with the intention of returning to impose the  reestablishment of its party and its class, to restore the  government or the power it had lost. That is what characterizes  the political exiles. This can be clearly seen within the Miami  community. There is a political community, which fights day  after day -- fights, talks, kicks, and moans. It cries in the  hope of returning to reimpose its idea, to reassume the  government. They do not care about the interests of Cuba or of  the Cuban people. They only care for their political interests.    Those who will come in April are economic exiles who left  the  country to improve their well-being, to find ways to fulfill  their aspirations and talents, but who wish to maintain a link  with their people. The Cuban by tradition is patriotic. It is  appropriate that this community maintains its language, its  traditions, its culture. They must be respected for this, and  given consideration. A link must be built between them and us.  No political matters will be discussed. These people will not  demand power. They will not come to ask the working class for  power. They are not coming to ask the Communist Party for power.  They are not coming to ask Cuba to sacrifice its national  interests. They are coming to ask for what we can give them:  understanding, ties with their relatives, ties with their  country, and ties with their culture.    [Roque] We are getting to the end of the program, and we  must  reach a conclusion on this invitation to the conference. But are  the Cubans, the Cubans who are here, aware of the times that are  coming, of this exchange of ideas, of this rapprochement with  the community that lives not only in the United States but  throughout the world?    [Rodriguez] I think our people have been politicized. They  have a fine understanding of what could happen. They are aware  of the possible outcome. When you speak with a worker who has a  lower cultural level -- the lowest level for us is the ninth  grade -- speaking with workers, we realize that they are aware  of what is happening. They are also aware of the fact that the  policy on migration has changed because we know one another  better. The idea we have on migration has also changed.    [Roque] Do you not think that changing the idea of those who  are on the other side might also change the U.S. policy imposed  all along concerning the Cuban economic and political situation?    [Sexto] It is possible. It is possible, but this is not the  time to prophesy anything. It could be a pressure element  forcing the United States to reconsider its policy. I think we  Cubans who are on this side must be aware that many Cubans who  are on the other side are also changing their ideas on the  situation. They are becoming aware of the false idea they had  that forced their migration. We must also admit and recognize  that we cannot continue ignoring the U.S. policy toward Cuba,  which has taken the migration issue as a pressure and propaganda  element against our country and its interests. We must admit  that, except for that political sector of the exile community  that is fighting to return to this country as a conqueror, the  rest are true Cubans who by right deserve to have an affective  link with their people.    [Rodiguez] Well, answering Roque's question on the nation  and  migration, and what could be said about it, I think we Cubans  comprise a single nation. We will always be a single nation  regardless of where our citizens live. This has been  demonstrated by that community in Miami that has not allowed  itself to be affected by another society.    [Roque] I wish to thank Osvaldo Rodriguez and Luis Sexto for  their participation in this discussion on the invitation for  dialogue with the exile community that will be held in Cuba in  April, 1994.

He maintained that the country  will only be able to generate electricity at 60 percent of its  capacity by December.    Speaking on television to a panel of journalists, the  minister described the prolonged cuts as one of the gravest  problems facing the country.    There may be solutions but there can be no miracles, Portal  said. He added that there is currently no stable generation of  electricity due to a lack of spare parts [aseguramiento  material] for the thermoelectric plants.    The minister said that 66 percent of the electricity is  generated in plants from the former Soviet Union and former  Czechoslovakia, which disintegrated, and this led to an  interruption in the procurement of spare parts in the past three  years.    Portal also cited a lack of foreign currency, due to the  current economic crisis, among the factors that have worsened  the situation in this sector.    He reported that $3 million were allocated to the purchase  of  spare parts for the thermoelectric plants and $7 million to the  generation of electricity in 1994.    Two small plants will be operational by end of year, one in  eastern Cuban and the other near the capital, the minister added.    Portal said that limitations in this sector will not impede  further implementation of development plans promoted by Cuba to  overcome the serious economic problems currently facing it.    We have a new and powerful electricity system, he said,  after  pointing out that most Cuban plants were installed less than 25  years ago.    Portal thinks that the use of national petroleum, a heavy  crude with high sulfur content, is not the cause for breaks  [roturas] at the hydroelectric plants, because its use only  causes problems with the gas pipelines.    The use of national petroleum will save about $360 million  this year. This represents 30 percent of total electricity  consumption.     "
